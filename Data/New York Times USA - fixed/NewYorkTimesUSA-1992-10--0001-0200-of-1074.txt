HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Overview;
2 CAMPAIGNS BEGIN DIRECT DISCUSSION ON DEBATE FORMAT

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
After charges and countercharges, ever-changing ultimatums and ever-passing deadlines, the two Presidential campaigns opened direct negotiations on debates last night, as Gov. Bill Clinton warily responded to President Bush's new eagerness to face off on national television.
Mr. Bush scrambled for tactical advantage by casting Mr. Clinton as the candidate who was afraid to go man to man in the four debates that Mr. Bush suddenly proposed Tuesday and that would begin Oct. 11. 
 Mr. Clinton, noting that Mr. Bush had previously resisted debates for weeks, offered his own proposal, suggesting that the two candidates begin to mix it up this Sunday in a previously scheduled appearance by Mr. Bush on CNN's Larry King program.
Top officials from both campaigns were huddled at the negotiating table in Washington from 8 P.M. to 11:45 P.M. last night.
 
Day of Frantic Movement
 Both sides had compromised by the time they reached the table, and the upshot seemed to be a campaign that was finally, perhaps, lurching toward an agreement on televised debates. At the end of last night's session, spokesmen for both sides said that the discussions were "ongoing" and would resume at 8:30 this morning.
It was a strange day on the campaign trail, with furious exchanges of public letters, negotiating meetings scheduled and canceled and rescheduled, and stylized catcalls from the candidates across the airwaves.
At the same time, much of the political world was focused on Dallas, where Ross Perot was on the brink of announcing whether he would re-enter the race.
Mr. Bush, trying to jumpstart his campaign by calling for Presidential debates after long resisting a bipartisan commission's plan for them, told a campaign rally in Wisconsin yesterday that Mr. Clinton was "missing in action."
"Governor Clinton," he said, "has responded to my challenge the same way he's responded to issues like free trade, fuel-efficiency standards and middle-class tax cuts: he waffles."
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, was even harsher, scoffing at Mr. Clinton's attachment to the commission's plan. "First he wants the commission; then he wants to go on 'Larry King Live,' " Mr. Fitzwater said. "He'll want to go on Arsenio Hall and 'The Gong Show.' "
A spokeswoman for the Bush campaign dismissed the idea of a debate on the Larry King program and said the campaign awaited the results of direct negotiations between the two sides.
But the Bush campaign clearly felt that, at least for 24 hours, it had regained the high ground on the debate over debates.
A banner at a campaign rally demanded, "Who's chicken now, Bill?" turning back on the Democrat a charge that his supporters had lobbed against the President for weeks as Mr. Bush stonewalled on debates.
The Clinton forces were, in fact, on the defensive much of the day. Caught off guard by the President's sudden shift, the Clinton camp tried to keep the negotiations under the auspices of the bipartisan commission, but finally agreed to a direct meeting with the Bush forces last night. Still, a campaign often accused of excessive caution and sitting on its lead lost a day of control.
Paradoxically, it came on a subject that the Clinton forces had skillfully played for weeks. Mr. Clinton signed on early and eagerly to the commission's plan, and Mr. Bush's resistance to it was widely seen as being politically costly.
Campaigning last night, Mr. Clinton said: "The President offered four dates that seemed impractical because they're during the World Series and Monday night football and all of that. I told my folks to go work with the debate commission tonight and then meet with his people as quickly as they can and work out dates. But he said yesterday, 'Let's get it on.' "
 
More Questions for Perot
 Referring to the bipartisan commission's plan, Mr. Clinton added: "The next debate was scheduled for next Sunday night. Larry King ought to have us both on there and let the American people call their questions in."
Mr. Perot, meanwhile, found himself on the defensive, amid continued questions about his method of gauging support for a possible re-entry to the campaign; many Americans were discovering that a call of any nature to his 800 number was automatically counted as a vote for his re-joining the President race.
"I'm a businessman," Mr. Perot said yesterday on the CBS program "This Morning." "I'm not going to pay for the phone call for some fella that says, 'Don't do it.' He can set up his own 800 number."
Aides to Mr. Perot said state coordinators were asked to report back on the sentiment at the grass roots by noon today. A news conference was scheduled for 4 P.M. Eastern time today.
 
Lowering Expectations
 Behind the positioning on debates yesterday was a growing recognition that debates, sooner or later, would be held. The surest sign, perhaps, was the pre-debate spinning that was already under way, with candidates and their seconds trying to lower expectations for each man's performance.
Vice President Dan Quayle, campaigning in Detroit, told reporters of his opponent, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee: "He has a big advantage over me. He grew up in Washington, D. C., and he's the son of a wealthy United States Senator. He went to the most expensive private schools in Washington, D. C., and I'm the product of the public schools."
Mr. Quayle himself had a privileged upbringing as the scion of a wealthy newspaper family.
Mr. Gore, campaigning in Ohio, responded to Mr. Quayle's analysis with a laugh and then said, "What puts the Bush-Quayle team at a disadvantage, not only in the debates but in all their communications with the American people, is that they have presided over the worst economic performance since the Great Depression."
The struggle over debates yesterday reflected the shifting dynamics of this race, as the Bush campaign tries to persuade voters to take a second look at the race after weeks when public opinion seemed ominously stalled for the President. Mr. Clinton retains a double-digit lead in most of the national polls. And he was hammering Mr. Bush for weeks because of the President's resistance to the commission's plan for debates.
The commission has already been forced to cancel three proposed debates.
The Bush campaign was widely seen as resisting debates in September because it hoped to first tighten the race; many analysts said taking the stage with the Democrat at this point would allow Mr. Clinton to "close the sale" and cement his status as a potential President.
Still, with little if any movement in the polls, Mr. Bush on Tuesday suddenly announced a proposal for four consecutive Sunday night debates beginning Oct. 11.
The debates carry advantages and risks for both candidates. Mr. Clinton is obviously advantaged by the status quo, but as a challenger he could still be helped by sharing the stage with the President. Mr. Bush badly needs to make his case to the American people, but he also runs the risk of presenting Mr. Clinton with another opportunity for attacks.
 
Figures in Negotiations
 The two sides met last night at the Washington law firm of Mickey Kantor, the chairman of the Clinton campaign and its lead debate negotiator. At exactly 8 P.M., the Republican delegation entered the offices: It included Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman; Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director; Frederic V. Malek, a close Bush adviser, and Bobby Burchfield, the campaign's general counsel.
The Democrats were represented by Mr. Kantor, Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee; Thomas Donilon, a Democratic lawyer involved in several previous debates; Bev Lindsey, a Clinton campaign staff member; Jack Quinn, a Gore aide, and Harry Thomason, a television executive and Clinton supporter.
Both sides had some victories to claim by the time they entered the room. The Bush campaign succeeded in getting the Clinton forces to the table for direct negotiations, without acceding to the bipartisan commission.
The Bush forces were said to particularly dislike the format of the commission's plan, which involved a single moderator. But the Clinton campaign was getting debates, and, its strategists asserted, had already gotten substantial political mileage out of Mr. Bush's resistance.
"He didn't yell uncle; he screamed it," said James Carville, a top strategist to Mr. Clinton.

HEADLINE: Municipal Bond Yields Rival Taxed Issues

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Tired of watching your state's services deteriorate even as taxes and fees head higher? Now, there's a way to profit: simply buy some of your state's notes and bonds.
A glut of municipal offerings has pushed even some tax-exempt yields slightly higher than those on taxable Treasury issues of similar maturities. After the effect of taxes on the Treasury yields is considered, the municipals' advantage is wider still. 
 Although municipals come closest to the yields of Treasury securities at shorter maturities of three years or less, longer issues in both Treasuries and municipals pay out much more.
At the short end, California's offering of $5 billion in notes, including $3.75 billion sold yesterday, sets a record for a municipal issue. The notes were popular enough that underwriters led by Lehman Brothers cut the yields by 10- to 15-hundredths of a percentage point yesterday, to 2.65 percent and 2.85 percent for notes maturing in January, April and May.
These rates are still generous considering that Treasuries of similar maturities yield about 2.7 to 3 percent. "The municipal market has one problem: heartburn," said Howard Burstein, sales manager at E. A. Moos & Company, a municipal bond firm "That comes from indigestion of supply."
States and municipalities are issuing huge amounts of debt to refinance higher-cost issues and keep governments running even when tax receipts fall short. Bond yields increased slightly yesterday as states and municipalities sold $2 million in longer-term debt.
Coming as a result of California's need to keep operating, despite a weak economy and budget woes, for the next several months, the $5 billion record is nothing that anyone wants to brag about. The Guinness Book of Records lists the fastest snail and the loudest snorer, but not the largest municipal debt issue.
The volume of new issues carries the risk that the ratings agencies will cut their grades, hurting the prices of notes and bonds investors are already holding. California investors have been hit by several downgrades.
But with so many states pumping out so much paper, the yields from California and many other states have gone high enough to more than compensate for any added risks, some analysts and investors say.
"If you have a job, you're in a tax bracket right now where munis make sense," said Joe Dean, who manages four municipal funds, including a California Fund, for Shearson Lehman. Some insurance companies that don't even need the tax exemption are buying municipals for the yields, he said.
 
A Steep Yield Curve
 A-rated municipals maturing in three years or less pay more than Treasuries. A one-year municipal pays about 3.16 percent compared with 3.03 percent for the issue from the Treasury.
Long-term Treasuries still have a pretax advantage over municipals. The 30-year Treasury bond yields 7.37 percent compared with about 6.18 percent for AA-rated municipals. But these yields are so much greater than for the shortest maturities that Mr. Dean recommends the longer municipal bonds.
"I've been in the business 23 years, and this is the steepest yield curve I remember," he said.
California plans to sell the remaining $1.25 billion of its notes, at adjustable rates, today. Frank Murphy, the manager of short-term municipals at Lehman Brothers, said that the two largest previous issues were $4.1 billion for California last year and the same amount for New York State in 1990.

HEADLINE: The World of a Drug Bazaar, Where Hope Has Burned Out

SERIES: 'The Well': One Block in Brooklyn -- First of two articles

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
The hum of the streets rises to fever pitch as dusk settles on a battered block in Bushwick.
"Most Wanted, Most Wanted," calls a man leaning against a graffiti-filled wall. "Lamborghini," another whispers to passers-by. A third paces the sidewalk, chanting, "Jungle Fever, Jungle Fever, Jungle Fever." He stops by a rumpled woman whose grocery bags hang like weights from her wrists, and trades a tiny package -- "Jungle Fever" heroin -- for a crumpled bill. The deal, one of hundreds made here each day, is done.
 
Lurid Brand Names
 The police call it "the Well" -- this block of Knickerbocker Avenue, between Troutman and Jefferson Streets, that has become the most notorious drug bazaar in Brooklyn and one of the toughest in New York City. 
 To spend two weeks in the Well -- to talk with its residents, addicts, dealers, police officers and social-service workers -- is to see how the drug trade can invade and occupy the entire life of a neighborhood.
Infested with dealers hawking vials of crack or glassine bags of heroin stamped with any of a score of lurid brand names, the Well provides an endless stream of drugs for buyers from as far away as Connecticut and Long Island. It is a constant source of arrests for the police, and of killings and of infection with H.I.V.
And like any center of urban drug trade, the Well has become an utterly persistent and hellish vortex. It not only sucks the life from the addicts who walk its streets but also the hope from the officers who police them. And into its midst have been drawn the hundreds of people who live in the six-family frame houses that line the block.
Some use and some sell. A few fight back. Many more have simply turned their heads and tried to tailor their lives for safety.
"The whole neighborhood is into it," said Inspector Robert Baumert, commanding officer of the Brooklyn North Narcotics Bureau, which has made hundreds of arrests on the block in recent weeks. "We are talking about a people where this is a way of life."
China J. is a 29-year-old mother of seven who tried to keep her building and herself free of drugs before surrendering in despair. "I've never seen a neighborhood where it's so widespread and so intense as Knickerbocker," said China, who lived on Jefferson Street until several weeks ago. "It's like Knickerbocker is controlled by drugs. The dealers will make it part of your life. You don't have any choice but to live with it. You can't complain to them, you can't complain to the cops, because you will die."
On the surrounding streets of Bushwick, an old industrial neighborhood whose name has become shorthand for urban despair, new housing and social services have finally begun to appear, even blossom.
 
Murals to Victims
 The Well is another story entirely. It is a place where street sellers congregate on every corner, where they grab buyers for other middlemen who stand in doorways or down the street. Teen-age girls sit on stoops and call out "bajando" (Spanish for "coming down") when they see the police moving in. Prostitutes and addicts roam back and forth from abandoned buildings nearby.
On all but one of the corners are murals painted to commemorate the casualties of the drug wars. "Rest in Peace" reads one. "Siempre te recordaremos" ("We'll always remember you") says another. In a four-block radius of the Well, there have been 23 homicides since January 1991, most linked to the dealers.
The busiest building on the block -- far busier than the pizzeria, the "Botanica" selling religious statuary and the dry cleaner -- is the AIDS research center near the corner of Jefferson, which provides AIDS tests, condoms, clean needles and referral services for as many as 100 residents a day.
No one knows how many of the neighborhood's residents are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, but of those who have been tested for the virus at the clinic, 45 percent have tested positive -- 15 times the citywide rate.
Just a block away, at Starr Street and Knickerbocker, is Maria Hernandez Memorial Park, named for the 34-year-old woman who was murdered in her apartment in 1989 by dealers angered by the efforts that she and her husband, Carlos, made to rid the street of drugs.
It was that shooting, residents say, that sealed the already tight lips of the community.
 
Standing Up
Price of Courage Can Be Exile
 Maria D. still faithfully attends community meetings about drug problems on Troutman and Knickerbocker, but she never says a word.
Maria Hernandez's murder, she says, was stunning enough. But shortly afterward, when two known dealers were spotted at a community meeting with the local police, rumors quickly spread that the drug organizations were sending spies to find out who was informing on them.
Many people stopped going to meetings at all. Those who continued to go were instructed by the police to pass on information anonymously.
"I go to the meetings, but I never say nothing because I live here," said Maria, one of many residents who spoke on condition that their full names not be used for fear of reprisals. "I go. I listen. I keep my mouth closed."
Silence. Lies. Dusk curfews. Locked windows. Group shopping. Disconnected telephones to avoid charges of informing. Such are the changes that Maria and others have made to their everyday routines in order to survive.
 
'They Know Us'
 "I try to only make two big trips to the grocery store each month," said another resident, who also told of the nightmare trek that she and her two young sons must make to and from their school each day, pushing through the crowds on the corners. Their curfew is 7 P.M. In her desperation, she hopes to scare them into obedience by telling them stories of children being kidnapped.
"It's very dangerous for my kids," she says, anxious that no specific information be used to describe herself or her children. "They know us."
Sitting in the kitchen of the house she owns on Troutman Street, Maria said she had tried such a live-and-let-live strategy. But she insisted on shooing the dealers away from her stoop and threatening to call the police.
Then, this past July, when one of the dealers cursed her, her 18-year-old son, Robert, pushed the dealer and the two began to argue.
A friend later told Maria that some dealers had put an $18,000 bounty on her son's head. Quietly, Maria sent Robert to live in an apartment in Queens, which costs her $600 a month. He carries a beeper, in case she needs him.
Nowadays, the dealers call out to Maria as she scrambles to and from Knickerbocker to shop, but she tries to ignore them. Neighbors have told her that a bullet wedged in the house next door was meant for her. But Maria tries to ignore that, too.
 
Local Task Force
 But she insists she has not given up. One of a handful of residents bold enough to join the Jefferson Street Task Force, a group formed three years ago to help fight drugs and to improve living conditions in the neighborhood, this stocky woman, whose eyes flash with frustration as she talks about her block, continues to fight -- albeit silently. She has left one apartment in her house empty, preferring to take the financial loss than rent to dealers. And she continues to shoo the dealers away.
Still, traditional community tactics, like street patrols, are out of the question.
"Look at them all out there," she says, nodding toward the window. "We can't go out on the streets. They'll kill you."
 
Joining Up
Guns and Money Create Intimidation
 Preferring the risk of the drugs to the pain of withdrawal, many of the Puerto Rican and Dominican residents on the block have clung fiercely to the lucrative trade to supplement welfare checks or support their own drug habits. And while many people on the block say they hate the sight of dealers and users on streets where their children play, many also concede that these soldiers of the drug trade are less invaders than part of the community's tangled web of blood ties and friendships.
Track marks travel up and down Candy H.'s legs like fingers, knotted only by abscesses where she injected heroin too many times. The 43-year-old prostitute with blue eye shadow smeared above tired brown eyes pulls her sleeve up to show more tracks on her arms, then points to her left breast. "I've got one there, too," she says.
Candy came to the area in the late 1960's, looking for heroin for weekend use. Soon, however, the checkout clerk-turned-topless dancer turned to prostitution to finance her habit, and moved into an abandoned building on Jefferson. She sold crack for a short time on Knickerbocker because the money was better than prostitution ($20 for a "date," $300 to $400 for a half-day selling drugs).
 
Expendable Street Workers
 In recent years, she said, she has kicked her heroin habit, buys crack only now and then, but has stopped selling, because she is afraid of being arrested. But there are plenty of people to take her place.
"A lot of new families are getting involved in it. You see it with moms and kids. Everyone gets involved."
And with so many unemployed or money-hungry youths willing to sell, street workers are considered expendable.
"If you get busted, they don't even come get you out of jail," she said, referring to the dealers.
China (pronounced CHEE-na) says she had given up heroin before arriving on the block last year. She moved her children to Jefferson Street, she says, because her old apartment had no heat or hot water and she had been told the building on Jefferson was "clean."
Within two months, however, drugs began to appear in the hallway outside her two-bedroom apartment. Tenants on the second and fourth floors began storing drugs for the dealers across the street. Soon, heroin and crack, she said, were everywhere. Complaints to her landlord seemed to go unheeded.
"Either he was afraid of them or something was going on," she says. "It got to the point where they wouldn't let him in the building. "
Hoping to keep the trade away from her children, she put a lock on the basement door. The dealers quickly popped it off. She tried to keep to herself as she walked in and out of the building. The dealers, however, accused her of calling the police.
One day, she said, five dealers kicked down her door, pointed a shotgun, an Uzi and a handgun at her and her children and accused her of stealing their drugs. "I told them I didn't do it," she said, "but they made me pay for it anyway."
 
Trying the Other Side
 Tired of fighting, she finally broke down. "I thought if I can be like them, they will leave me alone," she said.
She found a dealer, bought some heroin for herself and also agreed to sell some on the street. She left her children at a local playroom and headed out into the Well. The occasional $10 stipend for doing chores in the building paled next to the $80 or $90 a half-hour for selling drugs.
Her stint as a seller turned out to be a short one. After a week, she said, she resolved to stop again and sought help from a detoxification center. A few days later, on Aug. 5, an electrical fire severely damaged her apartment, and she found herself and her family on the street. But hers was a bittersweet escape from the Well: Unable to find or pay for a new apartment, they moved into a family shelter.
"Either you learn to survive in the street or you die," she said. "It's one of the two. I just thank God I'm still alive and that I got out of there."
 
Fighting It
A Vicious Battle, Seemingly Endless
 Ask the officers of the 83d Precinct about their work and they usually talk about robberies. Ask them about the Well, and they talk about drugs.
Lieut. Charles Meyer, who headed the precinct's street narcotics enforcement unit until his promotion last week, grew up only blocks away and played in Bushwick Park, now named for Maria Hernandez. There were always drugs around, he says.
But in recent years, the trade has become harder and meaner, first with the crack epidemic and more recently with the renewed popularity of heroin.
He rattles off known drug locations on Troutman and Jefferson. He describes different surveillance strategies -- all of them made harder by residents' unwillingness to help. Last year, his four-man unit made 247 drug-related arrests in the immediate area. Many of the dealers -- especially the youngest -- were back selling within days.
 
Revolving Door
 Late this summer, he said, they arrested a 14-year-old boy for selling heroin on Troutman Street. They released him to the custody of his mother, who promised to keep him out of trouble. Three weeks later, he said, the boy was arrested two blocks away for selling crack. This time, still unable to prosecute him because of his age, the police turned the youth over to his father.
"Two weeks after that," Lieutenant Meyer said, his voice rising in disbelief, "we arrest his father for selling crack in the same spot."
The lieutenant also talks of growing hostility toward the police from a community that claims some officers are too rough. That tension has made his work more difficult.
Two weeks ago, on night patrol, he and his partner got into a fight while trying to arrest a dealer near the corner of Knickerbocker and Troutman.
"We had to wrestle him down," Lieutenant Meyer said. Within moments, he said, residents surrounded him and began throwing bottles. One hit him on the leg, another hit his partner on the side of the head.
The incident, one of several bottle-throwing episodes in recent weeks, merely heightened the lieutenant's frustration.
"It's an embarrassment for me to go down there and make arrests and yet nothing changes," he said. "It's a disgrace, really. But we try the best we can."
 
Escaping It
Grasping For a Slender Rope
 Florencio Agron stands in the doorway of the Hispanic Service Society, one of a handful of social-service agencies in the area, and watches the drug trade in the Well.
"So many people are involved," he says quietly. "I feel so helpless," he confides later.
On a shoestring budget of $70,000 that has only been partly financed this year, Mr. Agron and two staff members get more than 3,000 requests each year to help residents from Troutman, Knickerbocker and Jefferson. Many of the residents, who do not read or speak English, come for assistance in filling out government forms. Some bring their children for after-school tutoring.
But it is clear that as they step into the modest two-room office that many of the parents and children have simply come seeking refuge from the Well.
The numbers have been overwhelming.
Last year, 150 elementary school students signed up for a tutoring program intended for 15 students. He took 25 students but was forced to refer the rest to programs in other Bushwick neighborhoods. Since school started this fall, 50 students have signed up. Fifteen now come each afternoon -- several of whom arrive on a fall day with their mothers grasping their hands firmly as they rush in off the street. Of the others, Mr. Agron said, "I have no choice but to refer somewhere else."
 
Fear, Apathy, Hope
 Mr. Agron said he has made repeated, unsuccessful requests to recruit volunteer tutors from local high schools and the community. The high schools, he believes, are skittish about sending students to the Troutman and Knickerbocker neighborhood. Parents, he says, decline to get involved out of apathy or fear.
"If there's no incentive, monetary or whatever, people won't show," he said. "And a lot of people are skeptical about coming into agencies when they are trying to hide something."
But there has been progress.
Since he arrived at the crumbling office in 1987, the floor has been tiled, the holes in the ceiling have been filled. The wooden facade and broken windows have been repaired.
He says that of the 25 students who were tutored last year, 20 saw their grades go up. All but two passed to the next grade.
"In a special way, the children here tell you 'Thank you,' " he said. "That keeps me going."

HEADLINE: Conference Committee Approves an Energy Bill

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Thursday, Oct. 1

 BODY:
With time growing short before the Congressional session runs out, Senate and House conferees approved early today a compromise version of a wide-ranging energy bill.
During nearly 12 hours of negotiations, the lawmakers agreed to drop proposed restrictions on coastal oil drilling and to dilute two provisions involving alternative fuels and revamping utilities regulations. 
 The legislation would grant tax relief to independent gas drillers and set higher efficiency standards for plumbing products.
 
Drilling Ban Is Dropped
 Early this morning, the conference committee agreed to drop a proposal to ban oil drilling along most of the nation's coastline and to buy back leases off Alaska, Florida and North Carolina. The proposed ban had been a major area of difference between the House and Senate versions of the energy bill.
On Wednesday, the committee agreed on requiring the Department of Housing and Urban Development to link mortgage rates with energy efficiency standards, and on streamlining licensing procedures for new nuclear power plants. The procedures had been hotly debated on the floors of both the House and the Senate.
Senator J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, the chairman of the conference, also convinced House conferees to drop a provision that would have restricted the right of gas-producing states to limit the output of their wells, presumably to support prices, a practice called pro-rationing. In its place, a single line will appear in the final version of the legislation saying, "It is the sense of the Congress that natural gas consumers and producers, and the national economy, are best served by a competitive natural gas wellhead market."
In exchange on Wednesday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, leader of the House conferees, put restrictive conditions on a measure Mr. Johnston wanted establishing tough federal mandates on Government and private vehicle fleets to employ growing numbers of buses, cars and trucks that run on alternative fuels like natural gas, methanol and ethanol.
Mr. Dingell, who feared the measure would hurt the auto industry, wants the regulations to be linked to the availability and price of fuels.
In another important development, Senate and House conferees merged their differing measures to revamp regulations on electric utilities and ease the way for newer and smaller utilities and producers to sell and buy on the wholesale electric market.
Senate conferees had strongly objected to a House provision giving smaller producers access to transmission lines owned by larger utilities. A broad coalition of environmentalists, consumer groups and some power producers said the proposal would increase efficiency and decrease prices.
Senators softened their opposition to the access provision, and in exchange House members agreed to some Senate terms on competition and to a loosening of regulations on electric utilities to operate power plants abroad.

HEADLINE: Hospitals In 2 Boroughs Join Efforts

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
The New York Hospital will replace the Salvation Army as the controlling force behind Booth Memorial Medical Center, the largest voluntary hospital in Queens.
Under the change, announced yesterday, the New York Hospital, on the Upper East Side, will appoint the board that sets policy at Booth Memorial, a 487-bed hospital in Flushing, Queens, but it will remain, a New York Hospital official said, an "independent, free-standing hospital." 
 Officials at both institutions said Queens residents would benefit from the change because it would enable Booth Memorial to offer more sophisticated, high-technology care.
The officials also said the agreement -- officially a change in Booth Memorial's sponsor -- would enable both hospitals to be more competitive by, among other things, allowing purchasing on a larger scale.
Booth Memorial's executive director, Lieut. Col. Ronald Lyons, said the Salvation Army was cutting its ties to Booth Memorial because "hospitals have become more economically and business driven" and it does not have the resources to sustain a hospital the size of Booth Memorial.
Dr. David B. Skinner, president of the New York Hospital -- a 1,370-bed, voluntary, nonprofit hospital that is part of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center -- said that New York's new relationship with Booth Memorial is part of a "long-range strategic plan" for a future in which it will benefit medical institutions to "have a network of facilities in different parts of the metropolitan area."
An affiliation agreement between the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and Lenox Hill Hospital, also on the Upper East Side, will end next July, but that had no bearing on the decision to become involved with Booth Memorial, Dr. Skinner said.
As part of the sponsorship, New York Hospital will pay the Salvation Army an unspecified amount to compensate it for part of its investment in Booth Memorial over the years.
The Salvation Army, founded by William Booth in 1878, opened Booth Memorial in Manhattan in 1914 and its center in Flushing in 1957.

PRESIDENT BUSH
 In a speech yesterday in Fond du Lac, Wis.
"And so it boils down to this. We cannot take a risk of a candidate with no experience, no track record, whose ideas and agenda are wrong for America. That is the basic thing. Governor Clinton is wrong for America.
Let me tell you something. In the Oval Office you face tough decisions. You cannot be on all sides of every question. You've got to call them as you see 'em. And I've made mistakes, like any American I'll admit it when I make mistakes, but I believe I've been a good, strong leader, willing to make the tough calls. And I'm a leader whose ideas are right for America, and I stand before you today asking for your support so that we can change America just as we have changed the entire world. 
 And I want a second term in office so we can continue to renew our schools, reform welfare, give our children a better shot at the American dream. "
 
GOV. BILL CLINTON
 In a speech yesterday to small-business owners in Clinton, Md.
"We have got to find a way, if we want a vital small business economy, to control health care costs; they're going to bankrupt this economy if we don't. Indeed, the difference, the single difference between my health-care plan and the Bush plan is that he proposes to put more money into the same system with minor modifications. I propose a plan that will bring health-care costs in line with inflation, not just the government health-care costs, but your health-care costs as well.
I have done this after spending literally more than a year talking to hundreds of people, including business people. I don't know how many business people I've met who have had to give up insuring their employees because they couldn't afford the premiums. I don't know how many people I've met who can't change their jobs because they or someone in their family has been sick, and they have a pre-existing health condition."
 
ROSS PEROT
 When asked yesterday on the CBS program "This Morning" about complaints from people who called his toll-free number to tell him not to run but got a recording saying their call would be counted as support.
"Well, they can send me a letter. We do have an 800 number. It's 925-1300. We had a million and a half calls the first two and a half hours after the Larry King show the other night. So folks are calling in and basically I said, If you want me to run and you're outside the volunteer movement -- Larry brought this up -- I said they could call that 800 number. I'm a businessman, Harry. I'm not going to pay for the phone call from some fellow who says, 'Don't do it.' "

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Economic Consultant;
The Whirlwind Is Over for Perot Adviser

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
For the last four months, John P. White was on what he described as something of a whirlwind. In that time, Mr. White, a senior executive with the Eastman Kodak Company, was on leave from the company to oversee the drafting of the economic plan for Ross Perot's off-again, on-again Presidential candidate.
Mr. White has had considerable experience in business and with the Federal Government, but it seems that nothing was been quite like being Mr. Perot's chief economic adviser. 
 "I've had some relationship with government and with corporate life," Mr. White. "But with Ross it's unique. You never quite know what's going to happen next."
 
An Abrupt Halt
 But this week Mr. White spent several days in private discussions in Texas with Mr. Perot, then returned yesterday to his job at Kodak. The leave of absence had been intended to last through the election in November.
Mr. White insists that his decision to return to the company's headquarters in Rochester not be interpreted as a harbinger of the direction Mr. Perot's campaign might take.
No matter what happens to the Perot campaign, the 55-year-old Mr. White said, he will continue to champion the economic principles he crafted on Mr. Perot's behalf. Although many economists have assailed the plan as being politically naive and unattainable, Mr. White defends the proposals, which calls for eliminating the Federal budget deficit in five years through sharp tax increases and harsh cuts in Government spending.
"It's clearly attainable," he said. "We said it should be done in five years because it's hard stuff to do and you have to keep people's attention."
Mr. White, a vice president and general manager of Kodak's integration and systems products division, came to Kodak in 1988 after a computer software company he headed, the Interactive Systems Corporation, was bought by Kodak.
Previously he served as deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget and as an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Carter Administration and worked at the Rand Corporation, the research organization based in Santa Monica, Calif.
Mr. Perot had heard of Mr. White through mutual friends. The economic plan was put together after months of soliciting ideas from economists, policy analysts and academics, regardless of their political affiliation.
 
Graduate Students Help
 Armed with a wide array of suggestions, Mr. White called the deans of graduate schools of business and public policy, like Harvard, the University of California at Berkeley, Duke and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, asking for graduate students to help in the drafting of a plan.
Within three weeks, he had hired about a dozen graduate students who worked virtually around the clock to assemble the Perot plan. "We had a priority list of issues," Mr. White said, "and we tackled them one by one, from the economy to competitiveness to education and health."

HEADLINE: Dow Up 4.86 Amid Concern on Jobless Data

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks closed slightly higher yesterday on buying related to the end of the third quarter, but enthusiasm was capped by anticipation of tomorrow's release of September unemployment data, traders said.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 4.86 points at 3,271.66. Advancing issues led decliners, 1,038 to 706, on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was a moderate 184 million, compared with 170 million on Tuesday. 
 Analysts said investors were preparing for the jobs report amid speculation that a bad unemployment number could provoke the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again to help the listless economy.
"We're all waiting for Friday," said Alice Sadlo, a first vice president at McDonald & Company. "People are expecting the number to be weak. They are expecting the Fed to lower rates again, but with the dollar situation, it makes you wonder how much good that would do."
The dollar has come under severe pressure lately, largely because of the gap between low American interest rates and high German interest rates.
The stock market was also weighing the impact of a restructuring by International Business Machines Corporation, which was announced after the close of trading on Tuesday.
"People were worried about what effect I.B.M. would have on the market," said Newton Zinder, a senior vice president with Shearson Lehman Brothers.
The computer giant said Tuesday that 20,000 more workers than expected had accepted early retirement incentives and that it was reducing its manufacturing capacity. Yesterday, I.B.M. shares fell 1/4, to 80 3/4. Several analysts lowered their earnings estimates.
Analysts noted that some of yesterday's buying was related to the fact that Wednesday was the last session of the month and of the quarter.
Among individual issues, Computer Vision was among the most actives, falling 3, to 6 1/4, after the company said it foresaw lower-than-expected results in its fiscal fourth quarter.
U.S. Healthcare rose 1 1/4, to 44 5/8, as Alex. Brown repeated a strong buy and Salomon Brothers upgraded its rating to buy from hold.
Community Psychiatric, a psychiatric hospitals company, slipped 3/8, to 8 7/8. It said fourth-quarter earnings would be near the 5 cents a share it posted for the third quarter.

HEADLINE: Dollars From Kin in U.S. Now Sustain Haiti

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Sept. 30

 BODY:
In the cramped downtown offices of Boby Express, a large international money-transfer company, there is a bustling business this morning.
Although the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has just marked the first anniversary of his overthrow with a rousing call for a "total embargo" of his Caribbean country, the cashiers here cannot keep up with the customers who have come to receive wire transfers of support payments from relatives in New York and Miami. 
 Most of those who line up each day say they fervently hope to see Father Aristide return soon as President. Yet few seem willing to forgo the monthly payments that sustain their families and, indirectly, Haiti's army-backed Government. "We all want Aristide back," said Naftia Juanita Casseus, a 20-year-old student, smiling as she clutched the $100 she said her father, a hospital worker, had just sent her from Miami. "But you can't stop us from getting our money. That would make a lot of people unhappy."
Funds transferred by firms like Boby Express and Hatrexco, the other major company in the business, are not recorded by Haiti's treasury or by international financial agencies. But economists estimate that the payments sent by the 750,000 or more Haitians in the United States are worth at least $250 million a year, by far this country's largest source of income.
Father Aristide and his supporters complain about the ineffectiveness of a hemisphere-wide trade embargo that was imposed on Haiti by the Organization of American States shortly after he was overthrown last Sept. 30, saying that many members still sell Haiti everything from petroleum to bullets.
But experts on the Haitian economy say that for all the leakiness of the embargo, it is ordinary Haitians themselves who, without reflecting on the politics, have provided the cash that pays for critical imports and keeps the exiled leader's enemies afloat.
"This is the main explanation why, when they imposed a trade embargo on the hemisphere's poorest country, it didn't crush this place," said one Haitian economist who asked not to be identified. "For years, the biggest foreign-exchange earner in Haiti has been cash sent home, not exports sent out."
A businessman who finances imports from Europe, which were largely unaffected by the embargo, agreed. "This is our biggest source of hard cash," he said, displaying a handful of checks from Haitians abroad and missionaries living here that he had exchanged for Haitian currency. "What this coup has taught us is that anybody will sell you anything as long as you have dollars."
Perhaps in recognition of their desperate dependence on relatives abroad, Father Aristide himself has never publicly called for his supporters to stop sending cash to Haiti. Similarly, his Government in exile has never sought to stop scheduled airline service, another lifeline to the Government of Prime Minister Marc L. Bazin.
Because of the heavy demand, American Airlines, the largest carrier between the United States and Haiti, will begin a second daily flight from Miami on Thursday.
"The diaspora has always kept this country afloat," said the Rev. Antoine Adrien, an adviser to Father Aristide, acknowledging the support that the funds from abroad had indirectly provided for the military, partly by keeping the level of human suffering from reaching explosive levels.
After the coup, the United States threatened to freeze the assets of the coup's financial backers. But nothing has been done to impede the flow of cash from individuals, which United States officials concede may have grown since the embargo.
"As the perception that things are getting bad back home has grown, Haitians in the States have been sending, say, $120 rather than $100 to their families," said one diplomat. "A 10 percent change alone would have been enough to offset the embargo."
Asked why Washington had not stopped the transfers, an Embassy official here said, "The idea was to make an impact on the coup makers, but not to totally suffocate the country that is the poorest in the hemisphere."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidate's Record;
Perot, No Longer Unfamiliar or Unmarked, Has Yet to Live Down Criticism

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
What a difference a campaign makes. When Ross Perot first leaped into Presidential politics, he presented a tantalizing yet unfamiliar face unmarked by the arrows of political combat.
Now that he's back, the wounds show.
Dropping from a strong showing in the polls to a shriveled 9 percent, Mr. Perot abruptly pulled out of the race July 16. This week, poised to re-enter the fray, he faces the same questions left hanging when he vanished from talk shows. 
 In the days before Mr. Perot's sudden withdrawal, criticism of him fell into three basic categories: his supposed lack of sensitivity and autocratic style, his business dealings and use of political connections, and his judgment. Most of those criticisms and accusations have yet to be silenced.
 
Personality
A Man Who Likes Things His Way
 Some of the most pointed criticisms raised in the press and in opinion polls in July focused on doubts about Mr. Perot's character, particularly his attitudes about race, religion, homosexuals and women.
Voters also expressed fear that the billionaire executive might prove too autocratic if entrusted to lead the nation. Mr. Perot dismissed that notion as "an election year fantasy carefully crafted by the Republicans." He particularly lashed out at Vice President Dan Quayle's assertion that he was a "temperamental tycoon" who lacked respect for the Constitution.
Several events during the campaign and reports of Mr. Perot's actions in his computer empire, Electronic Data Systems, fueled those fears.
Just five days before Mr. Perot declared he would not run for President, he departed from his usual round of speeches to enthusiastic supporters to address the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. While calling for racial harmony and economic development, he managed to alienate a large part of his audience. Citing his father's treatments of poor blacks in Texas, Mr. Perot told the Nashville audience that his father used to tell him, "Son, these are people, too, and they have to live."
That remark, coupled with Mr. Perot's references to blacks as "you people" and "your people," distanced him from his audience and perhaps from many other black voters. Critics pointed to his minority-employment record. In 1986, the last year that E.D.S. was under Mr. Perot's control, only 1 percent of its managers and supervisors were from minority groups.
 
Beards and Facial Hair
 Jews may have thought they had reason to be uncomfortable as well. Records brought forth early in the campaign showed that Mr. Perot's company dismissed a computer programmer, Reginald Dallaire, in 1983 because he had grown a beard in defiance of company policy prohibiting facial hair.
Mr. Dallaire, who refused to shave his beard because he had converted to Judaism from Roman Catholicism after joining the company, was reinstated with back wages after Federal District Judge John C. Coughenour ruled that he had been discriminated against because of his religion. Mr. Dallaire later quit the company.
A flap over Mr. Perot's attitudes toward homosexuals also troubled the last days of his campaign. After stating in a May 29 interview with Barbara Walters on the ABC News program "20/20" that he would not consider appointing homosexuals to Cabinet-level posts and would not lift a ban against their serving in the military, Mr. Perot came in for sustained criticism from gay-rights groups. He reversed his position July 8, saying that he would not rule out such a Cabinet appointment. Mr. Perot's campaign chairman, Thomas W. Luce 3d, then indicated that a President Perot might relax restraints in the military as well.
That approach would be a departure for a company executive who has long emphasized traditional life styles and a complementary uniform of white shirts, dark suits and ties. Former employees say homosexuals were never warmly welcomed into E.D.S. In a June 29 issue of Time magazine, a former Perot employee described standing orders not to hire anyone with a "weak handshake" because the individual might be homosexual.
Mr. Perot has been blunt about the sort of employees he does like. He told U.S. News & World Report of his penchant for hiring Vietnam veterans who "could be on the wild side." He then described a series of conversations with one man, Don Drobny, whom he described as a talented 27-year-old who "loved to chase women."
Mr. Perot told the magazine's editors that he told Mr. Drobny: "You've got six months to get a wife." Mr. Perot said he forgot about the conversation but that Mr. Drobny returned five and a half months later with a fiancee.
Back in the spotlight this week, Mr. Perot angered female reporters with the comment that negative articles and television reports they produce are simply a result of their attempts to "prove their manhood."
 
Business Dealings
Money and Power Come in Handy
 More complicated questions about the candidate focus not on his personality but on his way of doing business. Though Mr. Perot has proved to be 1992's ultimate outsider in many ways, his business record is that of a longtime insider.
Republicans and Democrats have called Mr. Perot's quixotic run for the Presidency an attempt to buy the election. At a rally last May in Orlando, Fla., he told an adoring audience: "Just put it this way. I'm buying it for the American people." He has spent more than $12 million of his own money.
But Mr. Perot's political track record shows that he also sometimes spends money on others to get something for himself.
Since 1972, Mr. Perot and his business associates have helped to bankroll scores of politicians. In 1974, Mr. Perot gave more than $90,000 to Congressional candidates, making him the largest individual contributor in the United States that year. Twelve recipients of Mr. Perot's largess later voted for a $15 million tax break specifically written for Mr. Perot's corporations and passed in a late-night session of Congress.
Since 1980, according to reports by Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Mr. Perot and his family have given $175,000 to candidates for Federal offices. Some went to legislators who would later rule on the construction of one of the Perot family's pet projects, the construction of a modern airport in Fort Worth on land that lies in the center of a 17,000-acre tract owned by the Perots. Over the last five years, Federal, state and city governments have invested nearly $200 million in cash and tax breaks for that project.
The campaign for the airport began in 1987, when Mr. Perot and his son, Ross Perot Jr., asked the Federal Aviation Administration to finance a $25 million runway and control tower. The F.A.A. declined, saying the family should "compete fairly."
The Perots persisted. Turning to Representative Jim Wright of Fort Worth, who was Speaker of the House from 1987 to 1989, they convinced him that the project was critical to Fort Worth's growth. Three weeks later, Mr. Wright pushed a bill through Congress that dedicated money for the Alliance Airport.
Nothing about the project was illegal. Yet it did result in at least one clear benefit to the Perot family. a Perot company executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the value of tens of millions of dollars worth of real estate around the airport doubled after the project won approval.
Mr. Perot's efforts on the prisoner-of-war issue have been criticized as well. In 1987, working for the repatriation of American servicemen who he believed were held in Southeast Asia, Mr. Perot unsuccessfully sought to persuade the Reagan White House to begin limited economic relations with Vietnam.
Reagan Administration officials complained that he went to Vietnam for his own business ends. They also contend he was prepared to grant concessions in American foreign policy without first waiting for concrete signs that Vietnam would be more forthcoming about missing Americans.
 
Judgment
Use of Detectives Raises Doubts
 Mr. Perot's talent for making enemies, his tolerance for conspiracy theories and his frequent use of detectives has raised questions about his judgment.
A Perot campaign official said yesterday that Mr. Perot hired private investigators in the last two months to look into volunteers' use of money.
Some Government officials close to the prisoner-of-war issue said Mr. Perot became obsessed with the notion that a Government conspiracy was blocking efforts to free any prisoners left behind.
It was over the P.O.W. issue that Mr. Perot began a three-year feud with Richard Armitage, the senior Pentagon official in charge of P.O.W. and M.I.A. affairs. In 1986, Mr. Perot met with an undercover police officer who said he had information about a conspiracy involving the Pentagon and the prisoner issue. The undercover officer also raised questions about Mr. Armitage's relationship with a Vietnamese-American restaurant owner.
Mr. Perot met with the undercover officer, James L. Badey, then encouraged government investigations into the case. Mr. Armitage was never charged with wrongdoing.
Mr. Perot's harsh dealings with officials behind the construction of the Vietnam Memorial in Washington also won him enemies.
Though he gave generously to the project at the outset, once Mr. Perot turned against the design (saying it would look like a "trench"), he tried to get the committee to move in a more conventional direction. John Wheeler, the chairman of the fund that built the memorial, refused.
Mr. Perot hired Roy Cohn, the New York lawyer, to do whatever he could to stop construction. Mr. Cohn demanded the memorial fund's records and charged that the project's backers had misused money.
An audit showed nothing wrong. And the memorial was finally built. "He pushed me and pushed me to give up the wall," Mr. Wheeler said. "It was like being sliced with a knife."
Mr. Perot's aggressiveness in that instance was not without precedent.
When a rival computer company won a lucrative state contract in the 1980's, Mr. Perot hired a private detective to investigate the senior official in charge of that concern. The detective, a former F.B.I. agent named Joseph T. Wells, said he spent at least 18 months gathering information to use against the System Development Corporation and a top executive, Edward Doyle.
Mr. Wells also tried to get the F.B.I. to begin a criminal investigation into one of Mr. Doyle's top aides. Yet nothing was ever revealed to show that Mr. Doyle or anyone else associated with the company had done anything improper.
Examples of Mr. Perot's reliance upon detectives kept cropping up as his campaign progressed. Another highlighted case was that of his investigation into a land deal engineered by the Pennzoil Company and its head, J. Hugh Liedke, a close friend and former business partner of President Bush.
In that case, Mr. Perot hired a Washington law firm, Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPheron & Hand, to look into the sale of a 500,000-acre parcel of land in northern New Mexico. The land had been offered to Mr. Perot for $24 million in the early 1970's. It eventually was sold to Pennzoil. In 1986, Mr. Perot said, Pennzoil came to him with an offer to sell the same land -- minus 100,000 acres -- for twice the price. He said at the time he had learned that Pennzoil received a $48 million tax credit for donating the extra 100,000 acres to the Forest Service.
After reports surfaced that Mr. Perot had once investigated Mr. Bush's children, the President's campaign chairman, Robert M. Teeter, said Mr. Perot "doesn't have the judgment or temperament or respect for our laws to be President." Mr. Perot, who denied the reports, retaliated by producing a letter in which President Bush had praised him as a friend.

HEADLINE: One Group Saw Relief: The Very Wealthiest 1%

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Contrary to what many Americans believe, the way the Federal tax burden is shared among different income groups has not changed much since 1980. The only exception? The very richest 1 percent.
That group saw real tax relief. But for almost everyone else, effective tax rates are about what they used to be, according to findings presented at a recent conference of tax specialists at the University of Michigan. The Federal tax burden on families in the top 20 percent of earners, estimated at 27.5 percent now, is 3.2 times that of families in the bottom 20 percent, scarcely different from 3.4 times in 1980. 
 In essence, income taxes, which are the most progressive form of Federal tax, became a smaller share of the total Federal tax burden. At the same time, payroll taxes, which include Social Security and Medicare, and fall most heavily on middle- and lower-income families and more lightly on the rich, loomed larger.
The biggest surprise to many economists was that the burden on the working poor did not shrink. The effective tax on the bottom 20 percent actually rose sharply during the first half of the decade, but then fell again. The rise came as higher excise and payroll taxes pushed total Federal taxes to 10.3 percent of their income in 1985, from 8.1 percent at the beginning of the decade. At the same time, inflation was pushing more low-income people into the ranks of income tax payers. The 1986 Tax Reform Act, which removed millions of low-income families from the tax rolls, reversed most of the rise.
 
Theory at Issue
 As for the the top 1 percent, Federal taxes dropped to 24.9 percent of their pretax income in 1985, from 31.7 percent in 1980, as both personal and corporate tax rates were slashed. Now the figure stands at 28.8 percent.
The finding that there were not large shifts in the tax burden seems to refute the suggestion that tax changes are to blame for the big income gains by the richest Americans and the relative losses by those who make the least. "I've looked for evidence that lower rates caused the increase in inequality, but I couldn't find a smoking gun," said Joel Slemrod, a professor at the University of Michigan.
 
Tilting the Tax System?
 Lynn Karoly of Rand estimated that 85 percent of the rise in inequality was from shifts in pretax income.
Some economists at the conference argued for tilting the tax system more in favor of the working poor. "It's possible to find efficient ways that don't cost the rich $3 to give poor people an extra $1," said Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution.
But several economists at the University of Michigan meeting strongly questioned whether whether the tax system could play a dominant role -- as the current political debate seems to imply -- in redressing the squeeze on the middle class.
"The taxes required to offset inequality are far too large to undertake," said David Cutler, an economist from Harvard University.
To illustrate how large, the Congressional Budget Office economists calculated that raising the top income rate to 50 percent, taxing stock trades and scaling back Social Security taxes -- a package far more radical than anything proposed by anyone to date -- would roll back less than one-seventh of the increase in inequality during the 1980's.

HEADLINE: Niagara Crash Brings Cry for Rules on Helicopters

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Like many of the thousands of people who make their livings off Niagara Falls, Nick Ricci, who owns a hotel on a wooded ridge overlooking the falls, now wants the Canadian and American Governments to regulate the sightseeing helicopters that churn through the skies overhead at a rate of nearly one every five minutes.
Watching the thundering green-blue waters of the falls today, Mr. Ricci noted that the collision of two of the helicopters on Tuesday caused one to crash just 200 yards from his building. "If the wind had been blowing in toward the hotel instead of out, that copter could have hit us," he said. "It's pretty unsettling." 
 Three passengers -- two from Brooklyn and one from Queens -- and the pilot of one of the helicopters were killed. None of the five people on the other helicopter were seriously injured.
Long ignored as noisy nuisances or grudgingly accepted as necessary evils in the all-important tourist trade, the helicopters have suddenly become threatening and unwanted to many residents -- including many who know their economic value in a recession-strapped region.
 
Tourist Tapes Sought
 Moreover, the crash, the cause of which was still undetermined today, has raised questions about whether the aviation authorities on both sides of the border should start restricting when, where and how many helicopters can tour the falls.
At least three companies operate a total of 200 or more sightseeing flights daily during peak season. As many as five helicopters have been known to be airborne above the falls simultaneously.
"This is going to change everyone's thinking about the helicopters," said Mr. Ricci, 33, a former professional hockey player who now owns the Oakes Inn. "They fly overhead constantly and I never thought about them. Now, I realize it's just too dangerous."
In essence, anyone with a pilot's license can cruise the congested area along any route they choose, officials said. "All we do is recommend an altitude and flight pattern," said David Tomczak, an air traffic controller at Niagara Falls International Airport. "But there is nothing that says they have to do anything."
The crash victims were identified today as Ben Poprawski of North Tonawanda, N.Y., 42 years old, the pilot; Orna Levy, 19, of Queens; Esther Zarian, 23, of Brooklyn, and Amnon Sarfate, 26, of Brooklyn.
Investigators from the Canadian Transportation Safety Board continued inspecting pieces of the crumpled McDonnell Douglas 500E helicopter, which remained at the crash site. The Canadian authorities have asked tourists who might have videotaped the collision to submit their tapes to investigators. There were hundreds of sightseers in the area at the time.
"Because helicopters don't have flight data recorders, we don't know what actually happened," said Jim Harris, a spokesman for the Canadian Transportation Safety Board.
 
Flights Are Suspended
 Sightseeing flights have been suspended indefinitely while the investigation, which could take months, continues.
Though there has been no shortage of accounts from witnesses, many of them conflict. The survivors of the crash made no public statements yesterday.
But most accounts agree that the smaller helicopter, owned by Rainbow Helicopters of Niagara Falls, N.Y., lost control when one or both of its rotor blades were clipped by the other helicopter, owned by Niagara Helicopters Ltd. of Niagara Falls, Ontario.
After the collision, the American helicopter plummeted into the wooded ridge below Mr. Ricci's hotel. The second helicopter landed a mile away.
The question about regulating the helicopters has stirred debate. Scott B. Hughes, general manager of Rainbow Helicopters, said pilots could easily avoid each other if they maintained radio contact over the open frequency used by helicopter pilots.
"There's no doubt in my mind that our pilot was in continuous radio contact with the other pilot," he said today. "So what happened? Damned if I know."
 
Passengers Can Distract
 But Harold Bucholtz, who owns another American-based helicopter company, said pilots were often distracted by the excited chatter of their passengers. "For sure, the guy sitting next to you is going to be asking questions about you altitude, where you're going to turn and what's that thing on the left," he said. "You can lose 200 feet in altitude in a few seconds if you're not paying attention."
Mr. Bucholtz said the Federal Aviation Administration and its Canadian counterpart should begin setting mandatory flight patterns and altitudes for the helicopter flights.
In the wake of the crash in Niagara Falls, momentum has built on both sides of the border for banning or severely restricting helicopter flights. Two weeks ago, Rob Nicholson, the member of Parliament representing Niagara Falls, introduced legislation banning low-altitude flights over the falls.
And on the American side, Barbara A. Geracitano, a Niagara Falls city councilwoman, said she plans to reintroduce a bill to ban helicopters from taking off inside the city limits.
The bill was narrowly defeated two years ago amid fears it would hurt the local tourist trade. But now, Ms. Geracitano said, the tide of opinion has shifted. "People will still come; they'll just get a great view from the ground," she said.
 
Dependence on Tourism
 Along Main Street in Niagara Falls on the American side, where scores of vacant stores stand in bleak testimony to the bad economic times, the debate over helicopters was on many residents' minds yesterday.
"It's such a racket you can't talk over it," said Ruth Hooker, 59, whose apartment building overlooks the Niagara River Gorge. "The wind catches their blades and all you hear is bang, bang, bang, chop, chop, chop."
But in Norm's Bar across the street, the thought of banning a tourist attraction put a scare into Marla Fadel, who owns the tavern. "The industries are gone, we're really depressed here," she said. "The helicopters are good for business. They should stay."

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Panel Shows Consensus Is Easy If Ideas Are Vague

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
At a time when political consensus exists on precious little, few Americans would take issue with these propositions:
*The Federal budget deficit should be lowered. 
 *The nation's medical-care system should be reformed.
*Medicare and Medicaid costs need to be reined in.
*The tax system should encourage people to save more and consume less.
*Military spending should be reduced.
*Government spending should be adjusted so more goes to valuable programs and less or nothing to those without such merit.
So amid great fanfare, another commission with several prominent members, this one called The Strengthening of America Commission, issued a 180-page report today, the product of 16 months of work, urging that those steps be taken.
 
But How?
 What the commission did not address was how the medical system should be changed, which Medicare and Medicaid benefits should be reduced and by how much, who should pay higher taxes, which military programs should be cut and which Government programs are without merit.
It did not, in other words, address who would bear the pain, who would make the sacrifice for putting the country on a different course. That is the fundamental matter politicians have been unwilling or unable to address for a decade, a failure that caused the mess the commission now wants cleaned up.
Voter surveys show that Americans resent the way Presidential candidates and other politicians avoid confronting the crucial issues of the time. But this latest commission illustrates how it is not just politicians but leaders in all walks of life who decline to stand up and be counted on the side of making demands on the American people. John F. Kennedy's line about asking not what your country can do for you has become passe.
The 60 commission members included a few senators, representatives and other politicians but most were corporate executives, labor leaders and scholars working under the auspices of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research institute.
When a reporter suggested at a news conference on Capitol Hill, where the report was released, that the group had ducked the essential issues, Senators Sam Nunn and Pete V. Domenici, the co-chairmen of the commission, took offense.
"You're fundamentally wrong," said Senator Nunn, Democrat of Georgia. He said that the panel had drawn a blueprint and that policy makers would fill in the details.
Senator Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said the question reflected "the sense of cynicism that's around."
He suggested, "Rather than say, We can't, I think we have to say, Why not?"
But a few of the commission members agreed that the panel had avoided the difficult calls.
"The problem with all of this," one member, Isabel V. Sawhill, wrote in her signed statement, "is that after aggressively calling for tough choices, the report is incredibly vague on what those choices are and, in the process, leaves the impression that they will be far more easily and less painfully achieved than is actually the case." Ms. Sawhill, a prominent student of the Government's social and economic policies, is a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, another research center.
Blue-ribbon commissions are as much a part of the Washington scene as campaign fund-raisers and the Lincoln Memorial. Sometimes they make history. That was the case with the Warren Commission on the Kennedy assassination and the Kerner Commission, which examined the causes of the urban riots in the 1960's.
But the work of commissions is generally hoisted to the top shelf in library stacks, where they gather cobwebs for the rest of their days.
Over the years, the Center for Strategic and International Studies has focused almost entirely on foreign affairs and military issues. But its president, David M. Abshire, said the center formed The Strengthening of America Commission because "we are most vulnerable not on the Russian steppes or in the Persian Gulf, but in our factories, our classrooms and our halls of government."
To get a copy of the report, send $14 to C.S.I.S., 1800 K Street N.W., Suite 400, Washington, D.C. 20006.
Some of the panel's recommendations are indeed ambitious. It would balance the Federal budget over 10 years by cutting spending by 8 percent from what it would otherwise be and raising taxes by 3 percent.
Following President Bush's lead, the commission endorsed a cap on mandatory spending programs other than Social Security, including Medicare, Medicaid, farm price supports, veterans benefits and student loans. These are programs that make payments to all eligible individuals. But like the President, the commission did not take the essential next step of saying how the cost of Medicare and Medicaid, which have been rising at the rate of 13 percent a year, should be controlled.
 
Overhaul of Taxes Urged
 The commission's most innovative recommendation was to abolish the existing income tax system and replace it with what the commission called a consumption-based income tax system. Taxpayers would pay taxes only on the portion of their income that they spent, not on the money they saved or invested. Since rich people are able to save more than the poor and the middle class, the only way to make such a tax as equitable as the current system would be to exempt the poor and have tax rates that would rise steeply as income and spending increased.
If overall taxes are increased by $376 billion over 10 years, as the commission proposed, rich people and the middle class would have to pay higher taxes than they do now, a point not addressed in the commission's report.
Like so much else in the document, the difficulty with the tax plan is in such details.

HEADLINE: Brazil's New Chief Prepares for Monday Takeover

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Empowered by the impeachment of President Fernando Collor de Mello, Vice President Itamar Franco worked today to forge a parliamentary base to sustain him through the end of 1994 as the leader of Latin America's largest nation.
As the Vice President negotiated Cabinet choices with political supporters, the Senate completed steps that will allow a formal transfer of power on Monday, fulfilling the constitutional requirement that an impeached President be barred from exercising control while he is tried by the Senate. 
 The trial is supposed to be completed in 180 days. Mr. Collor said through a spokesman today that he would submit to the trial and would not resign. But an overwhelming majority of senators have already announced their intention to vote to convict Mr. Collor.
Today, the day after more than half a million people took to the streets to celebrate the impeachment, Brazilians started to take a closer look at the quiet 61-year-old career politician who is expected to be the country's leader for the next two years.
The styles and personal trajectories of Mr. Franco and Mr. Collor could hardly be more different.
The playboy scion of a political oligarchy, Mr. Collor was appointed by Brazil's ruling military to be Mayor of Maceio, a state capital, when he was 29 years old. When Mr. Franco was 29, he was a civil engineer working in his hometown, Juiz da Fora, as head of the city Department of Water and Sewers.
At age 36, he was elected Mayor of Juiz da Fora, the second largest city of Minas Gerais, an interior state known for austerity, a sober work ethic and nationalist politics.
"What most pleases him is his image of integrity, rectitude, honesty and public spirit," Valder de Goes, a Brasilia political consultant, wrote in a profile this month. "Itamar is a solitary, close, introspective man."
Mr. Franco was Mayor from 1967 to 1974, when he was elected Senator for Brazil's center-left Democratic Brazilian Movement. In his 26 years in public office, he has moved through four political parties and is currently politically unaffiliated.
In 15 years in the Senate, he gained a reputation as an economic nationalist hostile to foreign investment, to foreign imports and to cooperation with the International Monetary Fund -- concepts embraced by Mr. Collor.
Mr. Franco has made few public statements and has given few public interviews since assuming office on March 15, 1990, but several officials interviewed here this week said that his economic thinking had moved to the center in recent years.
"The world has changed, and Itamar has changed," said Antonio Delfim Netto, a member of the Chamber of Deputies who fueled Brazil's economic growth as Planning Minister in the 1970's and who is expected to be named Agriculture Minister.
Carlos Langoni, a former Central Bank president, predicted confidently, "There is no way that Itamar will change the fundamentals of the Collor modernization plan."
Senators close to Mr. Franco predicted that he would maintain Brazil's new debt accord, and, with minor changes, the privatization program and openings to foreign trade promoted by Mr. Collor. By the end of November, Brazil's Senate is expected to vote to approve an accord reached 10 days ago to reschedule Brazil's $44 billion private bank foreign debt.
The most pressing problem facing Mr. Franco will be the nation's 25 percent a month inflation rate. To beat inflation, Mr. Franco needs to pass tax increases through Congress, to speed the reduction of Brazil's federal bureaucracy and to cut tax evasion.
Today, Mr. Franco sought to translate into a formal political pact the political consensus registered in the Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday when 92 percent of members present voted for impeachment.
"The political parties have to be tied to a formal pact of national unity," said Senator Mauricio Correa, a Franco adviser who was chosen today to be Justice Minister. "It will not be enough for them to give support at first, and then to come out later with the machine guns."

HEADLINE: Detroit Journal;
Big Problems and an Image to Match

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Earlier this month, a Florida woman visited a downtown church where the Rev. Ervin A. Brown will marry the woman's daughter. The woman walked from Christ Church Detroit, where the wedding will take place, to a hotel at the Renaissance Center, where the reception will be held, two and a half blocks away.
"She asked if we needed an armed guard to walk the guests to the hotel," recalled Mr. Brown. "Talk about image problems." 
 Oh, Detroit, Detroit, Detroit. As hard as it tries to overcome its portrayal as an urban nightmare, stories like the one told by the Episcopal pastor, as well as a string of recent events, have repeatedly punctured this proud city's soul and bruised its pride. No other city, residents here lament, has to work so hard to overcome an image -- and sometimes the damage is self-inflicted.
Detroit's former police chief began a prison sentence earlier this month for embezzling police funds. A Cable News Network report a week ago portrayed the city as an impoverished shell. There was a bitter monthlong strike by 10,500 public school teachers.
All of these events have damaged an already fragile self-image. "If the city was a person, it would have a lot of defensive pride," said Larry Ledebur, director of the Center for Urban Studies at Wayne State University.
"When you mention you work in Detroit, the reactions you get from people make it very clear what their perception is," said Mr. Ledebur, who lives in the suburb of Southfield. "It's almost universally negative."
The city's beleaguered image masks the fact that its problems are generally no worse than those of other cities with populations of one million to two million. For example, Detroit's 615 killings in 1991 made the city's homicide rate comparable to those in Dallas, which had 500 homicides, and Houston, which had 608, according to statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Dallas, not Detroit, has the highest overall crime rate.
"As far as Detroiters go, we don't see our problems as any worse than other cities," said Paul Hubbard, president of New Detroit Inc., a public policy organization of civic leaders. "Detroiters are tired of it."
Yet the city continues to get grim reviews from around the nation. Urban specialists say this is partly because Detroit never recovered from the 1967 riots. The decline of its industrial economic base has led to a steady drain of residents, mostly whites who have fled to the suburbs. The city's 1990 population, according to the Census Bureau, declined to a little more than one million from 1.5 million in 1970. Nearly 76 percent of the city is black.
"Detroiters are very sensitive about these things," said Morris Thompson, an editorial writer for The Detroit Free Press. "Detroit has had a bad reputation in the country at least since the 1967 riots."
Residents fiercely defend their city, but even some of them admit that life is not easy, given the economy and chronic high unemployment, 15.5 percent in July as against the national rate of 7.6. "Sometimes life in the city is good and sometimes it's bad," said Owen Grant, who has lived in Detroit for 25 years. "Right now, it's very rough.'
Mr. Brown, the Episcopal minister, who has lived here for 11 years, concurs. "I kind of feel beleaguered and discouraged over unemployment, crime, blight, and the fact that the same things seem to be getting worse instead of better." Mr. Brown said he and his wife, a hospital chaplain, differ over the quality of the city. "She says Detroit has a spirit and the people are resilent," he said, "but I find it harder to find."
Urban experts say Detroit can rehabilitate itself. Mr. Ledebur of Wayne State points to Cleveland, which had image problems a decade ago but now, with a refurbished downtown, draws fewer knocks.
He concedes that it will not be easy but adds, "It's not impossible."

HEADLINE: EDUCATION PANEL SEES MODEST GAINS

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Only modest progress has been made toward the six national education goals that President Bush and governors agreed to in 1989, and the United States continues to lag behind other industrial nations in geography, mathematics and science, according to a report made public today.
"The rest of the world has been expecting more and getting more," from its students, said Education Secretary Lamar Alexander. 
 The report, released by the National Education Goals Panel, is the second in a series of 10 that will chart progress toward education goals that the nation is supposed to achieve by 2000. The panel is a bipartisan group made up of six governors, four members of the Bush Administration and four members of Congress.
American children at most age groups are achieving about the same scores they achieved for the last decade, although math and science scores improved slightly for children ages 9, 13 and 17, the report showed.
"We've got to have much more rigorous standards and raise expectations," said Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, a Democrat who is a former chairman of the panel.
Today's report is likely to renew pressure for full financing of Head Start, since the panel's first goal is that all children should start school "ready to learn," which encompasses the need for early childhood nutrition, health and family programs.
 
6 Goals For the Year 2000
 The panel for the first goal has yet to define standards to assess progress, but its chairman, Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation on Teaching, said: "This report card is terribly flawed because it fails to take seriously the most important goal. Unless we get our policy toward mothers and babies straight, we're never going to have better schools."
The second goal calls for a 90 percent high school graduation rate. The report showed that although more high school students are entering college, the number of high school graduates has not increased. And a decline in the difference in high school completion rate between black and white students was countered by a rise in the number of Hispanic students without a high school diploma.
Goal three calls for American students to demonstrate competence in English, mathematics, science, history and geography, while the fourth goal calls for them to be first in the world in science and mathematics. The fifth calls for every American to be literate and possess the skills to compete in a global economy.
The final goal calls for every school to be free of drugs and violence and to offer a disciplined environment. The report showed that alcohol and cocaine use had declined among 12th graders, but that violence had increased in the same period.

Behind the Agency Review at Oldsmobile

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
OLDSMOBILE'S startling decision to consider changing agencies was not so much "a wake-up call" for the troubled car maker's longtime shop, says the vice president and general manager of the General Motors division, as it was a necessary response to Oldsmobile's poor showing in recent years.
"We shouldn't interpret the agency review as a lack of performance on the agency's part," John D. Rock, who became Oldsmobile's top executive in April, said in a frank telephone interview from Lansing, Mich., where the 95-year-old division is based. 
 "Oldsmobile had reached a point where the changes needed were of such a magnitude that everything got reviewed," he added.
Mr. Rock discussed Oldsmobile's plight, as well as his plans for the lagging division, in the wake of the unexpected disclosure on Sept. 18 that Oldsmobile would review its $110 million to $140 million account, which has been at Leo Burnett U.S.A. in Chicago since 1967.
The last time a G.M. division dismissed an agency was in 1958, when competitors like Ford were still building Edsels and Chrysler was building DeSotos.
"Basically, when you try to do a repositioning, and do it correctly, you have to take a look at everything," he said. "We're reviewing ourselves."
That approach was applauded by Tom Dukes, director of competitive assessment at J. D. Power & Associates, the automotive consulting company in Agoura Hills, Calif.
Though the review is "precedent setting," he said, "it's not a simple matter of saying the fault lies with the agency or with the manufacturer."
"Is it the advertising?" he asked. "Or is it the product? Which came first, the chicken or the egg? It's a difficult call."
Oldsmobile's review follows a severe sales slump during which sales plunged 57.6 percent from 1985, their most recent peak year, through 1991.
Mr. Rock attributed that slide to "a lack of quality, reliability and durability in the mid-80's, when Oldsmobile was having those very successful years, selling 300,000-plus Cutlass Supremes to a very sophisticated group of buyers."
"I think we became probably the biggest owner group to build Honda," he said.
If anything, then, Burnett's advertising might have done its job too well, bringing customers into dealer showrooms to buy more than a million Oldsmobiles a year at precisely the time the products were inadequate and inferior.
"Your very success creates the difficulty," Mr. Rock said, likening the problem to that of a husband whose wife learns he had 25 affairs rather than a sole indiscretion: "Your chances are pretty slim of getting back in her good graces."
Mr. Rock, 56 years old, can afford to be forthcoming about Oldsmobile's mistakes -- he was elsewhere when they were being made. He joined Oldsmobile less than six months ago from a corporate G.M. position as vice president in charge of customer sales and service.
Still, the division has a special meaning to him; growing up, he worked at his father's Chevrolet-Oldsmobile dealership in South Dakota.
From 1987 to 1991, as general manager of the GMC Truck division, Mr. Rock demonstrated a proclivity for shaking up the status quo. Unhappy with GMC Truck's advertising, he encouraged his agency, McCann-Erickson Worldwide in Troy, Mich., to undertake a substantial reorganization, by acquiring a shop that handled the retail portion of the account and hiring Candace Robbins, GMC's truck advertising manager, to head the revamped operation.
Mr. Rock, who began working for G.M. in 1960, makes no secret of his admiration for Saturn, the auto giant's experiment in disrupting the status quo. Opened amid widespread doubts in 1988, Saturn now cannot build cars fast enough to meet demand.
He said he particularly admires Saturn's ability to "take the variance out of the retail environment," by offering friendly, no-haggling visits to dealerships.
"The early research data from consumers say they very much like that," he added. "If that's the case, and you're attempting to talk to nontraditional Oldsmobile owners, primarily import buyers, that atmosphere appeals even more to them."
"Can Oldsmobile become Saturn-esque?" he asked rhetorically, noting that "Saturn is America's newest car company; Oldsmobile is the oldest."
Mr. Rock said he "would envision Oldsmobile becoming more of a product line like Mazda," referring to the Japanese vehicle maker that specializes in niche models like the Miata convertible, but "with more plain, austere European styling."
His Oldsmobile of the future, he added, "is exemplified by Achieva," the division's recently introduced entry-level sedan and coupe, and by Aurora, a luxury model due in spring 1994.
"The natural question there is will the dogs eat the dog food," Mr. Rock said. "I wish I knew the answer to that.
"All I know is that business as usual is really not an option."

Merck Chairman Opposes 'Play or Pay' Health Plans

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
P. Roy Vagelos, head of the world's largest prescription drug maker, spoke yesterday against health care legislation that he said might endanger American leadership in medical research and innovative technology.
Dr. Vagelos, the chairman of Merck & Company, who presided at a campaign speech on health issues last week by Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, at Merck's headquarters in Rahway, N.J., criticized the financial implications of "play or pay" proposals. They would tax busineses that do not provide medical coverage to employees and use the money to finance coverage for those without insurance. 
 The play or pay approach has been endorsed by many Democrats in Congress, although it is not currently part of Mr. Clinton's program. Similar plans have been enacted, but not carried out, in Massachusetts and Oregon, and have been proposed in many other states. Dr. Vagelos contended that a national version could quickly lead to a Government-controlled system.
 
Fears Centralized System
 He said the initial tax increase would be about 9 percent of payrolls. Companies that already spend more than that would have an incentive to drop their coverage and pay the tax, adding to the public's share of health costs.
"We'd quickly slide into a centralized system," he said, involving the Government in approving investments in medical innovation. He said there had already been "a discouraging decrease" in research and development spending "by Government and most of the private sector."
"Innovation in biomedical research is every bit as crucial to achieving our health care goals as the investments that manufacturers make in research and development to increase their quality and productivity to stay competitive," Dr. Vagelos said. He made his remarks yesterday in a speech to business executives at the Detroit Economic Club.
Merck, which is spending more than $1 billion this year on research and development, has not endorsed a Presidential candidate. Dr. Vagelos, who has long been active in Democratic Party work, said the company would welcome a visit by President Bush.
Asserting that the inability of many Americans to get health care was "a national disgrace and a political time bomb," he said all poor unemployed people should be made eligible for Federal-state Medicaid assistance.
To help pay for the added coverage, he said, "it's also high time that we streamline our health-care system and bring it into the computer age." He said standardized insurance claim forms, electronic billing and data banks could save billions of the $800 billion a year in health spending.
Illnesses resulting from smoking add at least $65 billion a year to national health spending, he said. Preventive health measures, including auto seat belts, prenatal care and programs to slow the use of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs "could prevent two-thirds of all premature deaths," he added.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Hillary Clinton;
Hillary Clinton Fights Back With Punch Lines

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER

 BODY:
Of all the unflattering things said about Hillary Clinton during the campaign season, she said yesterday, the cruelest blow was not criticism of her ambition or her headbands -- or even assertions that she is an enemy of the traditional family, insensitive to stay-at-home moms.
"The only one that really hurt, and one of the few that was really true, is that I'm middle-aged; I couldn't believe when I saw that in print," the 44-year-old wife of Gov. Bill Clinton said, drawing howls of laughter from the mostly female audience of 750 who paid $60 each to attend the Financial Women's Association of New York luncheon. "It was even meant to be a nice article" she said, "but gosh, I've got a few years left." 
 Mrs. Clinton, who has never been particularly well-known for her use of humor, on or off the stump, is still no Ann Richards. But at several junctures in an otherwise serious speech on children's issues, domestic violence and health care, she seemed to show a new jocularity.
 
An Early Celebration
 Asked how she would use her position as First Lady if her husband won the Presidency, she hoisted a bottle of mineral water and said, "Well, I'm going to have a drink here" before answering. Still laughing at her own joke, she went on to give her standard answer about working to be a voice for children in the White House.
Then, once again serious, she defended a decades-old paper on children's legal rights that Republican campaigners have interpreted as evidence that she would support the right of children to "divorce" their parents on a whim.
"Children are being exploited right now in the existing court system, whether they have any rights or not," she said, noting that welfare agencies were always able to sue parents on behalf of a child. And the whole issue of whether or not children can sue their parents would be moot, she said, if their problems were not ignored until court intervention became necessary.
On "family values," an early campaign issue that seems to have backfired on Republicans and even created a backlash against attacking Mrs. Clinton, she said, 'We have all this rhetoric at the national level about valuing children, yet we don't do very much to support children."
 
'A False Debate'
 "Family values begin with valuing families -- all kinds of families in all kinds of circumstances," she said, adding that finger-pointing about which families espouse true family values had been wholly counterproductive. "It's a false debate. There isn't anyone I know who doesn't believe families need strong values."
It was Mrs. Clinton's remarks about crime that drew the most enthusiastic response from the audience. In response to a question from a mother who said she worried about raising children in New York, Mrs. Clinton said many more police officers were needed on the street, and spoke of her own worry for her daughter Chelsea's safety, even during a short bicycle ride from the Governor's mansion to a Little Rock library.
She said Mr. Clinton's emphasis on increasing police protection was "one of the reasons why he's a different kind of Democrat."
After her speech Mrs. Clinton, who campaigned in Brooklyn earlier in the day, worked her way slowly through the crowd in the Grand Hyatt New York ballroom at Park Avenue and 42d Street, shaking hands with supporters. They included an older executive who said Mrs. Clinton had made her proud to be a woman, another who described herself as a "Wall Street economist" who would be forwarding her resume to the Clinton administration, and a young woman who whispered that she just wanted to touch Mrs. Clinton's green silk suit.
 
Reasons for Enthusiasm
 The enthusiasm was variously inspired. A fellow graduate of Wellesley College referred to the sisterhood, and a Republican who asked that her name not be used said she had been impressed by Mrs. Clinton's intelligence. Mary Robinson, of the Bank of New York, mentioned her impression that the speaker really cared about minority women.
Elsie Chan, the principal of Murry Bergtraum High School in Lower Manhattan, said Mrs. Clinton had won her over on many points. Among them: "I'm middle-aged, too."

HEADLINE: Further Prescriptions for the Convalescent Sears

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
For more than a decade, Sears, Roebuck & Company has tried to redirect its retail business, at times simply adding a brand name or two, at times mounting wholesale overhauls.
While Sears might receive an A+ for effort, however, many analysts would fail it for execution. Even though Sears on Tuesday announced plans to sell its securities business, Discover credit card and real estate operations, analysts say that a few additional basic, but sweeping, corrections are necessary for setting the $31.4 billion retail business back on its feet. 
 Following are questions about the company's situation, and the answers as seen by analysts:
Q. Sears stores generate enormous volume, but those sales dollars have not translated into profits. How can Sears force more of its sales dollars to the bottom line?
A. Sears has a higher expense structure than virtually any of its competitors. Last year it spent 29.2 percent of its revenues on salaries, light bills, advertising and other routine costs, while Kmart's expenses amounted to 19.6 percent of total sales and Wal-Mart's were an even leaner 15.3 percent.
Sears argues, with some justification, that as an older, more traditional retailer with more complex commitments to its employees, its cost structure cannot be compared with that of Wal-Mart, which evolved in a different era. But Kmart, which also has a long history, has done a better job of paring expenses.
Analysts praise Edward A. Brennan, Sears's chairman and chief executive, for making the tough decision to eliminate 48,000 jobs from the merchandising group by the end of this year, saving about $900 million annually. But so far, few of those savings have trickled down to the bottom line.
"The numbers aren't there yet because we're still in the process of seeing change occur," said Peter J. Siris, an analyst at UBS Securities. "But even if this recession persists, I think we'll see some marked improvement by the end of 1993."
Q. How can Sears rebuild its customer base?
A. While Americans of a certain age are still Sears devotees, baby boomers are less loyal. They may have worn Toughskins and Winnie the Pooh as children, but they are now sporting Gap and J. Crew. Some can even be found lurking about J. C. Penney, which has successfully managed to reshape itself.
Marketing consultants are puzzled as to why Sears has not capitalized on its legendary heritage. As the nation's first mail-order business and a general symbol of bedrock American values, Sears could use its advertising and marketing to play into the retro-1950's nostalgia that has swept the country.
"Sears has been such an integral part of the heartland and has always stood for value, and now we're back in a really value-oriented time," said Edwin D. Rice, executive marketing director at Landor Associates Inc., an image consulting firm based in San Francisco. "They need to tap into that."
Others suggest that Sears do more to build its market share among ethnic Americans.
Q. Why does Sears always seem to be a day late and a dollar short when it comes to innovation?
A. Edward A. Weller, a retail analyst at Montgomery Securities, likes to say that the main problem with Sears is that its managers and executives are "Sears-ized," -- so indoctrinated in the lore of past glories and so entrenched in an overwhelming bureaucracy that they cannot change easily. The result: Nothing happens quickly at Sears, which is why the company is continually playing catch-up with its competitors.
Mr. Weller and others believe that Sears's biggest challenge will be to radically alter its culture. And for the first time in many years, Sears is showing subtle signs of a personality change.
It has eliminated the elaborate structure that gave often-conflicting responsibilities to buyers, regional management and store managers, which stifled the flow of goods. Now responsibility is more linear, from buyers directly to the stores. Sears has also eliminated overlapping jobs by melding its corporate and merchandising staffs.
But its most visible change was the hiring last August of Arthur Martinez, formerly Saks Fifth Avenue vice chairman, as head of retail operations. While retail experts have debated the wisdom of selecting a financial man instead of an experienced merchant, they applaud the choice as a sign that Sears is willing to go outside for good ideas.
Q. How can Sears get away from its reliance on sales of washing machines, lawn mowers and power tools?
A. Sales of durable goods like major appliances, hardware, tires and electronics account for almost 70 percent of Sears' revenues from merchandise, which makes the company more vulnerable to troughs in the economy that most of its competitors.
Sears is notorious among retailing wags for displaying dresses next to lawn mowers or putting maternity clothes in the area next to petites. In a recent report about Sears, Mr. Siris at UBS Securities, said of Sears's women's department: "It has almost no major national brands, and it is not known as the place for fashion. Yet the women's business is the most profitable segment of Sears's merchandising."
Many consultants are convinced that Sears must find a way to make more of its money off sales of clothing and other "soft" goods, which generally earn a higher profit margin and are somewhat less subject to the vicissitudes of the economy.
"They have to supplement their hard lines with fashion -- fashion that's exciting, well-made, priced right," said Walter F. Loeb, president of Loeb Associates Inc., a retail consultancy. "And they can't put it out three months after everyone else has marked it down for clearance."
Q. How did Sears lose its position as the largest retailer in America to Kmart and Wal-Mart?
A. When Sears made its initial attempts to correct its retail business in the mid-1970's, Kmart had always been the johnny-come-lately in the race for Middle America's shopping dollars, and Wal-Mmart had failed to attract much attention outside its home state of Arkansas.
Since then, Kmart has revamped its discount stores, giving them a sleeker, more contemporary look with bright lighting, bold signs and just enough trendy merchandise to make shoppers enjoy the experience. And it has bolstered the whole corporation by acquiring specialty-store chains like Waldenbooks, which it bought in 1984. Kmart even has a warehouse club, Pace, in its stable.
Meanwhile, Wal-Mart's conquest of legions of shoppers combined a commitment to consistent low prices, a down-home, service-oriented atmosphere and deft deployment of cutting-edge information systems that kept expenses to a minimum.
Sears was not as quick to adapt to the changing retail landscape. It dabbled in specialty-store formats starting in the early 1980's but did not commit itself to the concept until 1987.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Senate Race;
New Hampshire Governor Finds Himself the Issue

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H.

 BODY:
The discontent that chilled the Bush campaign in the New Hampshire primary has not abated, forcing another scion of New England Republicanism into a fight he didn't expect.
Gov. Judd Gregg, like his father before him, has won a string of easy election victories, for four terms in the House of Representatives and two more terms in the Statehouse. But now he is running for the Senate, at a time when his years of public service are shrouded by a sinking New Hampshire real estate market and a flurry of business failures that has cost 70,000 jobs in the last four years. 
 Local polls indicating that Mr. Gregg is running neck and neck with his Democratic opponent, John Rauh, show that voters thus far are treating the Senate race as a referendum on Mr. Gregg's performance as Governor. Mr. Rauh is a little-known retired corporate executive whose calls for price controls on health care and a 50 percent cut in the military budget have traditionally not been winning issues in this state of Yankee innkeepers and shipyard workers dependent on Pentagon largess.
No Democrat has won a senatorial election here since 1976, and few people here doubt that Senator Warren Rudman would have won re-election easily had he decided to run.
 
Voters Are Frustrated
 "The issue is Judd Gregg," said Tom Rath, a senior Concord Republican strategist. "As long as Rauh is not perceived as stunningly out of the mainstream, he can win it."
Mr. Rauh's surge relies on the frustrations of voters like Buck Howe, a 47-year-old Merrimack businessman whose printing concern has been forced to let go nine of its 12 employees. "The politicians are either in your body or in your wallet," he grumbled after meeting Mr. Rauh at a Hollis flea market. "I'm so fed up, Rauh looks pretty good."
The race is also a test for an electorate torn between anger and stoicism. Those who view New Hampshire's recession as one more natural blip in the business cycle are likely to vote for Mr. Gregg. Mr. Rauh's fortunes rest on the fear expressed by a growing number of people that New Hampshire is suffering a chronic downturn that will not bend unless government takes action.
No name is more identified with New Hampshire's steadfast commitment to low taxes and small government than Judd Gregg's.
 
'Change' Is No Mantra
 In a year when "change" has become a political mantra, Mr. Gregg steadfastly boosts President Bush and defends his record as governor, noting, "New Hampshire is doing better than our sister states."
"Since I've been in office," he said, "we're the slowest-growing state government in the region.
Mr. Gregg's charges that Mr. Rauh represents values outside the New Hampshire mainstream have been overshadowed recently by reports that the Governor avoided service in Vietnam because his father applied pressure to keep him out of the military. In response, Mr. Gregg said he deserved his deferments and ultimate exclusion from the draft because he suffered acne, sleepwalking and injured knees.
The Governor is a plodding campaigner, clearly uncomfortable with the retail style of campaigning that still characterizes New Hampshire politics in the television age. He dutifully shook hands up and down tables at a Manchester Greek-American festival recently but made little more than perfunctory chit-chat with voters. When confronted by a man who complained about mounting real estate taxes, he rolled his eyes dismissively, told him residents in Massachusetts pay more, and brusquely moved on.
 
Descendants of Poachers?
 But Mr. Gregg reminds voters that he is the torch carrier of the anti-government heritage that goes back to the days when outlaw poachers of the English kings' forests settled here.
Watching Mr. Gregg mount a 16-year-old Sellefrancis horse at the inauguration of a riding school for the disabled in Goffstown, Norm Chase, a 35-year-old engineer, said he would vote for the Governor because he is against government waste. "He's what New Hampshire tradition has been: conservatism," Mr. Chase said.
Mr. Rauh is a more engaging campaigner, but he spends so much time talking to each individual voter at campaign stops his aides fret that he is not shaking enough hands. Having come to New Hampshire from Cincinnati only six years ago, he still speaks with a Midwestern accent and may be vulnerable to the Republican charge that he is a carpetbagger.
While taking some unconventionally liberal positions, he has tried to tailor his campaign in a way that fits New Hampshire traditions. He tells voters he strongly backs a line-item veto and a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget, and a capital gains cut for long-term business investments.
And while he wants the Federal Government to invest in more public works, like a high-speed rail between the New Hampshire coast and Boston, Mr. Gregg has embraced the message of the anti-politician.
"The public does not trust the President, the Congress, the two parties -- and I think they are right," he told a group of truckers at a recent forum. "Both parties have fallen in love with this miserable game of politics."

HEADLINE: Unusual Conditions Cloud Prospects for Rate Cut

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
With declines in retail sales, factory orders and consumer confidence expected to be capped later this week by a less-than-stellar unemployment report, conditions seem right for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again this Friday, after the jobless rate is released.
But don't bet on it. The Fed under Alan Greenspan has often cut rates as soon as poor jobless reports followed a wave of other bad economic news. But this time, a lively debate inside the central bank that has divided its governors and unusual outside pressures cloud the prospects for a rate cut. 
 In recent interviews, Fed officials indicated that there are definite tensions on the central bank's board, with some governors open to further rate cuts and others leaning against them. According to these officials, some Fed officials believe more easing may be needed to revive the torpid economy, while others assert that enough easing has been done already.
 
Dissatisfaction on Economy
 "We have put quite a bit of additional easing into the system over the past few months," said David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman of the Fed. Still, he acknowledged, Fed members remain dissatisfied with the anemic state of the economy. "Recent data have been a bit on the weak side," he said.
The Fed has rarely faced outside pressures like the recent turmoil on the world's currency markets. Europe's currency crisis has finally started to simmer down, and a Fed rate cut now could throw new fuel on that fire.
What is more, the dollar is at a record low against the Japanese yen and is approaching new lows against the German mark. Fed officials might be reluctant to cut rates further because that might help turn the dollar's slide into a nose dive.
Complicating matters is the November election. If the Fed cuts rates on Friday, it will no doubt be criticized for trying to help its friend in the White House.
Nonetheless, if the employment report is bad enough, economists say, Mr. Greenspan will have little problem lining up the Fed's seven governors to support a further rate cut.
"There's no question that payroll employment is the key factor in Fed thinking," said David M. Jones, chief economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York securities firm. "I think Greenspan will play it by ear depending on what happens with the job numbers."
The Fed cut rates on July 2 when the jobless rate jumped to 7.8 percent, its highest rate in eight years. It lowered the discount rate -- the rate at which it lends to banks -- by one-half point, to 3 percent, and it pushed down the Federal funds rate -- the rate commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans -- by one-half point, to 3.25 percent.
Two months later, when the Sept. 4 jobless report showed that private-sector employment had plunged by 167,000 jobs, the Fed pushed the Federal funds rate down further, to 3 percent. The discount rate and Federal funds rate are now at their lowest levels in almost three decades.
Most economists expect Friday's report on September employment to show a decline in overall payroll employment because of the end of a Government summer jobs program that employed 150,000 youths.
 
Assessing the Odds
 "We think that if the payroll numbers, after factoring out the summer jobs program, are up 50,000, then the Fed won't ease further," said Elliott Platt, chief economist for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York. "But if the payroll numbers are flat or down, we think they will ease."
Mr. Platt suggested that the Fed's first worry was domestic. "If the job numbers are bad, we think the Fed will take the risk of a rate cut whatever the repercussions in foreign exchange markets," he said.
An American rate cut would aggravate European currency tensions by widening the gap between low American rates and high German rates. The higher yield available in Germany makes German investments attractive, causing investors to move money out of other currencies and into German marks. That puts pressure on some countries to raise their own rates to keep their currencies from sliding against the mark.
In an interview, the vice chairman, Mr. Mullins, said Fed members were "studying" the dollar's weakness "very carefully."
"One worries most when you see the weakness in the dollar reflected in the bond market and stock market," he said.
Some economists suggest that no matter how bad the job numbers are, the Fed might wait before acting until its open market committee meets on Tuesday. That committee, the Fed's main policy-setting group, includes the seven Fed governors and the presidents of five of the 12 Federal Reserve districts.
Mr. Mullins and other Fed officials expressed optimism that the economy was slowly picking up as consumers and businesses reduce debt burdens.
"We're making measurable progress in working our way through the deleveraging process," he said.
Mr. Greenspan has often described the debt burden as a head wind slowing the economy's progress.
Lawrence E. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve governor, said in an interview, "The head wind is probably blowing fairly strongly, but our weather map suggests that the barometric pressure is going to improve, and the winds will diminish as we move forward."
Fed officials say there is some disagreement among governors about how to interpret money supply figures. Some governors are said to worry that a strong pickup in M-1 -- a narrow sector of the money supply that includes cash and checking deposits -- presages an economic rebound and high inflation, while others look far more to M-2, a broader sector of the money supply that is growing more slowly.
Fed officials said whatever differences existed on the board were in interpreting the data rather than in fundamental philosophy.
Economists suggested that the Fed officials leaning most against further easing were John P. LaWare, a governor, and Thomas C. Melzer, president of the St. Louis district. At the open market committee meeting last July 1, they were the only dissenters tofurther easing. They argued that this policy placed excessive emphasis on short-term concerns and might undermine the Fed's long-term inflation-fighting credibility.
But many economists and Government officials say lower rates are the best hope for the stalled economy.
"Some additional easing would be helpful," said Henry Kaufman, head of an economics consulting firm in New York. "It would reduce debt burdens. It would reduce the cost of financing. And I think the fears of spurring new inflation are overstated."
Many economists say the Fed, having cut rates on Sept. 4, just two months before the election, would probably feel little inhibition about cutting rates on Friday, just one month before Election Day.
Besides, the economists say, Fed officials can argue that there is no way any rate cuts this week would help the economy and President Bush before Election Day. Most economists say it takes at least three months for the stimulating effects of rate cuts to start coursing their way through the economy.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Candidate Bush Is Holding Back

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THE economy is under water, and judging by the polls, so is the Bush re-election campaign. Is there no way for George Bush to regain the initiative?
Any President is obviously at a disadvantage running on his record in the midst of a recession. And this President is at particular risk because this recession threatens his natural constituency -- white-collar workers who never before imagined that the jobs lost could be their own. 
 But Mr. Bush's sometime allies on the economic right are still puzzled by his failure to fight with all the weapons at hand. The uncertain fate of two radical proposals, which have been bouncing from desk to desk in the White House for months, illustrate the grip of inertia on his Administration.
The capital gains coup. The President's apparent cure of choice for all that ails the economy, repeated so often that it has taken on the quality of a mantra, is a cut in the tax on capital gains. But Congress is not about to give him what he wants -- at least not unless it is attached to a tax increase on the ordinary income of the rich. And by most accounts, the contest is firmly stalemated.
Most accounts, but not all. Paul Craig Roberts, a Treasury official in the Reagan Administration who still carries the supply-side banner into political battle, suggested six months ago that the President could cut the effective tax rate on capital gains by executive order. And a high-powered Washington law firm hired by the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Taxpayers Union thinks he has a point.
The idea is to index capital gains to inflation, taxing only the portion of the gain in value that exceeds the change in the general price level. Thus a stock bought in the early 60's for $10 and sold today for $30 would not be taxed at all because the price level tripled in the interim.
Congress plainly never intended the tax code to be interpreted this way. But lawyers from the firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge concluded that ambiguities in the wording had left an opening for reinterpretation. Thus a Treasury decision to tax only indexed gains "should and would be upheld judicially."
In any case, there might never be a serious challenge. Congress would not be likely to muster a veto-proof majority to reverse the Administration's interpretation. And private citizens opposed to indexing would have great difficulty gaining the legal standing to force a decision by the courts.
Economists are of two minds on the policy issue. Isabel Sawhill of the Urban Institute points out that the "benefits would be heavily tilted toward the rich." But she acknowledges that indexing is "a sensible thing to do in principle," as part of a broader package of reforms to make the tax code inflation-neutral.
But the suburbanites in states from New Jersey to Texas who will determine Mr. Bush's fate would probably be delighted with the tax break. And even if the initiative went down in flames in court, it would help to recast the President as a mover and a shaker.
Why, then, has the White House chosen not to act? Jude Wanniski, the president of Polyconomics, dismisses the legalist arguments offered by the Treasury Department. The core opposition, he insists, is coming from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and the budget director, Richard G. Darman, who are simply defending their turf against supply-side intruders.
Kill the lawyers. With the possible exceptions of "tax-and-spend liberals" and the Democratic platform writers who omitted the G-word, candidate Bush has reserved his harshest words for trial lawyers. That ought to make the auto insurance reform drafted by Jeffrey O'Connell of the University of Virginia and Michael Horowitz of the Manhattan Institute pure campaign gold.
The O'Connell-Horowitz plan offers an enticing solution to a problem that dogs virtually every American: the escalating cost of auto liability insurance. Instead of insuring themselves against negligence suits, drivers would, by Federal mandate, be given the option of insuring themselves against their own purely economic losses in auto accidents.
While those who took the option would give up the remote chance of a giant payoff from a lawsuit, compensation for injuries from one's own insurance company would be sure and swift. And the savings in legal fees and pain and suffering awards would cut overall auto insurance costs by an estimated 20 to 30 percent. "Can you imagine what people could do with the extra $30 billion?" Mr. Horowitz asked.
Unlike capital gains indexing, the auto insurance initiative is not dead in White House waters. Indeed, it is likely to show up one of these days in a Bush campaign speech. But one of these days is, by any reckoning, very late. If heaven helps only those who help themselves, the President is in deep trouble.

HEADLINE: Tax Burden Is No Lighter After Efforts of 80's

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
President Bush has recently been hammering his Democratic rival for harboring plans to raise taxes. Gov. Bill Clinton, in turn, says he is only aiming at the truly rich. He, like the President, has wrapped himself in the flag of middle-class tax relief.
But the latest research on the effects of the sweeping tax changes in the last decade -- from the 1981 tax cut through the 1990 budget deal -- illustrates how elusive the goal of easing middle-America's tax burden can be. New evidence shows that despite repeated efforts at lowering Federal taxes, the average American family's Federal tax burden -- including Social Security, corporate and excise taxes -- has failed to shrink at all. 
 The average effective Federal tax rate amounted to 23.3 percent in 1980, according to three economists from the Congressional Budget Office, Richard Kasten, Frank Sammartino and Eric Toder, who recently presented their findings at a conference of public finance specialists at the University of Michigan. That figure hovered within a narrow band, but never dropped below 21.7 percent. Today it is 23.2 percent, virtually where it was 12 years ago before a nationwide tax revolt helped sweep Ronald Reagan into the White House.
When people think about taxes, they tend to think of income taxes, because they are the biggest share of most people's tax payments as well as the most visible one, a beast to be battled every April. But as Federal income taxes have been trimmed and the Federal Government has raised the ante in other areas, economists have increasingly felt it useful to include the whole range of payments that Washington exacts to get a more realistic measure of the levy on the population.
So the new calculations include not only income taxes -- which have shrunk as a portion of the American family's income, but also Social Security, excise and corporate taxes. Although the latter three are paid all or in part by companies, economists point out that they are borne, ultimately, by individuals, as customers or shareholders.
These calculations also depart from earlier assessments of the changing tax burden because they focus on families and the burden borne by different groups of families. In measuring the effective tax rate, the economists consider a family's total Federal taxes divided by its pretax income -- which is the broadest measure of a person's tax burden.
What the figures showed, said William Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution and one of the commentators at the Michigan conference, is that
"in some ways, nothing much changed."
That is not to say that there were no significant changes within the overall totals. Income taxes shrank as a portion of family income from 1980 to 1992, but that was offset by a sharp expansion in payroll taxes. The burden of corporate taxes on American families fell somewhat, while excise taxes edged up.
The fact that the total Federal tax burden has ended up where it started was caused by income, consumption and demographic trends as well as changes in the tax law. In particular, incomes grew too slowly to lighten the overall tax load. Pretax income rose 1.5 percent a year after inflation on average and less than half that pace for more than two-thirds of American families.
But mostly the problem was that for every tax cut, there was a tax increase. Washington, after all, was spending a growing share of national output. A Reagan tax increase in 1982, called the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, vies with the much-lamented Bush tax increase, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as one of the country's biggest tax increases.
The conclusion that the more the tax code changed, the more the overall tax burden stayed the same reflects a broad consensus among dozens of the nation's top public finance experts on how the tax decade affected family tax burdens and aftertax incomes.
This view was reflected at the mid-September gathering of many of these experts, mostly middle of the roaders from government, academia and think tanks with no particular ideological ax to grind. They were meeting in Ann Arbor, Mich., to ponder the latest evidence -- much of it available for analysis only in the last year or so -- and to weigh the "fairness" issue, which has become a factor in the election.
"Reagan broke the 'no-new-taxes' pledge long before Bush," said C. Eugene Steuerle, a former Treasury official under President Reagan and author of a recent book, "The Tax Decade," chronicling the 1980's tax changes. "The Government promised to deliver higher benefits and lower taxes," Mr. Steuerle said. "If you promise too much, something has to give."
On the other hand, the experts agreed, Republican tax policies contributed only marginally to the income squeeze on poor and middle- class families. "The consensus is that growth in inequality was not due to changes in tax rates," said Joel Slemrod, director of the Office of Tax Policy Research at the University of Michigan's business school and the organizer of the conference. The trouble, he said, was declining wages at the bottom and stagnating pay in the middle.
Barring a new willingness to scale back Washington's obligations, the evidence suggests that promises of broad tax relief hold the same chance of payoff as circulars from groups like Publishers Clearinghouse announcing million-dollar prize winners. It also suggests that tinkering with the tax code would do little, if anything, to reverse the stagnation of middle class incomes, a prime cause of voter discontent and pessimism.
In fact, the last decade has been one that saw extensive remolding of tax policy, including five major Congressional tax bills, a basement-to-roofbeams Social Security overhaul and thousands of alterations too minor to attract much public notice. All this changed things less than people have thought.
The 1981 Economic Recovery and Tax Act slashed the top marginal income tax rate -- the rate paid on the last dollar of income -- from 70 percent to 50 percent and reduced all other brackets by nearly a quarter. The 1986 Tax Reform Act went even further, replacing numerous brackets with three -- 15 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent -- aiming benefits at low-income families and eliminating hundreds of tax loopholes.
In between, however, came three large consecutive tax increases -- in 1982, 1983 and 1984 -- aimed at reining in the runaway Federal deficit. More tax increases followed the 1987 stock market crash and the 1990 Saddam Hussein invasion of Kuwait.
Income taxes -- which helped touch off a taxpayer revolt that preceded Ronald Reagan's election -- did decline, from 12.3 percent of pretax income to 10.9 percent with the biggest breaks at the bottom of the income ladder.
 
Payroll Taxes Swell
 But other Federal taxes rose by exactly as much. "Highly visible taxes were cut, but less visible taxes went up," Mr. Steuerle said.
 In particular, payroll taxes swelled form 7.2 percent of income to 8.9 percent as the Social Security tax rates jumped to 15.3 percent of ages up to $55,000, counting both employee and employer contributions. And corporate and excise taxes, which are declined and then rose again.
 To be sure, the public finance experts are not saying that today's Federal tax system is not in many ways superior to the 1980 tax system. Ineffective and inefficient 70 percent top tax rates are no more. Ditto for much of the real estate tax shelter industry. And for millions of families, filing income taxes is a lot simpler. Indeed, some would argue, the stubbornly high tax burden was one of the few things that did not change for the better.

HEADLINE: Fall in New Home Sales Discounted by Analysts

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell to an annual rate of 570,000 units in August, a steep drop despite soft prices and the lowest mortgage rates in nearly 20 years. But after close scrutiny, analysts found in the numbers scant evidence of further deterioration of the housing market, concluding that it was essentially flat.
"Although they appear to show a decline," said Mark H. Obrinsky, senior economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association, "this has more to do with Commerce Department methodology than to the state of demand for homes." 
 The data on sales of new homes have become increasingly unreliable because of the Government's inability to adjust to changes in the market, specifically to the fact that builders are reluctant at a time of sluggish business to put up homes without a sales contract.
 
July Decline Reversed
 Skepticism about today's report arose on various counts, including a sizable upward revision that transformed the decline initially reported for July into an advance, and the fact that the Commerce Department deemed any change of less than 10 percent to be statistically insignificant.
The 570,000 sales rate in August compared with 607,000 in July, indicating a 6.1 percent drop. But when compared with the first reading for July of a 563,000 rate, the August pace was slightly higher.
The statistical surveys are based on samples of building permits, and in many cases sales have been made before the issuance of permits.
"We're seeing a lot more of that," said Audrey Harmon, a Census Bureau statistician. She said the agency tried to allow for this factor but had underestimated it. The sample, she added, was designed to pick up only one of each 40 permits issued, with none included for homes built on a consumer's own land.
The result has been upward revisions for every month during the last year, a phenomenon analysts said they expected to show up again in the September figures.
Some analysts combined the latest figures for July and August, which they found to be 3.7 percent higher than those for May and June. But Ms. Harmon, whose agency states that it takes four months to establish a trend for sales of new homes, was skeptical that this exercise was meaningful.
The Government's housing report showed sales rose in the Northeast to an annual rate of 72,000 from 67,000, and in the Midwest to 120,000 from 115,000. But these gains were offset by declines in the South, to 238,000 from 251,000, and in the West, to 140,000 from 174,000.
At the end of the month, there were 272,000 unsold new homes, or a 5.8-month supply at the latest sales pace. This compared with 273,000 in July, a 5.6-month supply. The 1992 peak was in April, when the inventory represented a 6.2-month supply.
Prices rose for those homes that sold in August but not enough to regain June levels. Both the median and average prices rose $3,000, to $121,000 and $140,200, respectively, compared with $122,900 and $146,000 in June, and $118,000 and $137,200 in July.
The actual number of sales in August, with no annualization or seasonal adjustment, was 50,000, down 1,000 from July and 3,000 from June, the report published jointly by the Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development showed.
Through August, sales of new homes ran 18 percent ahead of the 1991 pace.
Upon revision, the annual sales rate is now 554,000 for May, 581,000 for June and 607,000 for July. The initial estimate was for a 2.6 percent decline for July, but the new figures showed a 4.5 percent increase.

HEADLINE: 6 Canadian Banks Post Big Rise in Prime Rate

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Canada's leading banks, reacting to volatility in financial markets caused by fears that voters would turn down a constitutional referendum in October, today announced the biggest single recorded jump in interest rates since the Depression.
The six banks, led by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the Bank of Montreal, raised their benchmark prime rate by two percentage points, to 8.25 percent, in a move widely expected to hurt consumer and investor confidence here. 
 Joining the rate rise later in the day were the Toronto-Dominion Bank, the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Royal Bank of Canada and the National Bank of Canada.
As in the United States, where it stands around 6 percent, the prime rate here sets the trend for business and consumer borrowing costs throughout the economy.
 
An Emotional Debate
 "The reality here," said Warren Jestin, chief economist for the Bank of Nova Scotia, "is that the constitutional debate has become highly emotional, and its outcome is uncertain, making markets extraordinarily volatile. Once the referendum is over, conditions should be calmer and rates might fall again."
Canadians will vote Oct. 26 on an agreement reached by political leaders on Aug. 28 aimed at amending the constitution to keep Quebec from separating. Polls show that the referendum, which needs approval of all provinces, will be defeated in Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta.
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has warned that a no vote would begin the process of dismantling the country. The Royal Bank of Canada calculated in a report published Friday that such a breakup would add 720,000 people to the 1.3 million already unemployed and that 1.25 million Canadians would emigrate to the United States.
 
Central Bank Actions
 The rate increase was also touched off by the actions Tuesday of Canada's central bank, the Bank of Canada, in tightening money to defend a plummeting Canadian dollar. During the day Tuesday, the dollar fell below 80 United States cents, to a four-year low of 79.50 cents. Over the last year, the Canadian dollar has fallen from a high of nearly 90 cents. It closed today at 80.24 cents, up 0.24 cent from Tuesday's close.
"There was a growing sense in the market that if rates didn't rise significantly, there would be an all-out repatriation of funds from Canada," noted Rob Palombi, an economist for MMS International, a financial information services concern in Toronto. "There was a need to stabilize the panic flows."
But the rate increase was about the last thing that Canada's weak economy needed. As in the United States, economic activity here has been lackluster and unemployment is running at 11.6 percent of the labor force.
 
Report of No Growth
 The dramatic rise in rates came as Statistics Canada, an economic agency similar to the Commerce Department, reported zero growth in July, following a slight rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in the value of goods and services produced in June.
Still, the financial news for Canadians was not universally bleak. A lower dollar helps big exporters, particularly the natural-resource companies in western Canada, and reduces incentives for those who have been crossing the border to shop for bargains in the United States.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed on Light Day; Report on U.S. Jobs Awaited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday in light trading as the market awaited further indications on the direction of the American economy.
Gold prices fell a bit. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery fell 40 cents to $347.80. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid price of $348.30 a troy ounce, down 20 cents. 
 Traders said there was little news to affect the currency market. Traders are awaiting tomorrow's scheduled release of September unemployment figures from the Government for more insight into the economy's health.
"That's a big number for the short-term direction of the market," said Peter Wild, a trader with the New York office of Bank Julius Baer & Company.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 119.25 yen, down 0.40 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 119.55 yen. In New York, the dollar traded at 119.85 yen in late afternoon, up from 119.31 late Tuesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7805, from $1.7705 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound traded at $1.7865, cheaper than $1.7895 the day before.
In Europe, the dollar fell to 1.4145 German marks, from 1.4220 the day before. In New York, one dollar bought 1.4100 German marks, down from 1.4110.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.2355 Swiss francs, up from 1.2278; 4.7695 French francs, up from 4.7665; 1,223 Italian lire, up from 1,199, and 1.24675 Canadian dollars, down from 1.25275.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $348.75 a troy ounce, from $347.45 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $348.70, from $348.50 bid late Tuesday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.46 to close at a bid $349.09.

HEADLINE: The Russian Art World Is Feeling The Troubles of Its Country

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
Two weeks before the 800 artworks in the "Great Utopia" show at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum were to be shipped from Moscow, the Government's Ministry of Culture was dissolved. Russian museum officials said that almost put an end to the show, which is composed of works of the Russian and Soviet avant-garde from 1915 to 1932 drawn from 72 institutions throughout the former Soviet Union.
Eventually, the museums delivered the works on their own, without the expected financial support from a central Government, and the show opened on schedule in Manhattan on Friday. But many of the regional museums participating in the show had received more lucrative offers from other nations for the loan of their holdings and threatened to pull out.
 
Where Chaos Prevails
 
 "I had to go to one museum and kidnap the paintings to get them here," said a Russian museum official who came to New York for the opening of the show. "I got three huge crates on the plane by stating that they were my hand luggage."
Getting art from Russia to New York is only a small part of the problems faced by museum officials in Russia these days. A number of them have been in town for the opening Guggenheim show, and most had stories of their own about the troubles, and occasionally the chaos, which now beset their world.
"We still have party functionaries who know nothing about art serving as the directors of some provincial museums," said one museum official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "In some cases, these museums have very valuable holdings, things that were sent to them from St. Petersburg and Moscow in the 1920's in order to hide them. The directors don't know what they have, and they don't know how to raise money to take care of what they have. In some instances, you could say there is chaos."
Anetta Bass, who served for 30 years as director of the State Art Museum, in Kuibyshev, on the left bank of the Volga, and is now the deputy director in charge of research, was defensive about this claim, as were several of her colleagues. "Our museum world is not chaotic," she said. "The chaos is elsewhere, in the economy. For 60 years when nobody was allowed to see these treasures, we kept them in good condition, and now, we are able to show them."
Miss Bass, who wears a look of perpetual defiance, said she had just been hired at the museum in Kuibyshev, a few months before Stalin's death in 1953 when she was ordered to destroy all avant-garde works in the the museum's collection. "I managed to preserve them," she said. "If I had been caught, it would have meant jail or worse."
Economic woes are worse than bureaucratic difficulties. As the chief of the All-Russian Artistic Production Association, which supervises all international exhibitions participated in by Russian museums, Zelfira Tregulova is among the most influential offials in the Russian art world. Yet until a few weeks ago, when she received a raise, Miss Tregulova said her monthly salary of 1,600 rubles, about a third of the average Russian wage, would last her only two weeks. Even at that, she said, she was doing much better than most of her colleagues because she holds a Ph.D. and has a relatively high administrative post. Asked how she made ends meet, she rolled her eyes and said: "Translations. Anything I can get."
Vladimir A. Gusev, the dour-faced director of the State Russian Museum of St. Petersburg, declared without amusement that "disasterous economic developments, especially inflation" are "forcing me to become a capitalist." Thus, his institution is the first of the major museums in Russia to have opened what is a fixture in virtually every American museum: a gift shop.
Furthermore, he said, an object of his visit to New York had been to meet with his counterparts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to arrange the production and sale of copies of old Russian porcelain. "This can provide us with tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars," he said.
Mr. Gusev also expressed concern that in the present economic turmoil, in which runaway inflation has hurt the well-to-do no less than wage-earners, privately held artworks are leaving the country at an uncontrollable rate.
"I don't mean the legitimate art market, which developed about four years ago when Sotheby's opened an office in Moscow," he said. "I mean that when the Iron Curtain fell, illegal exports increased greatly."
Although he said he was unable to cite specific examples, Mr. Gusev said that much of the Russian art now being sold abroad are masterworks that in normal times might be expected to be donated or bequeathed -- or sold -- to Russian museums.
Several of the Russian officials interviewed insisted their world was not without its lighter moments. Inna Balakhovskaya, who works in the All-Russian Artistic Production Association, said it took high-powered persuasion before she was permitted to include a huge birdlike construction by Vladimir Tatlin in the "Utopia" show.
Tatlin's visionary sculpture, created from 1928 to 1932, was being kept at in an aircraft museum about 80 miles outside Moscow. It took six visits, Miss Balakhovskaya said, to convince the authorities that the construction, now suspended from the Guggenheim's ceiling, was a visionary work of art rather than a highly classified space vehicle.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Archbishop Asks for Film Guidelines

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Sept. 30

 BODY:
In an unusual 40-page pastoral letter, Roger Cardinal Mahony, the Archbishop of Los Angeles, challenged the entertainment industry today to adopt general guidelines for the depiction of violence, sex, family life and the treatment of women.
Implicitly criticizing the movie industry for an avalanche of films that "pander to baser instincts," Cardinal Mahony, who leads the largest archdiocese in the nation, with 3.5 million Catholics, went out of his way to insist that he rejected censorship or a return to the kind of production code, specifically governing how film makers deal with sex and other issues, that dominated the movie industry for decades. 
 Instead, the 56-year-old Hollywood-born cleric said the movie industry should voluntarily arrive at a way to assume its social and artistic responsibilities. In doing so, film executives should adhere to "general criteria" on such subjects as sex and violence, he said.
"The golden rule applies here," said Cardinal Mahony. "Responsible film makers will not do to their audiences what they would not want done to themselves -- or to their own teen-age sons or daughters."
There was no advance notice of the contents of Cardinal Mahony's message, but the reaction of a number of people in the film industry was one of relief that the message was not marked by more drastic proposals. Cardinal Mahony has a reputation for outspokenness, controversy and activism. And in the wake of recent comments about "family values" by Vice President Dan Quayle and other Republicans, the movie industry has been especially edgy.
By midday today, most studio chiefs had not yet received Cardinal Mahony's letter. But Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, the industry's lobbying group, received an early copy, and commented: "What the Cardinal said is wise, reasonable and thoughtful. He's not calling for a censorship board. What he wants to do is lift the level of quality in motion pictures. Who can argue with that?"
Other executives said privately, however, that while Cardinal Mahony's points might be instructive, they could not be expected to have a major impact on an industry driven by a need for blockbuster hits.
Specifically, Cardinal Mahony said that movie makers should adhere to "specific criteria" in certain subjects. In dealing with a movie's portrayal of women, for example, he asked: "How are the women in the story portrayed? Are they persons possessing the same intrinsic dignity as their male counterparts and, at the deepest level, facing the same soul wrenching challenges to grow and become aware. Is the unique vocation of motherhood given its proper due? Are the agonizing pressures and tensions of working mothers, especially those who must educate, nurture, and support their children, alone explored with sensitivity, candor and compassion?"
In dealing with sexuality, he asked the film industry to ask itself: "Does the picture convey the beauty of authentic sexuality, or does it demean this very important part of being human? Would you want your teen-age children to see this picture? How about their friends?"
On the issue of violence, Cardinal Mahony asks: "Is the violence demanded by the story? Is it presented as a desirable way to solve problems and resolve conflict? Is it presented honestly? Do we see the cowardice at the heart of it? Do we feel the pain and dehumanization it causes to the person on the receiving end, and to the person who engages in it?"
Although Cardinal Mahony said his message was also designed to cover the television industry, the bulk of his comments were directed at the movie business. The Cardinal said he would commit Catholic educational institutions in Los Angeles, the two Archdiocesan newspapers, the National Catholic News Service and the full resources of the Archdiocese to making the effort a priority.
 
A Papal Address
 Aides to Cardinal Mahony said that the pastoral letter was begun five months ago and was unrelated to the "family values" debate that has simmered in the Presidential campaign. The Cardinal issued the letter, they said, to observe the fifth anniversary of the address given by Pope John Paul II to leaders of the entertainment industry in Los Angeles. In that address, the Pope urged Hollywood to use its immense power to "enrich the whole of the human community."
During his seven years as archbishop of Los Angeles, Cardinal Mahony has been an outspoken, energetic and ideologically unpredictable figure. Bill Rivera, his spokesman at the Archdiocese, described him as a liberal on social activism issues and right of center on theological matters.
The leadership of the film community -- with whom he periodically meets -- was startled last February when Cardinal Mahony appeared to support a "decency code," proposed by a fundamentalist group, that would forbid such things as suggestive dancing and lustful kissing. But Cardinal Mahony's associates said his comments had been misinterpreted, and he later said that he opposed a code.
Cardinal Mahony insisted today that the "human values" he seeks in films were hardly controversial. "The criteria I articulate here, and the values that underlie them, are the exclusive property of no one religious community, ethnic grouping, educational level, economic class or political party," he said. "Certainly the Catholic Church has no monopoly on them."

Woodpecker's Brain Survives, but Will Humans'?

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:

The Diversity of Life
By Edward O. Wilson
Illustrated. 424 pages. Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. $29.95.
In many respects, Edward O. Wilson's important new book, "The Diversity of Life," is a celebration of the miracle of evolution and the astonishing inventiveness of natural selection. You suspect that he's building a case to show how little we know of the environment's complexity and how recklessly we are spending the abundance of nature's storehouse. 
 Still, you want to concentrate on the wonders that Mr. Wilson unfolds. There is, for example, his account of why the acorn woodpecker of California keeps its brain intact despite hitting wood with its bill at 20 to 25 kilometers an hour (12 to 15 miles an hour), "whereupon it instantaneously decelerates at 1,000G, where 1G is the acceleration needed to counteract earth's gravity and 4G is what an astronaut experiences on liftoff." The woodpecker survives because its brain case acts as a shock absorber and because its body moves in a single plane like a metronome, avoiding rotational forces that would tear its brain loose from its moorings.
There's his description of how spiders travel through the air by spinning out web filaments long enough to be picked up and carried by the wind like a balloon. And there's his tribute to the evolutionary diversity of sharks, which range from the magnificent great white to the little cookie-cutter, which "thrusts its maw into the bodies of its victims and twists to slice out five-centimeter-wide conical plugs of skin and flesh." In other words, a two-inch cookie.
But then about halfway through "The Diversity of Life," you come to a chart that traces the full geological history of life from four billion years ago to the present. At intervals along a horizontal line there appear little lightning bolts to designate when "biodiversity was sharply reduced by the great extinction spasms." There are six of these in all. The first, for example, appears 450 million years ago at the dividing line between the Ordovician Period and the Silurian. The fifth marks the cataclysmic end of the Age of Reptiles, some 65 million years ago. But here's the shocker: The last lightning bolt appears just to the right of zero years ago, or a few decades from now. We are coming up on the sixth "major extinction spasm" in the history of life on earth.
This casts a considerable pall over the story Mr. Wilson is telling. The more you think about it, the more you realize that even the good news is bad. For instance, the good news is that the struggle to protect elephants or whales is not merely about saving these charismatic creatures but rather about preserving the infinitely complex habitats of which such animals are only the most manifest glories. Yet if commercial interests are reluctant to hold back for spotted owls, why should they worry about subterranean worms or microscopic ticks?
Moreover, the ethical dilemmas portended by this book are depressing. Where it comes to the conflicting needs of a starving Ecuadorean peasant and a rapidly diminishing rain forest, who in good conscience can ask the peasant to lie down and die for the sake of genetic diversity he can only be aware of in the abstract?
As it turns out, this book does deliver much grim information. A pioneer in the field of biodiversity studies and the author of such works as "Sociobiology," "On Human Nature," "The Insect Societies" and "Biophilia," Mr. Wilson celebrates the complexity of evolution precisely to emphasize the extent of the catastrophe we face. Symmetry is everywhere in "The Diversity of Life." He stresses the interdependency of species so that he can emphasize the great extent to which severe damage to environments can ramify. He amazes us with the enormous numbers of species we have not yet identified so that he can shock us with the unknown amounts of life that may be on the way to extinction.
His bottom line is that by the roughest estimate there may be tens of millions of species now alive on the earth, of which only about 1.4 million, at most 10 percent, are known. "A 20 percent extinction in total global diversity, with all habitats incorporated, is a strong possibility if the present rate of environmental destruction continues," he concludes.
Moreover, he drives home dramatically why people can't afford such a loss. To judge from experience, there are hidden riches in unknown species that could provide us with everything from miracle medicines to hardier food. It took 10 million to 100 million years to recover from previous natural devastations of the planet. Most important, perhaps, we don't really know enough about our nature as humans to judge what subtle but devastating effects such losses might have on our psyches. We are more deeply rooted in nature than we realize, and we break free at our peril.
Yet surprisingly, Mr. Wilson's book has cause for hope, too. There is evidence that ecosystems like the rain forests can be profitably used without harming them. As he concludes, "The race is on to develop methods, to draw more income from the wildlands without killing them, and so to give the invisible hand of free-market economics a green thumb."
He offers a point-by-point program for change and makes it sound as if the world were far more aware of what must be done to preserve biodiversity than headlines about elephants and wolves and spotted owls make it sound. He refers to the growing conflict between human population growth and the needs of the environment not as an apocalypse but as a "bottleneck." He writes as if we can pass through it.
So despite all the pessimism in "The Diversity of Life," its virtue is not that it frightens but that it educates. It broadens our understanding of what Darwin revealed. It hints that even if humans weren't created by the hand of God, they may yet prove to be a blessing upon the earth.

HEADLINE: ON HORSE RACING;
A Day at the Track With the Governor

BYLINE: By Joseph Durso

 BODY:
Mario M. Cuomo sat high over the finish line at Belmont Park yesterday and said, yes, he knew that people portrayed him as a Governor who resented and maybe even suspected horse racing, and he peered back a half a century for reasons.
"My impressions of racing," he said, "were the same as anybody who was raised in a neighborhood like mine: very poor. My father owned a grocery store in Queens and he gave credit to people, and he resented it when people didn't pay him but they did go to the bookmaker and pay him. The best-dressed guy in the neighborhood was the bookmaker." 
 He paused, and concluded: "But everybody wants to get rich and I have no negative feelings or moral reservations about racing or gambling. People will be betting on racing forever."
The state, counting on it, tapped into the business of betting a long time ago. It authorized parimutuel betting at the race track half a century ago and nudged the well-dressed bookmaker off the street corner. And 20 years ago, it took over the street corner with the Offtrack Betting shop. So, betting now is not only legal but also patriotic.
Also, maddening. The bettor finds it maddening when he surrenders 17 cents of every dollar won -- it's called the takeout -- and 5 cents goes to the state, the rest to the tracks. But the tracks find it maddening, too, because people are also being induced to spend their money on casino gambling, lotteries, video poker and endless other games of chance. The state finds it maddening because it needs more money from racing than it's getting.
The situation grew even more maddening last spring when Cuomo got into a hassle with the New York Racing Association, the nonprofit agency that is enfranchised by the state to run Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga race tracks until the year 2,000. The Governor needed $50 million to fill holes in his state budget, and wanted to get it by inducing N.Y.R.A. to sell a parking lot at Aqueduct to the Port Authority for use by Kennedy Airport. The association would then be required to turn over the profit to the state.
The association resisted until the Governor went to the whip. He threatened to investigate N.Y.R.A. and the renewal of its charter and even to pack its board of trustees with his own appointees. He also named a nine-member board of inquiry with a far-reaching title: the Commission on Racing in the 21st Century. Peace promptly broke out.
Still, Cuomo did not visit a race track for nine years until last Aug. 22, when he unexpectedly arrived at Saratoga Race Course on the afternoon of the $1 million Travers Stakes. The race was obligingly won by the only New York-bred horse in the field, Thunder Rumble.
His second visit was made yesterday, when he appeared at Belmont Park in the morning a couple of hours before the first race and headed for the press box. He was flanked by two of his racing deputies: Vincent Tese, the state's Director of Economic Development and chairman of the new commission, and Steven Richman, a veteran of the state's Racing and Wagering Board, who will work as executive director of the commission.
"We want to make racing better," the Governor said, explaining his recent sorties to the tracks. "We're not going to change the face of racing overnight. We want to give people more joy."
"And," he added, without lingering on joy, "give the state more money."
"There's a tremendous potential in racing," he said, "if only because the problems are so obvious. Like OTB. Should we sell OTB? Generally speaking, I don't think it's being run very efficiently. What should we do about the takeout? When I was at Saratoga, I couldn't walk two steps without being swamped with questions and complaints. Mostly, what are you going to do about the takeout?
"It's like the takeout insults them. They don't understand the economics of racing, where the money comes from, where it goes. But they resent the takeout. That's one of the main things the commission will look into."
He was asked how his past confrontations with N.Y.R.A. had evolved into his swoops into racing in the new era of goodwill, and he sprang to answer.
"Of course, I was confrontational with the New York Racing Association," he said. "I had to tell them that you are here for the 18 million people of the state. You are not like Morgan Stanley or I.B.M. You are a public organization, and is that the way to do it? We put in a bill to change it, but dropped it after we began to work better with N.Y.R.A.
"I've had the same struggle with the Port Authority. They're a government itself. They have an air force. They get paid more than we do."
"But," he added, without breaking stride, "I would rather conciliate than confront. Don't forget, I also had a confrontation with Bill Clinton."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
A Little TLC for Mexico

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
Topic A here is the just-completed freer trade pact among Mexico, Canada and the U.S. Almost daily, newspapers splash the story on their front pages using the initials "TLC." This stands for "el Tratado de Libre Comercio." It does not stand for "Tender Loving Care," though Mexico needs a little of that from a U.S. that either ignores the treaty entirely or turns it into a campaign football.
Mexicans, it seems, follow every whiff of news about the issue with the attention Americans usually reserve for serial killers. "Perhaps it is because we take you more seriously than you take yourselves," said a senior government official. 
 Mexico, at least, deserves to be taken seriously. It is run, literally, by a powerhouse elite that has transformed the economy into the 13th-largest in the world, albeit only one-25th the size of America's. Mexico is America's third-biggest trading partner, ranking behind Canada and Japan and before Germany and Britain. The U.S. will export over $40 billion to Mexico this year, triple the exports in 1986. Much of this results from the ruling party's historic decision to abandon its insular past and take up free-marketeering.
President Bush has treated Mexico more seriously than perhaps any of his predecessors. Mexicans love him for this. They are worried about Bill Clinton.
The Democratic contender favors freer trade, but says he will withhold judgment on the treaty until he studies it. Democratic emissaries, authorized and otherwise, have come here to tell President Carlos Salinas and his aides not to worry. They have reassured Mexicans that the pact would sail through a potentially wary Congress even more quickly with Mr. Clinton than with Mr. Bush because Democratic legislators will better heed a Democratic President.
Mr. Salinas knows America well, so was not too reassured. He reportedly asked Mr. Bush not to keep making the treaty a Republican issue. But he agreed to a photo op next week with Mr. Bush and Prime Minister Mulroney of Canada. Mr. Clinton needed no convincing about cooling the issue; if he discusses it, he looks either protectionist or anti-labor.
But Mr. Salinas seems to be signaling another message to Mr. Clinton: Don't dig yourself into a deeper hole on the matter, so we can iron out problems later. A close aide to Mr. Salinas told me, "Notice Salinas himself never said publicly he would not renegotiate the text." The aide hastened to add that the sections on trade could not be touched, but that Mr. Salinas might be able to accommodate a President Clinton's political needs by modifying labor and environmental passages -- or by dealing with these controversial issues outside the treaty itself.
All this done, the Salinas propaganda machine -- as formidable and disciplined as China's -- put out a new line. The trade pact, it said, could and should be one of Mr. Clinton's first foreign policy initiatives. It is just sitting there, promising a net increase in U.S. jobs, ready to be set in motion with great fanfare. "A natural," one top economic aide called it.
These are clever, upbeat words that mask deep concern. Mexican leaders cannot afford doubt or delay on the treaty. Foreign investment in Mexico would trail off quickly. Mexico badly requires that money to finance social programs and economic growth, already slowing down.
The seldom-spoken truth here is that Mexico has much more at stake in this treaty than the U.S. For America, the pact would mildly accelerate present trends in trade growth and certain job losses in manufacturing. It would also help democratize and steady an increasingly important neighbor.
For Mr. Salinas and his ruling party, power and policy are at some risk. They stand to gain hundreds of thousands of jobs. But by opening up their country, they could also unleash American pressures -- for democratization, higher wages and more spending to clean up pollution -- beyond their capacity to manage.
Troubles with the treaty will not cause Mr. Salinas to turn back. He has already gone far to reverse Mexico's protectionist, state-run economy and historical antipathy toward the U.S., and to turn Mexico into a modern nation -- goals long desired by Washington. The U.S. elephant has no good reason to carelessly make his task harder.

HEADLINE: Clues to the Crash of the Job Market

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Almost 30 years ago a diverse group of concerned citizens sent a report to President Johnson titled "The Triple Revolution," predicting a cybernetic revolution in which computers would eliminate jobs and create a "human slag heap of tens of millions of Americans who do not have the skills to compete in a computerized society." 
 The age of the computer is indeed here and many workers now have been replaced by them, including well-paid middle managers whose jobs have disappeared for good. We have underestimated the impact of this revolution and apparently now are able to eliminate more jobs than we can create.
One of the remedies widely advocated is retraining of the unemployed, but almost nothing is said for what purpose. We need to know more precisely what products are to be made or services performed before we can provide useful training. Otherwise the prescription is without direction, leaving a still-unsolved problem.
Research and development is the key to meaningful job creation. As has been demonstrated many times in the past, research leads to new products, new companies, and new industries. Our spending on domestic research and development has been declining for many reasons -- certainly obsession with short-term results leads to a sacrifice of research expenditures. Changes in tax policies could provide added incentives to research and development.
Finally, the problem of capital formation needs to be addressed. We discourage savings as a source of capital and encourage debt as a tax-deductible item in cases where nothing is created except a transfer of ownership in corporate takeovers, leaving the surviving companies drowning in debt.

Companies' New Securities Balloon to Record Amount

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The rush by corporate America to raise money from the public continued at a breakneck pace in the third quarter, as companies issued a record amount of securities. For Wall Street, that translated into an unsurpassed payday as investment firms raked in record fees.
Corporations issued $224.7 billion in debt and equity securities in the three-month period ended yesterday, up 50.2 percent from the $149.7 billion in offerings that hit the market in the third quarter of 1991, according to the Securities Data Company. That amount also solidly broke the record of $212.9 billion in securities that were issued in the second quarter of this year. 
 With those results, 1992 will be without question the best year ever for underwritings. For the first nine months of 1992, corporations have issued $667 billion in securities, which is $77 billion more than was issued in all of the record year of 1991, according to Securities Data.
The flurry of financings has been generated by low interest rates and relatively strong equity markets. The low rates have pushed many corporations to refinance their debt in order to lower their costs, even as institutional and retail investors in search of yields have turned to the public marketplace in greater numbers to make investments.
"The demand has been pretty much across the board in terms of types of issuers," said Grant Kvalheim, head of the capital markets desk at Merrill Lynch & Company.
The heavy business has proved a boon for Wall Street. Firms earned an unprecedented $5.1 billion in the first nine months of the year, according to Securities Data, already surpassing the $5 billion in fees for all of 1991. Merrill Lynch alone has earned more than $1 billion in fees.
Underwriters said that the flurry of initial public offerings grew more tepid in the third quarter, as an increasing number of institutional investors became more price sensitive and selective. But, they said, investors have turned increasingly to yield-oriented products, such as convertible securities.
Merrill Lynch, the perennial leader in underwriting, again captured the top spot, with $37.8 billion in securities during the quarter for 16.8 percent of the market.

Computervision Stock Plummets on Forecast

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
Just six weeks after making its initial public stock offering, the Computervision Corporation watched Wall Street hammer that stock yesterday, after the company announced that results for its third fiscal quarter would be "substantially below" expectations.
Computervision's shares lost more than 30 percent of their value yesterday, falling $3 each to close at $6.25 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
 The company, formerly known as Prime Computer Inc., had already been predicting an unspecified loss for the quarter. It gave no details yesterday as to how much worse the final numbers might be.
"The decline was more than we expected," Harvey Wagner, Computervision's chief executive officer, said, adding that the company could not be more specific until it finished sifting through its data.
Mr. Wagner said the unexpectedly disappointing results for the quarter, which ended Sunday, were based on worldwide economic conditions in both Europe, where the company conducts 70 percent of its business, and the United States. He said recent turmoil in Europe over interest rates and currencies "tended to freeze customer spending."
Computervision is among the leading suppliers of computer-aided-design software, which manufacturing companies use in designing products. This past summer the company divested itself of its computer hardware business and changed its name from Prime Computer. On Aug. 14 it filed an initial public offering in a complicated financial deal intended to drastically reduce the company's huge debt.
Twenty-five million shares were sold at $12 a share, raising $300 million, along with another $300 million in debt issues. The $600 million was used to pay down long-term debt, and management hoped to set the new organization on a path to profitability.
Computervision's president and chief executive, John J. Shields, spoke to analysts today about the surprise announcement. Robert Herwick, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, said Mr. Shields attributed the unexpected revenue shortfall to the currency crisis in Europe and to the distractions of top executives in July and August as they prepared for the stock offering.
"The deviation in the plan occurred primarily in the last two weeks of September in Europe," Mr. Herwick said. "The recent confusion about currency translations and interest rates froze the buying process in the U.K. and Italy, where they had high hopes for orders.
"And the financing situation took senior management away from managing the sales and marketing process. Rather than holding weekly reviews of sales cycles, that fell to every other week. So in the month of July, management of sales and marketing was not all it should have been."
Mr. Wagner said Computervision would not know the official quarterly results for some time. But Mr. Herwick estimated that revenues would be down 20 percent from the comparable quarter a year earlier, when sales were $280 million. He added that operating income would probably be positive, although down from the $10 million in the corresponding quarter last year.
Mr. Wagner insisted that when Computervision made its stock offering the company had no indication of the depth of the sales downturn. "It was as much a surprise to us as to anyone," he said. He said Computervision was well positioned to move toward profitability, with "new state-of-the-art products, new distribution channels and a very respectable balance sheet."
Some analysts, however, believe Computervision's problems run deeper than current economic adversity.
Peter Schleider, a partner with Wessels, Arnold & Henderson in Minneapolis, said Computervision "has totally blown the pricing model," charging customers too much for its software.
He said a competitor, Parametric Technology Inc. of Waltham, Mass. "is eating their lunch" by offering better software for $15,000 to $22,000.

HEADLINE: Can This Guy Be Serious?

BYLINE: By Stefan Kanfer; Stefan Kanfer is drama critic of The New Leader and contributes to Time.

 BODY:
Hello, you people, this is Rush Limbaugh, the man George Bush came to visit last week. Why? Because I stand for what he stands for. Me. I. Rush Limbaugh, the talk show host who bills himself as "The Epitome of Morality and Virtue, With Talent on Loan From God." Rush Limbaugh, whose love affair with the mirror and the mike has attracted more than 500 radio stations.
And now there's even more of me, folks, available on shelves across the fruited plain. You know how I boast about taking on the liberals with half my brain tied behind my back? Well, that's the half responsible for the wit in my new book "The Way Things Ought To Be." This week it heads The New York Times best-seller list. 
 Some folks -- the jealous art and croissant crowd -- say it's because I tirelessly plug the thing on my radio show three hours a day, five days a week. But the President and I know it's because people want to read what I write. Well, not exactly write. I kind of talked it to a guy with a tape recorder. And he kind of stitched it together. Charles Dickens and Leo Tolstoy would have done the same thing if they were alive today.
The book is for people like you, folks who don't flip to another station when I go "dadalup, dadalup, dadalup" until I can think of something to say. Where was I? I. Myself. Mine. Dadalup, dadalup, dadalup. (In my tome this is defined as an "attempt to approximate the stirring sound of a trumpet fanfare and alert listeners that something important is coming.") Ah, yes, I remember what I was talking about. My book. By me. I.
It's neoconbabble, purist Limbaughlderdash, a fresh entry in the great tradition of nonsense literature. Not since Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear assumed room temperature (my way of saying they're deceased), etc. No wonder George Bush chose to air his views on my show. Dadalup, dadalup, dadalup. . .
Who could resist this sample from page 39: "The poor and the lower classes in this country have gotten a free ride since the Great Depression when it became noble to be poor. Look how we treat the homeless: We celebrate them, make romantic figures out of them. We make movies about them and teach them how to dine in dumpsters."
How about this on animal rights: "Our laws do not prevent us from killing for food and sport, so the right to life of an animal is nonexistent."
Here I am on ecology: "The earth is a remarkable creation and is capable of great rejuvenation. We can't destroy it. It can fix itself."
And how's this for keen political analysis: "The Republican Party should buy Buchanan two Cadillacs so that he can get rid of his Mercedes as thanks for dispatching Duke to the ash heap of irrelevance."
Can this guy be serious? America is asking. Indeed I am, my friends. But these sound bites -- as brilliant as they are -- don't even begin to tap my other side: I'm also a subtle and tasteful satirist. Take my commercial for Feminazi Trading Cards: "On the front, an action shot of a leading feminist burning a bra, dominating a TV show, picketing an all-men's club. On the back, all the vital statistics: waist, hips, the documented age, the number of abortions and, where applicable, the alimony payments and divorce settlements."
On Eastern Europe: "The Stone Age would be a giant leap forward for most Russians."
On liberals: "They are the past. We conservatives are the future." Dadalup, dadalup, dadalup. Folks, I could burble on like this forever. Maybe I will. After all, 12 million listeners can't be wrong, especially when two of them are William Buckley and Col. Oliver North. (Bill says my show is "like a jolt of champagne," and Ollie believes that "Rush has captured the sense of average Americans.") Besides, there's deeper purpose to all that we neocons do and say.
If I may quote myself -- and if I don't, who will? -- "The American economy cannot be revived without someone getting rich.
"Why not me?"

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Overview;
PEROT RE-ENTERS THE CAMPAIGN, SAYING BUSH AND CLINTON FAIL TO ADDRESS GOVERNMENT 'MESS'

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Ross Perot jumped back into the race for the Presidency today, instantly creating new risks, opportunities and uncertainties for Gov. Bill Clinton and President Bush in the final 33 days before Election Day.
Mr. Perot, who bolted from the race in July, asserted he was reactivating his independent campaign at the plea of his supporters. "I thought that both political parties would address the problems that face the nation," he said. "We gave them a chance. They didn't do it." 
 Despite new polls showing his support vastly diminished, Mr. Perot dismissed the notion that he could function only as a spoiler or that he was motivated by animosity toward Mr. Bush.
 
Playing FamiliarThemes
 He presented his candidacy as a de facto nomination from the grass roots, declaring: "I would like to thank the American people. By choosing me as your candidate, you have given me the highest honor I could ever receive." [Excerpts from the news conference, page A20.]
With his running mate, retired Vice Adm. James B. Stockdale, at his side, Mr. Perot struck many of the same themes that he rode to sudden political prominence last spring, assailing a "Government in gridlock" that has let the deficit and other critical national needs go unresolved.
"The American people are good," he said, "but they have a Government that is a mess. Everybody in Washington makes excuses. Nobody takes responsibility even when they have direct responsibility."
 
Slapping at News Media
 The Perot camp declared that it expected Mr. Perot to be included in upcoming Presidential debates, and both Bush and Clinton campaigns said they were willing to do so. Negotiators said tonight that they had reached a tentative agreement on the debates. Officials close to the negotiations said there would be three debates, with the first one on Oct. 11. [Page A18.]
In a remarkably combative news conference for an announcement day, Mr. Perot, a Texas billionaire, also lambasted the news media for investigating his past and his political practices and asserted that he would keep his campaign focused solely on the issues he wanted to highlight.
"I don't care what you do," he told the reporters present. "Just have fun, get raises and bonuses, play gotcha. I don't care. I care about this country, I care about the American people, and I love them, and I will do whatever I can to serve them."
Strategists in the Bush and Clinton campaigns were quick to say that Mr. Perot would not be the formidable presence he was last spring, when he briefly shot to the head of the pack after a campaign waged largely on television talk shows. They predicted that Mr. Perot's candidacy would fare much as other recent third-party candidates have fared, pulling a vote percentage in the teens or single digits.
But they acknowledged that, in a close race, Mr. Perot would be an important variable in some of the most important states, like California and Texas, perhaps even tilting a state to one candidate or the other. Moreover, it was clear that Mr. Perot would affect the tone and the dynamic of the dialogue.
Mr. Perot, whose personal fortune has fueled the petition drive that has placed his name on the ballot in all 50 states, is expected to wage a campaign heavily oriented toward television. "I think you will see a heavy emphasis on the media, television," said Orson Swindle, head of United We Stand, America, the Perot organization. "You will see issues discussed in a way you have not seen in the past."
Unlike the campaigns of the two major party candidates, Mr. Perot's will not be publicly financed.
A new poll for CNN and USA Today suggested that Mr. Perot faced a skeptical and largely unfriendly public for his revived campaign. The poll, conducted Monday through Wednesday by The Gallup Organization, found that 60 percent of the 1,052 registered voters polled said Mr. Perot should not re-enter the race, while 33 percent said he should. In contrast, the Gallup Poll found in late June that 69 percent of those asked wanted Mr. Perot to be a Presidential candidate.
The CNN/USA Today poll also showed Mr. Clinton with a formidable lead, 52 percent, as against 35 percent for Mr. Bush and 7 percent for Mr. Perot. It had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
In his speech today, Mr. Perot apologized to his supporters for leaving the race this summer and hinted that after months of being portrayed as a temperamental quitter, he wanted to begin anew. "My decision in July hurt you," he said. "I apologize."
Then he added, "Looking back won't solve our problems. Looking forward, working together, we can fix anything."
Responding to Mr. Perot's re-entry, Mr. Clinton said in Wisconsin, "My fight is with George Bush, and I'm going to take it to him." The Governor said he still believed he had the best economic plan in the campaign and argued that Mr. Perot's re-entry would have little effect on the way he ran his race.
"The problem I have with the Perot plan," Mr. Clinton said in a interview with a television station in Cincinnati, "is that it puts deficit reduction ahead of generating jobs."
The Bush and Clinton campaigns today remained locked in negotiations over debates, with a main sticking point the Bush team's desire for a late debate, on the Sunday before Election Day, and the Clinton campaign's resistance to one. Should Mr. Bush succeed in tightening the race, a late debate would give the President a final chance to project a reassuring presence and make his case to the public..
Mr. Bush took a day off the campaign trail today but escalated his advertising offensive with a new attack on Mr. Clinton as a risky and dangerous taxer. "You can't trust Clinton economics," an announcer says in the new commercial, which focuses on five Americans and the additional taxes they would supposedly pay under a Clinton Administration. "It's wrong for you. It's wrong for America."
The Clinton campaign reacted to the commercial quickly and forcefully. "It is blatantly false, and nobody else in the world claims that," Mr. Clinton declared. "George Bush has said time and again that he would say whatever it takes to be elected President, and this is an example."
The Democrats, for their part, were broadcasting a new commercial that resurrects the broken campaign promise from 1988 that haunted Mr. Bush in the primaries this year: "Read my lips: no new taxes."
Both campaigns have treaded carefully around Mr. Perot in recent days, but Senator Al Gore, the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee, hinted at the contrast the Democrats would draw on economics. Campaigning in Wisconsin today, Mr. Gore said Democrats shared Mr. Perot's concern for the reducing the deficit, but the Tennessee Senator added: "He raises taxes on middle-income people in a way that we think is very unwise. We stimulate economic growth."
 
Reporting a Different Perot
 Stan Greenberg, the poll taker for Mr. Clinton, asserted today that the Clinton campaign's polls showed Mr. Perot slipping throughout the week. He also argued that Perot II was drawing a very different -- and more Republican -- constituency than Perot I was last spring.
"He was drawing the shake-up-politics voters last spring," Mr. Greenberg said. "Now he's drawing support from voters who want to get spending under control. And that's a very different share of the electorate."
But the Bush forces continued to hope that Mr. Perot succeeded in shaking up the race and perhaps opening up some states where Mr. Clinton has a formidable lead.
"We welcome him to the race," said Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign. "He says he wants to talk about the economy and the deficit, and we welcome that."
In general, Mr. Perot's entry is seen as a risk and an opportunity for both Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton. He poses a problem for Mr. Bush in Texas, a must-win state for the President, for example, but he could cut into Mr. Clinton's support in California and some Northern states like Michigan.
Perhaps foreshadowing an appeal to keep anti-Bush voters from straying, Mr. Clinton said in an interview with a Raleigh, N.C., television station: "I hope that it won't divide the vote of those who know that Mr. Bush should not be given another term."
In his announcement today, Mr. Perot did not go into the details of the economic plan he issued after he left the race on July 16, when he said he did not want to be a disruptive force.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: News Analysis;
A Tremor Now, Not a Groundswell

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Ross Perot shook the scaffolding of American politics by re-entering the Presidential race today, but it was only an aftershock compared with the major earthquakes he caused earlier this year.
No one knows for sure from whom he is likely to take more votes, or how many, and the campaign staffs of President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton are both more apprehensive than they let on; their almost fawning eagerness to send delegations to appeal for his support early this week is proof of that. 
 In certain circumstances, Mr. Perot could alter the dynamics of the race, particularly if he takes part in television debates and manages to prevent Mr. Clinton or Mr. Bush or both from scoring with viewers. That could prompt many voters to ponder anew their views of all three candidates.
If the race between the two major-party nominees tightens, he could tip the balance by throwing large, vital states to one or the other.
 
Doubts About Credibility
 But Mr. Perot no longer commands anything approaching the support that he commanded early this summer, when for a time he led Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton alike in some polls. His abrupt and ill-explained departure from the contest in July, for which he apologized at his news conference here today, cost him not only volunteers but also a good deal of his credibility.
It is also much later in the game. Most voters have made up their minds, however tentatively, and Mr. Perot has only 33 days to persuade them to give him a second chance.
He spoke of a long, hard slog to restore a nation whose political process and government he described as messes. He said that it would take sacrifice on everyone's part to rebuild what he termed an educational system, an industrial base and a health-care network in disastrous decline. Some still see him as a potential savior, but many more, to judge from talks with voters around the country in recent weeks, doubt his staying power.
Perhaps, with the help of the sort of television blitz that his millions of dollars put easily within his reach, Mr. Perot can once again make himself seem an attractive alternative to a pair of major-party candidates with substantial, well-advertised electoral liabilities themselves.
He retains valuable political assets, notably the American fascination with billionaires who thrust themselves into the spotlight, especially self-made ones. Moreover, even though he has said little lately about how he would change things, he has unquestionably touched a nerve with his constant insistence that Washington has failed to come to grips with dire problems.
Yet serious questions remain about how the public will react to further exposure to Mr. Perot's prickly personality -- to his thin-skinned reaction to criticism of any kind, his resentment of any inquiry into his family or his past personal or business conduct, and his inexperience in the give-and-take of government, to say nothing of his innocence of the details of domestic and foreign policy.
Edward J. Rollins, the political consultant who managed the Perot candidacy for a time, has written that the candidate lacks the temperament needed in a President. He left the campaign early. But a similar judgment came today from John P. White, who stayed on to draft an economic plan and returned only yesterday to his job at the Eastman Kodak Company.
Mr. Perot's imperious instincts showed through when he announced this afternoon what kinds of questions he would answer and what kinds he would not, which is something corporate bosses can get away with but political candidates cannot. A man famous hereabouts for an ego as big as Lyndon B. Johnson's, he showed an unawareness of how many others view him when he asserted that the American public was tired of "ego-driven, power-hungry people."
Having renounced professional managers after an unhappy experience this summer, it remains to be seen whether Mr. Perot will have the tools -- polling services, television production skills, tactical counseling -- that any candidate, especially a neophyte, needs to make the most of his appeal.
The prevailing view in the political community, which has evident biases against someone so scornful of it, is that Mr. Perot will be lucky to finish with as much as 10 percent of the vote nationally and is highly unlikely to win a single state. That kind of percentage would be in line with those of the most effective third-force candidates of recent years, former Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama in 1968 and former Representative John B. Anderson of Illinois in 1980.
A new poll for the Cable News Network by the Gallup Organization indicates some of the dimensions of the insurgent's problems, and indeed those of Mr. Bush. It gave Mr. Clinton 52 percent, Mr. Bush 35 and Mr. Perot 7. More important for the long run, it showed Mr. Perot with a 66 percent unfavorable rating, twice what it was when he pulled out in July, and it showed that only 14 percent thought his economic plan was the most promising among the three candidates.
On a state-by-state basis, it appears likely that Mr. Perot might help Mr. Clinton in Texas and Florida, two states that Mr. Bush needs to balance expected Clinton victories in California and New York, the other two Big Four electoral-college powerhouses. Mr. Bush might be helped in some close northern states, such as Ohio and Michigan, but the electoral arithmetic suggests strongly that without Florida and Texas, that would not be enough.
An exhaustive compilation of state polls by the Hotline, an electronic campaign news service, indicates that as things stand now, the Perot candidacy will have only a marginal effect and will not swing a single state.
But none of the polls yet reflects any campaigning by Mr. Perot. Nor do they take into account the President's success this week in putting Mr. Clinton on the defensive on the debate issue, at least for a day or so -- Mr. Bush's first successful strategic stroke since the Democratic convention.
The debates, whose frequency and format remain under negotiation, are almost certain to include Mr. Perot. He meets the criteria for participation set by the independent commission that has been trying to arrange the debates, and given that, any attempt to exclude him would risk making him look like a martyr, even though the commission may well not oversee the debates.
As the final phase of the campaign begins, each candidate can see different dangers looming.
For Mr. Perot, who was humiliated earlier by being branded a quitter, late reentry runs the risk of setting him down in history as an also-ran. For Mr. Clinton, the worst thing that could happen would be an interruption in his momentum, a restirring of the pot caused by the new debate about debates and the new three-way race. For Mr. Bush, the peril lies in the threat Mr. Perot could pose to the principal underpinnings of his already shaky base.

HEADLINE: Hard Times Change Many Minds

SERIES: Closing Willow Run -- Third article of a series: Taking the Anger to the Polls

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YPSILANTI, Mich., Oct. 1

 BODY:
Union officials at General Motors' Willow Run assembly plant here have long complained about growing political apathy among the rank and file. But not this year. Their plant has been scheduled for closing, and the workers blame George Bush (along with the chairman of G.M., whose selection they don't get to vote on).
Bill Clinton wasn't the union local's first choice for President (Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa was) or even its second (Edmund G. Brown Jr. from California was). But workers have been registering to vote in record numbers just so they can back the Democrat in November. 
 One new voter, 35-year-old Fred Mosley, said he would have supported President Bush a year ago. "I believed in Bush," said Mr. Mosley, who installs the rear trim on cars. "He's strong, he's military; I was in the military."
 
John Wayne or 'a Wimp'?
 Then, last spring, the auto worker believed in Ross Perot. "I was hurting over the plant closing," he said. "Perot comes out, talking all this great stuff, and I was like, 'Yeah, yeah, that's what we want.' I was looking for somebody -- John Wayne, another John F. Kennedy."
Now, Mr. Mosley said, Mr. Perot was "a wimp" for getting out of the Presidential race in July and is still a wimp. "He's just making a last-ditch attempt to save Bush," Mr. Mosley said, dismissing Mr. Perot's declaration today that he is indeed a candidate for President.
While Governor Clinton of Arkansas isn't John Wayne or John Kennedy, Mr. Mosley added, he does have one overriding plus: "He's not Bush."
Indeed, the Bush backlash among auto workers here, as well as at other plants, seems to be behind what is thought to be the first voter registration drive inside the Willow Run plant that anyone can remember.
So far, local union officials estimate that more than 300 new voters have been signed up in the last six months, including 70 in just two days last week.
"I've never seen such anger or enthusiasm, and it's not so much for Clinton as it is against Bush," said Douglas A. Fraser, the former president of the United Automobile Workers and now a professor of labor relations at Wayne State University in Detroit. "No matter how much he says the economy is getting better, he can't convince them. They know it isn't true."
Back in Michigan last week, President Bush, who carried the state in the last election, was casting himself as the champion of the auto workers, in contrast to Governor Clinton whose fuel economy standards, the President contended, would cost the state 40,000 jobs.
With Michigan considered to be one of the pivotal industrial states this year, both candidates are chasing blue-collar voters like Mr. Mosley.
At 5:30 A.M. on Wednesday, one longtime auto worker, Tony Ochab, was at the gate of the Willow Run plant with 2,400 Clinton-Gore leaflets as the first of 2,400 workers were pulling into the parking lot.
"I've never been involved with politics before," he said. "I want to make sure George hits the unemployment line before I do. I might hit it in April. He can hit it in November."
Willow Run will shut down sometime in 1993. It has about 4,000 hourly workers, although half are already on layoff. Mr. Ochab has been plotting his revenge since Feb. 24, when General Motors announced that the Chevrolet Caprice and other large cars built at Willow Run would be produced instead in Arlington, Tex. The company has declined to specify why Arlington was chosen.
Without the facts, many workers are convinced that the President from Texas had something to do with it. The President has said that he was not involved.
Arlington aside, people in this town, 30 miles west of Detroit, where there are four auto plants in a five-mile radius, say Mr. Bush has stolen their American dreams. On Friday, Laraine Drew, who has raised three children by working on the assembly line, was at the union hall, registering to vote.
"When I was 21, I voted for Kennedy," she said. She has not been to the polls since.
Now, she is part of a dwindling group of die-hard Ross Perot supporters here. "He's a businessman," said Ms. Drew, who works for a company that lost a record $4.5 billion last year. "That's what we need."
Willow Run, one of 21 General Motors plants that will close by 1995, is only the latest disaster in a state with more than 9 percent unemployment. And U.A.W. leaders say the sentiments voiced by the Willow Run workers are being echoed loudly at plants everywhere.
At the Labor Day parade in Detroit, where Senator Al Gore of Tennessee was a keynote speaker, the marchers were estimated at more than 150,000. In contrast, only about 30,000 marched in the 1988 parade.
Mr. Fraser said the size of this year's crowd only confirmed the change of sentiment among auto workers. Union officials estimate that as many as 30 percent of auto workers voted for Mr. Bush last time.
 
'They're Coming Home'
 "The most disturbing thing about it, and I wish it weren't true, is that when people become affluent, their values change," Mr. Fraser said. "They don't think they should be paying taxes to support people who are less well off. Reagan made greed respectable, and it caught on with some of our people. Now, with the economy the way it is, it's turned around, and they're coming home."
Not surprisingly, Michigan's Republican Governor, John Engler, who is the President's state campaign chairman, takes another view. "They should vote for George Bush because we've got an American economy with five straight quarters of growth," he said. "Not robust growth the way it needs to be, but clearly headed in the right direction."
Five straight quarters of growth means nothing to many people here. They may be America's highest-paid industrial workers, but even if their jobs were not threatened, the auto workers say, they would still be worried about house payments and college tuition for their children.
 
Disappearing Overtime
 "Ten years ago, we were working 10-hour days, six days a week," said Ted Copeland, a 36-year-old assembler, Vietnam veteran and former Navy reservist who left last year to fight in the Persian Gulf war. "I was making a fantastic amount of overtime -- earning $42,000, $43,000 a year."
Now, with overtime a part of the past at the doomed auto plant, the figure is closer to $30,000.
General Motors has said that most Willow Run workers, with an average of 20 years seniority, will be transferred to other plants. But Mr. Copeland, with two young sons and only 12 years on the line, is preparing for the worst. He has taken a second job, installing energy-saving devices for an engineering firm. The twice-monthly family dinners at the Red Lobster restaurant are over. He has sold off the truck he bought last year and his prized 1929 Model A Ford.
And, for the first time in 12 years, he is backing the Democrat. "O.K., fine, the man went to Oxford," he said. "But I feel he's gotten a whole lot of exposure to what's going on in this country -- unemployment, homelessness, welfare, drug abuse, the whole spiel."
And, he added, "Clinton's a very personable guy." One thing that impressed Mr. Copeland: "I heard him talking about his 1966 Mustang."
 
Driving a Political Statement
 The kinds of car a person drives is a political statement here, where the bumper stickers say "Buy American." Bob Harlow, the president of the Willow Run local of the U.A.W., said any politician foolish enough to pull up at the union hall in a foreign model would probably not get an endorsement.
One auto worker, Dave Roberts, has been driving his Chevrolet Lumina between Arlington and Ypsilanti since last spring, 18 hours each way. His wife, Jacqueline, a salaried worker at Willow Run, was transferred to Texas. Mr. Roberts, with 22 years' seniority, hopes that by spring he will be transferred, too.
Just back from Arlington last week, Mr. Roberts said his road trips provided a chance to do some politicking. "Gas stations, restaurants, any store I stop in, I try to bring it up in some way," he said. "Like I'll say, 'Well, I hope it's Clinton we're all voting for.' "
Mr. Roberts noted that he had a "little confrontation" with another customer at a gas station in Hope, Ark., Governor Clinton's hometown:
"He said, 'We don't like him down here.' I said, 'Well, all I can see is the economy in a bad state. We need a change.' "
Mr. Roberts added, "This lady who was there came over and said, 'I think it's time for a change, too.' "

That's what we need." (pg. D1); Fred Mosley said he would have supported President Bush a year ago. Then, in the spring, the auto worker favored Ross Perot. "Perot comes out, talking all this great stuff, and I was like, 'Yeah, yeah, that's what we want.' " But Mr. Mosley has become disillusioned with Mr. Perot and says Gov. Bill Clinton has an overriding plus: "He's not Bush." (pg. D4) (Peter Yates for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Catholic Archdiocese Weighs Closing Parishes

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
The Archdiocese of New York announced yesterday that it was studying the possibility of closing a number of its 412 parishes because of shifts in Roman Catholic population, the declining number of priests and economic difficulties.
At the same time, the archdiocese said it might open new parishes in fast-growing areas such as Orange and Dutchess Counties. 
 The announcement was made in the weekly newspaper of the archdiocese, Catholic New York, which has been the forum the announcement of several recent economic developments -- including the disclosure last week of a salary freeze for 1,600 lay employees and 1,500 priests.
The newspaper quoted Auxiliary Bishop Patrick J. Sheridan, the second in command to John Cardinal O'Connor, as saying no specific areas or parishes were being considered for closing. "We're not nearly at that point yet, not at all," the Bishop said.
The Bishop could not be reached for further comment last night.
 
Task Force Study
 The article said no decisions on closings would be made until a study by an 18-member commission that Bishop Sheridan heads, the Archdiocesan Task Force for Parish Planning, is completed.
Over the last 20 year, only a handful of parishes have been closed or merged in the archdiocese, which is made up of Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven counties north of New York City. The archdiocese has been reluctant to close even those parishes in inner-city areas that have lost the bulk of their Catholic populations. The parishes are seen as anchors in the community, which can help to keep certain blocks from decay and provide vital social services like soup kitchens and schools.
The archdiocese has announced in recent years that it was examining the possibility of closing some of its roughly 300 Catholic schools. But only a few -- 10 in the last two years -- have been closed, and those only after long negotiations with the parents and teachers.
Whether or not parishes are ultimately closed, yesterday's announcement may be intended as a warning to parishes to shore up their finances and prepare for a leaner future.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
A Mixed Day for the Dollar Amid Uncertainty in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against major European currencies while falling against the Japanese yen amid uncertainty over Europe's political squabbling concerning its currency crisis.
Gold prices fell slightly. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery fell 30 cents, to $347.50. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid price of $348.10, off $0.20. 
 Kevin Lawrie, vice president and chief dealer at the Bank of Boston, said the market had shown an "upward bias," but "essentially we didn't have anything very dramatic here."
 
'The Bleeding Has Stopped'
 In relative terms, the dollar is still weak, Mr. Lawrie said. "But it looks like the bleeding has stopped for the moment," he added.
He said traders were keeping an eye on Britain's handling of the currency crisis. On Sept. 16, Britain pulled out of a European Community program that sets exchange-rate limits to avoid sharp fluctuations.
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, denied rumors that he was going to resign.
"That's added a little bit of support for the dollar," Mr. Lawrie said, adding that economic data on unemployment rates in September due today were not expected to be good.
By the end of the trading day in London, the pound dropped to $1.7325, from $1.7805 late Wednesday. In New York, the pound was quoted late yesterday at $1.7380, compared with $1.7865 Wednesday. It finished earlier in Tokyo at $1.7445.
The dollar fell to 119.80 yen, from 119.85 yen late Wednesday, in New York. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar rose, closing at 120.32 Japanese yen from a record low 119.25 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at 119.90 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's late rates, included: 1.4215 marks, up from 1.41; 1.2425 Swiss francs, up from 1.2355; 4.8040 French francs, up from 4.7695; 1,244.5 Italian lire, up from 1,223, and 1.24735 Canadian dollars, up from 1.24675.
Silver in late trading at the New York Commodity Exchange was quoted at $3.714 a troy ounce, down from $3.739 late Wednesday. Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $3.75 a troy ounce, down from $3.76 bid late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Bush Offers Plan for Wider Use of Ethanol in Fuel

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
President Bush today proposed changes in the Clean Air Act that would encourage wider use of ethanol, a corn-based alcohol used in automobile fuel.
The proposal was welcomed by farmers in the hotly contested political battleground of the Middle West, but was criticized by some environmentalists and the energy industry, especially in oil-producing states that make competing additives for gasoline. 
 The Bush plan spells out a new formula for cleaner auto fuels that is intended to lower the emissions that cause smog. It would require refiners to devote most of their production to gasoline that evaporates much less readily than most fuel now on the market. As a result, more gasoline blended with ethanol -- a faster evaporating mixture -- could then be sold.
 
Credits for Farm Products
 Earlier today, Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan said the Government would help 18 countries buy American grain and other farm products with $3.6 billion in credit guarantees. The credits represent two-thirds of the $5.7 billion that the Agriculture Department expects to guarantee this fiscal year, up from $5 billion last year.
The two actions today are the latest efforts to shore up Mr. Bush's standing in the Farm Belt. Last month the President authorized export subsidies for one billion bushels of wheat and released $755 million in disaster aid to farmers who lost crops to bad weather, although his Administration had resisted legislation dealing with disaster aid.
Mr. Bush, who made today's announcement in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, characterized the fuel proposal as a compromise involving farm groups, environmentalists, the oil industry and ethanol makers because it would speed the development of renewable fuels without sacrificing protection of the environment.
"The bottom line is this," he said. "Clean-burning ethanol fuel can help reduce pollution. This creative solution allows us to proceed in a way that is good for farmers, good for rural America, good for the environment in our cities and good for American consumers and motorists."
But the proposal might have produced as many political headaches as it was meant to solve. Oil refiners, natural-gas producers and the coal industry attacked it, saying it would necessitate costly changes to manufacturing plants, was expensive to taxpayers and harmed the market for compounds that compete with ethanol, particularly gasoline additives made from natural gas and coal.
"He's writing off the economic interests of those states that produce natural gas and coal, like Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Colorado, Wyoming, Pennsylvania and West Virginia," said Bill Orr, national representative of the $15 billion industry that processes methanol, an additive made from natural gas and coal that reduces harmful emissions from fuel. "There are thousands of jobs that will be lost in those states."
 
Criticism From a Democrat
 Environmentalists and a Democratic lawmaker who helped to write the Clean Air Act were also critical.
David Doniger, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national environmental group, called the proposal an "unjustified giveaway to Archer Daniels Midland," the Illinois-based company that is the country's largest ethanol producer and that has given more than $1 million to the Republican Party so far this year, more than any other company.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, said he doubted the President's assertion that the proposal would clear the air.
"We have asked and asked," Mr. Waxman said, "but there is no detailed description of this proposal available. So we are expected to trust George Bush to protect the environment. Given his record, I do not think the American people can rest assured that this giveaway will not ultimately come at the expense of their health."
But Mr. Bush and his advisers were clearly pleased with the plan because of the effect they hope it will have in Indiana, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, major corn-growing states. Illinois, Missouri and Ohio -- with 44 electoral votes in all -- are particularly crucial for Mr. Bush's re-election.
 
Quayle Announces First
 Hours before Mr. Bush's announcement, Vice President Dan Quayle told a group of farmers at an agricultural fair in Columbus, Ind., about the "good news."
"The President will announce a program that will further increase our consumption of ethanol," Mr. Quayle said. "Governor Clinton's response to ethanol has been rather simple. He has repealed the tax incentive for gasohol in the state of Arkansas. You've got a clear-cut choice of who's going to be on the side of farmers: the President or Governor Clinton."
Here in Washington, the National Corn Growers Association and representatives of the ethanol industry praised the President's plan. They said it would increase the amount of corn sold to ethanol makers by 100 million bushels annually by 1995.
This year, roughly 400 million bushels of corn are expected to be processed to produce 900 million gallons of ethanol. The widening use of ethanol as a fuel additive is largely due to a tax program that grants producers of fuels containing 10 percent ethanol a 5.4 cents-per-gallon exemption from gasoline taxes.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Reaction;
. . .As Clinton Refocuses Attack

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis., Oct. 1

 BODY:
The Democrats today began planning a strategy to undermine Ross Perot's economic plan.
Mr. Clinton and his aides sketched a plan for the final weeks of the campaign that they hope will keep their team on track. They hope to capitalize on the weaknesses polls have identified in Mr. Perot's base of support while continuing the attack on President Bush. 
 Gov. Bill Clinton and his top aides appear to have been expecting today's announcement. In recent days, they have begun emphasizing the elements of Mr. Perot's plan that would call for higher taxes, like the gasoline tax, and cuts of entitlements in areas like Social Security. Confident that voters are not ready for such bold potions, they have begun to paint Mr. Perot as dangerously out of touch.
 
Deficit vs. Jobs
 "The problem I have with the Perot program is that it puts deficit reduction ahead of generating jobs," Mr. Clinton said in a radio interview in Cincinnati. Campaign aides said Mr. Clinton did not watch Mr. Perot's televised announcement and was informed of Mr. Perot's decision afterward.
But Mr. Clinton conceded in a television interview in Raleigh, N.C., that there could be a danger in the anti-Bush voters he has attracted being offered another alternative.
If there were any private concerns within the campaign about the new Perot campaign, it was not betrayed today in relaxed campaigning in Wisconsin, which included a visit to a small-town Dairy Queen.
Dee Dee Myers, the campaign's press secretary, said polls showed that Mr. Perot's strength was much less than what it was when he dropped out in July, an erosion that she said worked to Mr. Clinton's advantage.
"He doesn't change the outcome in any state," she said of Mr. Perot's presence on the ballot. "He kind of muddies it up in Texas, kind of muddies it up in Florida and North Carolina, states where Bush needs to win and where we're running pretty strong or very strong. In states like California, he takes probably a little more from us, but we're 20 points ahead."

HEADLINE: Congressional Panel Trims '93 Military Budget by 9%

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Voicing concerns about cutting military programs too deeply in a recessionary election year, House and Senate negotiators today approved a $274.3 billion military budget for the 1993 fiscal year that includes many weapons designed for the cold war era.
The compromise bill for the year that begins today represents a 9 percent decline, adjusted for inflation, from the $291 billion military budget for the previous year but cuts only $6.5 billion from President Bush's request. Lawmakers made no additional troop cuts beyond the Pentagon's recommendations and canceled few weapons programs. 
 In many ways, the bill marks a transition from lingering cold-war-era programs to what are likely to be several years of steep declines in military spending and a focus on regional military contingencies.
 
Saving Money, Saving Workers
 Lawmakers generally followed the Administration's proposed path toward a "base force" of 1.6 million in 1995 but signaled the first attempts to address new money-saving strategies, like buying more weapon prototypes before advancing to full production. They also plan to ease the transition for displaced workers in the weapons industry.
A 1990 agreement between Congress and the Administration that blocked the transfer of military spending to domestic programs expires this year, prompting many lawmakers and budget analysts to project deeper cuts next year in Pentagon spending.
"This year is the last year that the defense budget gets to tread water," said Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan research organization here. "Next year the money disappears."
The measure adopted today supports development of the new Air Force F-22 fighter, a new aircraft carrier and the Army's light attack helicopter, the Comanche. It also provides $4.05 billion for the "Star Wars" anti-missile defense system -- about $100 million less than this year -- but sharply cuts spending for space-based weapons and delays the construction of a land-based anti-missile site to 2002, from 1996.
Even the main exception to this trend carries plenty of cold-war baggage: After some debate, Congress agreed with the Administration to end the B-2 Stealth bomber program after building 20 of the bat-winged, radar-evading aircraft. But the program's total cost, $44.4 billion, makes the B-2 the most expensive military aircraft ever.
The bill now advances to the full House and Senate, which are expected to approve it this weekend. Mr. Bush is expected to sign the measure.
"This bill begins to reinvest cold-war defense resources in American economic security," Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.
Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said the Defense Department would reserve comment until the budget plan could be reviewed.
Lawmakers expressed concern about easing the pain for workers in the weapons industry and communities where bases will close by setting aside about $1.5 billion to help communities, displaced military personnel and factory workers.
 
Early Retirement
 One provision, originally offered by Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, allows military personnel with certain specialties to retire after 15 years, instead of 20. Personnel can receive credit for the five extra years by taking jobs in areas like education, law enforcement and health care.
The measure also supports the flagging weapons industry by approving $148 million to upgrade M1 tanks at the General Dynamics Corporation tank plant in Lima, Ohio.
In another program the Administration has not supported, lawmakers approved $755 million to develop and build the V-22 Osprey, which takes off like a helicopter and flies like a plane. In July, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney grudgingly agreed to spend the $1.5 billion that Congress had already authorized for the program.
The Pentagon's annual effort to reduce the number of reserve troops was again sharply curbed by lawmakers careful to protect one of their most sacred cows: The negotiators agreed to cut 39,000 reserve troops, instead of 116,000 as the Pentagon had requested. Lawmakers also approved $695.6 million for new night-vision equipment, trucks and C-130 transport planes for reserve units.
 
In Addition, . . .
 Also included in the legislation are these provisions:
*The Pentagon must conduct a thorough cost study of new combat aircraft, including the AX, the F-22 and the F/A-18.
*The Defense Department was ordered to review duplicative roles among the armed services.
*A 3.7 percent pay raise was granted to the 1.8 million active-duty forces, effective Jan. 1, 1993.
Both the House and Senate had included provisions that would repeal a Pentagon ban on virtually all abortions at American military hospitals overseas. But for the third consecutive year, President Bush's threat to veto the military budget bill if it included the abortion provision forced Congressional leaders to drop the language from the bill.

HEADLINE: Where the Drug Culture Rules

SERIES: 'The Well': One Block in Brooklyn -- Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
When a citywide blackout and ensuing riots left much of Bushwick in ruins in 1977, one area that survived was a block of small businesses on Knickerbocker Avenues and three-story wood and brick houses nearby.
That survival, however, sealed its doom. 
 Today, even as parts of this north Brooklyn neighborhood finally begin to rebuild, the block left to age on Knickerbocker Avenue is flourishing in an altogether different way, as one of the busiest -- and most brazen -- drug bazaars in New York City.
For the last three years, special police units have mounted repeated assaults on the Knickerbocker Avenue drug trade, but to little lasting effect. Day and night, heroin and crack are sold by teen-agers who pace the teeming sidewalks shouting brand names like "Jungle Fever," "Dr. D." and "Lamborghini." The police call it "the Well" -- wry tribute to its unending supply of drugs and drug arrests.
The survival of the Well is partly a matter of the block's peculiar history: Spared by the riots but deprived of prosperity and social services, it became a drug-selling center first for the Mafia and then for Dominican and Puerto Rican drug organizations from around New York City. But beyond that, law-enforcement officials and drug-policy experts say, the Well's persistence is a stark illustration of the failure of traditional efforts to curtail the narcotics trade.
"Troutman and Knickerbocker represents a city, state and national failure to develop a drug strategy that will work in places like Bushwick," says David C. Condliffe, who resigned this week as director of the Mayor's Office of Drug Abuse Policy, saying he was frustrated by a lack of money to prevent and treat addiction. "We clearly have not developed a geographic targeting plan at an intense enough level. And our failures are costing us small fortunes in tax dollars and people's lives."
The local precinct, the 83d, has poured in extra officers. The city's signature drug-fighting weapon of recent years, the Tactical Narcotics Team, has been sent into the Well several times and returned this week for a three-day operation.
But none of this has done much good -- evidence, the police and the experts say, of the limits of law enforcement. While thousands of dealers and buyers have been arrested in the Well, an overburdened court system and constraints on the prosecution of minors mean that many end up back on the streets in a matter of days. When the dealers are chased off one street, they simply move to the next one. Indeed, amid such criticism of its long-term effectiveness, T.N.T. has seen its staffing cut in half since its inception in 1989.
"We can't do this alone," said Inspector Robert Baumert, commanding officer of the Brooklyn North Narcotics District. "We are trying to attack from the supply side. We need more people working at it from the demand side. It has to be a total war. It's like Vietnam. If there's not total support, you lose."
Bushwick residents talk about neglect by business and city and state officials, high unemployment, poverty and the drive of new immigrants to make money to pad welfare checks or to send back home. The city complains that the stock of mostly privately owned housing has proved difficult to monitor for drug activity. And perhaps most important, both the police and social service workers say they can do little until a majority of residents no longer see the drug trade as a way of life.
"This is not just a group of people selling drugs on the side," said Rex L. Curry, associate director of the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development in Brooklyn. "It's a culture that has learned to make its living this way over the last 10 years. Kids have grown up on this -- it's a culture that has been created basically by the lack of resources and lack of economic alternatives in the area."
 
Refuge
Independence Proves Undoing
 "Bushwick" is Dutch for "refuge." And like Bushwick itself, once a small city with its own minor league baseball team, the block was once a stable working-class area of three- and four-story homes and little Italian restaurants. Residents, first German immigrants, then later Italians and Jews, went to work in the nearby knitting factories and breweries.
But in the years since World War II, when much of the white population began moving to the suburbs, much of Bushwick fell victim to real-estate speculators, who began blockbusting in the 1940's and continued profiteering through the mid-1980's, when the city auctioned hundreds of lots without restrictions.
By the 1970's, the block was already known as a mob-controlled area with an active drug market. On the night of the blackout, July 13, 1977, as rioters stormed through Bushwick, store owners stood guard outside their doors on Knickerbocker, protecting the block from plunder but preserving it as a heroin market.
Knickerbocker, a main commercial thoroughfare, had come under the control of the Bonanno crime family. In 1977, at a time when New York City's other organized-crime families had banned drug dealing, the Bonannos, under the direction of Carmine Galante, began planning a huge heroin smuggling operation, hoping to corner the lucrative traffic for all America.
It was in the heart of the Well, on the rear patio of the Joe and Mary Italian-American Restaurant at 205 Knickerbocker Avenue, that Mr. Galante was murdered on July 12, 1979. He was found sprawled face up on the ground, his lighted cigar clenched between his teeth.
In the years that followed, Joe and Mary's was converted into a Chinese take-out restaurant, and the drug trade was largely taken over by newcomers to the neighborhood.
According to drug investigators, after the Galante murder, Jamaicans and Colombians based in other parts of New York, became the principal suppliers of cocaine and heroin. And buyers, including teen-agers, doctors, lawyers, truckers, city workers, addicts and at least one police officer, from Connecticut to Long Island, continued to come.
Not that all of this neighborhood is suffering. Another block down Knickerbocker, on George Street, the New York Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group, has built two-family houses with small front yards and driveways. Several churches and social service agencies and charities -- such as the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council and the New York Community Trust -- reach the streets around the Well, too.
But for those trying to fight the drug problems on the block, social and economic history is playing against them.
Virtually all of the houses and storefront properties in the Well were, and are, privately owned. While home ownership usually stabilizes a neighborhood, in the Well it has also made it difficult to investigate or deter drug activities. And because Bushwick had avoided government programs through the first half of the century, largely an effort to ward off poor or minority newcomers, few social service organizations have deep roots. Fewer still have wanted to take on the problems of the Well.
"Bed-Stuy had the Kennedys fighting for it," said Nadine Whitted, district manager of Community Board 4, referring to the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, a community development program sponsored by the Kennedys. "We don't have anything like that."
 
Entrepreneurs
Endless Supply Of Willing Dealers
 With the disappearance of factories, many residents have been forced to create work for themselves. For some that has meant bodegas and restaurants and novelty shops. For others, it has meant drugs.
Though the police have made several attempts to drive them out, the drug dealers have merely shifted from street to street, like peas pushed around a plate.
Once concentrated on Starr Street, the trade was displaced after the highly publicized shooting in August 1989 of Maria Hernandez, a woman who had fought drug dealers in the neighborhood. Instead of leaving the neighborhood, the dealers simply moved two blocks north to Jefferson.
When a group called the Jefferson Street Task Force began renovating the abandoned city buildings on the street where prostitutes and dealers found refuge, the dealers moved a block south to Troutman. For the last year, the police have focused their patrols on Troutman, even closing the street to traffic for part of each day. The trade has now moved around the corner to Knickerbocker.
"The activity here is incredible," said one drug investigator assigned to the area. "Every park, every street corner, any abandoned building -- they are just looking to set up shop."
A few doors down Starr Street from the building in which Mrs. Hernandez was shot to death a 27-year-old woman sat on her stoop with her 6-year-old daughter, taking in the brisk fall air and reflecting on her neighborhood. "When Maria died, we thought it would get better, but after that was done with, everyone came, did their stories and left. The cops came, but it all died out."
Trying to revive police efforts last February, Capt. Edward Fernandez, the commanding officer of the precinct, began "Operation Clean Streets," aimed at the Well and the 10 surrounding blocks.
With 14 new officers, he mounted a strategy just short of a state of siege hoping to make life as miserable as possible for the dealers.
He expanded patrols and assigned an anti-crime unit and a Special Narcotics Enforcement Unit to the area. He enlisted help from helicopter patrols, mounted units, emergency services units, the sheriff's office and the Brooklyn North narcotics units, including a Tactical Narcotics Team. A special assistant district attorney was assigned to help seek stiff penalties for arrests marked with a yellow cover sheet -- the sign that the act had occurred in the Clean Streets area.
Residents, reluctant to assist the police publicly, quietly cooperated by painting their addresses on their roofs so patrolling helicopters could orient themselves at night.
Though law-enforcement officials say they do not know exactly who controls the drugs in the Well, they have aimed at several groups that they say do most of their business there. One, a Puerto Rican group with 25 or more members, operates on Jefferson Street and is thought to be behind at least 15 drug-related murders in the area, said one investigator. The drug group, now under investigation, is believed to be getting its drug supply from the Bronx.
Both the police and residents say the efforts have not been without value. Between February and August, the precinct logged 626 felony arrests (sellers), 303 misdemeanors (buyers) and issued 7,160 summonses for other minor violations intended to deter the dealers. T.N.T., which occupied the area from May to August, made 733 additional arrests, many by undercover agents who bought from dealers with marked money. Last night they completed a three-day operation in the area in which they arrested about 150 people.
But for all their efforts, both residents and the police say, nothing much has changed. For each drug dealer who is arrested, they say, there seems to be another to take his place.
 
'Always a Replacement'
 "The problem we see in Bushwick is that there is always a replacement for these dealers," said Capt. Kevin Hickey, commanding officer of Brooklyn North's T.N.T. unit. "You could hit Knickerbocker and Troutman six times a day and you'd think you'd get the message out, but you don't."
Dennis Herring, a telephone technician who serves as chairman of the 83d Precinct community council, was equally perplexed. "This police captain has sent in everything but a tugboat," he said, "but it still hasn't gotten that much better. It works while the police are there, but these people have the attitude that once the police are gone, the dealers can come back."
Angela M. Battaglia, housing director of the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizen's Center, who has helped organize the Jefferson Street Task Force, speaks with deep dismay about what has happened over the last two decades to a block that, as a child, she could see from the top of her tenement on Knickerbocker Avenue.
"A lot has been done for Bushwick to uplift these neighborhoods," she said, "but with the exception of the local police, the city has not made a sufficient commitment. It's not that they have ignored the whole area, they've just ignored this block and the problem there."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
'Honored to Accept': Excerpts From Perot's News Conference

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Following is Ross Perot's opening statement at a news conference today on his decision to campaign for President and excerpts from his exchange with reporters, as transcribed by News Transcripts Inc., a private transcription service:
Good afternoon. The volunteers in all 50 states have asked me to run as a candidate for President of the United States. Jim Stockdale, our Vice-Presidential candidate, and I are honored to accept their request. Few people in this country have been able to live the American dream to the extent that I have. No person ever had a finer father, mother or sister than I. No man has ever been blessed with a better wife, Margot, or five more outstanding children plus six grandchildren -- too good to be true. 
 I have been extremely fortunate during my business career. So I have lived the American dream. And certainly if anyone in this country should be obligated to serve our country and its people I should be.
The volunteers know that this is a critical time in our nation's history. Neither political party has effectively addressed the issues that concern the American people. They have asked me to run this campaign on the issues and to assure that the problems the American people are concerned with will be dealt with after this election is over.
I know I hurt many of the volunteers who worked so hard through the spring and summer when I stepped aside in July. I thought it was the right thing to do. I thought that both political parties would address the problems that face the nation. We gave them a chance. They didn't do it. But the volunteers on their own forged ahead and put me on the ballot in the final 26 states after July 16.
The day we were on the ballot in all 50 states the volunteers requested that I come back in because the political parties had not responded to their concerns.
 
'Government in Gridlock'
My decision in July hurt you. I apologize. I thought I was doing the right thing. I made a mistake. I take full responsibility for it. There's only one issue now, starting today, and that is what's good for our country.
Looking back won't solve any of our problems. Looking forward, working together, we can fix anything. The American people are concerned about a Government in gridlock. Our people are good. The American people are good. But they have a Government that is a mess.
The American people are concerned about this Government they pay for that doesn't produce results. Everybody in Washington makes excuses. Nobody takes responsibility, even when they have direct responsibility. The American people have figured that out. They want that changed.
The American people are really concerned about a Government where people go to Washington to cash in and not to serve. They want the Government changed so that people go as servants of the people back home, and do not use Government service as a stepping stone to financial success.
The people know that it is wrong to spend our children's money. Nothing could be more wrong. We know that we cannot constantly pass on a $4 trillion debt to our children. The people want this problem squarely dealt with. They want our financial house put back in order.
The people are concerned that our Government is still organized to fight the cold war. They want it reorganized to rebuild America as the highest priority. In order to do that, the highest priority of all is to rebuild the job base and the industrial base. We've got to put out people back to work. We've got to stop the loss of entire industries that go to other countries.
We must make the words "made in the U.S.A." once again the world's standard for excellence.
 
'I Go as Your Servant'
Not only is Government a mess, politics is also a mess. The way political campaigns are run is a mess. The people want a new political climate where the system does not attract ego-driven, power-hungry people.
We will create an environment that attracts the best people in the country to come to serve, and to go back home, and go to work. Together we can solve these problems and make the political process responsible and relevant to selecting the best people in the country.
These are the issues we'll talk about in the coming weeks. I will not spend one minute answering questions that are not directly relevant to the issues that concern the American people.
And now to the American people, I don't belong to anybody but you. You the people own me. If you elect me I go as your servant. I will work night and day to see that the priorities that you have established are accomplished.
To the many young people -- and it's a disproportionate number of very young people who have called me, written me and some have even driven across country to Dallas to visit with me at their own expense, expressing concern about what kind of country they will live in as adults, wondering whether or not they will even have a job when they get out of school. Now this is unthinkable, that you'd have a college degree and not be able to get a job in America.
When I think of all the sacrifices my parents and all the generations who came before them made in the earlier times for us so that we could live the American dream, certainly we all dedicate ourselves to seeing that you, the young people in our country, will have the American dream passed on to you.
Even the very young ones write me. This little girl, a beautiful little girl, Adrian Cagiano. I'll leave this picture for you. Here is -- here are a few excerpts from her letter:
"My name is Adrian Cagiano. I am 9 years old, almost 10. I wish you would really run for President and I wish I could vote. I think everyone should get to say how they would like to see things done. I just don't think a small group of people should decide all these things for a whole bunch of people." This is signed Adrian, Rural Route 2, Augusta, Kan.
Now when you're hot and you're tired, and you're worn out some day, take a look at this little girl and her sisters, and you'll say whatever it takes we've got to do it, we've got to pass on the American dream to them.
To the retired people who made it through the Depression, fought and won World War II -- now how's that for a double hit? Grow up in the Depression and then as a bonus get to fight and win World War II. Worked and sacrificed most of their lives. I know you share my commitment to make sure that we pass the American dream on to our children and grandchildren.
One of my most poignant memories is the day Mort Myerson became the president of Electronic Data Systems. His 95-year-old grandfather was there. His grandfather had had to flee Russia many years ago because he happened to be a Jew. He lived in an attic in Brooklyn for 18 months working as a tailor as a young man, so he could get together enough money to buy a train ticket to Fort Worth, Tex. He reared a fine young son and that son became Mort Myerson's father. He was there when Mort became president of E.D.S. At the end of the meeting Mr. Myerson came forward with tears in his eyes and hugged Mort and said, "Son, through you I have fulfilled all of the dreams I had as a young man when I came to America."
 
Sharing the Sacrifice
Now, that's what this is all about -- fair-shared sacrifice will be necessary to solve these problems. The last time we all sacrificed together was World War II. Everybody participated in the sacrifice. We won. We can win again if each one in this country will carry his part of the burden.
To the huge number of people in the armed forces, the largest single group of people who have written me and urged me to run these past few months are our military forces and people who are veterans. You've written, you've called and you've volunteered your time urging me to run. I do this for you primarily because you fought and won the hot wars and the 45-year-long cold war for us. And in many cases, nobody ever even said thank you. This is my tiny little way of saying thank you.
Certainly you deserve a country for yourselves and your children that fulfills the ideals that you fought for on the battlefield. Some of you gave your lives. I do this for the widows and the children. Many of you bear the permanent scars of the war. I do it for you.
I received a Purple Heart through the mail yesterday and a letter. Some short excerpts:
"Dear Ross: I was awarded this Purple Heart for wounds received during a Vietnam ambush in 1968. Over the years, its value to me has grown significantly, and like my family, it is priceless. I would be honored if you would accept the loan of my Purple Heart to keep with you throughout the campaign. I believe that it can serve as a compelling reminder that the hard battle ahead can and must be won.
"Let it also remind you of the army of ordinary citizens that has mustered to your call and looks to you to stop the hemorrhaging of the American spirit, to unite once and for all our diverse citizenry under a single American banner, and to restore honesty, integrity and responsibility to our Government. Like you, I firmly believe that if we stand united, we will win. Good luck, Ross. Dennis Garvin, Wilmington, Del."
Dennis, thank you. I'll keep it with me during the campaign. I understand it's on loan. I'll get it back to you. Never forget, to everybody listening today, I can't do this job without your continued support. One person is nothing in a task this large. If millions of you will come together, we can do anything. There's nothing we can't do. It's up to you; it's up to all of us. I promise you I'll give it everything I have, but the final results are in your hands, because you own this country and you are the voters.
 
'Committed to Serving You'
I look forward to squarely presenting these issues day after day to the American people. I would like to thank the American people. By choosing me as your candidate, you have given me the highest honor I could ever receive.
In closing, let me say this. I love this country. I love the American people. I love the principles on which this country was founded and I don't like to see those principles violated, and there are millions of folks out there just like me that are sick and tired of it.
I am totally committed to serving you, God bless you all, thank you for this honor, and now I would like to introduce Jim Stockdale, our Vice-Presidential candidate, and his wife, Sibyl. Jim Stockdale is a hero's hero. He's a recipient of the medal of honor. In addition to that he is a scholar. He is a retired admiral. He suffered as a prisoner of war during Vietnam as few people have.
He provided leadership that caused our Government to award him the medal of honor. In order to receive it his fellow prisoners have to recommend him for it, the ultimate compliment. He is a man of steel. He has been hammered on the forge of brutality and was able to reach outside himself to provide strength to others.
I can't tell you how many P.O.W.'s told me when they came home that they would not be alive if it had not been for Jim Stockdale. He gave them the courage to go forward and to live. Now that's leadership, that's the kind of person that built our country. We're very fortunate to have a man of his quality to serve us.
And now let me tell you a little bit about Sibyl. She is one of the great women in our country. When the men were dying from brutality and neglect, Sibyl Stockdale and a handful of dedicated wives and mothers were out there trying to get someone to do something so that their husbands could survive this very long war.
She finally broke through. She got our Government to change its policies from not saying anything about it to one of embarrassing the North Vietnamese into changing the treatment so that more men would survive that ordeal.
There are few women during the period of my life of 62 years who have shown more strength, more courage, more commitment and more dedication, who have been more brutally tested than Mrs. Stockdale, and as a combination, it's two pieces of steel.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. You're not going to tell us what your campaign plans are. Will you tell us where you're going to appear and when?
A. We're not going to reveal our strategy. We will just have it unfold day after day without any -- here's the one thing you can bet on: It's going to be serious; it's going to focus on the issues. . . .
Q. Why should America put its trust in an economic plan crafted largely by a Carter Administration official?
A. No. 1, it was not crafted largely by that person. That person participated on the team, made an important contribution. That person is a very bright, wise, able person. I had absolute control over that plan, was deeply involved in it myself, and a very talented team made up of a number of people participated.
Q. Your opponents say the gas tax and the increased taxes on Social Security benefits and the income tax [inaudible] falls too heavily on the middle class, and the rich don't participate as much as the middle class does. How are you going to respond to that?
A. Well, you'd expect your opponents to distort and twist and present, and I wouldn't dignify that answer -- I wouldn't dignify that answer with comment. I know exactly who that comes from. I know where exactly where it comes from. He said it so many times ----

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Two months ago you said you were quitting the race because you didn't want to be a spoiler and you didn't want to be disruptive. Now you say you're back to win this thing.
A. Yes.
Q. Isn't your strategy to disrupt George Bush's vote in a number of key states, including this one, Texas?
A. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. That's press myth No. 615. . . .
He has called me every name in the book. All I've ever said, Fine man, fine family. The only thing I've ever criticized is his mistakes in office. That's it. We're talking about performance here and not personality. See? I'm everything from a monster to crazy, though, coming from them, right?

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Did you know your campaign has hired people to investigate some of your volunteers? What's your [inaudible]?
A. No. 1, your question is, "Did I know that?" No.
No. 2, let's look, because I now have checked to find out what was going on. Number -- here is what happened. People, we had 50 states, offices all over 50 states, manned by self-selected volunteers. Some of them would call Dallas and say, Charley is stealing money. In order to comply with the Federal Election Commission rules, we had to check it out. So we would check. In most cases it was just false signals.
Then we would have a situation come up, say, gee, we've got a fellow out here in accounting in a secure area that your accounting coordinator that had done three terms in jail. Well, we would have to check that out. Ninety percent of the contact with that firm, most of the effort with that firm was just providing security people in offices that needed security. We would rent security people by the hour from them.
Now, let's stop and think about this for a minute. I would urge someone to say, "Well, how many people do you have in dirty tricks or opposition research?" Don't have any -- never had any. Isn't it fascinating that everybody goes bonkers on the front page of their paper the day I am to make this acceptance on a non-issue and ignores both parties who are in absolutely overdrive and overload trying to destroy one another personally?
Step 2, really now, if there's any balance and fairness in what you do, give the same attention to their investigative capability that you have created out of thin air about our nonexistent investigative capability. Find out how many full-time investigators they have checking everything is breathing.
And I think you'll conclude there's a lot of paranoia, at least in one place.
So I realize it's a tough game, and I realize nobody has to -- there are no Marquis of Queensberry rules, and I don't care. But I find it silly to the point of ridiculous that if you write a nonstory just because it gives you something hot that you don't take the time to say, "What about these other two guys?" Listen, we are not even in the game when it comes to investigation, in terms of what they're doing. And we don't -- all we try to do, if somebody says somebody's stealing, we check it out. We're required to, under the Federal Election Commission, not to let people steal money.
Now, if that upsets you, I'm sorry, folks, that's it.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. You had several quotes about how they use investigators, "they investigate everything breathing." Do you have chapter and verse about their use of investigators to either investigate you or the American people?
A. I don't feed the press.
Q. Well, you made the accusation.
A. Everybody else does. I don't give you a feed every morning about something nasty about -- did anybody here ever get a nasty feed from me? I rest my case.

HEADLINE: Ruling Party Takes Lead in Angola

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Jose Eduardo dos Santos and his party, a once avowedly Marxist group that has controlled Angola since independence in 1975, took an early lead today in this country's first openly contested presidential and parliamentary elections.
Preliminary results this evening gave Mr. dos Santos about 60 percent of the vote in the presidential contest and a wide lead over his chief rival, Jonas Savimbi, the former guerrilla leader. 
 In parliamentary elections, Mr. dos Santos's party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, known as the M.P.L.A. from its Portuguese initials, was also in the lead with 60 percent of the votes. This was nearly twice as many as those given Mr. Savimbi's party, the Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita.
But with only about 10 percent of the ballots counted so far, analysts cautioned that the picture could change dramatically.
Election officials said the turnout was very high, with nearly 90 percent of Angola's 4.9 million registered voters casting ballots. And despite the long history of conflict between the ruling party and Unita, there were few reports of election-related violence.
 
'Went Incredibly Well'
 "The elections went incredibly well," said Jeffrey Millington, the head of the United States liaison office here, which has closely monitored the elections. Washington has not had full diplomatic relations with Angola since it became independent of Portugal.
"There were certainly a lot of delays in getting the material out, transportation problems, logistical problems, and much confusion the first day," Mr. Millington said. "But by the second day, I think the problems had been resolved."
If the M.P.L.A.'S victory is confirmed, it would be a powerful repudiation not only of Mr. Savimbi but also of the United States. Along with South Africa, the United States subsidized Mr. Savimbi's long and violent struggle against the Angolan Government, which was formerly allied with the Soviet Union and Cuba.
What finally happens here is also considered a barometer of the transition to democracy and a market economy elsewhere in Africa. If the process goes smoothly in Angola, analysts say, it is a sign of hope for countries like Mozambique and the Sudan, which have been plagued by years of brutal civil war and repressive regimes.
 
Adapting to Changes
 Both the M.P.L.A. and Unita fought Portuguese colonial rule from the 1960's onward. After independence, they turned on each other and ended up as de facto proxies for the world's superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, in the cold war.
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the M.P.L.A. has gradually shed some of the most doctrinaire legacies of its Marxist past.
It no longer claims a monopoly of power. It has adopted new laws guaranteeing press freedom and abandoned its leading role in the army and in the secret police. And this year the party dropped the hammer and sickle emblem from the national flag, replacing it with a large yellow star.
If official figures are to be believed, the transformation has resulted in an extraordinary increase in membership. Since March 1991, the number of M.P.L.A. members is said to have risen from about 70,000 to more than 300,000.
In the monthlong campaign, Mr. dos Santos, 49 years old, cast himself as a kind of national father figure who, despite persistent interference by outsiders, mainly the United States, has been steadfastly committed to peace. For the most part that tactic seems to have worked.
 
Minds Long Made Up
 In interviews before and during the voting, most people said they had made up their minds several months ago, with their decision based on general impressions rather than specific programs.
By contrast, since May 1991, when the cease-fire accords between the governing party and Unita were signed, the rebel group has struggled fitfully to convert itself from a tenacious fighting machine into a political party.
The group has been hit by a series of scandals and violent incidents that have raised questions, at least among Angola's better educated and urban elite, about its commitment to democratic rule.
In the most telling episode, two of Unita's most senior leaders, Miguel Nzu Puna and Tony de Costa Fernandes, defected from the movement, accusing Mr. Savimbi, 58, of "crimes against humanity," including the killing of other leading Unita officials. A month later, it was disclosed that two senior Unita officials, Tito Chingunji and Wilson dos Santos, along with members of their families, had been killed.
In any event, Angolans reacted eagerly to the chance to elect leaders for the first time in their lives. The state-controlled radio reported that polling booths in some villages remained open until midnight on Tuesday, with ballots cast by the light of kerosene lamps. In Huila Province in the south, hundreds of people reportedly slept overnight outside polling stations, waiting to vote.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: News Analysis;
The Center of Attention

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
What makes Ross run?
Fundamentally, the answer does not seem to be the reason most people seek office, to win it. Rather, the point is to gain attention. 
 "It has been clear from the beginning that Ross Perot never had any great desire to be President, or even really to run for the Presidency," said Thomas D. Barr, a New York lawyer who is a close and longtime adviser to the Texas tycoon. "Saying he would on the 'Larry King Live' show was the worst mistake of his life."
In Mr. Barr's view, Mr. Perot was driven to enter and re-enter a race "that got away from him" by a desire to focus the national debate on the issues he believes important, and in a manner he believes correct.
 
Moving the Dialogue
 "I think that to move the dialogue is the whole point of the exercise at this juncture," Mr. Barr said in a telephone interview today. "It was always the whole point of the exercise, even at the beginning."
Mr. Barr is a friend, and his view of Mr. Perot's motivation is a positive one. The candidate's critics would agree that he is driven by a need to be seen a savior of some sort, but they see this as more of an expression of egoism than altruism.
In many ways the Perot case calls to mind that of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Like Mr. Jackson, Mr. Perot has been accused of harboring an outsized ego that he places in the cause of ideas; like Mr. Jackson, Mr. Perot sometimes insists that he alone represents those ideas; like Mr. Jackson, Mr. Perot grasps the power of the leverage that occurs at the juncture of media giantism and bloc-voting activism.
 
Outpouring of Attention
 For a while, Mr. Perot's exercise worked very well. In the modern media age, no fringe Presidential candidate has ever received such an outpouring of pleasant attention. From Larry King to Katie Couric to Barbara Walters, the twang and grin of Mr. Perot dominated talk-show television morning and night; his hourlong chats on the morning programs altered the shape, and expanded the role, of video politics.
But the attention grew increasingly critical, and when Mr. Perot suddenly quit the race on July 16, saying "it would be disruptive to the country" for him to continue, it turned savage. Then, worse, it disappeared.
By threatening to re-enter the race, and now fulfilling that threat, Mr. Perot has won an immediate and extraordinary -- some say inappropriate -- level of attention, both from the press and from the political establishment.
On Monday, in an event covered by political reporters from every major newspaper and carried live on cable television, Mr. Perot met in Dallas with delegations from the campaigns of President Bush and his Democratic opponent, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
The men and women the two campaigns sent to Dallas were, as Mr. Perot might say, "world-class," including the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the President's national security adviser. Bearing their economic plans before them, the besuited suitors stood with all the ease of emissaries to the court of Idi Amin as the billionaire told them they had been good to come and share their ideas.
And suddenly, after weeks when the spotlight was elsewhere, attention was paid. "His economic plan has been on the best seller list for weeks, but the first time I saw anybody write about it was on Monday," Mr. Barr said. If the attention had risen to a more serious level, he added, Mr. Perot would have stayed out of the race.
"What he said to both the Democrats and the Republican delegations was, 'Here's the deal; adopt my plan and you can get me out of the race.' And that was true; he meant it. If they want to take Ross Perot out, that's the way to do it."
In explaining his decision to re-enter the race today, Mr. Perot made clear how central was the motivation that the national debate be focused as he has suggested, although he pinned his decision on his supporters.
In terms that revealed the startling degree to which he regards himself as the embodiment of national sentiment, Mr. Perot described an America in which one man, himself, represented the sacred will of the people, a will that was precisely known to himself, and that had been corrupted and ignored by the Government and the two major parties.
"I know I hurt many of the volunteers who worked so hard through the spring and summer when I stepped aside in July," he said. "I thought it was the right thing to do. I thought the political parties would address the problems that faced the nation.
"We gave them a chance. They didn't do it. But the volunteers on their own forged ahead and put me on the ballot in the final 26 states after July the 16th. The day we were on the ballot in all 50 states, the volunteers requested that I come back in because the political parties had not responded to their concerns."
Some of Mr. Perot's associates and friends say he is driven as well by a desire to rid himself of the hated and unexpected label of "quitter," which was widely applied to him after he bailed out of the race in the middle of the Democratic National Convention, when supporters across the country were laboring to provide the 50-state balloting that he had set as his requirement for declaring his candidacy.
 
A Race Out of Control
 "Ross got out of the race because he had lost control of it," said one political adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "He saw the polls dropping, the money mounting, the continuing stories about 'Inspector' Perot. He hated all that, so he quit."
"But he never expected to be attacked as a quitter," the man continued. He isn't a quitter; he's a very dogged, bulldog kind of guy. And to be tagged with this label, to be called 'the Yellow Ross of Texas' -- that really killed him. And one reason I think he's back in is simply to prove this isn't true, to revive his name."
Some suggest an additional motivation, the intense dislike Mr. Perot is said to harbor for George Bush, a dislike reportedly stemming from the role Mr. Bush played as Vice President in telling Mr. Perot that the Reagan Administration no longer desired his involvment in the issue of whether American servicemen were still being held captive in Southeast Asia.
This view is especially popular within Mr. Bush's campaign. "It is rather clear to me that there is a deep and abiding personal animosity for President Bush on Mr. Perot's part," said Jim Oberwetter, the Bush campaign director in Texas.
Mr. Perot is particularly sensitive to this idea. Asked at a news conference after his re-entry speech today if he was following a "strategy to disrupt George Bush's vote in a number of key states," Mr. Perot erupted in anger, shouting: "Wait just a minute! Wait just a minute! Let me finish!" and dismissing the suggestion as "press myth No. 615."
It is Mr. Perot's expressed intention that from now on he will not answer questions like this, nor concern himself with any discussions of his personality or motivation.
But not even his friends think this is a hope that is very likely to be fulfilled. "I don't think there is anything about the rest of this that is going to make him anything but unhappy," said Mr. Barr. "I think it's going to be more of the same that he hated from before."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Reaction;
Bush Campaign Welcomes Perot As Reconfiguring the Election . . .

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The Bush campaign, searching anxiously for anything that could shake up the Presidential race, said today that it welcomed Ross Perot's formal announcement of his candidacy.
Although Mr. Perot could seriously challenge Mr. Bush in Texas and in Florida, both central to his re-election strategy, Bush aides said they hoped that Mr. Perot would also force Gov. Bill Clinton to expend resources in California, which the Republicans had largely ceded to the Democratic nominee, and in other states for which Mr. Clinton had not budgeted time or money. 
 Bush aides clearly were tailoring their response to the Perot candidacy for public consumption. But their comments, both public and private, reflected the growing sense within the Bush campaign that Mr. Clinton was solidifying an insurmountable lead.
 
'Simply Cannot Hurt'
 "Nothing about the Ross Perot presence hurts us," a senior Bush aide said. "Hey, we're the ones who are losing this election. Either he's going to help us, or we end up where we are, losing. It simply cannot hurt us."
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Bush's offer to have Mr. Perot join the proposed Presidential debates still stood. "He is on the ballot in 50 states," Mr. Fitzwater said. Some Republican strategists said Mr. Perot could erode Mr. Clinton's position as the single alternative to Mr. Bush, and that the President's stature as the incumbent could be enhanced by the presence of another challenger.
But others said they were concerned that Mr. Perot could remind voters about their doubts about Mr. Bush's economic stewardship.
They also said the presence of a third candidate complicated Mr. Bush's plans to conduct a strongly negative campaign against Mr. Clinton. In a three-way race, with two candidates attacking each other, the third candidate can sometimes benefit by avoiding the mudslinging.
Clearly, Mr. Perot worsens Mr. Bush's position in Florida and Texas, but the President planned an effort to solidify his support in those states anyway. He visits Florida on Saturday.

HEADLINE: Energy Bill Cleared for Final Votes

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
After a final flurry of horse-trading, Senate and House negotiators today put the finishing touches on an energy bill that should lower electricity prices and set new efficiency standards for many home appliances but do little to decrease the country's dependence on foreign oil.
Congress first took up energy legislation after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. But two years of back-room haggling, filibuster threats, and skirmishes between the oil and auto industries and environmental groups gradually pruned the bill to a shadow of its former self. 
 By the time the House and Senate passed similar versions earlier this year, the two most far-reaching provisions -- to permit oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to bolster automobile fuel efficiency -- were spiked.
 
 
Effects of Legislation
 Nevertheless, as elements of the bill are phased in over the next few years, motorists will be more likely to drive cars fueled by natural gas or methane, home buyers will receive lower interest rates on mortgages for better insulated homes, and businessmen eventually could become more willing to take a chance on investing in new nuclear power plants because of a streamlining in licensing rules.
While few in the Congress or the Administration are enthusiastic about the legislation, both Republicans and Democrats have said they wanted to prove they could accomplish something before the Congressional session ended.
"We can't leave and leave the work of the nation undone," said Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana and a principal author of the bill.
"We are very pleased with and fully support the progress made by the conferees in moving that much closer to final passage of the energy bill," said Laura Melillo, a White House spokeswoman.
 The most far-reaching provision would revamp 1935 utility regulations, increasing competition between utilities in generating power and removing restrictions on smaller power companies from using power lines controlled by larger utilities.
Leon Lowery, a lobbyist for Environmental Action, said the measure would "mean the profit margin for electric generation is lower and that means that conservation and efficiency will look better to utilities as investments."
The measure also authorizes the Energy Department to provide financing to banks to offer lower interest rates for investments in renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.
In a 12-hour conference session that ended early today as the bill was approved, the pruning continued as Mr. Johnston and Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and the leading House member of the conference, deleted or watered down provisions that hurt industries in their states.
Concerned about the impact on the auto industry, Mr. Dingell weakened a requirement that Government and private vehicle fleets purchase more cars, trucks and buses that run on alternative fuels by requiring a finding by the Secretary of Energy that fuels such as methane or ethanol are available at low prices.
Mr. Johnston insisted that a measure intended to restrict the ability of natural gas producing states from controlling prices be stricken, and replaced by a nonbinding "sense of the Congress" line calling for competitive natural gas pricing.
 
Environmental Groups' Reaction
 Environmental groups had generally expressed cautious support of the legislation until today. But they sharply denounced many changes bargained by the conferees, including the last-minute inclusion of a restriction on the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to set standards for radiation exposure at the proposed radioactive waste dump site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.
Nevada's two Democratic Senators, Richard H. Bryan and Harry M. Reid, said they would use procedural delays to force Senate leaders to delete the Yucca Mountain provision, and kill the entire bill if they fail. They could be joined by Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, who is concerned the bill will open the way to drilling in environmentally sensitive offshore areas of his state.
The Administration successfully lobbied to delete a section containing a moratorium on oil drilling off much of the outer continental shelf and enabling the government to purchase back leases off the Florida, North Carolina and Alaska coasts.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Excerpts From Speech By Clinton on U.S. Role

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from today's foreign-policy speech by Gov. Bill Clinton in Milwaukee, as transcribed by News Transcripts Inc.:
No American foreign policy can succeed if it neglects our domestic needs. And no American foreign policy can succeed if it slights our commitment to democracy. 
 The President often takes a lot of credit for Communism's downfall, but fails to recognize that the global democratic revolution actually gave freedom its birth.
He simply does not seem at home in the mainstream pro-democracy tradition of American foreign policy. He shows little regard for the idea that we must have a principled and coherent American purpose in international affairs, something he calls "the vision thing."
Instead, President Bush seems too often to prefer a foreign policy that embraces stability at the expense of freedom, a foreign policy built more on personal relationships with foreign leaders than on consideration of how those leaders acquired and maintained their power.
It is almost as if this Administration were nostalgic for a world of times past, when foreign policy was the exclusive preserve of a few aristocrats. This approach to foreign policy is sometimes described as power politics, to distinguish it from what some contend is sentimentalism and idealism of a pro-democracy foreign policy.
But in a world where freedom, not tyranny, is on the march, the cynical calculus of pure power politics simply does not compute. It is ill-suited to a new era in which ideas and information are broadcast around the globe before ambassadors can read their cable.
Simple reliance on old balance-of-power strategies cannot bring the same practical success as a foreign policy that draws more generously from American democratic experience and ideals and lights fires in the hearts of millions of freedom-loving people around the world.
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. Let there be no mistake, this world is still a dangerous place. Military power still matters. And I am committed to maintaining a strong and ready defense. I will use that strength where necessary to defend our vital interests. But power must be accompanied by clear purpose.
Mr. Bush's ambivalence about supporting democracy, his eagerness to defend potentates and dictators, has shown itself time and again.
It has been a disservice not only to our democratic values, but also to our national interest. For in the long run I believe that Mr. Bush's neglect of our democratic ideals abroad could do as much harm as our neglect of our economic needs at home.
Let us look at the record. It reflects an unmistakable pattern in the Bush Administration's foreign policy. Fearing attacks by isolationists in his own party, President Bush was reluctant to offer Boris Yeltsin, Russia's freely elected president, a helping hand. It took a chorus of complaints, culminating with the prodding of another Republican, Richard Nixon, to move him into action on the Russian aid package.
Just weeks before the attempted coup in Moscow, President Bush traveled to Ukraine. There he lectured a people subjected to genocidal starvation in the Stalin era, warning that their aspirations for independence constituted, and I quote, "a suicidal nationalism."
A few months later, the people of Ukraine voted by a huge margin for the immediate and total dissolution of the Soviet Union.
ACTION ON THE BALTICS. For over 40 years, the United States refused to recognize Soviet claims to the Baltic nations: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. But when at long last, the moment of Baltic independence came, President Bush suddenly became a reluctant bridegroom.
The United States was 37th among the world's nations to extend diplomatic recognition to these countries. We should have been first.
 
. . .
 In the Middle East, I supported the President when it became necessary to evict Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, and I support his decision now to provide air cover to Saddam's Kurdish and Shiite opponents in the north and the south of Iraq.
But I am angered by the Administration's appeasement of Saddam Hussein before the war and disappointed by its callous disregard for democratic principles after the war.
Just this week another friend of freedom, my running mate, Senator Gore, laid out in precise and devastating detail the errors of this Administration in dealing with Saddam Hussein.
President Bush showered Government-backed grain credits and high technology on a regime that had used poison gas on its own people. After the war, Mr. Bush encouraged the Iraqi people to revolt against Saddam Hussein but then abandoned them.
MIDDLE EAST POLICIES. The Administration has sometimes treated the conflict between Israel and the Arab states as just another quarrel between religions and nations, rather than one in which the survival of a democratic ally, Israel, has been at stake. I support strongly the peace talks that are under way, and if elected, I will continue without interruption America's role in them.
I also believe that America's policy in the Middle East should be guided by a vision of the region in which Israel and Arab partners are secure in their peace, and where the practices and principles of the personal liberty and governmental accountability are spreading.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Stable Quarter To Be in Stocks

BYLINE: By Kurt Eichenwald

 BODY:
BY all rights, the stock market during the last few months should have been a place for only the steeliest investors. An international currency crisis, a market break in Japan, a topsy-turvy Presidential election and an economy stuck in low gear are not exactly the ingredients of a sound, stable equity market.
But for the third quarter just ended, the overall market was more than stable -- it was downright boring, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index gaining about 9 points in the period. In the quarter, almost three-fifths of the stocks in the S.& P. were plus or minus only 10 percent in value, bringing few profits -- or losses -- to many investors. 
 "I think the market has done remarkable well, given the circumstances," said Laslzo Birinyi Jr., president of Birinyi Associates, a Wall Street research firm. "It hasn't made a whole lot of progress and has relatively low volatility."
Much of the reason for the calm stems from the flood of cash that has poured into the marketplace since falling interest rates set off a mad search for higher yields. Even if investors were uncomfortable about stocks, the number of good-looking alternatives narrowed enough that investors persisted with the stock market, albeit with little enthusiasm.
But even in such times, the market can teach lessons. As the old saw goes, investors are putting their money into a market of stocks, not a stock market. And there were a wealth of big winners and losers among stocks to give investors an exciting ride in the last quarter.
Of nearly 4,700 stocks tracked by Media General Financial Services, 2,533 were up in price for the third quarter, while 1,948 were down. Another 189 were unchanged.
The highest proportion of winners was on the New York Stock Exchange, Media General said, where 1,018 stocks, about 75 percent of those tracked, climbed in the quarter, while 710 dropped and 62 remained the same.
On the American Stock Exchange, 265 issues climbed in the quarter while 225 stocks sank and 20 remained the same. Over-the-counter trading saw a similar split, with 1,250 stocks gaining in the period, 1,013 falling and 107 remaining the same.
Investors looking for big developments that might have moved stocks in the absence of strong economic news were able to find them in everything from natural disasters to rapidly changing energy prices to takeovers.
Some big winners owed part of their success to the damage from Hurricane Andrew. After a seven-year slump, natural gas stocks were helped by shortages caused by the hurricane, and a cool spring and hot summer that combined to cause rapid price increases that are sure to fall to the bottom line.
That made oil and gas companies among the biggest winners for the quarter. On the Big Board, four of the top stocks -- Pogo Producing, Mesa, Cabot Oil and Gas and Western Gas Resources -- owed much of their gains to the bulls' appetite for natural gas companies.
Throw in takeover bids, mergers and large asset sales -- which affected Constar International, Nicolet Instruments and Alexander's, respectively -- and almost all of the top 10 are accounted for.
The energy play also spilled over into Nasdaq stocks, where the biggest gainer for the quarter was Prima Energy, a natural gas producer. But that boost also owed something to a Wall Street anomaly: New analyst coverage of the stock began during the quarter, which spread word of the company's values and fueled demand.
On the American Stock Exchange, the biggest winner, Sierra Health Services, caught the other market wave of the quarter: renewed strength in medical stocks. As debate about health programs infused the Presidential campaign, some investors sought a market play in related stocks. Sierra owns and operates a health maintenance organization in Nevada, an insurance company and a medical group.
But for almost every show horse stock there was a nag. On the New York Stock Exchange, the biggest loser was the Presley Companies, a California home builder that fell victim to the turmoil in the real estate market and the troubled California economy.
The low interest rates that helped sustain much of the market's growth for the year also hurt some stocks. Two of the Big Board's biggest losers -- Homeplex Mortgage and T.I.S. Mortgage -- were hurt by falling mortgage rates that cut into revenues.
Hurricane Andrew also cut both ways. While energy companies prospered, some insurance stocks plummeted. The biggest loser in over-the-counter trading was Motor Club of America, an insurance and finance company. Motor Club had a $21 million charge against earnings because of the hurricane, and the condition of its unit in Oklahoma is so tenuous that the state's insurance commissioner said the company could not lend money or make investments without state approval.

HEADLINE: Balance Shifts as Firms Enjoy Buyer's Job Market

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The last of the fall season's recruiters left the University of Pennsylvania law school today, their brief cases filled with resumes. Demand for their time was brisk, they said, and more earnest than it was a few years ago. A tight job market for law students, even those at the nation's most prestigious law schools, has done the trick.
When the law school's placement director, Lyn Davis, talks about the 80's, she looks skyward and says, "That all seems very long ago." 
 This year, the university's Lauder Career Center was fully booked for the 11 days set aside between Sept. 10 and Oct. 1 for the initial interviews by legal employers. The recruiters were there mainly to interview the school's 228 second-year students who are seeking summer jobs at large law firms. Most recruiters found their sign-up sheets filled.
Meanwhile, many third-year students were snapping up offers from the firms that employed them over the summer. Instead of looking for something better, a very 80's thing to do, they were nailing down what they had.
 
The Balance Shifts
 Big law firms still want new associates from top law schools, of course, but this year, students know that the balance of power has shifted to the firms. Even at Penn, where no one is in serious danger of unemployment, the mood ranges from dampened to resigned.
Dean Colin Diver, having reported to the Lauder center one recent morning to greet recruiters, said, "We're still wondering if this year is going to be better than last," which Mr. Diver estimated had been the worst in 10 or 15 years. Then, paper coffee cup in hand, he glanced at the arrivals in suits and said there was no reason to believe it would be.
Ms. Davis said the brunt of the recession's effects had fallen on the class of '92. That group enrolled in law school when firms hungered for bodies and graduated when the same firms were shaking them off payrolls. "They're still getting used to the idea that some big New York firm isn't going to pursue them," she said.
As for their successors, Ms. Davis says they have already scaled back expectations. "I don't know what to say to them," she said. "They are quite realistic, and I'm very grateful to them for adjusting to reality."
Indeed, this year's second- and third-year students have had a few years to contemplate a dismal market. "I didn't come in expecting anything better because people out of college were having trouble getting jobs," said Sara Gold, a second-year student who graduated from the University of Michigan in 1991. Ms. Gold smiled, shrugged and added, "That's why a lot of people are here in law school."
In the fall of 1990, as Ms. Gold was applying, 425 employers interviewed at Penn. In 1991, there were about 325.
"This year we've had a little bit more, well, slippage," said Ms. Davis said, adding, "I'm trying to think of the word you use when people call and break your heart and say, 'We're crossing Penn off our list.' "
Other schools, too, have been crossed off lists. The National Association for Law Placement, which represents law schools and about 800 employers, is still compiling figures on this fall's recruiting season. But a survey by The New York Law Journal concluded that the 25 largest New York firms are interviewing at an average of 21 law schools this year, down from 26 last year.
 
Trying to Help
 Carolyn Wehmann of Magness & Wehmann, a Manhattan consulting firm that works for law schools and firms, estimates that in the last five years large East Coast firms have cut their recruiting budgets, including summer program salaries, by half. In addition, she said, many lawyers on the recruiting side complain that their partners say they should "just get out of the business -- that they don't have to do this anymore."
Howard Maltby, dean of students at Columbia University's law school, said his office tries to brief students -- whom he described as "still a little too sanguine" -- on the job market by tracking the summer programs at the 25 largest New York firms. In 1980, Mr. Maltby said, the programs hired 600 summer clerks. In 1990 the figure was 1,200. Last summer it was 850. The number projected for next summer is 800.
 
Lean Times in Midwest
 In this risk-averse population, only the most richly credentialed can be blase. At Columbia, Mr. Maltby said, the number of requests by students for on-campus interviews is up.
Students are also casting resumes around the country. Paula Patton, executive director of the National Association for Law Placement, reported a flow of job inquiries from the East and West coasts inward, a result of the widespread impression -- largely mistaken, she added -- that the Midwest market has not fared as badly in the recession.
At Penn, no letter barrages were necessary just a few years ago. David M. Goldenberg, now at Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge in Washington, recalled that when he was a second-year student, in September 1989, "jobs were pretty plentiful, and, at least at Penn, students didn't feel that pressed."
Mr. Goldenberg talked to about 30 firms on campus, received 25 or 26 invitations to visit firms for further interviews and in the end had 13 or 14 offers.
 
'Meaningless' Chat
 Now, in the same halls, a gray-suited second-year student, who declined to give her name, described the market as "pretty bad" and the 20-minute chats with recruiters as "meaningless."
"If I feel this way," she said, "how do people at smaller schools feel?"
They feel worse, by all accounts. Big firms have "tended to cut out the strong regional schools," said Michael K. Magness of Magness & Wehmann, adding: "Some of these schools have lost as much as 50 percent, even two-thirds, of the numbers they had in '88 and '89."
Perhaps as a result, law graduates are looking outside the field "as never before," said Ms. Patton; that was evident, she said, from her organization's survey of the Class of 1991. Many now work as waitresses and bartenders, and one reported his position as railroad engineer.
"The kids are scared," said M. Norman Goldberger of the Philadelphia firm of Klehr, Harrison, Harvey, Branzburg & Ellers. About to report to one of the Lauder Center's windowless interview rooms for the day, Mr. Goldberger added, "There's a swing back to the way we viewed it in '78," the year he graduated from Penn. "We were really happy to get a job with a big firm."
"It really struck last year," he said. "You get fewer questions about pro bono work and balance of life -- all stuff that's important."
The next day and 19 interviews later, Mr. Goldberger said he had heard repeated inquiries about the number of openings, not just one but two years away. "There are all these financial security questions," he said. "That never used to come up."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Dismal Economic Data Lift Bonds

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Unremittingly dismal economic reports fueled a strong advance in the credit markets yesterday that pushed some short-term Treasury yields to record lows.
But with awful September unemployment figures and Federal Reserve easing widely anticipated today, some analysts wondered whether the credit markets enjoyed today's rally yesterday -- pre-empting another sharp price gain. 
 Ross Perot's re-entry into the Presidential race yesterday afternoon chilled the market just a few degrees, leaving most of the gains intact. The two-year note traded at 3.68 percent, down a tenth of a percentage point to the lowest yield since the Treasury introduced these notes almost two decades ago. The 30-year bond yielded 7.31 percent, with the price up 23/32 ,to 996/32 , or more than $7 for $1,000 of face value.
 
'It Was a Wild One'
 Traders had expected a steady market as they awaited today's release of unemployment figures for September. Prices initially edged up after French and German credit markets advanced on some signs of Bundesbank easing, which might also smooth the way for the Federal Reserve to ease. News that weekly unemployment claims had risen for the fifth week in a row helped a bit more.
Then, when the nation's purchasing managers issued a midmorning report that signaled a contraction in manufacturing for the first time since February, bonds bounded ahead on strong volume.
"It was a wild one," Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, said of his day. "The economic data was unambiguously and consistently horrible."
Mr. Perot's late-afternoon announcement added to the trading-room commotion while subtracting several thirty-seconds from prices across the yield curve, especially at the longer end. "Perot says he enters U.S. Presidential race," said Patrick Rothstein, a Merrill Lynch manager in charge of trading, as he saw the news. "On the tape now. Wow."
A few minutes later, Mr. Rothstein said that political uncertainty on top of economic uncertainty left the markets jumpy indeed. "Isn't this a show?" he said. "It's a real food fight."
 
Whither Bond Prices?
 Question is, who might get hurt if the brawl continues today? Economists and market strategists expect that the September unemployment report will show a loss of more than 100,000 jobs.
Bond prices have already been bid up so much that even a sharp Fed discount-rate cut in response might not lift them further, said Richard Eakle, president of a money-management firm that bears his name. Cash levels in bond mutual funds are at record lows, he said.
Several corporations, deciding yesterday not to chance a continuing rally, sold about $1.8 billion in bonds.
At the short end of the Treasury market, the discount rate on one-year bills rose 9 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to yield 2.9 percent. The yield curve steepened, with record spreads that by now are routine.
In the when-issued market, the new seven-year notes to be auctioned next week traded at a price to yield 5.81 percent.
 
An Unusual Note Sale
 California completed a $5 billion note sale yesterday with a $1.25 billion adjustable-rate issue that involved the largest-ever municipal interest rate swap. Quite a mouthful, that, and abstruse to boot, but an example of how even state governments are involving themselves in high finance.
As a result of the swap, California will save almost $4 million in interest costs and avoid the risks of paying adjustable rates. The state's investors will meanwhile have larger tax-free money-market funds. All this is according to Peter Shapiro, the co-head of municipal derivative products at Citicorp.
Interest rate swaps are agreements that allow participants to trade adjustable- and fixed-rate obligations and income streams. The California notes, which mature April 26, have interest rates that change daily or weekly. Citicorp, First Boston, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley agreed to accept fixed interest payments of 2.57 percent (including fees) and assume the obligation of making the payments at adjustable rates.
To offset this obligation, these banks sold the adjustable payments to tax-free money market funds. Investors in these funds want their interest rates, but not their principal, to fluctuate.
A fixed-rate issue of the same maturity that California sold on Wednesday is costing the state 3.18 percent interest, including fees, Mr. Shapiro said. The limited appetites of the money-market funds, and their investors, kept the state from selling any more of the adjustable-rate notes, he explained.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
100 of Hartmarx's Stores To Be Closed by End of Year

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The HSSA Group Ltd., the investment group that acquired the Hartmarx Corporation's specialty stores last week, will close 100 of the 187 stores by the end of the year, Harvey A. Weinberg, HSSA's president and chief executive, said in an interview yesterday.
Contrary to a report in The Daily News Record, a trade publication, Mr. Weinberg said HSSA would keep 13 of its 16 Wallachs stores open, including the Fifth Avenue flagship. 
 Raleighs, a 12-store chain that is somewhat of a fixture in the Washington area, will be shuttered, as will Kleinhans in Buffalo, Hanny's in Phoenix, Peer Gordon in Cleveland and Arthur Frank in Salt Lake City.
"It sounds like they are closing some of their weakest stores, which will give them a real opportunity in the market," said Alan G. Millstein, publisher of Fashion Network Report, a garment industry newsletter. "Without the distraction of unprofitable stores, they will be a force in the tailored clothing business."
Mr. Weinberg said the closeout sales should be finished by the end of December.
"Sure, it's hard to close these stores, but remember, I sliced away 100 before I left Hartmarx," said Mr. Weinberg, who was in New York to rally the Wallachs sales force. He spent 27 years at Hartmarx, rising up through the retail side of the company to become chairman and chief executive before he resigned earlier this year. "We have to start this new company from a position of strength."
 
Trouble Getting Merchandise
 HSSA acquired the retail division of Hartmarx, a manufacturer of tailored clothing, for a $43 million note due in two years. Before the acquisition, the chains had trouble getting merchandise for fall because some vendors were afraid Hartmarx would file for bankruptcy protection for its retail business. Mr. Weinberg said suppliers had resumed shipments.
He said the best salespeople in the stores to be closed would be offered jobs in other HSSA stores. Mr. Weinberg said he did not yet know how many jobs would be eliminated.
The remaining stores will lower prices of basic merchandise and seek to sell more sportswear and casual clothing to decrease dependence on sales of tailored suits, which have been in a prolonged slump as Americans embrace a more casual style of dress and the economy eliminates more white-collar jobs.
"A lot of our customers have the white-collar blues," Mr. Weinberg said. "But they still have to wear clothes, even if they aren't wearing a suit."
HSSA will also eliminate marginal suppliers, while concentrating on building relationships with manufacturers that supply its most profitable goods. The group has a two-year contract with Hartmarx to buy $35 million worth of apparel, and Mr. Weinberg said he expected the relationship to continue after the contract expired.
F. R. Tripler, the staid purveyor of tailored clothing on Madison Avenue, will remain open, and four Roots stores in New Jersey will also continue operations.

HEADLINE: Economy Worries Market And Dow Declines by 17.29

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks fell yesterday, tripped up by more bad news about the economy. Even the prospect of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve failed to slow the market's decline.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 17.29 points at 3,254.37. Declining issues led gains, 1,036 to 730, on heavy volume of 204 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was off 1.51, to 416.29. The American Stock Exchange index fell 1.91, to 374.81, the New York Stock Exchange index was down 0.73, to 228.73, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 4.94, to 578.33.
The market opened with slight gains, but losses grew throughout the day as news about the economy sank in.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index, a key gauge of the manufacturing economy, fell sharply in September, and the Government reported that new jobless claims rose in mid-September to the highest level in six weeks.
 
Bad Report Todayy?
 "I think there's a general feeling we'll get a bad unemployment report tomorrow," Phil Orlando, equity portfolio manager at Unity Management, said of the September jobs report due today.
Analysts said the stock market was also rattled by speculation that Ross Perot would re-enter the Presidential race. After the close, Mr. Perot announced his decision to resume his run for the White House.
Among individual issues, Medical Care America stayed under pressure, losing 4, to 20 3/8, on news that some stockholders were suing the outpatient medical services company, charging that it issued misleading statements about its revenues and earnings prospects.
Pepsico rose 1 1/4, to 39 1/8. Goldman, Sachs added the company to its priority list.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Activity Slumped in September

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The nation's manufacturing economy, jolted by sagging new orders and less robust production, slumped in September to its lowest level of growth in seven months, according to a monthly survey by the nation's purchasing managers.
The report, which was released yesterday and provides the first look at the nation's manufacturing economy for September, not only portrays anemic economic growth but also the prospect of more of the same for October. The sharp decline in the level of new orders, the engine of production, indicates that it will be some time before the manufacturing sector sees profound improvement, economists said. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of economic activity dropped to 49 percent in September, from 53.7 percent in August. The decline represented the first time the index had fallen below 50 percent since the January reading of 47.4 percent. A reading below 50 percent indicates that the economy is contracting, the group said.
Most alarming, economists said, was the drop in the level of new orders, which stimulate production for the succeeding months. The association's index plunged to 49.6 percent from 59.8 percent.
"These figures reinforce the fact that there is very sluggish expansion in the economy as a whole," said Andrew F. Brimmer, a former governor of the Federal Reserve and president of Brimmer & Company, a Washington-based economic consulting firm.
"After maintaining a high level of growth for seven months, new orders collapsed and the manufacturing sector could no longer sustain growth," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's survey committee and director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes Inc. "Until new orders return to growth levels, the economic malaise will likely continue."
The monthly index is compiled from a survey of more than 300 purchasing managers at a wide range of industrial companies.
The purchasing managers' index of new orders for export was one of the few that indicated an upturn. The index rose to 56.6 percent in September from 53.7 percent in the prior month. That represented the fastest rate of growth since May. Industries that reported high growth in exports included tobacco, printing, glass, paper and fabricated metals.

HEADLINE: Increase in Jobless Claims Sours Outlook for Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
First-time claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 15,000, to 429,000, in the week ended Sept. 19, the fifth consecutive increase, the Labor Department reported today. From Arizona, meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of manufacturing activity fell below 50, indicating contraction, for the first time since February.
The reports, both of which were weaker than expected, came as the economic and political worlds braced for publication Friday of monthly payroll and other labor-market data for September. This will be the final reading of this pre-eminent gauge of economic health before Election Day, with most analysts anticipating a further loss of jobs and perhaps an uptick in the jobless rate. 
 The bad news for President Bush and the Republicans, however, is that October is seen as producing a steady stream of figures reflecting a stagnant economy. Still worse, there is virtually nothing he or anybody else can do to redress matters for electoral advantage.
 "I think it's just going to be an accretion of weak economic statistics that show little or no economic growth," commented Lincoln F. Anderson, a senior economist for Fidelity Management and Research in Boston. "It's too late" for significant change, he added. "It's a done deal."
Even if Friday's report were to be mildly favorable, which a few analysts anticipate, it wouldn't have much effect on the Bush record. Joblessness, for example, has climbed about two percentage points, to the mid-7 percent range, since he came to office.
"The economy is a lost issue for Bush," said Kenneth T. Mayland, chief economist for Society National Bank in Cleveland, adding that "1992 is cooked, it's done." "Stick a fork in it," he said.
The broadest measure of the economy, the total output of goods and services within the nation's borders, is due to be published the Tuesday before Election Day. But while most analysts still believe gross domestic product will have expanded for the July-September period -- resulting in the sixth straight advance -- the gain is not expected to exceed the 1.5 percent annual rate posted during the spring.
In fact, Mr. Bush has yet to match the 3.2 percent advance in G.D.P. posted in the first quarter of 1989, during which he took office. And analysts believe third-quarter growth could be at a very skimpy rate of 1 percent or less.
 Voters looking at indicators with more immediate or clearer personal relevance will want to focus, after Friday's job report, on various sets of figures to be published at midmonth, particularly retail sales and consumer prices.
But analysts say there's little reason to expect significant improvement from August's five-tenths of 1 percent decline in retail sales -- worse when inflation is factored in -- though the numbers may benefit from a late Labor Day that no doubt deferred some back-to-school purchases that would normally have been made in August.
The price figures will very likely be a bright spot, analysts agree, with consumer inflation continuing to be held in check by economic malaise. But low inflation, as millions of voters have by now painfully learned, implies low interest rates and thus low returns on certificates of deposit and other fixed-income investments. Subdued inflation also means a relatively modest increase in cost-of-living allowances for more than 40 million people who receive Social Security and some other Federal benefits.
The 1993 cost-of-living allowance, based on the rise in prices for urban wage earners and clerical workers between the second quarter of 1991 and the second quarter of 1992, will be calculated when the Consumer Price Index is published Oct. 15. A cost-of-living allowance of about 3 percent is expected, the lowest since 1986.

HEADLINE: Big Shearson Charge Seen

 BODY:
The plunge in the Computervision Corporation's stock on Wednesday will probably result in a third-quarter pretax charge of between $100 million and $105 million for Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which holds a 22 percent stake in Computervision.
That estimate, derived from company documents and confirmed yesterday by Shearson officials, represents more than a doubling of an earlier forecast by Shearson that it would take a pretax charge of between $40 million and $45 million because of Computervision. 
 The stock of Computervision took a beating this week in the wake of an announcement by its executives that third-quarter earnings would be "substantially below" expectations. They did not provide further details about the severity of the anticipated loss. The company blamed weak economic conditions in Europe and the United States for its woes.
Computervision's stock closed yesterday at $5.875, down 37.5 cents. On Wednesday, the last day of the Shearson's third quarter, its stock fell $3 to close at $6.25 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Computervision is a maker of software that helps companies design products. It also services computers, but no longer manufactures them.
John Keefe, an independent securities analyst, said this week's turmoil was far more disconcerting to Computervision and its shareholders than to investors in Shearson, for whom Computervision has become an old and familiar problem. Shearson was burdened in the second quarter by a $137 million pretax charge stemming from its investment in Computervision, whose name was recently changed from Prime Computer. Shearson has also lost $83 million in interest not collected on a loan it made to the company.
The two companies joined forces in 1989, when Shearson helped finance a leveraged buyout of Prime Computer. After the buyout, however, Shearson was unable to unload a $500 million loan because of a soft market for junk bonds.
Six weeks ago, Shearson helped Computervision conduct an initial public offering in which stock was sold at $12 a share.

HEADLINE: Two Top Posts Filled at American Ballet Theater

BYLINE: By JACK ANDERSON

 BODY:
Kevin McKenzie has been named the new artistic director of American Ballet Theater and Gary Dunning has been appointed the company's executive director. The announcement was made by Stephen J. Friedman, chairman of the governing trustees of Ballet Theater Foundation, after several months of uncertainty about the company's financial and artistic future.
Mr. McKenzie, who is 38 years old, was a principal dancer with Ballet Theater for 12 years. Mr. Dunning, also 38, joined the staff as assistant to the general manager in 1978 and was the general manager from 1984 to 1986, when he left to become executive director of the Houston Ballet. 
 A Ballet Theater spokesman said that the company's dancers burst into cheers when they were told of the appointments at a meeting yesterday morning.
The new directors will begin work immediately. Although neither has announced plans, it is expected that they will re-examine the company's budget and touring schedule.
 
Merger Plan Dismissed
 The troupe has a budget deficit that has been reported as $4 million to $5 million, and severe cash-flow problems that kept it from paying its dancers last month. A possible merger with the Joffrey Ballet, which is also financially strapped, was discussed by the boards of the two companies, but was dropped.
Mr. Dunning, a native of Bethesda, Md., and a graduate of Princeton University and the London School of Economics, said yesterday: "This is a time of great challenge for American Ballet Theater, and Stephen Friedman and the board of trustees deserve enormous credit for steering the company forward during the last few difficult months.
"We intend to meet these challenges head on, but it can only be with the generous support and active participation of all members of the A.B.T. family that our goals will be realized."
 
Silver Medalist at Varna
 Mr. McKenzie, whose appointment as artistic director had been widely rumored, was born in Burlington, Vt., and received his early training at the Washington School of Ballet. Before joining Ballet Theater as a soloist in 1979, he had been a leading dancer in the Joffrey Ballet and the now-defunct National Ballet of Washington; in 1972 he received a Silver Medal at the Sixth International Ballet Competition in Varna, Bulgaria. He was named a principal dancer of Ballet Theater in late 1979.
Acclaimed widely for his noble style in the 19th-century classics, Mr. McKenzie has also been praised in contemporary ballets by Antony Tudor, Agnes de Mille, Jerome Robbins, Kenneth MacMillan and George Balanchine. He was appointed a permanent guest artist of the Washington Ballet in 1989; he became artistic associate of that company two years later and left Ballet Theater. He has also been associate artistic director of the New Amsterdam Ballet, a small touring group founded by Martine van Hamel.
"For many years, American Ballet Theater was my home as a dancer, and it is with great pride that I return in my new capacity," Mr. McKenzie said yesterday. "The dancers of American Ballet Theater are the finest in the world and represent the pinnacle of artistic achievement."
 
'Extraordinarily Fortunate'
 Mr. Friedman released a statement in which he said: "Kevin McKenzie has enjoyed a prestigious career as one of the leading dancers of his generation and possesses a rich and highly developed knowledge of both the contemporary and classical repertoire. Mr. Dunning has played a key role in the ongoing success of one of the leading regional companies in the United States, and is a highly respected figure on the international dance scene. We are extraordinarily fortunate to have a new generation of leadership by such talented and esteemed figures."
Interviewed after the announcement, Cynthia Harvey, a principal dancer with the company, said: "It was a joyous announcement. Being in limbo has been a scary prospect for the company's dancers. Gary has tremendous qualifications as a manager. And Kevin is a real gentleman, as a dancer, as a partner and as a human being. He's always been helpful and caring, and he told us that he wants to keep the lines of communication open."
Mr. Friedman said that Oliver Smith, the theatrical designer who was the company's co-director with Lucia Chase from 1945 to 1980 and with Jane Hermann from 1990 until the end of last season, would remain in an advisory capacity and hold the title of director emeritus.

Transition In Romania: An Instant History

BYLINE: By Frank Rich

 BODY:
"Mad Forest," first produced by the New York Theater Workshop, has reopened at the Manhattan Theater Club, City Center, 131 West 55th Street. Following are excerpts from Frank Rich's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Dec. 5, 1991.
Three months after the 1989 fall of the Ceausescus, the British playwright Caryl Churchill, a director named Mark Wing-Davey and 10 of Mr. Wing-Davey's acting students went to Romania on what promised to be a preposterous mission. Their aim was to become instant experts on a nation in postrevolutionary turmoil and to make a play about what they saw. Their visit was scarcely longer than a week. 
 Can you picture the results already? The acting students, being by definition romantics, would create a let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom pageant. Miss Churchill, being an archetypal Royal Court Theater ideologue of her day, would insist on equating Elena Ceausescu with Margaret Thatcher.
Or so one might reasonably imagine. But real artists are unpredictable. There is nothing knee-jerk about "Mad Forest," as Miss Churchill named her play, and it turns out to be just as surprising, inventive and disturbing as the author's "Top Girls" and "Fen." The piece has not dated the way newspaper accounts of the same history already have. If anything, this "play from Romania," as it is subtitled, seems to seep beyond its specific events and setting to illuminate a broader nightmare of social collapse, especially in the insinuating production Mr. Wing-Davey has fashioned with a crack American cast.
"Mad Forest" can penetrate beneath the surface of its well-chronicled story precisely because it is not journalism. Only in the second (and least successful) of the three acts, a Living Newspaper in which the company temporarily simulates Romanian accents to recite an anecdotal oral history of the tumultuous week after the massacre of demonstrators at Timisoara, does the play purport to traffic in documentary reality. The rest of "Mad Forest" forgets about the facts, which remain murky anyway in Romania, and exerts a theatrical imagination to capture the truth about people who remain in place no matter what regimes come and go.
Miss Churchill devotes her first and third acts to an examination of two Bucharest families, one of laborers and one of intellectuals, before and after the revolution. The author's technique is elliptical and atmospheric, often in the manner of Eastern European fiction of the Kundera and Havel era.
In Act I, the double lives of people trapped in a totalitarian state are dramatized by gesture and image rather than by the dialogue, which is oblique or insincere, lest the dread secret police, the Securitate, be eavesdropping. In Act III, the liberated Romanians do little but talk, but they often talk over one another, screaming and arguing in paroxysms of xenophobia and paranoia that sometimes seem even more frightening than the sullen episodes of repression that precede them.
As is the playwright's style, some vignettes are meanly funny. But such conventional political satire is eventually overwhelmed by a more surreal form of theater. Mythological figures enter the action, among them an archangel and an elegant Transylvanian vampire drawn by the smell of blood. As the phantasmagoric sequences grow more grotesque, Miss Churchill gives poetic voice to the new crisis of a society in which the old totalitarian order has splintered into a no less malignant disorder. Abruptly the new democrats look suspiciously like the old Fascists and a hunt for class and racial enemies becomes the pathological preoccupation of people who remain hungry and enraged.
By using a small cast to populate this large canvas, Miss Churchill once again provides exceptional opportunities for actors to play multiple roles. What Mr. Wing-Davey achieves with his familiar but often unsung New York ensemble evokes memories of Tommy Tune's achievement with the American cast of Miss Churchill's "Cloud 9" a decade ago.
As designed by Marina Draghici (sets) and Christopher Akerlind (lighting), the physical production conjures up shadowy tableaux as evocative as the play's title, which refers to the dense forest that once stood where Bucharest is now and was, as a program note says, "impenetrable for the foreigner who did not know the paths." Miss Churchill does not pretend to know those paths, either -- each scene is pointedly introduced by a banal sentence read from a tourist's Romanian phrasebook -- but she does see the forest, not the trees. Nowhere is this clearer than in the play's wedding finale, where every element of the production whirls together in an explosively choreographed panorama of drunken revelry and sadistic, retributive violence.
Few lines can be heard over the ensuing pandemonium -- "This country needs a strong man" is one -- and the chaos that engulfs the theater is terrifying. Surely I was not the only American in the audience who found the climax of "Mad Forest," with its vision of an economically and racially inflamed populace on a rampage for scapegoats, a little too close to home.

HEADLINE: Easy Diner's Road Map to the Hudson Valley

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER

 BODY:
IN the 1954 film "The Wild One," Marlon Brando, the leader of a rowdy motorcycle gang, roars into a small town, takes a shine to a cafe waitress, eventually smashes up the place and terrorizes the citizens, then high-tails it out of town. In my less confrontational 1992 fantasy, I bomb into small towns in a gang of one, drop into restaurants with nerdy helmet-flattened hair and wind-blown clothes (no cafe Casanova, to be sure), eat as much as possible while surreptitiously scribbling notes, then careen down the road considerably heavier than I arrived.
Hardly movie fodder, but it's great fun. 
 Perhaps it was the storm clouds as I approached age 40 this year that prompted a burning need for reckless self-expression and put me on a motorcycle. More likely, it was the fact that my 5-foot-2, 106-pound wife, Mireille, kept a motorcycle at our Hudson River Valley home and I felt wimpy tooling around in a Subaru station wagon.
No sooner had I figured out which brake slowed the bike gradually and which could toss you over the handlebars like a well-kicked field goal than I was riding to restaurants. What a way to prepare for a fine meal! Pristine air, magnificent scenery, the exhilarating aromas of fall foliage.
Of course, there are complications in being a chopper gourmand.
Dressing is problematical, especially if you visit a jacket-and-tie establishment. Most of my motorcycle jackets are too tight to wear over a sport coat; I tied mine to bungee cords on the back of the bike, which left it looking as if it had been used as a beach towel all day. Moreover, light-colored pants invariably wind up with biker's lint -- grease spots -- around the ankles. Leather shoes are slippery on the gear pedal, and no matter how carefully you put on a helmet, you arrive at the restaurant with a deranged-looking Lon Chaney hairdo.
Upon buying a bike, I promised Mireille that I would never drink and ride a motorcycle, which should go without saying. So I am reduced to wistful swirling and sniffing at the table, sort of like a dog examining a giant steak bone on the kitchen counter.
Weather is a major issue on a motorcycle gastronomic tour: more than once I arrived at my destination soaked and shivering to meet my dining partners. Then there are the issues of gravel parking lots, a biker's nightmare; dealing with valet parking, doggie bags, and more. To a dedicated biker gourmand, however, these are mere bagatelles that could never deter us from our 500-cubic-centimeter mission.
O.K., gang, as Brando said, let's scramble.
 
Piermont
 The southernmost stop of this rolling gastronomic tour of the Hudson River Valley was Piermont, a little bird's beak of land in Rockland County that juts into the Hudson just south of the Tappan Zee Bridge. I approached via the Palisades Parkway (a relatively smooth ride), then spiraled down toward the waterfront on steep, winding residential streets lined with pastel two-story houses. Piermont Avenue is the busy main commercial thoroughfare with cafes, shops and galleries. It is also a riverside agora for motorcyclists.
The 40 seats at XAVIAR'S AT PIERMONT are hotter than Harley-Davidsons at a small-town parade. Locals reserve weeks in advance. The diminutive, elegant restaurant with waiters in black tie is owned by Peter Xaviar Kelly, the chef, while his brother, Ned, runs the front. Chef Kelly also runs a lavish operation across the river in Garrison, in a mansion bordering a golf course, that is called simply Xaviar's.
The Piermont restaurant is highly refined, essentially French and right on target more often than not. We started with a giveaway of lobster meat in dill sauce with caviar over sliced cucumber, then moved on to terribly salty shrimp with a clashing mango coulis. Much better are the lobster ravioli with a silken butter sauce and the woodsy pasta with morels. An au courant seared tuna with wasabi and soy sauce is perfectly executed, as is black bass gift-wrapped in thin potato slices with a butter-and-chive sauce. Duck breast fanned out over Oriental vegetables studded with confit of duck was a nice idea; however, the duck breast was gray and dryish.
Desserts are wonderful, especially the chocolate souffle cake and the raspberry souffle. Xaviar's also has a big-league French and American wine list with reasonable prices.
 
Brewster
 Brewster, on the east side of the Hudson, is near the intersection of Routes 684 and 22, not far from the Connecticut border. I took a quick detour through the pleasant though economically depressed business district, then headed up Route 22 to THE ARCH, which has been a special-occasion restaurant for Westchester and Connecticut residents for nearly 25 years.
The Arch is a welcoming, unpretentious restaurant, with a little bar near the entrance, a flagstone terrace for warm-weather dining, several small, simply appointed dining rooms, and servers in black tie. This is a pampering place where fine details do not go unnoticed. The cuisine is classical French, with rich, intense sauces and generous portions. The meal I shared with friends was not memorable, but the overall experience was enchanting.
We started with tasty lobster ravioli in a frothy, dill-flavored Champagne sauce, followed by a decent, though strong, commercial smoked duck breast with a warm potato-and-herb dressing. An unbalanced cold cucumber soup packed enough acid to burn a hole through my motorcycle's paint job. The traditional onion soup gratinee, made with a stout beef stock, was much better.
It was a challenge finding a reasonably priced wine on the upscale list, but my party finally went with a crisp and relatively light $29 Ferrari-Carano chardonnay. For a main course, I tried the baby chicken with a Bordelaise sauce to see how the chef could execute that benchmark dish. The kitchen did well on both counts, although the potato timbale and grilled tomato with it were bland. Duck with green peppercorns was pleasing, too, although the same dull vegetables reappeared. Roasted quail, superfluously paired with a grilled tournedo, was nonetheless well turned out. Same vegetables, though.
Pass on the inelegant creme brulee. Instead, try the elegant chocolate souffle or the very sweet (but well-textured) mocha meringue cake. Dinner is prix fixe at $45.
 
Stormville
 A short hop off the Taconic State Parkway just north of Interstate 84 is a don't-blink-you'll-miss-it town called Stormville, home of a most remarkable institution called HARRALDS . This 21-year-old restaurant is the embodiment of the courtly, effusive Harrald Boerger.
"Our trout are as fresh as they can possibly be because they come from a little pond right outside, which you may have noticed on your way in," Mr. Boerger says, adding that his bartender, Eugene, smokes them himself over the finest blend of fruit woods. The trout story goes on for several minutes until you know everything about the happy little flappers except their names.
The setting is romantic, sort of a Teutonic cabin with timbered ceiling, a big stone hearth and brass chandeliers.
As for the food, prepared by Mr. Boerger's wife, Ava Durrschmidt, it nearly lives up to her husband's billing. The trout, smoked with horseradish cream or sauteed, is terrific. Galantine of veal with pistachios is chunky and well seasoned. Main courses include a perfectly roasted duck with Calvados sauce and wild rice, and filet mignon with a well-balanced sauce choron (bearnaise sauce with tomato puree added). A cheese course follows, with port. Desserts are on the heavy side but good: linzer torte, chocolate mousse cake and a poppyseed-apple cake.
 
Millbrook
 The ride through Dutchess County's horse country to ALLYN'S near Millbrook is among the most spectacular in the valley. Well-tended Black Angus farms and magnificent stables for race horses alternate with multi-million-dollar estates. Allyn's, in a 200-year-old reconstructed farmhouse, is a well-meaning place that sometimes lacks the horsepower to meet its ambitious goals. Allyn Katz, the chef and owner, is a Culinary Institute of America graduate who has worked at the Hudson River Club in Manhattan.
I stopped at Allyn's for lunch and sat in the barn board-lined casual dining room with polo prints on the walls. A charming, more formal glassed-in room is open at night.
Gravlax is fine, served with bland yellow lentils. A white bean and escarole soup with chunks of ham is hearty and full flavored. Not so an insipid seafood salad. Best main courses are the simplest: hamburger, skirt steak with tapenade, and grilled chicken with mesclun, roasted peppers and sun-dried tomatoes. Servers have more personality than skill.
Allyn's has an exceptionally well-rounded wine list with a good selection of New York State labels.
 
Cold Spring
 Cold Spring is one of the most beautiful towns in the Hudson Valley, on a bend in the river where the highest mountains between New York City and Albany plunge down to the water. This 19th-century village, filled with antiques shops, inns and restaurants, is a tourist destination in the fall. Most visitors dine at one of the inns or restaurants near the waterfront, none of which have impressed me. Those in the know seek out a friendly publike spot, hidden behind a row of retail shops on Main Street, called VINTAGE CAFE .
One expects tavern grub in this all-wood setting replete with American artifacts. The soft-spoken owner and chef, Christopher Caul, offers a startlingly large selection of international fare, with an emphasis on Mexican. His wife, Cathy, runs the dining room. The salad of goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes is a good way to start, as is the gutsy (and spicy) black bean soup. Chilies rellenos are exceptional, filled with a blend of goat cheese and cheddar and served over a tortilla.
Two of the best main courses sampled were blackened pork tenderloin with guacamole and a mild red salsa, and swordfish in a tomato cream sauce with capers. And if you have been on a motorcycle all day without eating, you might tackle the daunting but well-balanced fettuccine with scallops, lobster and tasso -- the spicy Louisiana sausage -- in a rich lobster cream sauce. On Monday nights the menu is all-Mexican.
I was disappointed to see the list at a Hudson Valley place called Vintage Cafe ignore most local wines. But there are some good buys among California labels.
 
Saugerties
 CAFE TAMAYO was the happiest surprise on this extended motorcycle tour. The trip over the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge at sunset, with the river valley stretching for miles in both directions, was dangerously distracting. Saugerties, about 10 miles north of the bridge along the west bank of the river, seems an odd place for an ambitious restaurant. But Rickie and James Tamayo, hostess and chef respectively, thought otherwise.
Their restaurant, in a brick building dating to 1864, has a magnificent old mahogany bar, a painted tin ceiling, and overhead fans that are powered by a series of belts connected to a motor in the basement.
Mr. Tamayo's essentially American cooking has no particular theme or statement: it's just good, flavorful food for a fair price. We started with fried goat cheese in a light breading with a lush sauce of red peppers and garlic, outstanding potato pancakes studded with smoked salmon, and excellent white bean soup garnished with basil. For main courses, there was succulent braised lamb with saffron rice, and grilled lamb -- overcooked, unfortunately -- with a potato gratin. Confit of duck was falling-off-the-bone tender and rich, with red onion marmalade and wild rice, and aged shell steak with gratineed potatoes was right on target, too.
Mr. Tamayo is serious about his wines, and there are plenty of interesting selections at good prices.
 
Catskill
 LA RIVE, well-hidden in the west bank town of Catskill, looks more like a motorcycle gang's clubhouse than a locally renowned French restaurant. The long, rut-scarred dirt road that winds down to a wooded creek gives first-timers second thoughts. At first glance, the restaurant looks like the porch of a charmless country bungalow, which is precisely what it is. But as soon as you meet Marseilles-born Paulette Macary, an earthy dynamo who founded the restaurant 23 years ago with her husband, Rene (who died in 1987), all doubts are dispelled.
Indeed, guests dine on the porch sitting on vinyl-and-wood chairs at closely assembled tables. Suspended from the ceiling are bird cages that serve as chandeliers. Matronly waitresses serve a big platter holding nine different appetizers, including chick pea salad, lentils in red wine, eggplant salad, cod mousse and pickled herring. A soup course follows: chunky fish chowder that needs salt, and a rather pallid leek-and-potato soup.
Main courses were the best: a special of roasted pork stuffed with brandy-soaked prunes and tasty gratineed potatoes, and rare-cooked lamb with Provencal herbs. Prices are all inclusive and vary according to the entree, in our case $26 and $28.75. Chocolate cake was sweet enough to make a teen-ager groan; peach cobbler looked as if my Honda had run over it, but the fresh peaches were delicious.
La Rive has a short but ingenious French wine list. Mrs. Macary's answer to the computer-generated documents that can be changed weekly is a sheet on which "19" is printed in ink and the last two digits are written in pencil. To change vintages, all she needs is an eraser.
 
Tivoli
 Route 9 along the east bank of the Hudson River, just north of Rhinebeck, is a pleasant blend of rolling farmland and villages dotted with antiques shops. About 10 miles north of Rhinebeck, I turned onto a roller-coaster country lane that leads to Tivoli, a riverside hamlet of one intersection and a smattering of four-story 19th-century brick buildings.
The only action in Tivoli is at a surprisingly good Mexican restaurant, SANTA FE , right in the center of town. On clement days, a wooden porch is filled with margarita-slurping students from nearby Bard College. A motorcycle or two can often be seen parked out front.
This funky, popular spot, with an old wood bar up front and an open kitchen nearby, serves both traditional and contemporary Mexican-style fare that is characterized by clean, distinctive flavors. Among my favorites are the enchilada stuffed with roasted chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and local goat cheese; tacos of chicken, cilantro, onion and mole poblano; grilled pork tenderloin with a roasted pepper salsa, and the lusty black bean stew.
 
Rhinebeck
 Rhinebeck, about 100 miles north of Manhattan on the east side of the Hudson River, offers the biker many attractions: handsome architecture, shopping, antiques, good food and a vintage airplane museum, the Aerodrome, which stages mock dogfights every Sunday. For some reason, scores of bikers show up every week.
Rhinebeck has two restaurants worth visiting. One is THE BEEKMAN 1766 TAVERN, in the Beekman Arms Hotel, purported to be the oldest continuously operated hostelry in the United States. I like the woody pub room with its low ceiling, stone hearth and long bar featuring a good selection of wines by the glass. Many visitors prefer the more formal glass-enclosed porch with a view of the town.
Until two years ago, the food at "the Beek" could have made Colonial soldiers groan. But then the restaurant was taken over by Larry Forgione, the owner of An American Place in Manhattan. Under his full-time chef, Melissa Kelly, quality improved dramatically, yet prices remained pegged to the local economy.
Try the winsome appetizer called house-smoked salmon and potato crisp napoleon, which is layers of salmon and crunchy potatoes with lemon cream and chive oil. Crab cakes are a winner, too, as is the charred carpaccio of beef with grilled wild mushrooms and fried onions.
Recommended main-course specialties include Atlantic salmon roasted on a cedar plank with a pudding of roasted garlic and corn; lamb shank in a lamb broth with barley, beets and tomatoes, and yellowfin tuna encrusted with black sesame seeds. In cool weather, there is a paragon of chicken pot pie.
Just across the street, in downtown Rhinebeck, is a beguiling place called LE PETIT BISTRO, operated by an affable French couple, Yvonne and Jean- Paul Croizer. It's a snug spot, all wood with a little crescent-shaped bar and high-backed banquettes. Mr. Croizer toils in a kitchen the size of a Chevy van, turning out a coarse, well-seasoned pork terrine; good onion soup; roast duck with a charred skin and an orange sauce cut with tart orange zest; tuna steak au poivre, and a beefy sirloin steak. Quality wines are available at affordable prices.
Some 900 miles and 9,000 calories later, my motorcycle fantasy has been fulfilled. This winter, it's back to the Subaru.

HEADLINE: Issues of Race, in Talk and Tragedy

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
None of the panelists on "The Issue Is Race: A Crisis in Black and White" are happy about the state of relations between white and black Americans, but they are not happy about one another either. Tonight's two-hour free-for-all, provoked by Phil Donahue, is marked by the differences in approach and style of the black participants, who, for once, are in the majority.
Starting with what might roughly be considered the left, they include: Sister Souljah, the rap performer who was taken to task by Gov. Bill Clinton for seeming to justify the black youths who helped burn and loot Los Angeles; Dhoruba Bin Wahad, a former Black Panther now described as an activist; Anna Deavere Smith, who wrote and performed a one-woman show about the 1991 race riots in Crown Heights, Brooklyn; Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly of Washington, and Alan Keyes, the Republican candidate for the Senate from Maryland. 
 There is no semblance of a meeting point between the condemnations of white America that dominate Sister Souljah's rap rant and Mr. Wahad's soapbox radicalism on one side, and, on the other, Mr. Keyes's exhortations to use the system to win political and economic power for minorities, even though that may mean an alliance with George Bush.
Sister Souljah's bored and baleful expression when Mr. Keyes makes his argument tells the story. But she does not often settle for silent comment; she outtalks everybody. She is, after all, in the rap game, and when things heat up, Mr. Donahue has difficulty keeping her and Mr. Wahad from taking over. The audience seems to be on their side.
The program is prevented from becoming a Sister Souljah special by a leavening of mini-documentaries. Sylvester Monroe of Time magazine makes a case for government assistance to the inner cities; Tony Brown, who has his own PBS program, "Tony Brown's Journal," argues for the virtues of black self-help, and Cornel West, the director of Afro-American Studies at Princeton University, reports on the success of a multi-racial alliance in a redevelopment plan for New Brunswick, N.J. It can only be taken as a fraternal rebuke to Sister Souljah and Mr. Wahad when Professor West says that "rage, as real and authentic as it is, cannot have the last word."
 
'Murder in Mississippi'
A&E Network
Tonight at 9
Race is also at the center of "Murder in Mississippi," an hourlong report on recent disclosures about the 1964 murder of three young civil rights workers by Ku Klux Klan members.
The main revelation in this account of how James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were taken from their car and killed near Philadelphia, Miss., is that a black informant within the civil rights movement kept track of their whereabouts for state officials, who then passed the information along to the Klan. The alleged informant, who is now prominent in the state N.A.A.C.P., denies everything on camera, but the evidence presented here is at least compromising.
Bill Kurtis, who anchors this edition of "Investigative Reports," notes that in the weeks of searching for the bodies of Mr. Chaney, who was black, and Mr. Goodman and Mr. Schwerner, who were white, the F.B.I. found the bodies of nine black men whose disappearance had until then never been investigated. The most chilling thought left by this stark report is that if Mr. Chaney had not been in the company of two white men from out of state, his death, too, would probably have gone unnoticed by the nation. It's the sort of history that breeds Sister Souljahs and Dhoruba Bin Wahads.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Ad Campaign;
Bush: Attacking Clinton's Tax Proposal

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The Bush campaign began broadcasting a new 30-second commercial yesterday. The campaign said it would get national exposure but would not be specific.
ON THE SCREEN -- Opens with a black screen that fades into the legend, "Here's what Clinton economics could mean to you." The announcer says Mr. Clinton has promised to raise taxes only on the rich but that the real story is different. In a departure for campaign ads, the announcer is a woman. The camera then cuts to quick shots of taxpayers, showing their name, occupation and the amount the Bush campaign says their taxes would go up under Mr. Clinton. The ad ends with the new Bush slogan about a Clinton Presidency: "It's wrong for America."
TELEVISION SCRIPT -- Announcer: "Bill Clinton says he'll only tax the rich to pay for his campaign promises. But here's what Clinton economics could mean to you. (John Canes, steam fitter) $1,088 more in taxes. (Lori Huntoon, scientist) $2,072 more in taxes.
"One-hundred leading economists say his plan means higher taxes . . . and bigger deficits. (Julie and Gary Schwartz, sales representatives) $1,191 more in taxes. (Wyman Winston, housing lender), $2,072 more in taxes.
"You can't trust Clinton economics. It's wrong for you. It's wrong for America."
ACCURACY -- Mr. Clinton's promise to tax only the rich is faithfully repeated.
But the estimated tax burdens for the five people mentioned in the commercial are based on economic proposals for which Mr. Clinton has not provided enough information for such detailed analysis or on figures that do not always follow Mr. Clinton's proposals.
The Bush team says Mr. Clinton's estimates of how much he would raise by taxing the richest Americans are wrong. They say that to pay for his programs, people earning somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000 a year will have to pay the higher rate.
 But the Bush campaign uses figures that cannot be reconciled with Mr. Clinton's figures. Bush aides acknowledged that they were making a leap of logic: that Mr. Clinton would not have enough money to keep his campaign promises and will therefore tax the middle class rather than revising his plans.
 The ad makes no mention of Mr. Clinton's proposal for a $60 billion tax cut for the middle class.
SCORECARD -- As it fine-tunes its attack on Mr. Clinton, the Bush campaign is trying to paint him as a tax-and-spend liberal. The spot also tries to portray Mr. Bush as the protector of the middle class, which the Democrats say has been badly burt by 12 years of Republican leadership in the White House. The use of the steam fitter seems intended to identify Mr. Bush with the concerns of blue-collar workers and the overall tone of the ad fits neatly into the appeal to suburban voters that is central to Mr. Bush's electoral strategy.

FIRST FIDELITY CUTS PRIME LENDING RATE TO 5 1/2%

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
The First Fidelity Bancorp of New Jersey cut its prime lending rate yesterday by half a percentage point to 5 1/2 percent, the first bank in the country to reduce the rate in three months. First Fidelity, the nation's 23d-largest bank holding company, said the rate cut applied to all its 523 branches in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The prime rate is used by many banks as a benchmark for a wide range of loans. 
 Other banks did not immediately follow the move by First Fidelity, a banking company, based in Lawrenceville, N.J., that has historically not taken the lead in interest-rate adjustments. The last time the big banks reduced their prime rate was July 2, when they lowered it a quarter percentage point, to 6 percent. The drop yesterday, if it does spread, would put the prime at its lowest level since the summer of 1972, when it stood at 5 1/4 percent.

HEADLINE: The Uses of Ross Perot

 BODY:
He's through with the teasing but not the trifling. At the "request" of what's left of his once-impressive volunteer army, Ross Perot has resumed his Presidential race. His chances of winning are much less than when he quit in July. His only dim practical hope is to confuse and destabilize the contest. But there is one important way in which Mr. Perot's quixotic candidacy can serve constructive purposes.
His economic program, published after his withdrawal, contains many bold and sensible ideas. If he's now willing to carry these ideas to the public and defend them in detail, he will sharpen the debate and do much to educate the country. But that will require a candor and courage he has so far failed to display. 
 Mr. Perot's announcement sounded all the standard chords of piety -- honesty, military valor, selfless service, competitiveness, fiscal responsibility. He produced a Purple Heart from a wounded Vietnam veteran and a touching letter from a child. It was part Sinclair Lewis, part Lee Iacocca, effective except for one creepy line: "I will not," he said, "spend one minute answering questions that are not directly relevant to the issues that concern the American people."
There he goes again: the old imperious Ross Perot. Taken at face value, that sentence would seem to rule out all questions about his arrogance, his occasionally cavalier attitude toward the Constitution, about his penchant for espionage and intimidation. Questions, in sum, about character and style wholly relevant to a candidate's fitness for office.
The good news is that Mr. Perot wants people to ask him about the economy -- how he would eliminate the crushing $4 trillion deficit, rebuild "the job base and the industrial base" and "make the words 'Made in the U.S.A. once again the world's standard for excellence." It will be interesting to see whether he's ready to fully share his answers.
Earlier, Mr. Perot bristled when anyone asked what his positions were. Then after he quit he published a program for deficit reduction and economic revival more detailed than that of Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton.
It contains a lot of pain -- higher taxes on many Americans, sharply higher gasoline taxes, limits on mortgage interest deductions, new taxes on wealthier recipients of sacred entitlement programs. It's not perfect but it warrants serious debate. The trouble is, the program remains within the covers of Ross Perot's book; the candidate himself has shown little appetite for articulating it.
There was a brief hint yesterday that he might now do so. Does he really mean to push up the cost of gasoline for "the average American"? Yes. Gasoline in the U.S. is far too cheap, he said, and a tax could help rebuild crumbling infrastructure.
It was probably the first time in the campaign that Ross Perot has carved beneath the surface of generality. Even if he has no chance to win the election, he could salvage a reputation now marked by caprice by doing more of the same.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Great Grovel

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The banker at the New York dinner party had made a huge loan to a speculator who used the money to take over a fine American business, swiftly spinning the company into bankruptcy.
I asked the banker how he could have made a loan that so quickly cost many workers their jobs. He said if he had passed it up some other bank would have made the loan, and the loan profit. I asked him if that was the way he wanted to go on living his one life; he said no. 
 In Dallas, Republicans and Democrats acted like that banker. They crawled to Ross Perot although most of them were deeply distrustful of him. They were afraid the other fellows would crawl there first and make the vote profit. At least that banker can say he did not know that the borrower was a cheapjack.
Republicans and Democrats knew that Ross Perot had brutally walked out on millions of Americans who trusted him. They knew that his new candidacy, which he announced yesterday, would be a piece of cut-rate trickery -- a way for him to push himself forward as a national leader, at no political cost and with not much out of pocket either.
They knew that the economic plan they were summoned to Dallas to discuss and revere was the Perot Plan Not. He had never endorsed it before he quit. He would have had to defend it in detail and pay in votes for demanding more taxes. Right?
They knew that even now he is not capable of more economic expertise on his own than waving his paperback around on TV, when he can find it.
When the going got tough, Mr. Perot got out. He dropped back in when it looked nice and easy. With only a few weeks left, he could not be pushed very hard on economics -- nor on other plans he promised but never delivered. He announces that personal matters are beneath him so he will discuss only Real Issues. Then he ducks issue-questions. I love it.
The Repubocrats -- in Dallas nobody could tell the pilgrims apart -- had come to know Mr. Perot, well. Before Dallas they asked, with that knowing nudge -- what's ticking away inside that man, anyway?
But when he crooked his finger, they ran to Dallas, pumping up his cruel farce to national drama. They did not speak what they knew about Mr. Perot, because the other party was fishing for his votes or blessing. So they all pretended he was still worthy of national trust.
One happy thought: Neither Republican nor Democrat will have the right to use the word "pander" again about a living soul.
I suppose that if Republican leaders could sit smirking at their convention while Patrick Buchanan, in his sour passions, called America to holy war against itself, why, bending to kiss whatever part of Ross Perot was available was no trick at all.
But haven't Democrats told us they are dying for the chance to change the old hypocrisies and govern America in a cleaner way? I recall that. But they sure did kiss him -- quick.
Even Al Gore, that good man we New Yorkers like to like, told David Frost that Mr. Perot was a team player and hinted he would be acceptable in a Clinton cabinet.
Ross Perot? Wasn't he the player who walked off the field after the press called a strike or two on him during the early innings, smartly giving the finger to his team, umpires and audience, all?
Cabinet? Al, say it isn't so.
The worst part about that Dallas show is this: Hypocrisy is poison ivy -- it rubs off on you.
I was surprised that so many fine people of both parties made themselves part of it. I winced when I saw them standing around looking embarrassed after the closed seances with the master and his disciples.
But when I ran into one of them later and asked him how come he went, and he said, well, the party asked him, what could he do, all I did was nod, and say sure.
The Dallas exhibition increases American political cynicism. And it makes both parties more vulnerable to that great team player when, soon enough, he sticks it to them again.
But in sweet hope eternal, let us dream that the major candidates will now stand straight about Mr. Perot, just because they do not want to live their one lives with dusty knees.
They may lose some votes. But they may pick up more from Americans who do not want to live that way either; never can tell.

HEADLINE: Senate Endorses Pact to Reduce Strategic Arms

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
With a decade of negotiations and an era of superpower rivalry gone by, the Senate endorsed an arms control treaty today that sharply reduces the numbers of long-range nuclear weapons held by the United States and four republics of the former Soviet Union.
Even greater cuts in nuclear arms are already planned under a later agreement reached last June by President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. That agreement, currently being translated into treaty language, would cut warheads to 3,000 in the Russian arsenal and 3,500 in the American one, less than a third of today's levels. 
 But the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which was signed in July 1991 and was voted on by the Senate today, carries importance beyond its numerical reductions in warheads. The treaty breaks new ground by actually reducing rather than merely limiting the growth in the most powerful weapons.
 
Reductions Already Under Way
 Some of those reductions are already under way, but the treaty makes them legally binding, and it dictates that the arms to be removed include some of the powerful land-based varieties that arms control experts consider the most destabilizing and dangerous.
At the same time, it prevents the breakup of the Soviet Union from scattering nuclear forces among several new republics, since only Russia would retain nuclear arms. Ukraine, Belarus and Khazakstan, three newly independent republics where Soviet missiles were based, will have to become non-nuclear states under the treaty's terms.
 
Vote Was 93-6
 That process could take years and may yet prove difficult, arms control experts said. In Ukraine's legislature, for example, there is large resistance to handing over weapons to Russia and embracing non-nuclear status.
If it happens, the disarmament of Ukraine, Belarus and Khazakstan would be the first time that any state with nuclear weapons has renounced them altogether.
The vote on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start, which like all treaties must win the Senate's consent by a two-thirds majority, was 93-6, with only a few conservative members still opposing a pact whose momentum had gained steadily as the Soviet Union crumbled and the tensions between the two biggest nuclear powers relaxed.
The treaty will reduce the total number of long-range nuclear warheads in the United States arsenal to 8,556, compared with 12,646 in 1990. Russia will retain 6,163 warheads, compared with the 11,012 held by the former Soviet Union in 1990.
Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, noting the lingering uncertainties over carrying out the treaty, called it "a dream and a prayer to the tooth fairy."
But Acting Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, in a letter to Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, said approval of the treaty was needed to push the former Soviet republics forward.
"The history of the cold war will not be over until Start is ratified and has entered into force," Mr. Eagleburger said.
 
Soviet Aid Also Approved
 The Senate also passed a foreign aid bill that would provide $417 million to the former Soviet republics if they meet standards for human rights and carry out democratic and economic reforms. The measure would also provide $12 billion in new lending for the International Monetary Fund, some of which might flow to the republics. The House has approved a similar bill.
The treaty approved by the Senate today was negotiated with the Soviet Union, mostly during the Reagan Administration, and was signed at a Moscow summit meeting between President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, in July 1991.
After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia assumed operational control over the Soviet nuclear weapons, and Mr. Yeltsin said at once that Moscow would respect the treaty as negotiated. Under a separate protocol, negotiated after the dissolution of Soviet Union, the republics of Kazakhstan, Belarus and Ukraine have become parties to the treaty as well.
Kazakhstan's legislature has already approved the treaty protocol, which was signed in Lisbon in May by the United States and all four republics in which the Soviet Union based nuclear weapons. None of the other former Soviet republics' legislatures have yet approved it, although they are expected to do so before the end of the year.
But even those votes will not put the treaty into effect. That only happens when all five parties exchange what diplomats call the "instruments of ratification." And neither Russia nor the United States is likely to do so until Ukraine and the other republics take further steps.
Under the protocols signed by all sides, Ukraine and the other republics must declare that they will join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear states, meaning that they give up their nuclear weapons and forswear ever building any more.
The Ukrainian Government has said it hopes to do this, but it cannot guarantee that its legislature will go along, and nobody can say for sure whether the opposition to such a step can muster a parliamentary majority.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 3, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Senate endorsement of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty referred incorrectly in some copies to the new lending approved by the Senate for the International Monetary Fund. It was $12 billion.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Hillary Clinton;
Talking Up To Children On Politics

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER

 BODY:
Hillary Clinton fielded a few tough questions yesterday from some of the children she has said she will speak for if her husband is elected President.
After delivering a speech on education reform at the Bank Street College, Mrs. Clinton visited an eighth-grade government class in the adjoining Bank Street School for Children, where students asked whether the family-leave bill supported by her husband, Gov. Bill Clinton, would hurt businesses, whether children should be allowed to divorce their parents and what she would do to improve public education.
In detailed responses, Mrs. Clinton did not talk down to her audience. 
 "I do not believe it would cause an economic drain, especially since small business is exempt," she said in explaining her support of the family-leave bill. Her 13-year-old questioner nodded gravely throughout her answer, in a respectable imitation of a political reporter who knows he is on camera.
 
Some Friendly Questions
 Other questions were friendly, and some could have been written by the Clinton campaign staff: "How do you feel about being attacked by the Republican Party for being a working mother?" one girl asked. Another wondered, "Why do you think Bush and Quayle would support their own families having an abortion but not the rest of Americans?"
But no one could accuse Mrs. Clinton of pandering to her audience at the school on West 112th Street. In response to a question about battling the pernicious effect of television, she said, "I think schools have to give more homework."
During the school tour, Mrs. Clinton also sang, danced and clapped her hands during a short visit with a group of toddlers. She did her best to appear enthusiastic about participation in "The Jumping Song," hopping up and down in high heels, and joined in another tune that simulates proper tooth-brushing techniques.
Only moments earlier Mrs. Clinton had told educators, including Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, that public schools need a stronger emphasis on early childhood education and more resources.
On her way to expressing support for educators, she paused to take a swipe at Vice President Dan Quayle. "A headline in one of the newspapers today: 'Well, I can't be expected to spell. I only went to public school,' " she said. Mr. Quayle has said he was joking when he complained that the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, would have an unfair advantage in debates because he received a superior, private school education.
But Mrs. Clinton said teachers should also be challenged "to change the way they've always done things." And she said parents, who should work more closely with teachers, often need education in parenting skills and other services.
She recalled a recent conversation with a homeless woman: "I asked her if she was talking to her baby, and she looked at me and said, 'Why? He can't talk back.' "
Mrs. Clinton, whose own dedication as a mother has been questioned by her Republican detractors, allowed that all parents can be intimidated by the school system.
"For overeducated parents like me it's not so easy, either," she said. "I remember the first time Bill Clinton and I went to a teacher conference for our daughter, when she was in kindergarten, and you would have thought we were being hauled up before the Inquisition."

HEADLINE: A Two-Fisted Governor With a 'Foot in Mouth' Style

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss.

 BODY:
Barely a month into his first year in office, Gov. Kirk Fordice visited the annual meeting of the state Parent-Teacher Association and ended up in a shouting match over education financing. Within weeks the group, joined by the state teachers' association, was chanting "recall" outside the Governor's mansion.
 In the half-year since then Mr. Fordice, Mississippi's first Republican governor in 115 years, has frequently come close to choking on what both he and his critics call a brusque, "foot in the mouth" style. He suffered some embarrassing missteps with appointees and saw two of his vetoes overridden by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, a record for a first-year Mississippi governor. 
Democrats and some Republicans say Mr. Fordice, who vowed to bring a businessman's approach to government, is stuck in the strident and confrontational mode of his campaign.
 "Those were good qualities in a campaign, but they have to be moderated as Governor," said Jack Reed, a Republican businessman who was the party's 1987 candidate for governor. "It's early yet, but so far I would have to give him a grade of incomplete."
 
Inexperienced but Unafraid
 The Democratic state auditor, Steve Patterson, said, "He lacks the skills required to build a consensus on problems facing the state."
 But what opponents deride as inexperience and inflexibility, supporterssee as a willingness to skewer special interest groups and the courage to stick to a pledge of no new taxes.
 "Look at the way the special interests are screaming," said Gil Carmichael, a Republican candidate for governor in the 1970's, when the state party was hard pressed to win a race for dogcatcher. "If he were like the old politicians and lawyers who are trained to talk both ways, he would be smooth and slick. But he hasn't learned how to speak and not say anything."
 Mr. Fordice is not the first Mississippi governor to clash sharply with the state's historically strong Legislature. In fact, his Democratic predecessor, Ray Mabus, who styled himself the Harvard-educated face of Mississippi's future, had similar problems before he lost his office to Mr. Fordice.
 But where Mr. Mabus showed some finesse in a clinch, Mr. Fordice has so far been all sharp edges and flying elbows.
 The Governor, a 58-year-old engineer and former construction company president, admits that he can be too blunt for comfort but says he has few apologies for his first months in office.
 "I'm no politician, just an analytical businessman," he said in an interview. "I'm prickly sometimes, and I snap when the press gets negative. And I'm not going to get so guarded that I won't say anything."
 Much of the opposition to Mr. Fordice and his style grow from incidents like the P.T.A. meeting when he came off as insensitive and quick to anger. But he has also been dogged by charges of racism. During the campaign he strongly opposed affirmative action programs and even the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and many blacks and whites in the state said they saw similarities to David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader and neo-Nazi who last year made a losing bid for governor in neighboring Louisiana.
 Mr. Fordice denied charges of racism. But the issue arose again a month after his inauguration, when he responded to a question about a discrimination case that could have forced the state to raise taxes and spend more on historically black state colleges. Before a largely white Kiwanis group, Mr. Fordice vowed to call out the National Guard before he would comply with such an order.
For some, the symbolism was a disturbing echo of the days of "massive resistance" in the early 1960's, when Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama and Gov. Ross Barnett of Mississippi vowed to call out the National Guard in their fight against court-ordered integration.
 After an outcry in the news media, Mr. Fordice said he regretted the comment. After meeting with a group of presidents of the state's black colleges, he said, "I ought to watch my mouth." But he continued to blame the news media for "a far, far reach" in seeing something sinister and racial in his comments.
 
'Pitiful Attempt at Humor'
 Race isn't the only issue on which he has tripped over his tongue. Two months ago, in a discussion with state officials on tourism, he recalled how his historic hometown of Vicksburg had "fleeced those Yankee tourists," treating them as "a renewable economic resource." It was, he said later, a "pitiful attempt at humor."
 Other criticisms revolve around substance rather than style. On the overrides of his veto of a sales tax increase that was intended to aid education, Representative Billy McCoy, the Democratic chairman of the Education Committee who helped draft the bill, said the Governor had shown an unwillingness to compromise and had suffered the setback largely because he presented no real alternative.
 Mr. Fordice also incurred some embarrassment over several appointees to part-time state boards. One businessman he chose for an environmental board had been cited by the board to which he was being appointed as a violator of many regulations that the board had established. Three Fordice appointees to a higher education commission foundered on accusations of improprieties, including conflicts of interest and Medicare abuse, and on questions about their qualifications.
 Democrats said these incidents bespoke "sloppiness" on the part of the Governor's staff, but Mr. Fordice asserted that the opposition to his nominees was purely political.
 As for the override of his veto of the sales-tax increase, he said: "Of course I wish I hadn't been overridden, but there are those people who say that I win either way for insisting on not raising taxes."
 As he moves into his second year, Mr. Fordice has mounted an effort that could give him leverage against his legislative opponents and the "special interests" he derides. The Governor's office has set up a toll-free telephone number that citizens can call to register complaints or concerns about state government. Callers will be directed to the appropriate state agency and enlisted in what the Governor calls Team Mississippi to lobby the Legislature with telephone calls and letters. Before contacting the legislators, callers will also be provided with the Governor's proposals on a host of issues, including tort reform, economic development and term limits.
 "In the past, governors here have gone directly to the people on specific issues such as education reforms, but this is the first time a governor has gone directly to the people on a variety of issues," said Johnna Plummer, the Governor's press secretary, who added that in less than a month since the toll-free line had operated there had been about 1,000 calls.
 But Mr. Patterson called Team Mississippi "a public relations gimmick" designed to arouse general opposition to government rather than any strategy for getting programs through the Legislature. He said the Governor's proposals were chestnuts from the conservative Republican agenda that spoke mostly of less government and did little to address the problems of poor Mississippians and average middle-class voters.
 At times such criticism and the unrelenting turmoil that has marked his Administration so far leave him wondering if politics is really his calling. Sitting at his desk in the Governor's mansion, surrounded by stuffed trophies and exotic pelts from his many big-game safaris, he said a bit wistfully that he now had little time for such trips or for indulging his passion for flying his plane.
 "Some of the requirements of the job cramp my style," he said, then added with a smile: "But you know I'm a type-A personality and I'm supposed to thrive on a challenge. So I must be having a ball."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 2, 1992, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 2 about Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi referred incorrectly to the occasion on which he said he would call out the National Guard if the state was directed to raise taxes to finance historically black colleges. The statement was made to the Mississippi Press Asso ciation, not to a largely white local Kiwanis Club. Later, at a meeting of a Kiwanis group, Mr. Fordice ex pressed regret for it. The error was reported to The Times last week by the Governor's public affairs office, which said telephone messages left earlier at the newspaper's Atlanta bureau went unanswered.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Media;
Perot to Unveil A Big Ad Pitch, But Will It Sell?

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
One day after Ross Perot announced that he would be running for President after all, he committed to spending almost $1 million next week to buy three half-hour blocks of advertising on network television.
An advertising firm, called the 270 Group, has been formed to produce shorter television and radio commercials for him. And since the Texas billionaire is not accepting Federal election funds, he can spend as much money as he wants on advertising over the next four weeks. 
 But all this may not make much difference for a candidate whose support, according to recent polls, is in the single digits. As the Coca-Cola Company discovered when it tried to roll out New Coke, there are some products that even multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns cannot sell.
 
'At Best a Footnote'
 "No matter what he spends, he is at best a footnote," said Michael Robinson, a professor of government at Georgetown University who has studied the effect of paid advertising on Presidential elections.
Hal Katz, the chief executive officer of Katz Dochtermann & Epstein, a New York advertising firm, put it this way: "He'd have to have one sensational message. He can't do it."
Like most aspects of the revived Perot campaign, the candidate's advertising plans carry the hint of grandiosity. In fact, though, little is known about what these plans entail or to what extent they even exist.
So far, only two things can be said for certain about Mr. Perot's advertising campaign.
The first is that a group of advertising executives, headed by Dennis McLain of Dallas, have formed a quasi-independent firm along the lines of the Bush campaign's November Company to produce commercials for Mr. Perot. The members of the firm, named to reflect the number of electoral votes needed to win the Presidency, have declined to discuss their plans with the press.
The second is that representatives for the candidates have been negotiating with the three broadcast networks to buy a half hour of time on each network next week.
 
Firm Agreement at ABC
 Last night Stephen Battaglio, ABC's manager of media relations, said the network had reached a firm agreement to sell Mr. Perot a half hour starting at 9:30 P.M. next Friday for $620,000. The half hour will pre-empt "Camp Wilder" and lead into "20/20" with Barbara Walters, the show on which Mr. Perot appeared as a guest last night.
At CBS, a spokeswoman said the Perot campaign had contracted to buy a half-hour on Tuesday leading into the National League baseball playoffs, at a cost of $380,000, and pre-empting "Rescue 911." Representatives of NBC said they were still bargaining with the Perot campaign late yesterday.
Even as his campaign was contracting with the networks for time, though, it was unclear exactly what Mr. Perot planned to put on the air. Orson Swindle, the head of Mr. Perot's volunteer organization, told reporters in Dallas that two 30-minute commercials had been produced, one dealing with the economy and the other with Mr. Perot's biography.
But just a few days ago Murphy Martin, a former television reporter who took over the Perot campaign's media operation over the summer, said the Perot biography advertisement existed only in a five-minute form.
Mr. Martin did not return repeated calls to his office yesterday. And representatives of the television networks said they did not know what Mr. Perot planned to put on during his half-hour broadcasts, nor did they have any control over it.
"Political speech is protected by the First Amendment," ABC's Mr. Battaglio said. "He can really do whatever he wants."
It was over the cost of advertising, among other things, that caused Mr. Perot's campaign to fall apart in July.
In the spring the campaign hired Hal Riney, a highly respected San Francisco advertising executive, to produce a series of television commercials. At a meeting in early summer Mr. Perot asked the political consultants he had hired how much money it would take to pay for producing the ads and putting them on the air. One of these consultants, Charlie Leonard, who left the campaign early in July, recalled that Mr. Perot "flipped out" when he was told the cost.
"He said, 'Why would I spend that when I could go on the "Today" show for free?' " Mr. Leonard recalled. "It was at that meeting we learned this guy wasn't really willing to spend the money."
The ads produced by Mr. Riney never appeared, except on ABC's "Nightline." They showed Perot volunteers talking about what the candidate and the campaign meant to them and their children.
In the meantime, though, Mr. Perot continued to get plenty of free media exposure on shows like NBC's "Today," where he will be a guest again on Monday.
Just how much Mr. Perot will be willing to spend on advertising this time is unclear.
The half hours that he has purchased for next week will cost him more than $1 million. While this is certainly not an insignificant amount of money, even by television standards, if Mr. Perot continues to advertise at this rate, with only four weeks left before Election Day, he will spend only a fraction of the $35 million that President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton are each expected to spend on their general election advertising campaigns.
In theory, though, Mr. Perot could spend more than Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton combined between now and Nov. 3. The independent candidate is not receiving Federal matching funds, and thus is not required to abide by Federal spending limits. And since the economy is so slow, there is plenty of 30-second and 60-second spots left to buy both on the networks and on local television stations.
"There is probably an inexhaustible amount of time available," said Saul Cohen, a senior vice president at Slater Hanft Martin, a New York advertising firm. "There is really a glut of time that candidates would find appropriate."
Among the most popular advertising slots for candidates are what are known as "news adjacencies," slots that abut news programs. Other popular slots are during information-oriented shows like CBS's "60 Minutes" or ABC's "Prime Time Live."
 
High Cost of Advertising
 Even though the networks and the local stations are required by law to sell political candidates time at lower rates, it would not be difficult for a candidate to spend tens of millions of dollars on advertising in the next few weeks.
A single 30-second spot during a popular sports event or a top-rated sit-com can cost several hundred thousand dollars. During the season premiere of the CBS show "Murphy Brown," 30-second commercials were selling for about $300,000.
But no matter how much money Mr. Perot spends on advertising -- and some of his former aides, like Mr. Leonard, doubt that it will be that much -- advertising experts and political analysts say it is unlikely that it will make that much difference in the outcome of the election. Just as a big-budget ad campaign could not salvage New Coke, several million dollars of commercials are considered unlikely to sway enough voters to make Mr. Perot President.
Those who have studied the effects of advertising on Presidential campaigns say that the most effective commercials are those that shape the debate and resonate with a candidate's news coverage.
 
Negative News Coverage
 Before Mr. Perot dropped out of the race in July, much of his news coverage was distinctly negative, focusing on reports that he hired private detectives to investigate business rivals and influenced Federal policy for personal gain. This coverage resumed on the day he rejoined the race, with fresh reports that he had investigators check on some of his volunteers.
And a number of polls show that Mr. Perot comes to his revived campaign with such shaky credibility that it seems unlikely that paid advertising alone will restore the public's confidence in him.
Mr. Robinson, the Georgetown professor, recalled the case of another wealthy candidate, John B. Connally, the former Texas Governor, who tried to win the Republican nomination in 1980 by outspending his opponents. Mr. Connally spent some $13 million on advertising before he dropped out of the race. He had one delegate.
"Perot has demonstrated that going around the press doesn't help," Professor Robinson said. "Going through the press doesn't help. And paid advertising won't help. If you ask will any of this do anything, the answer is, 'No."'

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
In Depressed Middle West, Clinton Ridicules President on Economy

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., Oct. 2

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton traveled today to the economically depressed areas of the Midwest that President Bush bypassed on his train trip last weekend to talk about his favorite themes: why George Bush is killing the economy and why George Bush will not tell the truth.
And this evening, campaign officials said that Mr. Clinton, who had been criticized by Mr. Bush over his refusal to take a position on the North American Free Trade Agreement, had decided to support the accord. 
 Many of his supporters oppose the agreement and Mr. Clinton, while declaring that he favored the concept of free trade, has said that he found "glaring omissions" in the 2,000-page trade agreement that President Bush is scheduled to sign on Wednesday.
But a senior Clinton campaign official said tonight that Mr. Clinton would announce his support for the agreement in a speech on Sunday.
Asked about reports of his decision as he arrived in St. Louis tonight, Mr. Clinton refused to comment.
The Democratic Presidential nominee spent the bulk of his day today mounting an attack that was intended to put the President on the defensive about the economy and about new anti-Clinton commercials the Republicans began broadcasting Thursday.
"This is a campaign devoid of any conviction," Mr. Clinton said of the Bush effort. He ridiculed the President as playing down the jobless figures that were released today and said Mr. Bush has misrepresented the Governor's tax plans.
 
'Sucker-Punched Us'
 "Mr. Bush, you sucker-punched us once, and we are not falling for it again," he said to an invited crowd of Democrats at a rally in Toledo, Ohio. "Go away. Go away."
Mr. Clinton all but ignored the re-emergence of Ross Perot, and his aides seemed almost serene in their conviction that the Texas businessman's return to the political stage would not hurt the Arkansas Governor.
But his language about the President was as unstinting as it was harsh.
"Obviously, they've given up on winning on their record, and they don't have any plans for the future," he said. "So the only way they can win is to basically trash and convince people I'm for things I'm not."
The Clinton campaign released its own television commercial today in response to the President's attacks, asserting that Mr. Bush has mishandled the economy.
In Toledo today, Mr. Clinton used the new unemployment figures, which showed that the number of people out of work had decreased by one-tenth of a percent, to bolster his contention that the economy is not rebounding.
"Do you know what Mr. Bush said this morning?" Mr. Clinton said. "He said the unemployment rate had gone down one-tenth of a percent and we were moving in the right direction. Well, in a way we are. We're going to move him out of the White House."
While campaigning in Toledo and Flint today, Mr. Clinton emphasized his support for the concept of free trade, but also assailed the President as permitting the Agency for International Development to shut "plants down here and moving them overseas."
"That's their idea of a jobs program," Mr. Clinton said. "He promised us 15 million jobs. He just didn't tell us where they were going to be created."
Sounding protectionist and laissez faire themes at the same time, Mr. Clinton said: "I'm an expanded trade fellow. I believe in more trade. But I believe in more trade on fair terms."
In Toledo, his campaign invited several hundred Democrats, mainly union workers, to a rally on the parking lot of the Ohio Department of Employment Services. Mr. Clinton used the venue to point out that Mr. Bush's photogenic railroad train tour had bypassed Toledo.
"I'm the guy who came to Toledo," Mr. Clinton told the cheering partisan group. "Well, the train didn't stop here, and the buck doesn't stop there, but you can stop George Bush on Nov. 3."

HEADLINE: Brazil's New Chief Ignites Uproar With Choice of Finance Minister

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Itamar Augusto Franco assumed presidential powers today and immediately created an uproar by appointing a little-known tax lawyer to Brazil's most powerful economic post, Finance Minister.
After the appointment of Gustavo Crause, a Congressman from a poor northeastern state, the key Sao Paulo stock market index dropped 3,711 points, or about 8 percent. And doubts spread about the new Government headed by Mr. Franco, the former Vice President and reclusive politician who today became Brazil's acting President. 
 After 48 hours of bargaining over Cabinet posts, two political parties that led the drive to impeach President Fernando Collor de Mello decided not to join the Franco Government. The leaders of both parties, the Workers Party and the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, are expected to be candidates in the 1994 presidential elections.
"People don't want to commit themselves to something that probably won't work," Alexandre Barros, a political analyst, said here today.
 
'Collor Out! Collor Out!'
 The morning began here with Mr. Collor formally surrendering his presidential powers in order to stand trial on corruption charges in the Senate. Dressed in a gray suit, Mr. Collor appeared dignified and composed if tense as ministers solemnly exchanged farewell handshakes.
"Collor out! Collor out!" jeered demonstrators as Mr. Collor and his wife, Rosane, strode briskly out of the marble and glass Palace of the High Plains to a waiting helicopter.
As the helicopter lifted off, Mr. Franco was exchanging hearty embraces with politicians in the cramped subterranean offices of Brazil's Vice President.
Breaking a three-day public silence, Brazil's new leader vowed in brief comments to reporters, "There will not be any corrupt people in my Government."
But behind the jollity, there was unease over what some described as a hesitant start to Brazil's new Government. Criticizing the "indecision" of Mr. Franco, the Senate went against his wishes by advancing the transfer of power from next Monday to today.
On Wednesday, a survey of Sao Paulo voters showed little confidence in a Franco Government. Of the respondents, 23 percent predicted that a Franco Government would be "good or great," 38 percent that it would be "O.K." and 19 percent that it would be "bad or terrible." Twenty percent did not want to hazard a guess.
 
Business Leaders Disappointed
 Today's appointment of the Finance Minister further eroded business confidence in Sao Paulo, Brazil's economic and financial heart. Business leaders had hoped that Mr. Franco would choose an economist with the experience needed to fight Brazil's inflation and with the polish needed to save an accord on foreign debt by renegotiating economic targets with the International Monetary Fund. Brazil has the developing world's largest foreign debt, about $120 billion, and Latin America's highest inflation rate, 25 percent a month.
Today's newspapers reported that Mr. Crause, a 46-year-old member of the Chamber of Deputies from Pernambuco State, would join the Cabinet as Interior Minister. Late on Thursday, however, Mr. Franco decided to switch him to Brazil's most important economic post.
"Nothing will happen when so much is needed," a mining company president in Rio de Janeiro predicted today. "Crause is not a bad guy, but he's a tax lawyer and knows nothing about the economy."
Alden Brewster, a New York trader in third world debt, said by telephone today, "The guy is completely unknown externally, and that is not good when you have to renegotiate targets with the I.M.F."
To calm worries and the markets, Mr. Crause and Brazil's new Planning Minister, Paulo Haddad, said at a news conference today that they would not unveil any radical economic packages. Mr. Crause warned against people believing in "magical ideas."
As the new minister spoke, Mr. Collor was preparing to move his office to Granjo do Torto, a rustic retreat near here that is Brasilia's version of Camp David. From there, he plans to prepare his legal defense for the Senate trial.
 
No 'Parallel Government'
 Through a spokesman, Mr. Collor has promised not to form "a parallel government." Although Mr. Collor can resign at any time to avoid a Senate trial, he appears to be gambling that Mr. Franco's stewardship will prove so disastrous that the Senate will fail to convict him within six months, allowing him to resume full powers automatically early in April.
"The speculation is that Collor will sit comfortably and wait for Itamar to go bananas," Mr. Barros said. "My fear is that if you have inflation at 45 percent in October, at 80 percent in November, by December people will say that between hyperinflation and a thief, they'd prefer the thief."
But Mr. Franco, who served in the Senate from 1974 to 1989, has many friends there. Several important Senators have predicted that Mr. Collor will be tried and convicted by the end of this year.
In a parallel process, Brazil's Attorney General plans to indict Mr. Collor on corruption charges early in November.
On Thursday, Ibsen Pinheiro, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, dismissed the possibility of a presidential pardon, saying, "An amnesty bill for Collor would not get through here in 300 sessions."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Ross Perot;
Perot Says It Will Take a Year to Enact 'Fair-Share Sacrifice' Plan

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 2

 BODY:
One day after he jarred the Presidential campaign with his announcement that he was re-entering the race, Ross Perot said today that, if he is elected, his plan to balance the Federal budget would not get started until a year after his inauguration.
Interviewed by Barbara Walters for the ABC News program "20/20," Mr. Perot said it would take that long to secure Congressional approval of the legislation needed to implement his economic proposals. 
 "At the rate Congress moves, let's assume you go in the first of '93," Mr. Perot said. "You have everything; the plane's loaded and ready to go in '94. That's warp speed. But in terms of making the hard decisions, I'm saying within a year, with a mandate from the people, millions of Americans demanding that we get on with it, by the end of '93 we would have firm plans in place to restructure health care, rebuild the job base."
As he began his renewed campaign for the White House, Mr. Perot has had to face assertions that his economic plan places too much of a tax burden on the middle class and is such drastic medicine that it would throw the economy into a full-scale depression.
During this evening's interview, Mr. Perot said people are ready to make sacrifices to balance the budget. "We're talking about fair-share sacrifice," he said. "Everywhere I go, ordinary folks who work hard for a living pull me aside and say, 'Ross, I'm willing to do my share. Just make sure it's fair.' "
Mr. Perot's plan, as detailed in his book "United We Stand," calls for balancing the Federal budget in five years. This would be done through a mix of spending cuts and tax increases like a 50-cents-a-gallon increase on the gasoline tax over five years and raising the top marginal tax rates for people making more than $55,550 a year, to 33 percent from 31 percent.
The interview was the first time Mr. Perot had addressed the timing of his economic plans. John P. White, the Eastman Kodak executive who is the chief architect of the plan, has said it should not be begun until 1994 to make sure the economy is sufficiently on the road to recovery. Mr. White has defended the strong medicine and the relatively short timetable to eliminate the budget deficit as necessary to convince financial markets and the Federal Reserve that Federal fiscal policy is seriously addressing the problem so that long-term interest rates could be cut.
When Mr. Perot was asked if he though he could win, he answered that his victory would be less important than getting voters to focus on the need to confont the nation's economic challenges. "I am more than willing to go down in flames if the American people are too soft to face it," he said of his economic plan. "But nobody will ever be able to say that I didn't lay it out for them."
After his dramatic re-entry into the Presidential campaign, Mr. Perot plans to go underground this weekend, his advisers say. Instead of campaign appearances, he will meet with his staff to plot strategy, said Sharon Holman, Mr. Perot's press secretary.
The decision to spend the weekend on strategy reflects the fact that the Texan did not inform his advisers before he declared his re-entry into the race, Ms. Holman said.
"We were literally waiting to see what he would do," she said. "And now we're scrambling."
The staff, however, is much smaller than the group that worked for Mr. Perot before he withdrew from the race in July. Where the campaign had about 150 full-time paid staff members in July, it now has about one-third of that, none with any experience running a political campaign.
"This is the real Perot campaign," said a political consultant who worked for Mr. Perot during the first phase of his campaign and asked not to be identified. "This is the campaign he wanted to do -- no pollsters, no consultants, no internal pundits, no media. It's just him doing what he wants."

HEADLINE: Faulty Income Safety Net: Breaking Rules to Survive

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
After 37 years of marriage, Abelardo and Amanda M. have told the Government that they have separated. They are lying. But, after decades of hard work, it is the only way, they say, that they can survive retirement.
By filling in fake addresses on a couple of forms, they scrape by, guiltily, with an extra $294 monthly from a Federal program called Supplemental Security Income. Still, they run out of money at the end of each month, and search their cupboards for whatever food remains. 
 Created 20 years ago, S.S.I. was intended to guarantee a minimum income -- a safety net below all safety nets -- for those Americans considered most vulnerable: the elderly, the blind and the disabled. But the program, which serves 470,000 in New York State and 5.4 million people nationally, has come under fire recently.
 
'Make Difficult Choices'
 A group of experts hired by the Government to evaluate the program issued a report last month saying the program paid too little, discouraged relatives and friends from taking care of one another and had a bureaucratic backlog that prevented people from receiving help quickly.
"People are forced to make difficult choices whether to pay for food or shelter," said the experts' report, a result of a two-year study by what is called the S.S.I. Modernization Project. "Housing costs sometimes absorb most or all benefits, but the program penalizes people for trying to live together to make ends meet."
Abelardo, who is 66 years old, worked construction, repaired elevators, did just about anything he could get hired to do after coming here from Colombia almost 30 years ago. Amanda, who is 67, worked as a seamstress. They put their four children through Catholic schools. "We don't know English, but we got a good education for our kids," Abelardo said. But none of their children, with loans to pay and children of their own, have enough money to help them, he said. Indeed, they are putting up one of their sons while he goes to college.
Without their subterfuge, her union pension, his food stamps, and the small Social Security benefits each receives would leave them -- when they finish paying $600 a month rent for their shabby Harlem apartment -- with $273 a month to live on.
The advantage to their deception springs from an assumption, carried over from the Social Security system, that two people can live together more economically than they can separately. Hence the benefits available to a couple are 150 percent of those for an individual.
After much discussion, the experts rejected a suggestion that couples receive twice the benefits of singles. "It was more or less decided to keep the uniformity of the Social Security system," said Samuel Sadin, one of the experts, and the deputy director of Hunter College's Brookdale Center on Aging.
But the experts, he said, were more concerned about another disincentive to people living together -- the fact that if their children or friends help them, people like Abelardo and Amanda have to give up some of their S.S.I. benefits.
Recipients who move in with family or friends -- unless they pay rent or buy their own food and cook meals separately -- must give up one-third of their S.S.I. money. And any lesser help they receive from others results in an offsetting benefits cut. Roughly 10 percent of S.S.I. recipients forfeit some benefits because they receive outside help.
Increasing the benefits and changing the family-support provisions would require Congressional action, but Congressional leaders believe there is small chance of that. Representative Thomas J. Downey of Suffolk County, the acting chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee on Human Resources, is planning to hold hearings on the report's findings in the next Congress, but he is skeptical that Congress will act on them, given the size of the deficit.
In New York City single people receiving both state and Federal help through S.S.I. get a total of $6,096 a year -- below the Federal standard for poverty -- even though rents tend to run much higher than elsewhere in the country.
People who are on S.S.I. and also receive Social Security are permitted to keep an extra $20 a month, and some people on S.S.I., like Abelardo, also qualify for food stamps. In most states, they qualify for Medicaid. But even with that extra support they are unable to reach the poverty level, the experts said.
"We're content to let them live on an amount of money that isn't enough to let them get the essentials of life," said Arthur S. Flemming, a former United States Commissioner on Aging and Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare who was the chairman of the group.
Sia Arnason, co-director of the Institute on Law and Rights of Older Adults at the Brookdale Center on Aging, described one woman who went to be recertified for her S.S.I. benefits: "She said that she was doing fine, because her daughter was living in her neighborhood and she would occasionally bring by a bag of groceries.
"And their ears perked up and they said, 'How often does she do that?' And she proudly said, 'Once a week.' And before you know it her S.S.I. benefits are cut by $40 a week."
And so some people, like Abelardo and Amanda, break the rules. Both are American citizens, and, they say, always obeyed the law. Until now. And they don't feel good about the deception.
 
Navigating the System
 "No good," said Abelardo, for whom using his small amount of English seems like a matter of principle. "No good. No."
Some, however, are not able to work the system.
"Sometimes they aren't able to negotiate the system as well as other people, so they volunteer information," said Suleika Cabrera Drinane, executive director of the Institute for Puerto Rican and Hispanic Elderly. "You know, 'My children are helping me, with the rent, with this, with that.' They're proud. But sometimes it isn't even true."
S.S.I. serves a diverse group of Americans, ranging from children who cannot walk to schizophrenics sleeping on city streets to elderly people.
What the recipients share are extreme poverty and difficulty helping themselves -- the reason that, at a time when other welfare programs have drawn political fire for weakening people's will to work, the mission of S.S.I. has no such critics.
S.S.I. bolsters the incomes of its recipients in order to raise them to uniform levels: $422 a month for a single person, which is 74 percent of the poverty level, and $633 for a couple, which is 83 percent. Like Social Security benefits, S.S.I. benefits are raised each year to keep pace with inflation, but there has been no lump-sum increase since the program was started, according to the Social Security Administration.
Although most states tack on a contribution to the Federal money, in only two -- Alaska and California -- do the combined benefits for a single person exceed the poverty level.
New York State adds a maximum of $102.50 to the benefits for a couple, putting them at 96 percent of the poverty level. It adds $86 monthly to the benefits for a single person, bringing them up to about 89 percent of the poverty level.
"Every other country that I study has a much higher guaranteed income for the poor elderly," said Timothy M. Smeeding, one of the S.S.I. Modernization Project experts and a professor at the Maxwell School of Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
Lucille worked as a domestic from the age of 15, but never made enough money to save for her retirement or to qualify for much Social Security. Not that she ever thought about it -- between work and her six children, she was busy enough.
Now Lucille is 69 and living in the Bronx, and she can rattle off her benefits the way most people can recall their telephone numbers. She gets $217 from Social Security, $225 from the Federal Government for S.S.I., and another $86 from New York State.
She sleeps on the couch of one of her sons ("the only one I can depend on," she said) and pays him $234 in rent. That leaves her $294 each month. She would allow only her first name to be used out of fear she would jeopardize her benefits by talking to a reporter.
She said she wants to work, but asthma, high blood pressure, and arthritis have made that impossible. Each month, she runs out of money with two or three days to go.
As she described how she rations funds, she began, suddenly, to cry. "I get so confused sometimes," she said. "Sometimes I think it'd be better if I was dead."
Asked what she would spend a little more money on, if she had it, she didn't hesitate.
"A rib roast, I want," she said. "One more time."
The report by the S.S.I. Modernization Project called for an increase in benefits to raise recipients to about 120 percent of the poverty line, as has been done with some other poverty programs, and an end to the reduction in benefits for people sheltered or fed by their families or friends.
The report also called for allowing people who receive S.S.I. to have savings of $7,000, rather than the current limit of $2,000, and for the Social Security Administration to hire at least 6,000 staff members to reduce an average waiting period of four months for people who file disability claims. Making all the recommended changes would cost $38.8 billion annually by 1997, the report concluded.

The Economy
The unemployment rate slipped a notch to 7.5 percent in September, the Labor Department said in its last pre-election report. Although it was markedly less negative than private economists and the White House had feared, the White House was hard put to find strong points in it, and Democrats were quick to attack. American businesses cut their payrolls by 57,000, also a less severe result than predicted. The Federal Reserve was not impelled to raise interest rates, as many had expected, although it could still do so. The figures, the first comprehensive measure of the economy's performance last month, were greeted with some relief by economic analysts. [Page 1.]
President Bush will veto a bill to regulate cable television prices on Saturday, Administration officials said. But highly placed Republicans said they did not know if they had the votes to sustain the President's veto. Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, said he did not expect a vote on overriding the veto until Monday. [35.]
 
Markets
The Dow industrials plunged 53.76 points, or 1.65 percent, to 3,200.61. Investors were disappointed at the Fed's reluctance to cut interest rates and fearful that earnings would slump. [35.]

The dollar fell against the yen, mark and Swiss franc but rose against the pound and the lira. Gold prices rose. [45.]
Corn futures prices fell to a four-year low ahead of a weekend that promised superb weather for harvesting a bumper crop. [45.]
The average stock mutual fund rose 2.77 percent in the last quarter, outpacing the 30 Dow industrials, which slipped 0.63 percent, but trailing the 3.15 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, Lipper Analytical Services reported. [35.]
 
Companies
An agreement between Eastern creditors and Continental Airlines was approved by Judge Burton R. Lifland. It will compensate Eastern creditors for being shortchanged when it was controlled by Frank Lorenzo and the Texas Air Corporation. [37.]
Two failed banks were closed and sold to other banks. First Fidelity of Newark is buying Howard Savings Bank, also of Newark, and Webster Financial of Waterbury, Conn., is buying First Constitution Bank, New Haven, Conn.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Off the Trail -- Visits With Americans;
Campaign Is a 'Fraud' to the Urban Underclass

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The burned- out buildings have mellowed in the generation since the riots. Like Yorick's skull, they lend an air of ghostly attentiveness as Kenneth Anderson talks about the far-off "perps," the Presidential candidates who have been skirting what he knows and cherishes and despairs of as America's underclass.
"You know, perps," he explained, "as in perpetrators of a fraud." 
 A ghetto etymologist of sorts and a benign ward-healer in the withered civics of the black inner city, Mr. Anderson isn't even angry in his street-shorthand characterization. He is only determined to be accurate, as he sees it, about the Presidential campaign's utter irrelevancy here in one of the original wastelands of modern American politics, the seared urban plains of the Detroit riots.
"Ain't no future with them fronters," he said, offering a further sample of the black English of the "hip-hop" culture.
 
Malcolm's Their Man
 "Fronters" refers to putting up a fake front, he says, smiling dismissively at all the distant hullabaloo over this week's monotonous question: Will the perps ever debate, perchance to grope for fresh sound bites and gaffes, to summon filler for the remaining campaign hours, to portray vivacity on the nation's electronic scrim.
"People here are talking Malcolm, not Clinton or Bush," he said, pointing to Malcolm X, the late black nationalist leader, as the only figure able to stir positive mass responses these days in the realpolitik of the ghetto underclass. "Bush and Clinton seem unscrupulous fellows around here -- 'politricians,' we say, as in 'trick.' "
Mr. Anderson is a 35-year-old inner-city social worker with a keen eye for "cross-over" -- the breaking through to the white world of the more commercially exploitable aspects of the black youth culture. There is hip-hop leaking into the white media and, soon, he predicts, there will be all-out commercialization of Malcolm X himself. Spike Lee's movie on Malcolm opens around election day and that, Mr. Anderson predicts, will prompt this year's one passing nod from the white world's campaign machinery to the urban black plight.
The Detroit man is cynical because he lost all hope of duplicating his father's blue-collar career 10 years ago when he lost his job on the General Motors assembly lines. Since then he has earned a master's degree in urban studies and communications, the better to know the younger black generation he ministers to now as a job locator with a locally respected anti-poverty program, the Lula Belle Stewart Center.
To an outsider, being a job locator for young black males of the inner city would seem to offer all the fulfillment of Charon's piloting souls across the river Styx. This depressed city's unemployment rate is double-digit, and in the local North High School neighborhood it's about 70 percent, by Mr. Anderson's estimate. Down from Webb Avenue, drivers whizzing along the Lodge Freeway can see able-bodied black men holding up cardboard pleas: "Will Work."
The commercial strips of inner Detroit's black neighborhoods are boarded-up mazes studded with lottery, alcohol and fast-food shops where bullet-proof glass muffles the clerk's 'Have-a-nice-day.' It is a pitiful backdrop as Mr. Anderson explains that with the auto factory economy collapsing around young urban blacks and the global economy rushing at them with even more problems of foreign low-wage competition, their despair is about to compound, even beyond the depths of the crack epidemic that ravaged the post-civil rights urban ghettoes.
"Young black people can only look to themselves for help, not to the politicians on the outside," said Mr. Anderson, banishing, as much as being banished by, the distant campaign. "We're on a battlefield here. Martin Luther King said he had a dream, but Malcolm X asked, 'What about the nightmare?' " Emily A. Palmer, the director of the Stewart Center and a canny black social activist of an older generation, listens politely as Mr. Anderson talks about the growing relevancy of Malcolm, not Clinton or Bush, and about the explosive possibilities of the young hip-hop culture, an amalgam of blues, gospel, R-and-B and rap plus the "hard life" influences of a new generation of urban blacks facing widespread unemployment and racial ostracism.
"I don't understand that hip-hop," said Mrs. Palmer, who has created one of the few new specks of hope here lately. She persuaded the Kellogg Foundation to underwrite a program to train young men in construction trades to rehabilitate buildings for stabilizing families and housing unwed teens and their babies.
Mr. Anderson, polite in turn as he runs the program, certifies this as the sort of self-help that Malcolm X would appreciate. But even more, he adds, Malcolm would have spoken out brilliantly for local control of the new Hip-Hop soft drink and the X basketball sneakers, two new white enterprises Mr. Anderson notices in his rounds.
See? The whites still pay some attention, he says, urging a visitor to watch what happens when Malcolm's movie opens. "Why, George Bush might even have to take note of Malcolm then," he said, laughing, as if at the sheerest political satire.

HEADLINE: U.N. Council Votes to Use Iraqi Assets Frozen Abroad

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 2

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council voted today to take control of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iraqi assets frozen outside the country. The seized assets would be used to compensate victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and to pay United Nations expenses in Iraq.
The move means that Iraq will now begin using the proceeds of its huge oil reserves, believed to be the second largest in the world, to meet claims against it and to buy more foreign food and medicine for its people instead of relying on aid. 
 The resolution was adopted by a vote of 14 to 0, with China abstaining. The United States representative, Edward J. Perkins, called the resolution "a reasonable and proportionate response to problems Iraq itself has created."
But the roughly $800 million that the seizure of assets is expected to bring in will not go far toward meeting either the estimated $100 billion in compensation claims filed against Iraq so far or the country's peacetime bill for imported food and medicine of more than $2 billion a year.
 
An Alternative Plan
 And the seizure will not take place at all if Iraq agrees in the next few weeks to an alternative plan under which the Security Council would let it start selling oil again on a regular basis with the proceeds being used for the same purposes under United Nations supervision. This would mean a compensation program in which 30 percent of Iraq's oil revenues of some $17 billion a year would be regularly siphoned off over a couple of decades to meet claims.
When he addressed the General Assembly earlier this week, Iraq's Foreign Minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, said Baghdad now wanted to reopen talks with the United Nations on such an oil-sale agreement after breaking them off last summer. He said Iraq would seek permission to sell $4 billion worth off oil and was ready to give 5 percent of the proceeds in aid to Somalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Today the Foreign Minister estimated that this would leave Iraq $2.6 billion to spend on food and medicine after compensation payments and other deductions.
But in his General Assembly speech, the Foreign Minister made no reference to the United Nations' insistence on monitoring both the oil sales and the distribution of food and medicine inside the country, a demand that Baghdad rejected earlier this year as an insult to its sovereignty.
And today he and his aides ended separate talks with the United Nations about a new aid agreement for Iraq on an inconclusive note. Officials said Iraq still appeared reluctant to concede the degree of supervision that the United Nations wanted over distribution.
The resolution adopted today was drawn up when it appeared that President Saddam Hussein was determined to reject the Council's original oil-sale plan, despite the relief that it promised ordinary Iraqis, who were living in a world of serious shortages and soaring inflation after two years of sanctions.
 
Oil Barrels and Bank Accounts
 The assets to be seized under today's resolution include cargoes of unsold Iraqi crude oil stored in Turkey and Saudi Arabia as well as payments for oil deliveries that were blocked in banks when Iraq's foreign assets were frozen. The total value of these assets is still unclear but diplomats put it at $500 million to $1 billion.
If the resolution takes effect, a third of all the money will be put into a special United Nations compensation fund that will start reimbursing victims of the Kuwait invasion, giving priority to claims by foreign workers, mainly from poor Muslim countries, who lost their savings when they were expelled.
The rest of the money would be used to finance Iraqi imports of essential relief goods, and pay the cost of the United Nations arms inspectors hunting for President Hussein's weapons of mass destruction as well as the costs of the foreign relief workers in the country.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Trail;
Quiet Hecklers Receive Thanks From President

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.

 BODY:
Thirty-two days and counting, and every expectation is that it's going to get nastier.
But take heart from this:
When President Bush was campaigning last week in Ohio, his appearances at Bowling Green and some other stops were marred by noisy supporters of Bill Clinton, some of them chanting, "Liar! Liar!" But at Columbus, a sizable pro-Clinton contingent was content to make its presence felt with only signs and stickers. The catcalls and harassment were kept to a minimum. 
 The President was moved. And as he left Columbus, he scratched out the following on his note pad and gave it to one of the Clinton people:
To the Clinton-Gore folks:
You guys did it right for your team -- but polite
and in the best tradition of U.S. politics.
Don't work too hard against me!
Thanks.
George Bush
 
Now, Let's Hear From a Democrat
 But don't take too much heart.
On Friday, the following note showed up on the bulletin board of the Democratic Party headquarters in Toledo, just north of Bowling Green:
"I want to thank you guys for all you did to make our counter-demonstration in Bowling Green as much fun as it turned out to be. I am encouraged that if Bush ever makes the erroneous decision to come to Toledo, you guys are primed and ready to go. Thanks again for all your help. I hope you had as much fun as I did."
It was signed by Tim Russo, the Clinton campaign coordinator in Ohio. It was headlined, "The Mugging of a President."
 
Some Debate Tips, From an Expert
 As Vice President Dan Quayle goes about preparing to debate Al Gore -- and maybe Ross Perot's running mate, James Stockdale -- he will first study tapes of Mr. Gore in public settings to get a feel for the man. Then, Warren B. Rudman, the retiring Republican Senator from New Hampshire, will come in and play the Tennessee Senator in mock debates.
Warren Rudman knows Al Gore. He is also regarded as one of the quickest minds on Capitol Hill, good on his feet and good on the issues, particularly economics.
 
Some Privacy Tips, From an Expert
 Bill Clinton was campaigning in Wisconsin, traveling from Milwaukee to Madison, and dropped in on a child-care center. He was chatting with an 8-year-old when the youngster asked if a candidate for the Presidency of the United States would like to see a fort. Sure, replied the candidate.
So the two made their way out to a wooded area, finally reaching a collection of sticks, whereupon they fell into a discussion of the merits of privacy.
"Thrill of the day," the Governor said as he came out of the woods.
 
Loose Ends And Double Takes
 *Bush campaign volunteers in the industrial Midwest are passing out "pink slips" to workers leaving auto plants. The partisan message is, if Bill Clinton becomes President, his plan to raise car mileage standards would depress the automobile industry even more.
It is a jungle out there.
*When Barbara Bush was in Cincinnati earlier this week to do a little campaigning, she made the obligatory stop at a local chili joint for some Cincinnati-style red, which, unlike Texas red, smacks of a mysterious pinch of cinnamon, or maybe cocoa, or maybe both. Actually, she ordered a "coney," which, Cincinnati-style, is a hot dog smothered in chili, cheese, mustard and onions.
But hold the onions, requested the First Lady.
"I can't do that to them in Kansas," she explained, referring to the Bush faithful waiting at the next stop.
*Headline of the Week, from The Washington (D.C.) Times:
"Perot Answers Own Call."

HEADLINE: Nuclear Plants Held Hostage to Old Fuel

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The long delay in finding a place to dispose of nuclear wastes is about to collide with the accelerated pace at which the reactors are being retired.
Owners of several aging nuclear complexes are already keeping parts of their plants running for lack of a place to dump the highly radioactive spent fuel, and many more are likely to follow. The cost of doing so could go up to $20 million a year each if the Government cannot keep its promise to take old fuel by 1998. 
 The owners of the 31-year-old Yankee Rowe plant in western Massachusetts, which was shut down earlier this year, put the problem in stark relief this week, when they asked that their wastes be taken before that of other plants. "We're hoping to force the issue," William McGee, a spokesman at Yankee Rowe, said this week.
 
35 Years' Worth of Fuel
 When plants come to an end of their economically useful life, the owners want to seal or raze them. But if the fuel is still there, they must maintain the plants' miles of plumbing and wiring, valves and heat exchangers. Moreover, they must man the control rooms 24 hours a day simply to monitor the deep pools of water that hold the spent fuel. The old fuel contains most of the radioactivity that the plants produced in their lifetimes.
Nearly all the nuclear fuel consumed in the 35-year history of the civilian nuclear program is still stored next to the reactors that used it. The pools were not intended for long-term storage, but they can be adapted to hold the waste relatively easily while the plants are running.
At Yankee Rowe, for example, the Department of Energy is supposed to begin picking up spent fuel on Jan. 31, 1998, the date established by a 1982 law. But even if pickups start on time -- and Yankee Rowe officials and experts in the nuclear industry question whether that will happen -- they are not scheduled to finish until 2018.
"This is unacceptable to us," Mr. McGee said.
If the rest of the plant is shut down, then operating the spent fuel pool will cost $3 million a year, he added. So earlier this week the plant asked to be moved to the head of the line for pickup. The Government now plans to take the oldest fuel first. Some of Yankee Rowe's fuel is among the oldest in the country, but some was used as recently as 1991.
 
Expensive Alternatives
 The department, however, would face opposition from other utilities if it strayed from the current schedule and has given no indication that it will change it. Worse, it has hinted that it may not even be ready to help Yankee Row by 1998.
There are alternatives to store the fuel. If the fuel is old enough, it can be put in casks made of concrete and steel and cooled by natural air circulation, vastly reducing the level of attention and maintenance needed. But doing that at Yankee Rowe would cost $57 million, Mr. McGee said.
Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the utilities have been paying a tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour produced by the reactors to finance a repository. In exchange, the Energy Department was to begin picking up waste on Jan. 31, 1998.
But the law envisioned the waste going straight to a permanent repository, and the Energy Department's efforts to establish one have been severely set back by technical problems and local political opposition. A 1987 amendment to the waste law designated Yucca Mountain, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nev., on the edge of the department's nuclear bomb test range, as the site of the repository. But the department has made little progress in determining whether the site is suitable.
The law also allows for the establishment of a "monitored retrievable storage facility," essentially a fenced-in parking lot for casks. Presumably that could be built quickly, but so far no communities have volunteered to play host. Twenty towns, counties and Indian tribes applied for $100,000 grants from the department to study the feasibility of accepting an interim dump, but four later withdrew. One, Fremont County, Wyo., expressed some enthusiasm, but Gov. Mike Sullivan of Wyoming stepped in recently to block the process.
If the Energy Department misses the 1998 deadline, utilities may sue. "We believe the Department of energy has a financial obligation," Mr. McGee said. "We have already paid over $23 million into the fund."
Yankee Rowe, a small plant owned by a consortium of New England utilities, is an extreme case because it is a single-reactor plant. Southern California Edison plans to close its San Onofre 1 reactor soon, but the extra cost would be smaller because the company has two other reactors operating. But Yankee Rowe will not be alone in its problem, said Paul C. Parshley, senior vice president of Lehman Brothers, who has followed the nuclear industry for years.
 
Decisions Being Put Off
 "We have a number of plants that are going to shut down early," he said. "At the same time the decision to site and build a Federal repository is slipping further into the future." Some utilities, he said, are beginning to consider delaying decommissioning to wait for the Department of Energy to find a place to put the fuel.
Steven P. Kraft, director of nuclear waste and transportation at the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group based in Washington, said the costs could run to $20 million a year for each reactor. If a utility has to pay out money because of delays beyond 1998 by the Department of Energy, he said, "there's no question in my mind that they should seek recovery from the Department of Energy."
In Minnesota, where Northern States Power has run into difficulty trying to establish an alternative way to dispose of the fuel, the state's consumer advocate in utility matters, David Sampsel, said: "Northern States Power and the State of Minnesota were relying on the Department of Energy. We went into the nuclear power business relying on their assurances that the D.O.E. would have a repository for spent nuclear fuel."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Dueling Commercials;
Clinton Squad Snaps Back Quickly at a Bush Ad

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
On Thursday Gov. Bill Clinton saw a Bush campaign commercial on television that made him hopping mad. Today, less than 24 hours later, the Clinton campaign was on the air in 20 states with its own biting rebuttal, accusing Mr. Bush of having the "worst economic record of any President in 50 years."
It was the sort of hair-trigger counterpunch that is not uncommon in state and local politics but is almost unheard of in the layered, cautious bureaucracy of Presidential campaigning, and Mr. Clinton and his staff were crowing about it today. 
 On the campaign trail, Mr. Clinton said he had ordered his staff to prepare a rebuttal ad on Thursday after seeing the Bush commercial. It contends that Mr. Clinton's economic proposals "could" lead to large tax increases for middle-class workers.
"They just made it up and pulled it out of thin air," he told reporters traveling with him today. "It's absolutely false and it's the campaign and kind of Administration that George Bush has given America."
The Democratic media strategist who heads Mr. Clinton's advertising team, Frank Greer, said his staff worked much of the night to produce the 30-second advertisement. The Democratic ad included outside criticisms of Mr. Bush's commercial; the criticisms appeared in this morning's editions of The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
 
Searched for Quotations
 On Thursday night, Clinton campaign workers collected early copies of the Friday-morning editions of major newspapers to search for quotations to use in their commercial, Mr. Greer said. Finished copies of the commercial were delivered to television stations when they opened for business this morning, he said.
Mr. Greer said neither he nor Mr. Clinton are strangers to quick-response ads. Mr. Greer prepared several for Mr. Clinton's 1990 re-election campaign for Arkansas governor, a race in which his opponent, Sheffield Nelson, broadcast several attacks on Mr. Clinton's taxation record.
A Republican political strategist who recently left Washington, David Sparks, said today that such ads are rare in Presidential races, where most major decisions are made by committee and advertising staffs often include Madison Avenue professionals who work at a more measured pace.
But he also said that the ad should not surprise students of Mr. Clinton's election strategy. Mr. Clinton became well-known in his primary campaigns for quick, scorched-earth responses to unfavorable newspaper or television reports on his record or personal life.
And he dissipated the early advantage of a Democratic rival, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, in part with an advertising blitz that took quick, brutal exception to assertions that Mr. Clinton was making economic promises to voters that he could not fulfill.
"They've got a senior person full-time dealing with anti-Clinton stuff," Mr. Sparks said in a telephone interview from his office in Maine. "And a pledge not to let a day go by without rebutting a Bush charge. So while it might be unusual, it's certainly understandable given their tactics."

HEADLINE: Prague Journal;
A Flock of American 'Free Spirits' Nests in Czech Capital's Warm Heart

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Right off Narodni Street in the heart of Prague, around the corner from where the Cuban Cultural Center delivered fiery blasts against American imperialism not long ago, Ron Stillman from Forest Hills, Queens, is drawing customers in droves to taste the infinite varieties at his New York Pizza.
Kathleen R. Burke from Washington, operating from the top floor of an ancient house in the Old Town overlooking Prague's liveliest fruit and vegetable street market, puts out the twice-a-month, slick-paper Czechoslovak Financial Review, financed by high-powered European and American banks and businesses. 
 Matthew D. Morgan of La Jolla, Calif., has started a public-relations agency, and Melinda S. Ewing of Washington is doing public and guest relations and advertising for the city's most expensive hotel.
Steve Haas from Washington runs a busy copying shop. An American laundromat, the only one in the city, is thriving, and so is a gay bar opened by an American.
 
English Spoken Here
 Czech conversation rarely competes with the English of the mostly young customers at Ubiquity, a dark, ear-shattering disco the size of a football field or two, where dancers restore their vigor with Mexican food, brownies and chocolate-chip cookies, exotic delicacies for the Czechs.
From the up-market Lavka below historic Charles Bridge, similar sounds rise, but the largely American crowd is usually formed by M.B.A.'s or recent law school graduates sent here by consulting concerns to scout the business and investment opportunities in the formerly Communist country many view as most likely to succeed.
Americans publish two English-language weeklies. Two work as advisers at Prague Castle, the seat of the President.
The flow of Americans to Prague shows as much variety as Mr. Stillman's pizzas. One thing most do have in common is youth; they are largely in their 20's. There are those who, as Ms. Ewing puts it, are "just hanging out" for a while, as in Paris before it got too pricey. Some stay until their money is gone; others make it last longer by occasionally teaching in a city where studying English has become a passion from grade school through middle age.
"They don't last a long time," Richard Greene of Highland Park, Ill., said of most of the teachers. "I've been here for a year and I'm an old-timer." Mr. Greene, who is 22 years old and graduated from Carleton College in Minnesota last year, is more than a casual teacher. He says he loves the work and obtained a teaching job before coming. He will leave at the end of the year and is feeling nostalgic.
"Obviously it's gorgeous," he said, letting his glance roam over the cobblestoned expanse of Old Town Square, the Gothic Town Hall and the 17th- and 18th-century facades of the palaces, churches and burghers' houses that ring it.
 
1,000 Anmericans Register
 Americans appear to make up the largest group of expatriates. But the Czechoslovak authorities and the United States Embassy have no way of counting the number of Americans living here because no visas are required to enter and only those who wish to do so register with the embassy.
Rebecca Taggart of the embassy said more than 1,000 had so far registered to vote, and 1,200 have signed in as residents. The actual total is assumed to be several times higher. In 1989, the last year of Communist rule, 96 Americans were listed as residents.
The attraction of living in a beautiful city, which World War II spared and the lack of capital of the Communist Government protected against excessive "development," was cited by almost all of a score of American residents interviewed, including those whose primary motive is business opportunity. Neither the rest of the Czech Republic nor Slovakia seems to exert a similar appeal, and the impending breakup of the country into two nations does not affect the expatriates' lives.
"It has beauty, culture and history," Mr. Morgan, who is 26, said of Prague. Ms. Ewing said: "There is that Prague feeling. The architecture is so human. You know things have been happening here for hundreds and hundreds of years."
Many also cite the city's location, which makes trips all over Europe affordable.
Mr. Stillman, 38, saw Prague for the first time when he and 10 relatives took a bus tour to their family roots in Ukraine in 1990 and then crossed into Czechoslovakia.
"Prague was even more beautiful than the rest of the country," he recalled, sitting among the customers of his establishment, which is stark white and decorated with a New York subway map, a large photograph of the Manhattan skyline and the best of the drawings his customers are invited to make while they eat.
Large sheets of paper and boxes of crayons are on every table. Rock music fills the tomato-and-cheese-scented air. Mr. Stillman and his employees wear T-shirts with the shop's logo, recalling that of the New York Mets, and the slogan "Work Hard, Play Hard."
Mr. Stillman, whose partner is a cousin, Allen Wertheim, 34, typifies the qualities that impel Americans more than any others to plunge into what Mr. Morgan called "Dodge City, a really open place."
The stodginess of the anti-consumer attitude of the Communist era, which still characterizes much of this country, clearly brings out geysers of entrepreneurship among mobile young Americans used to a consumer-oriented economy.
 
Czechs 'Not Trying'
 They recognize and profit from the reluctance of Czechs to take the risks involved in filling the gaps in a service-starved city.
"Money is going to be made by people who take risks," Mr. Morgan said. "The Czechs don't know how to make money. They're not trying. They don't know that capitalism is based on hard work."
Mr. Stillman tries. He worked in the garment center, his cousin in the travel business. "Let's start a business here," he recalled he said to Mr. Wertheim shortly after their family bus got here. "He was all for it. We wrote out a business plan."
Mr. Stillman raised $120,000 of starting capital in New York; Mr. Wertheim apprenticed himself at no pay in a pizza place to learn the trade. They arrived here last January.
"We hit the ground running," Mr. Stillman said, describing what to Czechs seems a miracle of slashing through the bureaucracy. "No payments under the table," Mr. Stillman emphasized, just American persistence.
The partners see their present place as the "flagship for a chain," Mr. Stillman said. They plan to open two more outlets in December and January and a "sports bar" with video above the flagship. They are thinking also about producing frozen pizzas for export.
Many Americans cited two things that make Prague attractive: the low cost of living and friendly people. Prices are low only for Westerners used to much worse at home; for Czechs freedom has also meant rising costs.
But for Ms. Ewing to pay $200 a month for the top floor of a villa and a maid who does her laundry is a break from $1,000-a-month rent in Washington. Many of the young travelers -- "free spirits," Mr. Stillman calls the Americans who work behind his counter -- live with families at negligible cost.
"People really love Americans here," Ms. Burke said. Czechs describe this as a reaction to the repression of contact with foreigners in the Communist years. Nonetheless, Czechs and Americans agree that the expatriates keep largely to themselves. The Americans tend to overcome homesickness by spending as much time as possible among themselves. They make up half of his customers, Mr. Stillman said.
Americans and Czechs reported no open resentment of the expatriates. Indeed, David Krch, a psychologist, said: "It's the best thing that happened. It shows our isolation is finished. For the young generation, it's become natural to meet with foreigners."

HOW SAFE A SAFETY NET?
Created 20 years ago, Supplemental Security Income was intended to guarantee a minimum income -- a safety net below all safety nets -- for those Americans considered most vulnerable: the elderly, blind and disabled. But the program, which serves 470,000 people in New York State and 5.4 million people nationally, has come under fire as paying too little and discouraging relatives and friends from taking care of one another.

HEADLINE: Dow Loses 53.76, in Worst Day Since April

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Skittish investors, disappointed by the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut interest rates and fearful that third-quarter earnings will be disappointing, poured sell orders into the stock market yesterday, fueling a broad retreat.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 53.76 points, or 1.65 percent, to 3,200.61. The decline was the biggest since April 7, when the Dow lost 61.94, or 1.9 percent. 
 Broader indexes also slumped, with the Standard & Poor's 500 falling 5.82, to 410.47, while the composite of over-the-counter stocks traded on Nasdaq fell 6.70, to 571.63. There were 13 declining stocks for about every 4 that gained on the Big Board. Volume declined to 188 million shares, from 203.8 million on Thursday.
 
'Investment by Default'
 "This market really needs some good news," said Melissa R. Brown, a quantative analyst at Prudential Securities Research. "Stocks have been an investment by default rather than choice because of the low yield on cash, and that's not enough to sustain any advance."
Analysts said yesterday's biggest disappointment was the lack of any move by the Bundesbank in Germany or the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to encourage economic expansion.
The Fed's inaction was widely attributed to the September unemployment figures, released before trading began, that showed a slight decline in the unemployment rate rather than the slight increase that had been expected on Wall Street. The unemployment figures touched off a small rise in interest rates, depressing bond prices, and that in turn led computerized stock trading programs to begin selling stocks.
"We estimate that 30 points of the Dow's decline came from program trading," said Philip H. Smith, an analyst at Birinyi Associates. The Big Board's limits on program trading were imposed late yesterday once the Dow's loss exceeded 50 points.
Mr. Smith noted that the blue-chip stocks like those in the Dow fell farther than those of midsized companies and that the smaller-capitalization stocks traded on Nasdaq fared best of all yesterday.
"The unemployment figures were strong enough to keep the Fed from acting and too weak to be a good sign for third-quarter profits," Mr. Smith said.
Analysts said fears about earnings disappointments hurt I.B.M., the most actively traded stock, which fell 1 5/8, to a 10-year low of 78 1/2. The company's latest restructuring announcement contained hints that business remained weak.
Similarly, United States Surgical fell 4 3/8, to 59 1/8, as investors reacted to the failure of Leon Hirsch, the company's chairman, to address Wall Street's doubts about the company's earnings outlook at an industry conference this week.
Stanley Works did not leave investors guessing. The manufacturer of hand tools and home-improvement products said it now expected a 10 percent to 15 percent drop in third-quarter earnings, rather than the flat showing it had estimated earlier. Its stock fell 6, to 34.
Retail stocks were also weak. Sears, Roebuck lost 1 1/2, to 43, as the impact of Tuesday's well-received plans to pull back from financial services continued to wane. Wal-Mart Stores fell 1, to 58..
The biggest loser was JWP, the troubled contracting and information-services company. It announced the resignation of David Sokol, its president, and projected losses for the third and fourth quarters. The company's shares fell 3 1/8, to 3 7/8, a drop of nearly 45 percent.

HEADLINE: Registration Of Voters Is Intensifying

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Oct. 2

 BODY:
George T. Younger Sr. figures he has registered about 50 people to vote in the last 10 days, all while selling his "soul dogs" from a street-corner stand here. He has nabbed customers, people waiting for the downtown bus near his cart, and those, like 21-year-old Al-Qumar Lindsay, just passing by.
"I ask everyone who goes by if they're registered," said the 24-year-old entrepreneur, as he guided Ms. Lindsay through the form. "A lot of them just walk by. Others say it won't make a difference. I tell them it will." 
 "I was going to do it," Ms. Lindsay said with a shrug. "I just haven't had the time to go to the school that's doing it and sign up."
As the deadline approaches for registering to vote in the Nov. 3 elections, registration drives have taken on a carnival-like frenzy. Mr. Younger's hot-dog stand is far from the only unlikely place where citizens are securing their right to choose the next President. Registration is going on in diners, at cosmetics counters and during rock concerts, in office lobbies, soup kitchens and, of course, on the streets.
Connecticut Votes, which focuses on registering voters in the work place, has also conducted registration drives at golf tournaments. Broadway stars are registering voters outside theaters. The Body Shop, a franchised cosmetics shop, has registered 25,000 voters in its 100 stores throughout the country, replacing displays of its all-natural eco-correct products with posters that proclaim: "Don't Say You Care if You Don't Care Enough to Vote."
In part, the mad pace comes because among election seasons, the Presidential election is obviously the big one. But many voting experts also believe that this year, hordes of prospective voters have been smacked out of apathy by the nation's bruising recession.
"Just in terms of numbers, we've never seen so many calls before," said Kay Maxwell, president of the Connecticut League of Women Voters. "People keep saying: 'Where can I register?' I really want to vote this year.' I think we're going to see an incredible increase."
At this point, the most current Connecticut tally, from March, reflects a downturn in the number of registered voters since 1988, from 1,784,383 to 1,672,944. But Barbara Steinberger, a spokeswoman for the Secretary of State, said that the reality is likely to be different on Nov. 3 because registration traditionally ebbs after one presidential election and picks up in the weeks before the next one. "We expect that the registration will be even higher than last time," she said.
In New Jersey, one of 15 states that allows citizens to register to vote when applying for a driver's license, registrations have jumped: In 1988, the State Department had registered 27,473 voters from February to September 29. That compares with 88,813 voters for the same period this year, an increase of 223 percent, said Lillian Midge Trainor, director of the state's election division.
 
'Trend Has Been a Decline'
 "About 58,000 of the new voters are these motor voters," Ms. Trainor said. She added that new registrants are not always new voters, but people who have moved from one town to another. She does expect that the state will have about 4 million voters going to the polls, at least as many as four years ago. "The trend has been a decline," she said. "So if the numbers go up or stay the same, that's a pretty good sign."
In New York State, with 8,121,359 registered voters as of July 1, 1992, voter rolls have dropped from 8,618,376 in 1988. But those numbers are expected to increase by several thousand over the next week before the Oct. 9 mail-in and Oct. 10 in-person registration deadlines.
Officials in all three states say that like the election itself, it is still too early too predict how many voters there will be by registration deadlines.
But whether all the registration will lead to a turnout larger than the 50.15 percent of eligible voters who participated in the 1988 election is a big question. Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a private, nonpartisan research group based in Washington, said that individuals who are "herded" into registering in 11th-hour drives tend to vote less than those who register on their own.
"The critical question in voting is motivation," he said. "That doesn't mean that those who were herded into registering won't vote. It's just a lower percentage than the self-motivated voters."
In downtown Newark, volunteers stand on street corners, spouting off reasons to vote ("It's Your Future! "It's Our Future!) with the hard sell of circus barkers. El-Majik Hassad, 23, said he has been trying to register voters for two weeks, with limited success. But he has had more and more comers in the last few days, after President Bush's visit to a labor group here on Tuesday.
"People are saying they're upset because Bush came and didn't even try to reach out to black folk," Mr. Hassad said. "They're saying 'sign me up and tell me where to pull the lever.' "
Last-minute registrants give various reasons. In Manhattan outside the Virginia Theater on 52d Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, where the star of "Jelly's Last Jam," Gregory Hines, was registering voters Wednesday afternoon, those signing cards ranged from an advertising executive who recently moved to Greenwich Village from Texas, a Wall Street bond trader and former military officer who had always voted by absentee ballot and a restaurant manager from Rockaway whose original registration card got lost sometime ago.
Despite Mr. Hines's fame, only a few of the 53 people who registered in a two-hour drive were stargazers. Some stopped to register because it was convenient and others said they were drawn by the intensity of the 1992 political season.
"I want my vote to count this year because it's been a zoo with the election," said Elizabeth Shore, 34, a bookkeeper from Queens Village.
Volunteers registering voters say they cannot tell how many are doing so as Democrats or Republicans. Joe Lenihan, director of Connecticut Votes said, even with the 4,500 new voters the organization expects to register by the state's Oct. 20 deadline, two-thirds to three-quarters of the applicants are registering as independents. "We think there is a basic misunderstanding about registering with a party," he said. "People think that if they register with one or the other, they'll be pigeonholed into voting the party line. Or maybe they're just not sure."
To many civic-minded volunteers, the vote matters even more than the choice. Mr. Stronger, who plans to cut his workday at his hot-dog stand short on Monday, the deadline to register in New Jersey, so that he may devote more energy to registering voters, said he never preaches any candidate. "Some people just don't care," said Mr. Stronger. "But if one person I register votes, I still thinks it makes a difference."
 
Registration Information
 WHO IS ELIGIBLE: Any United States citizen who will be at least 18 years old and who has lived in their municipality for 30 days before the election may vote. Registered voters may request absentee ballots if they expect to be out of their area, if they are ill or if there is a conflict between work or school hours and voting hours.
IN NEW YORK: Deadline to register in person is Oct. 10; mail-in registrations must be postmarked by Oct. 9; absentee ballots must be requested by mail by Oct. 27 and in person by Nov. 2. To find out where to register, call your local county Board of Elections; in New York City call 212-VOTE-NYC.

HEADLINE: Dr. David Caplovitz, an Authority On Spending Habits, Dies at 64

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Dr. David Caplovitz, a sociologist and an authority on American spending habits and misleading sales practices, died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.
He died of cancer of the esophagus, his family said. 
 Dr. Caplovitz came to public notice in 1963 when he was 35 with the publication of what had been his doctoral dissertation at Columbia University two years earlier, "The Poor Pay More" (Free Press). Its contentions sound commonplace today, but did much to advance consumer-protection legislation.
 
'Buy Now, Pay Later'
 A "buy now, pay later" deal, he wrote, can ensnare the poor, uneducated or illiterate with high interest rates, hidden charges and shoddy goods.
Testifying in Washington in 1965, he described how some door-to-door salesmen and inexpensive furniture stores tricked unsuspecting -- mostly poor -- customers into signing "gimmick" contracts that required them to pay twice as much as they thought they would be paying.
At Columbia University's Bureau of Applied Social Research, Dr. Caplovitz directed a four-year study, "Consumers in Trouble: A Study of Debtors in Default." Released in 1971, it was later published (Free Press, 1974). A main conclusion was that courts often act "as collection agents of the creditors" rather than dealing out justice in default cases.
As a professor at City College of New York, he estimated in 1977 that the spreading habit of paying with "plastic" had put 10 million to 15 million Americans hopelessly over their heads in debt. He noticed that thousands of families were driven to credit counselors each year. "Debt entanglement is a major social problem," he said.
 
A Survey of Spending Habits
 A three-year survey completed in 1978, "Making Ends Meet," was based on interviews that delved into everything from people's spending habits to the impact of financial strain on marriages.
A native of New Haven, Dr. Caplovitz graduated from the University of Connecticut and, in addition to his Ph.D. from Columbia, held a law degree from City University of New York Law School at Queens College. He retired as a professor of sociology in February 1991 from City University of New York's Graduate School and University Center.
Since then and until his death, he did legal work for the Budget and Credit Counseling Service in Manhattan, representing indebted consumers. The organization's president, Luther R. Gatling, said yesterday that he was prompted by Dr. Caplovitz's writing to establish the service.
Dr. Caplovitz is survived by a daughter, Abigail of Groton, Conn.; a son, Gideon of Santa Cruz, Calif., and two brothers, Robert Caplow of New Haven, and Alvin Caplow of New York City.

HEADLINE: Few Bright Spots in Last Job Report Prior to Election

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
In the last chance for an improved job report that could help President Bush's re-election chances, the Government said today that the United States lost 57,000 more jobs in September and that the unemployment rate posted a statistically insignificant one-tenth point decline, to 7.5 percent.
The figures, the most comprehensive measure of the economy's performance last month, were greeted with some relief by economic analysts, most of whom had expected job losses twice as high along with a possible uptick in the unemployment rate. 
 But the Bush Administration strained to find a favorable light by which to portray a still essentially grim situation, one in which private-sector jobs have actually fallen by 25,000 since the President took office, far from the millions it had promised, while the unemployment rate has climbed two percentage points.
 
Dow Drops 53.76 Points
 The Federal Reserve was not compelled by the report to make any immediate cut in interest rates, though it could decide to do so at a long-scheduled policy-making session on Tuesday.
In part a result of the Fed's reluctance to act, the stock market retreated broadly yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 53.76 points, to 3,200.61, the biggest decline since April 7, when it lost 61.94. Investors were also disappointed by lowered expectations for fourth-quarter company earnings. [Page 35.]
Bright spots in the employment report, the final job tally before Election Day, were few. The drop in the unemployment rate came only because the labor force continued to shrink, as the economy's weakness was thought to have discouraged some people from looking for work.
 
'Pretty Weak Economy'
 The data "continue to show a pretty weak economy," said Darwin L. Beck, economist for the First Boston Corporation. "We've had really no gain in private employment for many many months."
Democrats seized on the report as a vehicle to attack Administration economic policy, particularly over the longer term. Campaigning outside an unemployment office in Toledo, Ohio, the Presidential nominee, Bill Clinton, complained of 1.3 million lost factory jobs over the last four years and of high overall unemployment "with no end in sight."
President Bush, interviewed on "Good Morning America," called the declines in the jobless rate in July, August and September an encouraging development, evidence, he said, of "slightly improving jobs markets."
Lynn Martin, the Labor Secretary, said a two-tenths of a point decline in the adult unemployment rate last month offered some encouragement as well as the fact that the ranks of the jobless shrank by 128,000, to 9,572,000.
In a separate report, today, new orders to the nation's factories fell 1.9 percent in August, the second straight decline and the biggest since December.
Among the 11 major states whose labor-market figures were individually published today, only Texas experienced a change of clear statistical significance. The jobless rate there spurted to 7.7 percent last month after having fallen to 6.9 percent in August.
The rates for New York, up five-tenths of a point, to 9 percent, and for Pennsylvania, down six-tenths of a point, to 7.6 percent, were regarded as having showed no meaningful change because the relatively small state samples make results volatile. The rate for Ohio, a major political battleground, eased five-tenths of a point, to 7.1 percent.
 
Matter-of-Fact Summation
 In sharp contrast to the eagerness with which today's report had been awaited was the matter-of-fact summation of lackluster results by William G. Barron Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"September labor market data show little change in both employment and unemployment," he told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. "Employment rose in the services industry and declined in the goods-producing industries and also in local government, where the special summer youth programs were being phased out. The unemployment rate was little changed from August but, at 7.5 percent, was down three-tenths of a percentage point from June's high of 7.8 percent."
Yet the results did mask some sizable subsidiary moves, like a sharp, 18-minute cut in the private-sector workweek that reversed an increase of that size in August. Sometimes an expanding workweek indicates overtime for existing workers that subsequently leads to new hiring.
Without the 88,000 decline in government jobs, resulting mainly from a winding down of special summer job programs and from the Detroit school strike, payroll employment would have posted a modest 31,000 increase. On the other hand, the August job loss was revised to show a 128,000 decline instead of the 83,000 initially reported.
American factories lost an additional 26,000 jobs in September, compared with a 92,000 loss in August, with weakness in aircraft, apparel and furniture as well as the erratic automotive and food-processing industries. Construction lost 21,000 jobs, resuming a downtrend that followed small spring gains.
 
More Service Jobs
 Services, however, added 72,000 jobs, including 18,000 in health, 9,000 in transportation and 7,000 in finance while retail trade was unchanged after skidding 79,000 in August.
The payroll survey also showed a 1.3-point drop, to 120.4, in the index of aggregate weekly production hours but a rise to 49 percent from 42.4 percent in the percentage of 356 industries raising September job levels.
According to the department's survey of households, employment fell 36,000 while the work force fell 164,000, reducing the number of number of jobless and the jobless rate.
The median duration of jobless spells jumped to 9.4 weeks from 8.9, the report showed, but the average spell edged up only to 18.3 weeks from 18.2. The number of people jobless for less than five weeks, the newly unemployed, fell by 13,000.
The department's quarterly survey of discouraged workers -- those who have given up looking for a job because they think it futile -- rose slightly over the summer but after rounding the figure remained at 1.1 million. Fewer blacks and men were discouraged but they were offset by more discouragement among whites and women.
Average weekly earnings of private-sector production workers dropped 1.1 percent last month, reflecting shorter hours, while average pay per hour eased two-tenths of 1 percent, the report also showed.

HEADLINE: Utilities Lead Stock Funds' Modest Gains

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Reflecting the performance of broad market averages, stock mutual funds registered unexciting gains during the third quarter.
Values of the average stock fund rose by 2.77 percent during the last three months, Lipper Analytical Services reported yesterday. The gain outpaced the 0.63 percent decline in the Dow Jones industrial average and the 2.27 percent rise in the Russell 2000 index but narrowly trailed the 3.15 percent gain in the Standard & Poors 500 index. 
 "It was a good quarter," said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. "But you had to be in the right stocks, like utilities and natural resources."
The last three months were not at all kind to investors in international stock funds. Currency crises hammered European equity markets, while continued poor economic performance in much of the rest of the world dragged down share prices from Asia to Canada.
All five of the worst-performing sectors tracked by Lipper Analytical were overseas funds. Latin American funds fared the worst, dropping by 11.14 percent after a 12.41 percent decline in the second quarter.
The two worst individual performers were Equi-Wright's Italian and Spanish funds, which fell by 26.70 percent and 24.65 percent, respectively. Financial markets in both countries were badly hurt by the failure of the European Community's Exchange Rate Mechanism to maintain stability between member countries.
"If you stayed home, you made money," said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, a biweekly investment publication that tracks developments in the mutual fund industry.
 
Help From Hurricane Andrew
 Natural disasters, rather than man-made ones, helped to raise the performance of energy-related funds.
"Hurricane Andrew definitely helped in terms of focusing attention on natural gas prices," said Dan Rice, portfolio manager of the MetLife-State Street Energy fund, whose values rose by 13.80 percent in the summer quarter, the best among all funds. Three-quarters of the fund's portfolio is invested in natural gas stocks, Mr. Rice said.
Among sectors, according to Lipper, utility funds recorded the best gains, rising by nearly 5 percent. And small-company growth funds rebounded over the summer after a dismal performance in the second quarter. These funds rose by 3.23 percent after falling by 8.37 percent in the April-June period.
Science and technology funds, which were also pounded in the second quarter, rose by 3.67 percent over the last three months, recovering some of their declines. And the decline in interest rates and a slow but steady firming in building conditions helped to raise values of real estate funds by 3.32 percent.
Money continued to flow into stock mutual funds during the third quarter, but not at the accelerated rate seen during the first half of the year.
"Inflows over the last twelve weeks have been relatively flat, at about $1.3 billion a week, including reinvested dividends," said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif., a firm that collects data on about 4,000 mutual funds.
Among fund sectors, Mr. Adler said that money had been flowing out of funds specializing in health care stocks since the start of September. By contrast, he said that utility funds have shown a steady increase in inflows since July.
Reflecting the decline in interest rates that has accelerated since the start of the year, only two groups of general equity funds tracked by Lipper Analytical have recorded gains for the first nine months. Returns in growth and income funds have risen by 4.97 percent since the start of the year. And during the same period, Lipper's equity income fund index has risen by 4.54 percent.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
For Greenpoint's Poles, an Uncertain Prosperity

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman

 BODY:
AT Shanghai Lee's restaurant in Greenpoint, where the Chinese waiter took the orders in Polish, Andrzej Czeczot, an illustrator, was showing his latest satirical drawings to friends. As an artist and, what is more to the point, as a perfectly legal immigrant, Mr. Czeczot has no objection to seeing both his names in print, but at least two of the others were without green cards and so preferred to be called simply Jurek and Stas.
One of the drawings showed a street in the Brooklyn neighborhood with booths advertising different kinds of forged documents. "Social Security Cards," said one, "Green Cards," said another, and the third offered "Asbestos School Diplomas." This referred to state licenses issued to graduates of a course qualifying them for dangerous and relatively high-paying work in asbestos removal. A year ago the police broke a ring selling such counterfeit permits to Polish arrivals. 
 "You can't get the fake diplomas anymore," said Stas, who gained his own legitimately by completing the course offered by New York State and taught in Polish as well as in English and Spanish. "But you can still get any other kind of documents."
"Remember those war films showing roundups in Warsaw with Nazis looking for Jews and people without papers?" said Jurek, a freelance house painter. "Can you imagine what would happen if there was one here on Manhattan Avenue, God forbid? They would find half had no papers or bad papers."
No one is sure how many of Greenpoint's Poles are illegal residents, how many have come as tourists and overstayed their visas to work as cleaning women, restaurant workers, in construction or demolition or as factory hands. But as the conversation at the Chinese restaurant illustrated, the illegals, vulnerable to exploitation and forced to live lives of hustling and hassling, have had a big impact on the neighborhood.
"The big change came three years ago when the economy started to change in Poland," said Jurek. He explained that before then, as Communism was failing, $40 bought enough zlotys for a family in Poland to live reasonably for a month. Under those conditions people came here with the idea of working for a while, saving and going back. "Back then," he said, "if you could take back $5,000 you were set for life, you could set up a business."
"Now that Poland is an almost normal country, $5,000 is nothing," Stas said. "Even $20,000 won't change your life." As a result, people who may have come intent on going back are here to stay. "Look what happened to me," Stas said. "I came six years ago. I tried this. I tried that. The letters from my wife and daughter stopped. I met a woman here. I still say I am going to go back but I'm lying. My friends know it too."
"We are all here for good," said Jurek. He said that he and his friends pray that the lawyers they keep consulting will eventually find a way for them to become legal immigrants.
Meanwhile, living by their wits and coping with landlords and employers willing to exploit their uncertain status, they have brought energy and conspiratorial cunning to what had been a sleepy ethnic enclave little noticed by the rest of the city. "We may be in a recession but there is not an empty store on Manhattan Avenue," said Mr. Czeczot, the artist. "Legally or not people are working. New little restaurants are opening." Other old-timers agree that in the decade since young Poles like Stas and Jurek flocked to Greenpoint, the neighborhood has grown steadily richer.
One source of this prosperity has come from asbestos removal. This occupation, dominated by Polish and Irish workmen, is thought of as the best of jobs and Stas knows that many in Greenpoint envy him. He says the jealousy is misplaced, describing the work as exhausting, hazardous and not anywhere near as well paying as people think.
"When I was still in Poland I heard that Poles could make $45 an hour pulling away asbestos in New York," Stas said. "All I knew was that it was dangerous but I thought, 'How much more dangerous could it be than breathing the air around Katowice?' " he said, referring to the polluted industrial region where he grew up. "Anyway, for $45 an hour I was ready to bite frogs and jump from church steeples, but I have never seen $45 an hour."
"Look," he said, showing stubs from his pay slips. "I'm lucky if I get $10 an hour and sometimes I have to kick back money to the subcontractors who hire me. Often we don't stop for lunch. We don't get overtime. Sometimes important safety equipment is missing. Sooner or later some of us will get sick. But what can I do? Complain? To who? They'll just replace me with some other illegal Pole waiting for the opportunity."
"You mean like me," said Jurek, smiling and passing around a plate of sweet and sour shrimp.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Corn Prices Hit 4-Year Low; Huge Harvest Is Under Way

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Corn futures prices fell to their lowest point in more than four years yesterday ahead of a weekend that promised superb weather for harvesting what could be the biggest corn crop ever in the United States.
In other trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans dropped to a new 14-month low, and wheat and oat futures also slipped. 
 On other markets, copper futures prices were at their lowest since May amid pessimism about the economy; oil futures were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mostly higher.
Corn for December delivery fell 2.5 cents, to $2.1125 a bushel, the lowest settlement for a near-term corn contract since May 18, 1988.
November soybeans dropped 5.25 cents, to $5.2725 a bushel, the lowest since July 19, 1991; December wheat fell 1.5 cents, to $3.48 a bushel, and December oats were unchanged at $1.335 a bushel.
The price of a bushel of corn fell 5 cents this week as frosty temperatures in the Corn Belt gave way to unseasonably warm weather that was expected to last through the weekend.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, copper for October delivery plunged 1.95 cents, to $1.004 a pound, the lowest price since May 18.
"The poor economic numbers released this week continue to show that the economy is in a very slow growth pattern, and that weighs heavily on the copper market," said Peter Cardillo, research director with Westfalia Investments Inc. in New York. Copper is widely used in manufacturing and construction.
Energy futures turned in a mixed performance on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude oil ended slightly higher but below the day's high of $21.98 a barrel as border tensions between Saudi Arabia and Qatar appeared to ease.
Light crude oil for November delivery rose 9 cents, to $21.92 a barrel; November heating oil slipped 0.02 cent, to 63.85 cents a gallon; November unleaded gasoline rose 0.60 cent, to 58.50 cents a gallon, and November natural gas fell 0.13 cent, to $2.505 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Most livestock and meat futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Cattle futures prices were bolstered by expectations for stronger cash cattle prices next week. Speculative fund buying supported the pork complex.
Live cattle for October delivery rose 0.17 cent, to 75.92 cents a pound; October feeder cattle ended 0.30 cent higher at 83.70 cents a pound; October live hogs rose 0.28 cent, to 43.05 cents a pound, and February frozen pork bellies slipped 0.03 cent, to 39.87 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: N.H.L. Team in Hartford Receiving $4 Million Loan

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 2

 BODY:
In their latest venture in investing in local companies to save jobs in Connecticut, state economic officials have made loans and loan guarantees to Connecticut's sole major-league sports team, the Hartford Whalers, to keep it from leaving Hartford.
The loan agreement, announced Thursday by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., gives the state the right to buy the team if its owner, Richard H. Gordon, a Hartford developer, offers it for sale during the seven-year term of a $4 million loan from the state. In practice, Mr. Weicker said, the state would use that right to arrange another buyer within Connecticut. 
 The Connecticut Development Authority is also guaranteeing $10 million of $25 million in loans from Fleet Bank and Connecticut National Bank.
"The quid pro quo for us is that we have a right of first refusal," the Governor said of any sale of the team by Mr. Gordon. "I don't want to own it. He doesn't want to sell it. But I want to make damn sure it isn't going anywhere else."
 
A Struggling Franchise
 The Whalers, which were brought to Hartford in 1974 by Aetna Life & Casualty and other Hartford-based corporations, have suffered as a hockey team and as a franchise in recent years while the city and state around it were being battered by recession.
Attendance has declined steadily since the 1986-87 season, when the Whalers won the Adams Division in the National Hockey League and averaged 14,574 people a game. This year, with the third-worst record in the league, the Whalers averaged 10,896 fans a game.
Mr. Gordon said the team lost $4.5 million last season, and the sale of season tickets and the arena's 45 luxury boxes for the next season are down.
In addition, the Whalers were caught up in the bankruptcy of the Colonial Realty Company, the state's largest realty company, when its pyramid of limited partnerships began collapsing two years ago. Colonial's partners owned 37.5 percent of the Whalers through a limited partnership.
 
'This Is Not a Bailout'
 Mr. Gordon said the $4 million loan from the state would be used to acquire the Colonial interest and restructure his 75 percent ownership. The remainder of the franchise is held by the corporate consortium from which he bought the team in 1988.
"This is not a bailout for the Whalers," he said.
Mr. Gordon first approached state officials early this year, after United Technologies announced it would eliminate 6,400 jobs in Connecticut in the next three years, but months before two Hartford mainstays, Aetna and the Travelers Companies, announced they would be eliminating 2,500 jobs in the state.
Just last month the state's capital city suffered another blow, the news that May Department Stores was closing the flagship G. Fox & Company department store on Main Street.
The company's announcement that it was merging its Hartford-based G. Fox chain into its Filene's chain means that Hartford is losing its last department store and the 695 jobs at G. Fox's corporate headquarters.
Keeping the Whalers in Hartford is essential for preserving what is left of Hartford's retail businesses, including the Hartford Civic Center, the team's home, said Joseph Cohen, a spokesman for the State Department of Economic Development.
"The Connecticut Development Authority is convinced that the Hartford Whalers are critical at this time to the viability of the Hartford Civic Center, which is critical to the survival of downtown Hartford," he said.
Mr. Gordon received the state loan and loan guarantees under an aggressive program Mr. Weicker's administration is operating to preserve jobs and create new ones by providing credit to companies that banks are reluctant to lend to.
Mr. Cohen said the state has made $150 million in loans and loan guarantees in the last 18 months, helping to save or create as many as 25,000 jobs.
 
Not Pursuing Buyers
 "Richard Gordon's made it clear," Mr. Cohen said, "that when you've got a team that's not doing well, poor ticket sales, a dropoff in skybox ownership, in a tough economy, banks are not interested in making loans to a business that is continuing to bleed money."
Mr. Gordon said he had not pursued any offers to buy the team, but estimated he could earn a profit of $25 million to $30 million by selling it for $50 million to $55 million.
Under the terms of the loan agreement, if another buyer appeared during its seven-year term, the state could buy the team, or arrange a buyer for it, at 85 percent of the offered price. In addition, the agreement bars the team from moving for five years after being sold.
One other National Hockey League team, the Winnipeg Jets, has received government aid in return for staying put. That team's operating losses are covered by Winnipeg and the province of Manitoba. Many professional teams have received state and municipal aid in building or renovating their stadiums.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed as Job Report Is Not as Bad as Expected

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed in currency trading eysterday as Government unemployment figures turned out to be not as bad as expected.
Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery gained 60 cents, to $348.10. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid price of $348.25, up 15 cents. 
 The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate edged down slightly to 7.5 percent in September even though employers laid off 57,000 more workers.
The slight improvement from August's 7.6 percent rate marked the third straight month that the jobless rate edged down by a tenth of a percentage point after hitting an eight-year high of 7.8 percent in June.
However, most economists were unimpressed because the decline resulted from shrinkage in the number of people looking for work, not becuse more people found jobs.
Kevin Weir, a vice president at Bear, Stearns & Company, said there was an initial rally because traders had been prepared for the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates in the wake of poor numbers.
"I think people took a second look at the number" and coupled that with the Fed taking no action, thus trading wound up "kind of all over the map today," Mr. Weir said.
Trading was also affected by the German central bank's silence on the interest rate front yesterday.
If Germany had revised its interest rates, that would have affected the currency markets also.
"The bottom line is you still may get a cut from the Fed and no overt action from the Bundesbank," Mr. Weir said.
The dollar fell to 119.35 Japanese yen in New York, down from 119.80 late Thursday. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 119.40 Japanese yen from 120.32 yen at Thursday's close. Later in London, it was quoted at the same 119.40 yen.
In New York, the pound fell to $1.7285, from $1.7380 late Thursday. Earlier in London, the pound fell to $1.7265, from $1.7325 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's late rates, included: 1.4095 marks, down from 1.4215; 1.2320 Swiss francs, down from 1.2425; 4.7700 French francs, down from 4.8040; 1,250.0 Italian lire, up from 1,244.5, and 1.25065 Canadian dollars, up from 1.24735.
Silver rose on the New York Commodity Exchange to $3.734 a troy ounce, from $3.714 a troy ounce late Thursday. Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $3.74 a troy ounce, from $3.75 bid late Thursday.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The New York Region;
Perot's Return May Hurt Clinton in New Jersey

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Officials of Gov. Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign in New York and Connecticut are largely discounting the impact of Ross Perot's return to the race. But in New Jersey, Mr. Perot's return offers at least an opportunity for President Bush's flagging campaign to salvage the state and its 15 electoral votes, political analysts say.
New Jersey, which has voted Republican in recent Presidential races, is considered a must-win for Mr. Bush. But before Mr. Perot's re-entry, Mr. Clinton was running slightly ahead in public opinion polls. The thin margin raises at least the possibility, say politicians and pollsters, that Mr. Perot could lure away enough Clinton supporters to let Mr. Bush squeak through. 
 "The people voting for Bush are voting for Bush," said Janice Ballou, director of the Center for Public Interest Polling at the Eagleton Institute of Rutgers University. "Clinton voters are the not-Bush people. That's why Clinton becomes more vulnerable."
 
Sharing the Protest Vote
 The argument for this view is that Mr. Perot may draw some share of the protest vote on which Mr. Clinton is counting and that New Jerseyans are accustomed to registering protest votes. Since Mr. Clinton appears to have inherited more of Mr. Perot's supporters over the summer, he might have more of them to lose now that Mr. Perot has officially returned to the race, analysts say.
But politicians and pollsters acknowledge that their theories are just that. The candidate has only been back in the race for two days, and the race and the candidate have been redefined since Mr. Perot dropped out in July.
Richard Gannon, the Clinton campaign director in New Jersey, said most Perot voters would probably come from economically depressed conservative areas in South Jersey that would otherwise have supported Mr. Bush. Still, Mr. Gannon added, "Anyone willing to spend $100 million gives me cause for concern."
New Jersey has a higher proportion of residents enrolled as independents than as either Democrats or Republicans, underscoring that party affiliations are not likely to have that strong an influence on the outcome.
In New York, Republicans have not publicly given up on the state's lode of 33 electoral votes. But many acknowledge privately that President Bush appears to be trailing irretrievably.
 
Quick Campaign Swing
 William D. Powers, the Republican state chairman, said yesterday that he hoped that the race would become competitive enough to lure Mr. Bush to New York for a quick campaign swing later this month. Mr. Powers discounted a poll released yesterday by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion because it was conducted just before Mr. Perot formally rejoined the race.
When those questioned who said they were undecided were asked which candidate they were leaning toward, the totals were 52 percent for Mr. Clinton, 35 percent for Mr. Bush, 10 percent for Mr. Perot and 3 percent still uncertain.
The telephone survey of 821 voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points among likely voters.
"Half the voters in the Democratic primary rejected Bill Clinton," Mr. Powers said. "They would not support President Bush, but probably would support Ross Perot."
The Marist poll appears to contradict Mr. Powers's prediction that Mr. Perot's re-entry would substantially benefit Mr. Bush. In a two-way contest, Mr. Clinton's margin was larger, nearly 25 percentage points. But when people were asked whether they were firmly committed to their candidate, 71 percent of Mr. Clinton's supporters said they were, compared with 57 percent of Mr. Bush's and 43 percent of Mr. Perot's.
 
Support for Perot
 Among people who identified themselves as Republicans, 13 percent said they were supporting Mr. Perot, compared with about 5 percent of the Democrats.
"Where we have to go to get the big turnout -- from labor, African-Americans Latinos -- he does not hurt us," said Bill Lynch, the deputy Clinton campaign director in New York, referring to Mr. Perot. "If we don't do that, then whatever he gets here could be a problem."
John A. Marino, the Democratic state chairman, agreed that the outcome would be closer than the poll suggested and that some anti-Bush voters might shift to Mr. Perot. "But even if you give him another 5 percent and it all comes from Clinton, it shouldn't matter," Mr. Marino said.
Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute, concurred that Mr. Perot was unlikely to affect the outcome in New York. "The race Perot left is a very different race than the one he re-entered," Dr. Miringoff said.
Whatever impact Mr. Perot has in New York is likely to be limited to the Presidential race. The Perot campaign organization told state election officials last month that no local candidate has permission to run with Mr. Perot on his independent ballot line.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: TH AD CAMPAIGN;
Clinton: The Swift Counterattack

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
Yesterday, one day after the Bush campaign began broadcasting an advertisement charging that Gov. Bill Clinton would raise taxes for an array of average Americans, the Clinton campaign released its own commercial in response. The 30-second ad will run in about 20 battleground states.
 
ON THE SCREEN Opens with a picture of four television screens, each featuring a clip from the Bush commercial. At the top in a red band are the words "George Bush attack ad." The words " 'Misleading' -- The Washington Post, 10/2/92," appear superimposed over the screens. Cut to quotation from The Wall Street Journal. Cut to another red band reading "The Bush record," and a statement beneath: "The worst economic record of any president in 50 years." Cut to a photograph of Mr. Bush. Ends with black-on-white message: "Nothing could be more frightening than four more years."
 

PRODUCER Clinton/Gore Creative Team
 
TELEVISION SCRIPT Announcer: "George Bush is running attack ads. He says all these people would have their taxes raised by Bill Clinton. Scary, huh? 'Misleading,' says The Washington Post. And The Wall Street Journal says, 'Clinton has proposed to cut taxes for the sort of people featured in Bush's ad.' "So why's he doing it? Because George Bush had the worst economic record of any President in 50 years. George Bush is trying to scare you about Bill Clinton. But nothing could be more frightening than four more years."
 
ACCURACY By most measures, economic growth under Mr. Bush is in fact the slowest since Franklin D. Roosevelt ratcheted up the industrial machine for World War II half a century ago. The newspaper quotations come from a Wall Street Journal article about the Bush commercial and a Washington Post critique, similar to this one, of the same ad.
 
SCORECARD At political war once more, Clinton strategists are hewing to the basics that saw them through the firefight of the Democratic primaries: never let an accusation go unanswered for more than one news cycle; hit back harder than your opponent hits you.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Congressional Roundup;
Democrats Work On a Tax Bill

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
The Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate tax committees, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, met today to work out a compromise tax bill that would satisfy both houses without provoking a Presidential veto.
Both houses have passed legislation that would, among other things, spur business investment in economically distressed neighborhoods, extend a number of expiring tax breaks, and pay for the expenditures with several tax increases. 
 The Senate bill includes two provisions that the White House has threatened to veto because they would raise taxes on upper-income taxpayers. The two provisions would raise about $7 billion over the next five years, so if they are removed from the bill some cuts or other revenues would be needed, perhaps removal of costly provisions sponsored by Senator Bentsen expanding the availability of Individual Retirement Accounts.
Mr. Rostenkowski, emerging at one point during the meetings, said he hoped to make use of various revenue-raising proposals included in the budget plan President Bush submitted to Congress earlier this year. Some of those are already in the Senate or House versions of the tax bills, but others could be added.

HEADLINE: Clinton: The Teflon Candidate

BYLINE: By Haley Barbour; Haley Barbour was political director for the Reagan White House.

DATELINE: YAZOO CITY, Miss.

 BODY:
Long before the official Presidential campaign began, before the first candidate kissed the first baby in New Hampshire, an echo of elections past began to fill the air. This sound, which gained strength and power over the months, was the sound of Democrats crying "foul!"
While every recent Democratic Presidential hopeful has made liberal use of the charge that Republicans rely on dirty tricks during campaigns, none mastered it as early or as well as Bill Clinton. At the first whiff of criticism or even a recitation of facts from his record, the Clinton camp immediately went on the attack, accusing the Republicans of dirty tricks. 
 If unflattering stories cropped up in the press, the Democrats decried the low road taken by Bush-Quayle "operatives." Day after day, they sounded the refrain. The Clinton people have crowed about the effectiveness of this strategy, and it has worked.
It has become virtually impossible for the President to discuss any issue -- from Mr. Clinton's economic proposals to his draft record -- without being tarred as mean-spirited or, in one account, accused of McCarthyism. When a recent Bush campaign ad estimated the costs of Mr. Clinton's economic plan, the press complained that the numbers didn't come from the Governor's camp. That's because the Clinton campaign never calculated the most important number of all -- what tax rate you must charge to generate $154 billion in revenue.
It's important to recall that the big early scandals involving Mr. Clinton's character were not generated by Republicans, but by the press and his Democratic primary rivals. But that didn't stop him from blaming these stories -- the Gennifer Flowers "expose" and his draft record -- on Republican dirty tricks. And when his 1969 letter about avoiding the draft was published, he lambasted "a pattern by people desperate to stay in power and willing to impugn the motives, the patriotism and the lives of anyone who stands in their way."
After his claim that the Pentagon had leaked the letter was proved wrong, Mr. Clinton continued to blame "the Republican attack machine" and "search and destroy politics that have taken the heart out of the political system in this country." For the most part, the press did not hold him accountable for such unsubstantiated or demonstrably false charges.
So he has stuck with his tactic: never defend. This attack campaign has two major goals: to mask their own assaults on the President and to inoculate Mr. Clinton from Republican charges.
No campaign in recent history has been as aggressively personal as Mr. Clinton's assault on George Bush. A national co-chairman of the Clinton campaign called the President "a racist." Ron Brown, the national Democratic chairman, likened the President's racial policies to massive resistance to civil rights in the South in the 1960's South. Al Gore has insinuated that George Bush lied about the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue and called the President a hypocrite.
During the Clinton-Gore bus-capade in July, Albert Gore and other speakers would rise to rip into George Bush and Dan Quayle, then Mr. Clinton would take the stage and sanctimoniously warn the crowd not to fall for the Republicans' tactics. He told one audience, "Everywhere I go, people say, 'Are you ready for one more Republican negative campaign?' "
This is character assassination, plain and simple, disguised as a plea for civility. Bill Clinton knew that long after the public lost interest in the facts of any particular controversy, his insinuations about Republicans would linger on.
And so they have. This weird spectacle reminds me of the "bad guy" in the wrestling match who gouges eyes and pulls hair while whining to the referee about his opponent's cheating. It succeeds because no referee intervenes.
Despite the polls, I don't think the Clinton scheme -- cynical, clever, well-orchestrated -- will succeed through Nov. 3. As in the wrestling match, I believe people will cheer as the guy on the mat rises and flattens the bad guy. Americans just don't like unfair tactics -- especially unfair tactics masquerading as fair play.

HEADLINE: How to Disarm Iraq

 BODY:
In an effort to step up pressure on Iraq, the United Nations Security Council has now voted to tap Baghdad's overseas assets to pay war compensation and U.N. administrative costs. That's sound strategy: clearly defined pressure to achieve a clearly defined goal.
The same can no longer be said of the 26-month-long economic embargo against Iraq. The embargo has been an impressive exercise in international solidarity, confounding skeptics who once predicted the effort would break down after just a few months. Yet the strategy has begun to suffer from Washington's inflexibility. 
 The purpose of keeping sanctions in place after Baghdad's expulsion from Kuwait was to force the destruction of Iraq's remaining arsenal of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and Scud missiles and to nail down guarantees against future arms buildups.
Thanks to the bravery and persistence of U.N. arms inspectors, the first part of that goal looks attainable. Yet President Bush's firm refusal to contemplate any easing of sanctions while Saddam Hussein remains in power weakens the U.N.'s ability to finish the job. If Iraq can expect the same treatment whether or not it cooperates, what reason does it have to cooperate?
There's a more promising alternative: Without in any way rewarding Iraqi intransigence, give Baghdad a positive incentive to cooperate with the U.N. by reaffirming the explicit link between sanctions and arms control progress.
Working in the teeth of Iraqi resistance, U.N. inspectors are well into the process of destroying most of the nuclear materiel, missiles, biological and chemical weapons they have been able to find. But given Baghdad's past deceptions, the inspectors can't be confident that additional items aren't buried at some secret site. And their job won't be complete until they negotiate reliable inspection provisions for the future.
Completing their work largely depends on Iraq's cooperating. Iraq might be more inclined to do so if Council members recalled the bargain embodied in Resolution 687, which formally codified the Persian Gulf war cease-fire. The resolution declares that once the Security Council finds that Iraq has complied with its requirements concerning weapons, the main international economic sanctions automatically end.
The Council later imposed additional requirements on Iraq, like protecting the Kurds, paying for humanitarian relief and accepting a newly delineated border with Kuwait. These too need to be enforced, but not necessarily with sanctions on Iraqi exports. Tangible relief ought to be granted in exchange for full compliance on arms control alone.
Instead, the Bush Administration insists that all sanctions stay in force as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power. That's politically satisfying. But it's also counterproductive, since it effectively tells Baghdad that it has nothing to gain from cooperating.
As long as Mr. Hussein's departure remains unlikely, the most important goal is to deny him any access to mass destruction weapons. The world's persistence has brought that goal within sight. Completing the effort now requires a judicious use of carrots as well as sticks.

HEADLINE: Improving African Farming Is a Two-Part Job

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Richard Critchfield's Sept. 14 Op-Ed article, "Bring the Green Revolution to Africa," is a misleading and ultimately mischievous characterization of a very difficult situation. By singling out the World Bank to bear the responsibility for the problems of African agriculture, he fails to recognize the complexity of modernizing agriculture on that continent, and chastises an organization that strives mightily to work with African nations to improve the well-being of their people. 
 Raising the productivity of agriculture requires a combination of new production technology and getting the prices right for the farmers. The new technology is the potential source of increased output; the "right" prices provide the incentives for farmers to adopt the technology. Nobel Laureate Norman Borlaug and his colleagues are working on one component of this combination; the World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral development agencies are working on the second part.
Most governments in the region have seriously discriminated against their farmers by using trade and exchange rate policies to lower prices of farm commodities while providing high levels of protection for their nascent manufacturing sectors. Thus the World Bank and other international development agencies have faced serious difficulties in addressing their part of the solution to the pervasive problems of African agriculture.

HEADLINE: For Cities: Some Christmas Tree

 BODY:
Want a challenge? Try finding the urban aid in the urban aid bills just passed by the House and Senate. The bills have little to do with cities and almost everything to do with rewarding powerful constituents. Unless radically altered, the bills aren't worth passing.
After the Los Angeles riots in April, Congress pledged a swift response. But then it dithered for months -- and finally proposed showering tens of billions on real estate investors, yacht buyers, oil and gas producers, even rural development. Only a fraction is left for ghettos. Of the $30 billion the Senate would spend over five years, only about $6 billion would go to blighted cities. 
 There's still a slim chance that the conference committee will produce a bill worth having. The first task is to prune the giveaways that make this a Christmas tree bill for almost every sector except cities.
The Senate version would create new subsidies for retirement savings of high-income families. Although it appears harmless for the five-year period that Congress is required to examine, it would create a huge budget hemorrhage in future years. Ultimately the tax giveaway would raise the deficit and thereby drive down national saving, the opposite of what proponents claim.
The conference committee could eliminate this irresponsible measure, and also lop off proposed tax breaks for real estate investors, first-time home buyers and other special interests. The next task is to salvage three modestly worthwhile provisions:
Enterprise Zones. The centerpiece of the Administration's response to Los Angeles was enterprise zones -- blighted areas in inner cities to which employers would be drawn by tax breaks and regulatory relief. State experience with such zones isn't encouraging, but Federal zones, potentially more powerful, are worth trying.
Unfortunately, Congress wants to create between 50 and 125 zones, spreading the money so thinly that no zone would feel much impact. If Congress would limit the program to a dozen or so zones, it might provide enough tax cuts and support services to make the idea work.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. The tax credit currently attracts private investors to low-income housing projects and accounts for most low-income housing construction. Community development corporations rely on the credit to finance residential housing projects. It is scheduled to expire and merits permanent passage.
Children's Assistance. Two programs warrant passage. One would provide additional food stamps to families saddled with high housing costs. The other would provide money to assist families threatening to break up.
Stripped down to these provisions, Congress would have an urban aid package costing only about $10 billion. That could be paid for without raising income taxes. These three provisions wouldn't end inner-city blight, or even make a major dent in it. But they would provide honest relief for distressed people in distressed cities -- a big improvement over the mislabeled giveaways that Congress has so far passed.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Mel Gibson Shoots (a Movie)

BYLINE: By ALLEN BARRA; Allen Barra, a contributing editor at The Village Voice and Entertainment Weekly, has written about film for Premiere and American Film.

DATELINE: BAYSIDE, Me.

 BODY:
This tiny resort community, on the Maine coast not far from Camden, is a cluster of summer houses so quaint that in the words of one Southern Californian, "you almost expect a little train to drive down the lane with Mickey Mouse in the engine." The houses, with their picket fences and bay windows, look as if they were built for the movies. And in fact, as local residents with binoculars and cameras wait outside in a drizzle, a movie is being shot inside one of them.
The film is "The Man Without a Face," a modestly budgeted drama that is Mel Gibson's directorial debut. As the camera rolls, Margaret Whitton, looking like the quintessential all-American mom, is serving her family lunch from a steaming pot of SpaghettiOs. Suddenly, the screech of an alarm rips through the house. Mel Gibson, every bit the lean, mean, fighting machine that has made him an international star, leaps from behind the camera and into the dining room, index fingers pointed like automatic pistols. 
 "Everyone duck!" he yells. "Don't move! Wait for the bomb squad!"
"What is this?" asks Faye Masterson, who plays the oldest daughter. " 'Lethal Weapon 4'?"
A quick check reveals that the vat of hot SpaghettiOs has set off a smoke detector. "That's the SpaghettiOs alarm," Mr. Gibson observes. "More SpaghettiOs for my actors."
With feigned exasperation, the 12-year-old Gaby Hoffman says, "Oh, Mel, you're so silly."
Mr. Gibson's behavior does seem pretty silly by the standards of most directors. During rehearsals he gives his actors bits of advice in the voices of Sammy Davis Jr., Charles Bronson and -- in the words of Bruce Davies, the film's producer -- "absolutely, hands down, the best Ben Gazzara impression I've ever heard."
Sometimes, during a lull, Mr. Gibson will begin a story to one of his actors with the words "Did I ever tell you about the time . . . ," and a chorus of "DEE-DEE dee-dee DEE-DEE dee-dee," the theme from "The Twilight Zone," will break out. "Demento Boy is back," Ms. Whitton cautions her movie children, and they nod knowingly.
"Demento Boy" is the cast's nickname for their director when, in Gaby Hoffman's words, "he acts really nutty." But Mr. Gibson, like the Hamlet he played in Franco Zeffirelli's 1990 film, has a motive for his madness. Gaby Hoffman and the 13-year-old Nick Stahl, another member of the movie family, are professionals; but they are also young, and "The Man Without a Face," in which a boy struggles to find his identity in a family of women, involves profound emotional issues. Mr. Gibson's playfulness helps to ease the tension.
"Sometimes I feel the pressure of keeping the cast and crew waiting when I flub a scene," Nick says, "but Mel jokes a lot and makes me feel that that I'm not messing up. He takes all the pressure off me."
"The Man Without a Face" is based on a 1972 novel by Isabelle Holland about the relationship between a disfigured former prep school teacher (played by Mr. Gibson) and a 13-year-old boy. Budgeted at between $10 million and $12 million and scheduled for release next fall, it is a small film by Hollywood standards. But that pleases the 41-year-old Mr. Gibson as he joins the ranks of actors who, whether out of desire for creative control or simply curiosity, have gone behind the camera.
"I was drawn to the material because of the relationship between this older man who's terribly disfigured and this young boy who's struggling to find a way to manhood," Mr. Gibson says. "A big budget would only get in the way; there aren't any car crashes or special effects."
Still, in some ways the pressure on Mr. Gibson is greater than if he had the budget of "Batman" to play with. As Richard Masur, who plays Ms. Whitton's husband, puts it: "It takes guts to put yourself on the line like Mel does. A lot of people are laying for you when you play Hamlet or decide to direct a film." 
During a coffee break on the set, Mr. Gibson admits: "The truth is that I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing. The kids are more veteran than me. They've acted before, but I've never directed a film. I'm winging it."
And he is. For various reasons, Mr. Gibson couldn't get the actors he wanted for the title role. And so he ended up directing one of the biggest stars in movies -- himself -- in his feature-film directing debut. (His only other directing credits are for films about the making of "Hamlet" and of two "Lethal Weapon" films.)
According to his colleagues, Mr. Gibson was lucky in his choice of star. Piper Laurie, who starred with Mr. Gibson in a little-seen 1979 Australian movie called "Tim," said she believes that "the only people who were surprised by how good Mel was as Hamlet were people who don't know about his extensive stage training or who haven't seen his early film work. He should do very well behind the camera."
Mr. Gibson's friend Richard Donner, the director of the "Lethal Weapon" movies, calls the star "a director's dream," but he adds: "Mel has a lot of anger and hostility in him. He bottles it up well, but there have been times when I've seen the pot start to boil over, and I know enough to back off and get others to back off."
In any case, Mr. Gibson seems to be in a good mood three weeks into filming in Bayside, where he has been joined by his wife and six children. On location he has been directing, acting and watching his budget. Each night, after shooting is finished, he goes from the movie set to a cold pizza and screening room to watch the daily rushes before checking in with his family.
Seated beneath a canvas tent that gives the set an air of a traveling circus -- Mr. Gibson himself likens his role to that of "head clown" and "ringmaster" -- he answers questions between bites of chicken. He responds warily, sometimes backtracking on statements, often glancing at the interviewer's tape recorder as if afraid that it might pull a fast one. He seems to enjoy being Mel Gibson while he is working but is downright uncomfortable about having to play Mel Gibson in situations that aren't spontaneous. Still, as a director, he appears receptive to suggestions.
"Mel is remarkably open to the ideas of other people involved," says Ms. Whitton. "He's not a theorist or an ideologue; he sees film as a collaborative process. He's going to be a very good director, and that shouldn't surprise anyone. He's a very good actor, and good actors know how to direct themselves."
Mr. Gibson agrees, adding: "That side of the camera I feel I know something about, so that's what I'm sticking to, the acting. I feel safer with that than trying to be Orson Welles my first time out. I can't really say I started out watching directors and thinking, 'So that's how it's done.' It's more like I saw the finished product and became increasingly interested in retracing the steps and seeing how it was done."
Mr. Gibson has had a lot of time to observe the techniques of respected directors, including Peter Weir, with whom he worked on "Gallipoli" and "The Year of Living Dangerously," and George Miller, whose "Mad Max" and "Road Warrior" made Mr. Gibson an international star before he was 25.
"I've been lucky that way," the actor acknowledged. "George Miller, for instance -- I learned a lot about economy from him. 'The Road Warrior' was shot for a fraction of what they do big Hollywood action films for. He also taught me to use economy of effort to obtain maximum effect. The famous chase scene at the end of the movie? Half the time the truck wasn't even moving."
Economy is clearly on Mr. Gibson's mind as "The Man Without a Face" nears completion; it's as much a matter of pride as finance to bring it in on schedule and on budget. "There's so much waste in films these days," he says. "It's really getting appalling. I mean, the whole budget for this film . . . ." He trails off. The entire budget for this film probably wouldn't be far from what Mr. Gibson was paid for "Lethal Weapon 3."
"Anyway," he says, "it restores your sanity to make movies this way. Or in my case," he continues in his best Three Stooges voice, "my insanity."
He is told about a comment that Nick Stahl made when asked how he copes with the tedium of movie making: "I figure they pay me to put up with that. The acting I do for free." Mr. Gibson grins. "Did Nick say that? What a wonderful thing to say."
At that moment, Nick walks by.
"Nick," says Mr. Gibson, "my old pal. Nick, did I ever tell you about how I met my wife? It was in a burning wasteland . . . ." The boy looks at Mr. Gibson, then glances at other cast members nearby. A chorus of "DEE-DEE dee-dee DEE-DEE dee-dee" breaks out in the yard.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION VIEW;
Celebrating 20 Years Of Elitism

BYLINE: By John J. O'Connor

 BODY:
Politicians who issue ominous warnings about a "cultural elite" turn curiously coy when asked to name names, but the arts, of course, merit conspicuous attention in their pantheon of villains. And so does public television with its persistent habit of providing a showcase for the best and, on occasion, the most provocative of the arts, at home and abroad.
Wearing its "cultural elite" badge proudly though hardly defiantly, one public-television institution, the "Great Performances" series, is this Friday, at 9 P.M. on Channel 13/ WNET, throwing a 20th birthday party for itself, pointedly subtitled "Celebrating Creativity, American Style." 
 The special offers an assortment of pieces commissioned for the occasion, many featuring series alumni. One, Meryl Streep, introduces the program, recalling her own television debut, in "Secret Service," a Civil War melodrama that was part of the 1976-77 season. For Ms. Streep, the magic of the series is that "it's a record of all those 'great performances' that would have just floated off into air, a record of artists doing what they do best."
Friday's assortment, aimed in various ways at showing how the arts enrich us all, is generally ingratiating and inevitably uneven as it tries to encompass something for everyone. Included are short plays by Terrence McNally, Wendy Wasserstein and Alan Zweibel; dances choreographed by Peter Martins and urban hip-hoppers; an Annie Leibovitz movement study with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Twyla Tharp; a tribute to Leonard Bernstein, and a rousing soul version of Handel's "Hallelujah Chorus."
There's little here to upset the anti-elitist brigades, although Mr. McNally's sympathetic treatment of a gay man dead of AIDS could activate their hostility. But this is, after all, not an occasion for inviting confrontations. There have been enough of those over the years, as Jac Venza, the executive producer of the series, recalled one recent evening in an Upper East Side restaurant.
Money problems, endemic to public television, have always existed. And even 20 years ago, politicians were going after what they considered an overly independent and liberal system catering to, in the immortal words of a Spiro T. Agnew writer, "the nattering nabobs of negativism."
Actually, "Great Performances" won't be 20 years old until next year, but the series can trace its roots to "Theater in America" of 1972, another Venza project, which began its distinguished tour of regional theater with Lanford Wilson's "Rimers of Eldritch." The following year, that series and others, including "Dance in America," were brought under the umbrella title of "Great Performances," produced by WNET and underwritten by Exxon on a 39-week basis, an enlightened corporate-identity relationship that would last for 15 years. The current underwriter is Duracell.
Mr. Venza remembers the earlier years as a "purer experience," nearer to the original structuring of public television as an alternative service. And, he notes, everything cost less. As production expenses began soaring, however, he refused to cut what he considered essential corners. "If you ask someone to perform for very little money, usually scale, you cannot economize on the hair, the makeup, the lighting," he says. "The performers have to be presented as professionals and given first-class production values. Otherwise we're treating the arts as a kind of poor cousin."
The "Great Performances" season gradually evolved into a combination of European acquisitions and original domestic productions. The relatively inexpensive imports, ranging from a wealth of classical music concerts and operas to mini-series on the magnificent level of "Brideshead Revisited" enabled the series, Mr. Venza says, to "put most of our money into American productions." Those include works by just about every major choreographer, the broadcast of four new American operas and adaptations of short stories by John Cheever.
Most music is easy. Even the anti-elitists can appreciate Bernstein conducting Beethoven or Stephen Sondheim's "Follies in Concert." But Mr. Venza has made a point of highlighting productions outside the mainstream: "Einstein on the Beach" by Philip Glass and Robert Wilson; the controversial Peter Sellars stagings of three Mozart operas; the equally controversial Boulez-Chereau interpretation of Wagner's "Ring" at Bayreuth (presented as an eight-part series). The list is long and staggeringly impressive.
The future? Noting that "we have already covered a lot of the classics," Mr. Venza speaks about finding "better ways to communicate with larger audiences." As costs continue to soar and budgets are increasingly scrutinized, he says that "even within public television, there are people who'd like to see less arts programming." New directions in the series are already apparent. More is being done with jazz and popular music. "Swinging Out With Harry" (Harry Connick Jr.) or "The Fred Astaire Songbook" can be tucked between "The Mahabharata" and "The Search for Nijinsky." Dance can be packaged imaginatively with biography, and the result can be as illuminating and moving as "Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane and Co."
There are still, of course, certain cultural gatekeepers who reject the very idea of the arts being associated with a medium ostensibly as vulgar as television. But there's no going back. Mr. Venza does indeed talk of a time when "many of the celebrated artists with whom we were eager to work had little enthusiasm for television because of their minimal presence in commercial television." Whatever its weaknesses, public television has changed all that.
"My job," Mr. Venza says simply, "is to protect the turf of artists and creativity." Don't underestimate the toughness and durability of elitists.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
In Philadelphia, a Showcase of Abandoned Hopes

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
It was the largest building in America, and reputedly the most expensive. Its bold, original design influenced architecture internationally. Tocqueville came from France to study it; Dickens declared it (along with Niagara Falls) one of the two sights he hoped to see on his 1842 American tour. Today, the Eastern State Penitentiary is something of an embarrassment, an abandoned ruin overgrown with weeds. But this gloomy landmark is still worthy of wide public attention. Few buildings shed a more penetrating light on modern democracy and its discontents.
Located just a few blocks from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Eastern State is also a museum, a showcase of lost hopes. Empty since the last prisoners departed in 1970, the prison's stone-walled cells are haunting tableaux of a failed experiment in utopian social planning. Designed in 1821 by the Philadelphia architect John Haviland, Eastern State was born from the fusion of Quaker social conscience with the Enlightenment's faith in reason. Its innovative form arose from humanitarian concern for the treatment of prisoners and from philosophical speculation about the cause and cure of crime. 
 Few visitors today, however, will find this place either humane or reasonable. For it was here, in the city of the Liberty Bell, that the concept of solitary confinement was put to its first major test. This was the dubious achievement of the place known around the world as "the Prison at Philadelphia."
Today, a preservation task force, financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts, is studying ways to re-use Eastern State and educate the public about its history. In the mid-1980's the prison, now owned by the city of Philadelphia, was the target of several redevelopment proposals, including plans for luxury housing and an urban shopping mall. All the proposals called for substantial demolition of Haviland's architecture, however, and in 1988, in response to a petition from the task force, Mayor W. Wilson Goode turned them all down pending further study.
But the popularity of Alcatraz notwithstanding, prisons make awkward landmarks. Compared to, say, a courthouse, a prison lacks the luster of civic pride. The classical form of a courthouse extols a supreme democratic virtue: the law and its impartiality, the consent of the governed to the rules that make their liberty possible. A prison speaks of the loss of freedom. Its message is not the law but the consequences of transgressing it: guilt, disgrace, the stigma of the outlaw state.
These qualities are not easily rendered into architecture, though Piranesi, memorably, transformed Baroque court design into "imaginary prisons" of nightmarish power. Still, for a young democratic nation, dedicated to reforming society and its institutions, the prison was an irresistible challenge. What could be more idealistic than to reform a brutal institution into an enlightened system for reforming individuals?
Viewed from outside, Eastern State resembles a Gothic fortress. Square in plan, the crenelated granite walls enclose a 10-acre site. A stone tower marks the entrance; from the corners, turrets rise. The design turns the form of a medieval city inside out. No hordes clamored to enter Eastern State, though the forbidding walls were designed to deter people from acts that might land them there. The massive ramparts also gave reassurance that those confined within would remain outside the city of the law abiding.
But it is inside the walls that the prison's experimental plan unfolded. Traditionally, prisons were squalid places, where people were thrown together in common rooms, often regardless of sex, age or the severity of their offenses. They were places of disorder and social neglect. By contrast, "penitentiaries" like Eastern State were places of discipline. They were built on the theory that criminals are psychological slobs, people who failed to acquire discipline early in life. Within the penitentiary's controlled environment, criminals would reform themselves through penance -- hence the name. The Pennsylvania Plan, as solitary (or "separate") confinement was called, took the theory a step further. Criminals would acquire discipline more readily if they were isolated from other undisciplined souls.
Philadelphia's prison officials considered several options before choosing Haviland's plan. They deliberated over a panopticon, a circular building with an observation tower in the middle, similar to one Benjamin Latrobe had designed for Richmond Prison in 1795. Though an observation tower rises from the center of Haviland's building, this is not the true panopticon form conceived by the British political economist Jeremy Bentham. Instead of forming a circle, Eastern State's seven cellblocks -- containing 250 cells altogether -- radiate from the central observation tower like spokes. (Four additional blocks and other outbuildings were added later.) This plan allowed surveillance of the open yards but, unlike a panopticon, it did not permit guards to look into the cells.
Instead of "the eye of power," to use Michel Foucault's term for the technique of constant prisoner surveillance, Eastern State relied on the power of the invisible. On arriving at the prison, prisoners were hooded before being led to their cells, to prevent them from seeing where they were going. Each cell measured 8 by 12 feet and was equipped with a flush toilet and running water. A walled yard outside the cell permitted solitary exercise. An 1831 report explained: "No prisoner is seen by another, after he enters the wall. When the years of his confinement have passed, his old associates in crime will be scattered over the earth, or in the grave . . . and the prisoner can go forth into a new and industrious life, where his previous deeds are unknown."
It sounds a bit like heaven, and indeed the roots of the Pennsylvania Plan lay in monastic architecture and in the solitary life of Carthusian monks. Inmates at Eastern State were provided with Bibles and expected to work at weaving and other crafts. They received regular visits from members of the Philadelphia Prison Society, the Quaker organization that had championed the creation of Eastern State. It is as if, by emulating a monastic structure, the prison could convert a criminal calling into a religious one, sinners into saints. "The Pennsylvania System is a Divine System," hailed one contemporary advocate.
But to Dickens, who visited the prison 150 years ago, the system was infernal, precisely because of its reliance on the unseen. Prisoners were invisible to the world as well as to one another, and their punishment left no visible scars. Society did not have to witness the consequences of confining people here. Dickens thought public flogging preferable to this "slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain."
But the governing concept of reform hinged on that tampering: on the prison's capacity to turn the private recesses of the mind into a matter of public interest. What stands out most vividly in Dickens's account of his visit (in his "American Notes") is the eagerness of prison officials to secure the prisoners' assent to the system that held them. One inspector asks a prisoner, Are you resigned now? Are you a better man? A female prisoner is asked, Are you happy here?
Such questioning was critical to the experiment's success. By a circular logic, only the prisoners could say if the system worked. Only they could provide the evidence that, yes, they had reformed. They had acquired discipline. They had mended their ways.
If Dickens paused to visit Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, he did not record it. From Philadelphia he traveled south to Washington, where he spent several days attending Congressional sessions at the Capitol, "a fine building of the Corinthian order, placed upon a noble and commanding eminence."
THERE'S A LOGIC TO DICKENS'S itinerary that is conceptual as well as geographic, for Latrobe's 1811 design is the complement of Haviland's: both buildings are concerned with the process of self-government. Gleaming, proud, the Capitol lifts its dome high over the landscape, the public symbol of the Republic's collective mind. From the Capitol, government power radiates outward into the city along the avenues of L'Enfant's Baroque plan. Inside the building, Latrobe's interiors (inspired, in part, by Piranesi) lay out the structure of reason within which the contentious process of self-government will unfold.
At Eastern State, the capitol's dark twin, abusers of liberty were compelled to bring themselves back into line. The sphere of this building is the private, psychological life of we, the people. Instead of radiating outward, the building presses in. It expresses its power in physical confinement, in the constant pressure it applied to the cells and their inhabitants, to the inner lives of individuals where democratic authority resides.

The Ecotourism Society, a consortium of conservation and travel professionals, is developing a program to evaluate the conservation practices of tour companies operating in fragile natural areas. The society is surveying consumers and tour operators to help prepare the final questionnaire it will send to organizers of tours. Questions will touch on an operator's recycling efforts, predeparture procedures, policies on energy consumption, a trip's impact on the local environment and economic practices in the communities visited. Questionnaires will be sent out next fall; first results are expected in the fall of 1994.
The two-year-old Ecotourism Society's membership includes tour operators, conservation professionals, academics, individuals and the tourism boards of several countries. The society focuses on travel to natural areas, the Amazon and Alaska, for example, and the impact of tourism 's impact on them. The society conducts workshops and seminars for developing countries and for universities.

HEADLINE: Mitchell-Lamas Going on Sale

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
FOR King and Nadine Lenoir one of the pleasures of living in Fairfield Towers in Brooklyn is the afternoons spent relaxing on the balcony reading or dining at the umbrella table.
"We feel secure here," said Mrs. Lenoir, as she and her husband, a retired chauffeur, sat in the living room of their two-bedroom apartment. "The place is safe and clean and many of the people here are old friends. This is our home now." 
 The couple hope to own it soon. The Lenoirs, who sold a home in another part of Brooklyn, moved back to Fairfield Towers earlier this year. They have signed a contract to buy their apartment when the former Mitchell-Lama complex converts to a condominium later this year.
The Lenoirs and the 300 or so other residents who have also signed contracts to buy apartments in the complex see the conversion as an opportunity for their part of the American Dream -- owning their own home. But others, including some state housing officials and legislators as well as some Mitchell-Lama tenants, see the conversion of Fairfield Towers and other buildings in the system as an erosion of the city's dwindling supply of moderately priced rental housing.
Rents for Mitchell-Lama apartments are usually well below the cost of similar housing in neighborhoods where they have been built. Within the last few years, a total of 8,500 units have passed out of the Mitchell-Lama system as their landlords exercised their rights to pay off the subsidized mortgages used to build them and accept full property taxation. While some 160,000 Mitchell-Lama units in 400 projects remain in the system, the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal says 134 projects with 82,000 units are eligible for the buy-out by the end of this year. Currently, 15 state- and 4 city-sponsored Mitchell Lama complexes with more than 5,000 units are leaving the system. The agency estimates it would cost a minimum of $100,000 a unit to replace this housing at today's construction costs.
"The housing is important and was designed with a particular population in mind," said Angelo J. Aponte, the Commissioner of the D.H.C.R. and one of the state officials who has waged an unsuccessful campaign to change the laws that let Mitchell-Lama projects become private housing once they reach their 20th anniversary.
"THE government is not in the business to provide windfalls for people in Mitchell-Lama housing when they are converted to co-ops or condominiums," Commissioner Aponte said. "Government subsidies have allowed people to remain in their apartments paying affordable rents. When these units leave the system, there are no replacements."
Stuart Berelson, a principal in the company that owns Fairfield Towers and Mark Terrace, a former Mitchell-Lama complex in the Bronx now being converted, says he does not understand the opposition to the conversions or the reluctance of lenders to extend mortgages to potential buyers in converted buildings.
"Everyone from Jack Kemp, the Housing Secretary, on down," said Mr. Berelson, "says what we need is more opportunities for working-class people to own their own homes. These kinds of conversions provide just that. We are selling homes for an average of $55,000 in Fairfield Towers. Why should people who live in Mitchell-Lama be renters all their lives?"
For the last six years some state officials and housing advocates have lobbied the Legislature in support of measures that would extend the obligation of owners of Mitchell-Lama housing to remain in the system. Bills that would stretch the period for buy-outs from 20 to 35 years have been defeated in the last six legislative sessions.
The Mitchell-Lama housing program, created in 1955, owes its name to former State Senator MacNeil Mitchell, a Manhattan Republican, and former Assemblyman Alfred Lama, a Brooklyn Democrat, who sponsored the legislation that established it. Known officially as the Private Housing Finance Law, it offered private developers tax breaks and low-interest mortgage money as incentives to build housing for middle-income people. In exchange, they would limit profits to 6 percent and keep rents down. But the agreement also said that these constraints could be lifted after 20 years.
Under the program, the subsidies given developers were passed along to tenants in the form of moderate rents. To be admitted to a Mitchell-Lama building, the applicant's income cannot be higher than what has been established for the apartment. Rents and income limits, set by the D.H.C.R. for state-supervised buildings and by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development for city-supervised Mitchell-Lama housing, varry from building to building.
For a typical two-bedroom apartment, for example, with a monthly rent of $450, the maximum household income could probably be no higher than $43,000. If a tenant's income rises above the ceiling for his apartment, a surcharge, no higher than 50 percent of the base rent, is added to the rent.
The property tax benefit granted owners of Mitchell-Lama housing is calculated according to a complex formula, based on rental income and utility expenses, and varries widely from building to building, depending on individual financial factors.
Myron Holtz, deputy commissioner for Housing Management with D.H.C.R., said it would not be possible to put a figure on how much the typical Mitchell-Lama owner pays in property tax.
The Mitchell-Lama program has resulted in the construction of 139,000 units in 270 projects in New York City and 28,500 apartments in 152 developments in other parts of the state. Many complexes built in the state under the program in the 1960's and early 70's, when most went up, are now reaching their 20-year anniversaries.
Despite the dire predictions from critics, so far only six of the 22 Mitchell-Lama complexes that have been eligible have converted to owner-occupied residences. The rest have remained as rental buildings but subject to the restrictions of rent-stabilization rules. But Mr. Aponte and others say it is only the poor real estate market that has kept more owners from converting their buildings.
"These things are dictated by economic conditions," said Mr. Aponte. "When the market comes back, I think you can count on seeing more projects go to owner-occupied housing. This will be particularly true of Mitchell-Lama housing in areas where property values have gone up."
There is a benefit to leaving the system after 20 years, Mr. Aponte said, even for owners with no plans to covert to co-op or condominiums. "If a building is in an area that has appreciated," he said, "the equity over time has been building up. The owner can refinance the mortgage and pay back the Mitchell-Lama debt. With today's interest rates nearly as low as they were when some of these projects were built, the owner can take the cash out and then convert sometime in the future."
Rueben Glick, a principal of the Glick Organization, a leading development company that has participated in the Mitchell-Lama program, rejects the notion that there is any windfall for buyers or landlords in the conversions of these properties.
"In the plan," said Mr. Glick, whose Brightwater Towers complex was recently converted to a condominium, "the advantage to builders was that there would be limited profit of 6 percent returned on our equity. But that usually did not happen because rents were kept so low and expenses were high so that profits did not have to be limited because they did not reach 6 percent in most cases."
Mr. Glick said that the original expectation was that after 20 years in the program the owners would be able to take their buildings private and charge market-rate rents.
"But rent stabilization was introduced," he said, adding that converting the buildings to co-ops or condominiums gives owners a way to get a return on their investments. When former Mitchell-Lama rental buildings are converted to co-ops or condominiums, owners are free to ask whatever tenants will agree to and what the market allows.
There have been some small victories for D.H.C.R. in the effort to stem the flow of projects from the system. In July the New York Court of Appeals upheld the agency's efforts to delay a buy-out petition from two Bronx Mitchell-Lama complexes, Bronx Park East and Columbus Park. The court said that the owners were bound by a clause in their deeds from New York City restricting the use of the land they occupied for 40 years, which took precedence over the 20-year Mitchell-Lama restriction.
Housing officials say they do not beleive that these sorts of deed restrictions, which were individually negotiated between the city and the developers, apply to many Mitchell-Lama projects. The restrictions came to light as part of the routine review of documents and deeds in the privatization process.
Most of the housing built with Mitchell-Lama subsidies was rental buildings, but the program sponsored a handful of limited- equity co-ops as well. These also have the right to convert to completely private co-ops after 20 years. The first to do so was Contello I in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. Three years ago the owners took their complex private.
The move to convert had nearly unanimous support among the residents. Out of 325 apartment owners in the two-building complex, 315 opted to buy. Five residents were given lifetime tenancy arrangements and the other five immediately sold their apartments to outside buyers. The initial investment for most residents in 1968, when the complex opened, was between $1,500 and $2,000.
MARTIN MARKMAN, an original buyer and president of the co-op board, said support for the privatization of the complex had always been fairly strong but had risen significantly a few years ago after residents heard that some housing officials were suggesting that homeless families be placed in the Mitchell-Lama buildings with room for them.
"It was an easy transition," said Mr. Markman. "We were self-managed for 25 years so we knew the building inside and out. There was a lot of support."
The owners refinanced the building's mortgage for $370,000 to pay off the underlying loan and start a co-op reserve fund. When the complex was converted to full-equity co-op the buyers did not have to make any more contributions because of the refinanced loan. With the impact of full taxation factored in, the charges went from $275 to $400 a month on average. Since the owners had already purchased their apartments, there was no additional cost to them. The 30 or so residents who moved out of their apartments soon after the conversion, Mr. Markman said, sold them for between $50,000 and $125,000.
Mr. Markman rejects the position that owners in Contello I voted themselves what amounted to an easy financial gain by taking their building private.
"This is not a place where rich people live," he said of the waterfront complex, which in its transition changed its name to The Waterview. "Many of the people who were among the first to move in are still here. We are working people who helped the city and state in that the housing created under Mitchell-Lama kept middle-income people from leaving the city."
Not all transitions have been as smooth. The conversion of Brightwater Towers has taken nearly six years. The condominium plan for the 734-apartment complex in Coney Island was declared effective in July. Part of the delay was due to several legal challenges by tenants to such things as the new rent increase schedule and surcharges when the complex became subject to the rules of rent stabilization before converting to a noneviction condominium.
And Mr. Berelson said that the conversion that he and his partner were trying to do in their buildings, Fairfield Towers in Brooklyn and Mark Terrace in the Bronx, had been hobbled by the reluctance of lenders to write mortgages for buyers in buildings where less than 50 to 60 percent of the units will be owner-occupied. In each project about 20 percent of the apartments have been sold. The owners, as a term of the conversion plan, agreed to arrange for bank financing for resident buyers.
"We had a commitment from a bank to do end loans for our tenant buyers when we started in 1989," said Mr. Berelson, "but the bank backed out when the market started to go down."
Brightwaters reached its 20th anniversary in 1985. The owner, the Glick Organization, paid off the mortgage the next year and undertook a conversion plan.
Paul Podhaizer, a longtime Brightwater Towers resident, is one tenant who will not join those insiders paying $33,000 to $75,000 for condominium apartments.
"I did not support the move out of Mitchell-Lama," said Mr. Podhaizer, a retired post office employee who for several years has served as chairman of the Brightwater tenants' association. "But I believe we were able to get in the end a pretty good deal for those who are buying."
The nonpurchasing tenants there are rent stabilized, as required by law, but Mr. Podhaizer does not feel this is enough protection for all tenants.
When buildings pass from Mitchell-Lama to rent stabilization, the base rents in the apartments are frozen at the last Michell-Lama rent, including any surcharge.
"The problem is that some of the residents had their rents set at a time when their incomes were higher than they are now," Mr. Podhaizer said. "Some people have been hurt by the loss of Mitchell-Lama status. It has been a hardship for people who have retired since the building left the system. If we had remained, some of them would have seen their rents drop to reflect their after-retirement incomes. The rent rules were fair up until that time."
ABOUT 100 tenants bought their apartments and the sponsors have made sales to about 130 outside buyers.
Mr. Podhaizer said the tenant negotiators were able to push the price of apartments to insiders from the original asking price of $30,000 a room down to about $10,800. A result was that apartments sold for $33,000 to $40,000 for one-bedroom units to $75,000 for three-bedroom apartments in the complex, which has water views, terraces and a swimming pool. Outside purchasers, Mr. Glick said, paid on average $110,000 for two-bedroom apartments.
With the prospects of convincing the Legislature to rewrite the Mitchell-Lama rules not promising, Mr. Aponte has taken another approach.
"We are examining other ways to keep owners in the system," he said, "by providing incentives."
As the buildings in Mitchell-Lama reach their 20th anniversary, many will be at the age where they will be due for extensive upgrading and repair work.
"One approach we are contemplating," Mr. Aponte said, "is the use of home-improvement repair loans or tax credits that will allow buildings to be upgraded and give the owners the tax break in exchange for a commitment to stay in the program for a certain period of time. It would probably be at least for the duration of the tax credit or loan."
"The best part," he continued, "is that the plan does not require legislative approval."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Illegal Occupancy;
Lessons From a Campaign for 'Possession'

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

OVER 10 years the issues have changed, says Arthur Zabarkes, full-time pursuer of illegal occupants in the Manhattan apartments of Peter Sharp & Company. In the 80's it was nonprimary occupancy. People tried to cling to their occupancy rights to a regulated apartment, often in hope of cash from a co-op conversion sponsor eager to sell it vacant.
Now the main question is succession, or who has the right to inherit lease renewal rights when the tenant named on the lease moves out or dies. 
 "At 440 East 79th Street we've got 13 cases going and eight are on succession," Mr. Zabarkes said. "It's not the first generation of illegals but apartments inherited by sublessees."
Most owners might be prepared to make a deal with sublessees, offering them a primary lease. Not Peter Sharp & Company or its residential arm, Church Management.
Mr. Sharp, who died in April at the age of 61, was a major Manhattan real-estate investor who started buying well-located rentals in the late 60's specifically for the purpose of converting them to co-ops. His policy was to achieve conversion with a modest percentage of buyers and wait patiently for turnover to sell the inventory at vacancy values.
Under this noneviction approach, renters are entitled to lease renewals indefinitely after conversion. Most sponsors in the early days of conversion used eviction plans, which left nonbuyers with no lease-renewal rights. To convert, sponsors had to achieve purchase agreements from at least 35 percent of the tenants. Later the percentage became 50 percent and nearly all sponsors switched to noneviction plans.
But Mr. Sharp was adamant about gaining possession of an apartment -- the ability to control its use -- once he was legally entitled to it. He hired Mr. Zabarkes to see to that.
Beyond the legal precedents of lawsuits he set in motion, Mr. Zabarkes's 10-year experience is instructive on the behavior of many upper-middle-income renters. A significant minority of them apparently tried hard to exploit their advantageous position under rent regulation. Legal action was required to gain possession in 28 percent of the apartments that had a tenancy turnover. The lawsuits led to possession, or a sale to the tenant, in almost every case.
The 13 midtown buildings, with 1,684 apartments, were converted from 1972 to 1982. There were 1,218 renter-occupied apartments when Mr. Zabarkes was hired in 1982. One year later the decision was made to stop offering cash payments to tenants to leave.
Currently 528 apartments are still rent-regulated and 690 have been vacated by regulated tenants. In the 199 lawsuits that were filed to gain possession, 145 tenants dropped their occupancy claim before the case was adjudicated. Twenty-four of these tenants bought their apartments.
THERE were trials in 58 cases. Peter Sharp won 54 -- a dozen in Civil Court and the rest in reversals on appeal. Four cases were lost at both levels.
"People were either trying to capitalize on the subsidy of rent regulation by not giving up their apartment, or they were looking to extract some part of the value of the sale of a vacant apartment," Mr. Zabarkes said. "I looked at it as extortion."
Tenant lawyers have a different perspective. Kent Karlsson , of the Manhattan firm of Karlsson & Ng, said that when the market was strong, some owners would bring nonprimary-occupancy cases based on almost any evidence, hoping to make tenants spend money or confront sponsors to make a deal. In more than half the cases he took, tenant claims to primary residence were legitimate, he said.
"The state of regulation forces the tenant to make choices that put them on the edge of what's legal and what's illegal," said Samuel Himmelstein, whose firm, Himmelstein, McConnell & Gribben of Manhattan, represents tenants. In a large minority of cases brought to him the tenant's case was not strong and he advised them not to proceed, he said. Legal costs are a minimum of $1,500 and typically end up ranging from $3,000 to $8,000.
But in other cases, he said, the tenant had a just claim to primary occupancy and the owner had merely used evidence of the existence of another residence to bring a case. And some tenants leave their residence for what in their own minds is a temporary if indefinite period, and have been vulnerable to the powerful hand of a pursuing landlord, he said.
Under the law, renters have a right to a regulated apartment only if they use it as their primary residence, as verified, if challenged, by public documents and testimony on the frequency of their use.
Possession cases also arise over subleases. The tenant's right to sublease a regulated apartment is limited to two out of every four years and requires the owner's consent, which cannot be unreasonably withheld. In the current market, many owners are said to be taking a more relaxed view of subleasing.
A THIRD law involves roommates. Rent-regulated tenants are allowed to bring in an unrelated individual and dependent children of that individual, as long as the tenant remains in occupancy. If the tenant moves out, under state rules based on a Court of Appeal decision, the roommate can succeed to the apartment when the roommate and the tenant have had "an emotional and financially interdependent relationship" for at least two years. The regulations are under court challenge.
A common situation in Manhattan, said Robert M. Olshever, a lawyer in Manhasset, L.I., is that a tenant will have two apartments, live mainly in one but show up in the other as well. If challenged, the tenant can sometimes succeed in claiming either or both apartments as a prime residence, Mr. Olshever said.
The Peter Sharp cases have established two main legal principles, according to Sherwin Belkin, of Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman, who represented the company. One is that the burden of proof in a right-to-succession case lies with the claimant. The other is that in nonprimary occupancy cases, documents alone -- showing where the tenant remains in occupancy. If the tenant moves out, under state rules based on a Court of Appeal decision, the roommate can succeed to the apartment when the roommate and the tenant have had "an emotional and financially interdependent relationship" for at least two years. The regulations are under court challenge.

One is that the burden of proof in a right-to-succession case lies with the claimant; the other is that in nonprimary occupancy cases, documents alone -- voter registration, for example -- are not enough to assure the right to occupy. Tenants must be able to show they actually use the apartment.
ON the tenant side, cases have established that for sufficient cause, a tenant can sometimes keep an apartment he doesn't frequently occupy. But most of the key decision favorable to tenants involve procedural issues. If landlords are not careful to notify tenants at the right time that their lease won't be renewed and why, for example, they can lose their right to gain possession of an apartment for years.
Mr. Zabarkes, 49 years old, has practiced architecture, obtained a master's degree in urban planning from Columbia, worked toward a doctorate in economics specializing in property rights, and served as executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council and the Rent Stabilization Association. "I'm a market-oriented economist," he said.
He says his experience shows that in almost one of three turnovers in upper-middle-income rent-regulated apartments in Manhattan, the tenant tries to cling to his possession rights. Privately arranged sublets, without notification of the landlord, are the most prevalent current method of accomplishing this, he says.
The apartments owned by Peter Sharp or investors for whom he manages are in the following co-ops or condominiums: 270 West End Avenue; 35 East 38th Street; 44 Gramercy Park North; 75 East End Avenue; 80 Park Avenue; 15 West 72d Street; 141 East 55th Street; 203 East 72d Street; 325 East 79th Street; 325 West End Avenue; 440 East 79th Street; 444 East 52d Street, and 520 East 81st Street.
A snapshot of the rental situation in one building, the co-op at 15 West 72d Street, suggests why many rental tenants won't buy their own apartments.
The 37-story building is a neighbor to the Dakota, on Central Park West, and its higher floors have excellent views. It became a co-op in 1980. Of its 497 apartments, 140 are occupied by preconversion renters. Their income is estimated at above $100,000 an apartment, based on occupations and the number of income-earners per unit, but not on financial data.
There are 18 apartments on the floors 24 to 26. Seven are still occupied by regulated renters. Their rents are $830 a month for the sole one-bedroom, on the 25th floor, and $900 to $1,300 a month for six two-bedrooms, which have 1,000 to 1,300 square feet and in two cases a terrace.
The apartments in the current market have a vacancy rental value of $1,800 to $2,200 for the one-bedroom and $3,300 to $3,500 for the two-bedrooms, Mr. Zabarkes said.
A two-bedroom co-op on a high floor recently sold for $430,000. At that price monthly costs for a buyer who pays 25 percent in cash would be about $3,200 before tax deductions. That includes debt service on the loan and a monthly maintenance payment of $1,300 to the co-op. It looks steep to a renter paying $900 to $1,300 a month.
"Tenants don't want to double or triple their carry," Mr. Zabarkes said, "and they don't expect the appreciation in value that people did in the 80's. Also, they don't want to start assuming ownership responsibilities they're not used to."
Before he died, Mr. Sharp advised patience, since there is an overall turnover rate of 5 percent a year in the rentals. His successors are following that policy.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Oct. 14 Auction;
For Sale: Pieces of the City

 BODY:
While the region's economic woes have been a drag on property values here, land in New York City still comes pretty dear. But later this month the city will be selling pieces of New York for just a few thousand dollars.
On Oct. 14, 130 city-owned buildings and parcels will be put up for sale at a public auction where bidding for a few parcels will start as low as $1,000. The cheapest lots are not, mind you, building sites, just slivers of land. One parcel, for example, is a 10-by-96-foot Staten Island lot on South Railroad Avenue between Bache and Jacques Avenues. But officials with the Department of General Services, the agency holding the auction, say these slivers often are bought for their value as parking spaces or private gardens. 
 G.S.A. is to conduct a pre-auction seminar tomorrow at 6 P.M. in the auditorium of 125 Worth Street. The auction itself is to be held in the auditorium of One Police Plaza at Chambers and Centre Streets behind the Municipal Building. Bidding is to start at 9 A.M. For more information call 212 566-8914.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Renaissance Revival on West 79th;
School Buildings for Sale

 BODY:
For nearly a century, the 1895 Renaissance Revival buildings at 168-170 West 79th Street in Manhattan filled roles that emphasized the teaching of religion and languages, first as the Notre Dame School, then as the Fleming School. The final lessons, however, have been in economics.
The Fleming School, which for two decades had been at 10 and 35 East 62d Street, bought the buildings from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York for $5.8 million in 1989 at the beginning of the real estate recession and then spent more than $4 million on renovations and construction of a new gymnasium linking the buildings. Last November, though, the school filed for bankruptcy. 
 Now, the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan-based real estate brokerage firm retained by the United States Bankruptcy Court, is orchestrating a sealed-bid sale of the 36,000-square-foot property.
The deadline for bids is Oct. 16, with a minimum bid of $4.5 million. For additional information, call (212) 355-3550. "It's most suitable for use as a school or nonprofit institution and is also prime for residential development," said George van der Ploeg, vice president of the Corcoran Group.

HEADLINE: A Second-Hand Store Upgrades to First Class

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN

 BODY:
PAUL H. CRANFORD browsed through a few of the dozens of men's suits on a rack and liked what he saw. "Here's an Yves Saint Laurent," he said. "And a Faberge, hand-tailored in Paris. And a Hickey-Freeman! All very vogue."
He also liked the prices because they should appeal to shoppers. One suit was marked $15, another $20; the highest priced, $30. "We try to get 10 percent of the original prices," he said. 
 Mr. Cranford could be a retailer trying desperately to survive during a deep and long recession but the uniform gives him away. He is a Salvation Army captain and the store he is visiting is the latest of 11 under his jurisdiction. It opened this summer in West Hartford and, at 30,000 square feet, is said to be the biggest thrift store in New England.
It is an establishment of soft lighting and wide aisles, with clothing in neat racks and coordinated by color and size, a plethora of changing rooms and well-trained and polite salespeople.
 
A New Retailing Approach
 Anyone who has ever wandered into a Salvation Army thift store in the past, perhaps looking around to see if any acquaintances were in the vicinity, knows that the stores featured second-hand clothing hanging indiscriminately on plain pipe racks or tossed into giant bins. If there was any motif, it was casual disarray. Most of the stores were found in the poorer sections of cities, sometimes tucked away in dreary brick buildings with Dumpsters on the side.
Now, an oversize thrift has shown up in suburban West Hartford, renowned for its high per capita income and excellent school system. Granted, the site of the thrift, in the Shield Street Plaza off New Britain Avenue, is in a less affluent part of town near the Hartford line but it is still West Hartford.
What's going on here? Is the Salvation Army moving into mainstream retailing? Is the old dreary image of urban thrift stores giving way to a new, brighter one in suburia? The answers to both, Captain Cranford said, is yes.
The reason for the new approach, he said, is simple: the Salvation Army needs more money to carry out increasingly more expensive programs that range from housing the homeless to rehabilitating drug and alcohol abusers.
Because the Salvation Army is a religious organization, it is cut off from funds available to many other social service organizations, Captain Crawford said. In Hartford, for example, he and his wife, Deborah, supervise the Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center for drug addicts and alcoholics. It can handle 112 people on a long-term basis and accepts people of any or no religious affiliation as well as atheists.
The annual budget for the rehabilitation center has escalated to $5.2 million a year but the center receives no money from the United Way, Captain Cranford said, and only $173,000 from the state. Faced with raising nearly all of the money himself, he is creating new and bigger thrift stores for the revenue they can generate. Of the 11 stores he supervises, he personally started four -- in Mansfield, Bristol, Newington and the giant in West Hartford -- in the two years he has been in Connecticut. He expects to open another in a Windsor shopping center this month.
The reason for moving into suburbia is a simple one: the money is there.
"It's a good market," Captain Cranford said."I need people with money to shop at our stores, and they live there." But he believes the move to bigger and better stores in suburbia also benefits the poorer people of the cities that the Salvation Army has traditionally served since the movement was started in the East End of London in 1865 as a Christian organization with a semi-military structure.
"People from the cities can shop with dignity in these stores," Captain Cranford said. "They can find what they want easily, the right size, the right color. And no one knows that some of them are assisted by Salvation Army vouchers for their purchases. This is meeting their needs with dignity."
 
Business Is Booming
 It is also evidently meeting the needs of many suburbanites. Business is booming at the newer and bigger thrifts, according to Captain Cranford, dramatically answering the question of whether people who live in big homes with manicured lawns and follow the stock market will shop in a store that carries a big THRIFT sign.
"Just check our parking lot on a weekend," Captain Cranford invited. "You'll see cars that barely make it to the lot but you'll also see Beamers and Saabs and Mercedes. People in West Hartford are smart shoppers."
In many cases, Captain Cranford believes that residents of wealthier communities do not have as much money to spare as is generally believed. "Their costs are up, the cost of educating their kids is up, and they're worried about jobs, too. I think they appreciate us."
The trend to larger stores, patterned after chain discount stores, is not confined to Connecticut or New England. It is a national pattern. Before Captain Cranford came to Connecticut, he opened new stores in the Jersey City, N.J., and Columbus, Ohio, metropolitan areas.
 
Stigma Fades
 Sometimes he is amused at the reaction of some people who do not quite know what to expect when they enter the West Hartford store. "They go 'Wow, this is O.K. I can deal with this.' The stigma of shopping at a thrift store is gone."
All the second-hand clothing is donated, which means those stores start off with a definite advantage over regular merchandisers. Do they resent the Army's intrusion on their turf?
Captain Cranford says no. "They like us as neighbors; we bring people in," he said. The Shield Street Plaza in West Hartford also contains such stores as Caldor and Radio Shack, a Waldbaum supermarket and a McDonald's. The large building the thrift store occupies had been vacant for months after a large lumber store fell prey to the recession and moved out. But the shopping center's look of abandonment turned to one of prosperity again, thanks to the addition of a store that deals in recycled clothing.
 
'The Original Recyclers'
 "We're the original recyclers," said Captain Cranford of his organization. "Without us, a lot of clothing would wind up in landfills. We don't waste anything. Clothes we get that are too worn or torn we bale up and send to third world countries."
He paused for a moment. "We also recycle people," he said. "All this goes for giving people a new chance at life at our rehabilitation center.
"And we add to the economy. The workers in our stores mostly come off welfare. We train them and they work hard. They want to work. This year, we've added 25 new jobs. That means 25 people are not dependent on welfare. And the state gets revenue from the sales tax."
The Salvation Army officer, a youthful, muscular man of 42, brings a personal expertise to the new business of retailing. He was involved in business, including retailing, before he joined the Army in 1981.
Although his parents and a grandmother were Salvation Army officers, he said he had no plans to join when he was growing up. After graduation from a small college in Maine, he said he first went to work for a clothing chain, then sold insurance and prospered in that, and finally became an executive for a major company.
In 1981, at age 31, he had a wife, three young children, the luxuries money could buy and a big house in Woodbury. He had attained the life style he thought he wanted.
But he was unhappy, he said, and it was reflected in a growing addiction to alcohol. "I'd get out of work and go to a bar and drink," he said. Something was missing. That year, he and Deborah enrolled at the Salvation Army seminary in Suffern, N.Y., to become ministers. There have been no regrets. "I love this job," Paul Cranford said.

HEADLINE: Assembly to Examine Youth Agency

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AN investigation by the State Division of Youth and Family Services into the events surrounding the injury of a 2-year-old Edison boy has triggered a wide-ranging legislative examination of the division itself.
Assemblyman Jeff Warsh, Republican of Edison, said the case in his district had been the final straw that led him to call for hearings to look into the division's investigation procedures and the training of caseworkers. He had already been concerned, he said, over "serious problems with the division in communities throughout the state." 
 The first of three scheduled hearings before the Senior Citizens and Social Services Committee has been set for Wednesday, he said.
The Division of Youth and Family Services is responsible for investigating allegations of child abuse and neglect and for the monitoring of families or placement of children in foster homes when such allegations are substantiated. The division has 46,000 active cases, handled by 1,065 caseworkers.
The division has been the object of mounting criticism from some medical professionals, lawyers, parents and child-advocacy groups. They charge that the division and its caseworkers are too often arrogant and relentless in their efforts to obtain evidence of abuse. Critics also say that division caseworkers are often poorly trained, using coercion and other improper techniques during interviews. The division's practice of acting on anonymous accusations is also widely criticized.
Officials and supporters of the agency, however, say it functions well, particularly in light of its limited resources and recent cuts in staff.
"D.Y.F.S. performs tasks that are very difficult and extremely sensitive," said Nicholas R. Scalera, director of the division. He said the agency's responsibilities often "require us to invade the privacy of the family, and when you do that you are going to run into opposition, anger, and a great number of accusations."
Assemblyman Warsh, formerly a lawyer with the State Department of Human Services, called for "ongoing and continuous" legislative oversight of the division. Though the Legislature has looked at criticisms of the agency in the past, he said, "officials in the division knew the legislators would go away, and they did."
The case that led Mr. Warsh to seek the hearings concerned Rabbi Bernhard Rosenberg; his wife, Charlene, and their son, Ari. Last July, Ari was injured when he fell off a trundel bed while playing at home. Eventually, after X-rays were taken, his injury was diagnosed as a spiral fracture of the femur, and he underwent an operation at a local hospital.
The injury is often associated with cases of child abuse, and apparently, Rabbi Rosenberg said, one of the hospital's doctors called the state agency.
"One hour after the operation," the rabbi said, "D.Y.F.S. is in there interrogating me and my wife." In addition to a representative of the division, he said, an investigator from the Monmouth County Prosecutor's office appeared in his son's hospital room, "flashing his badge."
Though the couple agreed to answer the investigators' questions, Rabbi Rosenberg said, they balked when the division investigator demanded that additional X-rays be taken to determine if the boy had sustained any other fractures. The rabbi said he did not want the child subjected to the additional radiation. The investigators persisted.
"The end result was that they said they could keep the baby in the hospital as long as they wanted," Rabbi Rosenberg said. The investigators finally relented when the couple's lawyer insisted that they produce a court order for the additional X-rays.
In addition to being arrogant and insensitive, Rabbi Rosenberg said, the division investigator refused to call the family's pediatrician to obtain Ari's medical history, refused to answer any questions regarding the grounds for the suspicion of abuse, and subjected the couple's 8-year old daughter to a telephone interrogation that left her crying.
In the end, the division closed the case after finding that Ari's injury was accidental.
"With D.Y.F.S., you're guilty until proven innocent," Rabbi Rosenberg said.
Division officials say that confidentiality requirements prohibit them from commenting on the Rosenberg case or any other specific case. But speaking in general terms, Mr. Scalera said that division practices and procedures "are not grounded in some willy-nilly list that we just come up with." They are based, he said, "on statutory authority, which is the fundamental building block of everything we do."
Under state law, he said, any person who has reasonable cause to believe that a child has been abused is required to report that to the authorities. And the division is required by law to investigate every incident of suspected abuse that is reported to it.
 
Anonymous Accusations
 Under current division procedures, anonymous accusations of abuse are pursued by the division. Some experts have criticized the policy.
"If somebody makes a false accusation, they should be open to having legal action taken against them," said Bruce Eden, vice president of the New Jersey Council for Children's Rights, a Wayne-based advocacy group for divorced parents who do not have custody of their children. Anonymous reporting, Mr. Eden said, makes it impossible to track down a false accuser.
In 1991, the division logged 53,750 reports of suspected abuse, Mr. Scalera said, and about 9,400 were anonymous. But about 1,800 of the anonymous reports were ultimately substantiated, he said.
"A one-out-of-five hit rate is a very high risk," he said. "You can't look the other way with that kind of number."
Over all, Mr. Scalera said, 19,489 of the original 53,750 reports of abuse in 1991 were substantiated.
 
'One of the Greatest Abominations'
 But Dr. Richard A. Gardner, a Cresskill psychiatrist and a clinical professor of child psychiatry at the Columbia University Medical School, said the "substantiated" label was sometimes wrong, the result of improper techniques used by division investigators.
"We're living through one of the greatest abominations in the history of this country," Dr. Gardner said, alluding to the way sexual abuse allegations are typically investigated.
In many division investigations, he said, the investigators are "coercive, they're overzealous, and they start off with the assumption that sex abuse took place." Investigators typically ask children leading questions that taint their recollection of events, he said, and in some cases even create false memories of events that may have never occurred.
"The vast majority of people working for D.Y.F.S. are untrained, many are incompetent, many are zealots, and the vast majority of them are doing incompetent evaluations," Dr. Gardner said.
 
Caseworkers Supported
 But Dr. Martin A. Finkel, a medical consultant to the division and a faculty member of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Camden, said the agency's caseworkers were doing a good job, given their heavy workloads. The average caseworker handles about 42 open cases, the division says.
"It's easy to be critical of D.Y.F.S.," Dr. Finkel said. "But it's a difficult job being a caseworker and making these decisions. I would say that most of the caseworkers I've come in contact with are very skilled."
Alisha A. Griffin, an assistant administrator for the division, said that in addition to having a bachelor's degree and one year's experience in social work, every field worker must complete a 15-day orientation program that includes training in investigation, cultural sensitivity and family sensitivity.
In addition, she said, during the first year on the job, workers must take a set of courses geared to specific areas of their assignment. For example, a caseworker would have to take a four-day course in child sex abuse investigation before being allowed to handle a sex abuse case. Moreover, caseworkers are assigned a "buddy" during the first month they handle cases, and are given only a few cases each week as they build their caseload.
 
'Law Needs to Be Changed'
 Too often, some critics charge, the training does not work. Herb Klitzner, a North Bergen lawyer who represented a couple anonymously accused of drug abuse, a charge that was never substantiated, called the division "the Spanish Inquisition of child welfare."
He said that a division investigator began an interview with the couple's 9-year-old son by telling him that his father was suspected of having a drug problem.
"The law needs to be changed to require any interview with a child to be taped from beginning to end," Mr. Klitzner said.
Division officials said that while they were open to suggestions that would improve the investigatory process, audio taping might not be the answer. "It has a chilling effect," said Raymond Wolfinger, supervisor of the division's office of legal and regulatory liaisons. "People would not be as forthcoming in interviews if there was a tape running."
Some experts say that division policies encourage investigators to engage in relentless searches for instances of abuse to the point of intentionally excluding witnesses who may provide contrary evidence.
 
Battle for Girl's Custody
 "In New Jersey we have an agency that is unbridled and out of control," said Dr. Lawrence D. Spiegel, a Morristown psychologist who was himself the target of a division investigation in 1983. "In many instances they are doing more damage to children and families than they are doing good."
During a bitter battle for custody of his 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Dr. Spiegel's wife filed an accusation with the division that he had sexually abused the child.
Without interviewing him, and without having the child examined by a doctor to determine if there was evidence of abuse, Dr. Spiegel said, the division notified the Morris County Prosecutor's office of the accusation.
"I was arrested and charged with first-degree aggravated sexual assault the next day," said Dr. Spiegel, who said he felt compelled to resign his position as chairman of the psychology department at Morris County Community College. It was three years before he was allowed to see his daughter again -- after a jury trial in which he was acquitted of all charges.
"In the course of three years D.Y.F.S. never, ever requested to talk to me," he said.
Gary M. Burrus, a social work supervisor with the division, said that many of the criticisms leveled against the division were warranted.
Field workers, he said, "make very bad mistakes all the time." He added: "These folks are guided by a philosophy that is so paranoic, that is so completely driven by fear of making a mistake, that consequently, a lot of people are getting labeled as child abusers who are not child abusers at all."
 
Set of Checks and Balances
 Mr. Scalera, however, said such charges "couldn't be further from the truth." He said that an intricate set of checks and balances -- from an independent oversight committee that monitors the division's actions to the state court system -- insures the fairness of the agency's investigations.
"We are trying to fulfill our mission under very difficult economic conditions," Mr. Scalera said. For the third year in a row, the division is losing employees as a result of layoffs caused by budget cuts. And while nearly all those layoffs have been among management personnel, he said, the reduced staffing inevitably puts greater pressure on the district offices.
Caseworkers have a reputation for being villains, said Dr. Richard Klein, a forensic psychologist from Caldwell who is a consultant to the division, but the reputation is false. "As a matter of fact," he said, "they save lives on a routine basis and the public has no idea."

HEADLINE: Service Clubs Rallying To Reverse Their Slide

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG

 BODY:
ONCE upon a time, in municipalities all over New Jersey, clubs made up of doctors, lawyers, bankers and other community leaders met once a week for lunch. The groups, each a small local branch of a large national organization, offered members a chance to socialize, conduct a little private business and organize community service projects. They called themselves Rotarians, Kiwanis or Lions, and they proudly erected signs at city or town limits proclaiming their existence.
The signs still greet newcomers to New Jersey communities, but the letters are often faded. The clubs behind the signs now find themselves fighting against the tide of social change; their most crucial project is survival. 
 The nation's five largest service clubs, Rotary, Lions, Kiwanis, Jaycees and Optimists, still claim thousands of New Jersey members. The state groups range in size from the Rotary Club (9,579 members and 249 clubs) to the Optimists (1,600 members and 45 clubs). But leaders of all five clubs say membership has declined over the last five years.
The clubs are not taking this sitting down. They are recruiting at public events, revising their social projects and volunteer work to keep up with the times and replacing the traditional lunch with morning and evening sessions. Membership restrictions as to race, religion, sex or ethnic background have been dropped, and only the Jaycees restrict membership by age. (Members must be between 25 and 40.)
The most frequently cited reason for the service clubs' decline is that familiar specter, the economy. The recession in white-collar jobs is so deep that it has touched even middle-age service-club stalwarts.
"When people are unemployed or worried about their jobs, they don't worry about club meetings," said Austin Johnson, a district governor of the Kiwanis Club, who also noted that two of this year's Kiwanis district governors had suddenly found themselves unemployed. For some people in actual or anticipated financial jeopardy, the cost of dues plus once-a-week meals has seemed too high.
Service club officers offer other reasons for the membership decline. In families where both parents work outside the home, family time may take precedence over community service. Many small towns have become bedroom communities, and the commuters who inhabit them sometimes have less of an interest in a local service club than do longtime residents. Even commuters who want to join the Rotary Club or the Jaycees have trouble attending regular meetings, particularly luncheons.
Another factor that works against club membership is what Dr. Lionel Tiger, a Rutgers anthropology professor, called "a lack of residential stability." A person joining the Kiwanis or Optimists in 1955, Dr. Tiger said, could count on being socially and professionally involved with the same people in 1965. Increased mobility has changed that assumption, reducing the value of club membership. Dr. Tiger said that young professionals might also feel that old-line clubs were "out of synch with the times."
Robert Wagner, a 52-year-old executive in Marlton who is district governor of the Lions Club, sees another, less tangible reason for the club's decline. Describing the 1980's as "the yuppie period," he said the prevailing hedonism of that decade affected the willingness of young professionals to become involved in community activities.
The traditional, nonfraternal service organizations are determined, however, not to go dinosaur-like down the road to extinction. The change in the times of club meetings, for example, has been dramatic. Only 6 of the 300 New Jersey Lions Clubs still hold noon meetings.
Honey Morganstern, who like her father, Jack Rosen, is a Rotarian from Fair Lawn, founded a "spinoff" Rotary Club in that borough. It meets for breakfast, which ends on time so commuters can catch their trains. Ms. Morganstern says her group has attracted new, younger members, at least partly because of the morning meetings.
Breakfast meetings, said Austin Johnson of the Kiwanis Club, benefit both time- and cost-conscious members by keeping meal prices down. Some retired Kiwanians even meet for coffee and doughnuts to lower expenses further.
The major service clubs were founded in the Middle West in the first two decades of the 20th century. Because membership was restricted to community leaders, local Rotarians or Lions also had local clout, Dr. Tiger said. Established service clubs, he added, had a role in the social structuring of small communities.
In some cities and towns, service club membership still carries a certain amount of prestige, Mr. Johnson said. "It depends on the community and the size of the club," said the 36-year veteran Kiwanian, a lawyer from Caldwell.
 
Admission of Women
 In the last five years, women have made the biggest change in the service club scene. The Jaycees changed their national bylaws to allow women after a 1984 United States Supreme Court ruling requiring them to do so. In 1987 a similar decision against Rotary International forced the opening of that club's ranks to women.
A fraternal ripple effect followed, and later that same year the Lions, Kiwanis and Optimists eliminated their rules barring female members.
In New Jersey, the Jaycees (formerly known as the Junior Chambers of Commerce) lead other clubs in the percentage of women admitted to their ranks. Alisa Hodawanec, president of the New Jersey Jaycees, estimates that her organization is 20 to 30 percent female, with 500 to 700 women. The Lions, Rotary, Kiwanis and Optimists range from 8 to 10 percent female members statewide.
In many clubs, women have moved into leadership roles. Phyllis Dejesse of Freehold, who owns a health-care advertising company, is about to become state governor of the Optimist Club; she will be the first woman to hold such a post in the United States. About 13 percent of the Rotary Clubs in the state have female presidents.
 
Making Connections
 Women have joined for the same reason that men traditionally do: business and social connections. Ms. Morganstern, who owns a travel agency with her father, said she had no desire to join Rotary when women were first admitted. But she booked Rotary conventions through her travel agency and eventually found that "I really had to be a Rotarian for business reasons."
Service club leaders say that minority membership is also increasing. Mr. Wagner, the Lions Club district governor, said members of various minorities made up about 20 percent of the New Jersey Lions, with a large number of Hispanic members in northern areas of the state.
Leo Chernev of Newark, state governor of the Optimist Club, noted that a new club in Paterson was largely composed of Jamaican immigrants. Mr. Johnson said that minority membership had risen in the Kiwanis Club, which had a black district governor in 1987-1988.
The clubs are making a special effort to recruit new members. Mr. Wagner said the Lions Club used the networking skills of its members to seek out potential Lions where they work: in banks, insurance offices and other businesses. These recruiters arrange to make presentations at businesses, or sit down with individuals to discuss the organization and invite the person to a meeting.
 
'Get Out the Vote' Effort
 The Jaycees hope to attract new members by increasing their visibility. Ms. Hodawanec said local Jaycees clubs had sponsored "get out the vote" efforts before elections as well as candidates' debates. The Jaycees are also setting up booths at community events.
Locally and nationally, all five clubs have made efforts to update their service projects. In the last few years, Rotary, Lions and Optimists have joined the antidrug crusade, underwriting the costs of established school-based drug education programs like "Just Say No," Dare and Quest. Local schools are provided with antidrug curriculums, sometimes augmented by outside speakers. (In the case of Dare, the speakers are local police officers.)
A new variation on the antidrug theme is the Optimists' "Get Real" program against steroid abuse. Ms. Dejesse is responsible for the initiative, which is providing schools with literature and speakers.
While New Jersey service clubs still concentrate on traditional children's charities, supporting essay contests, summer camps and projects for the handicapped, some have turned in new directions.
Mr. Chernev said one Optimist Club in southern New Jersey ran its own soccer league, with members providing coaching as well as financial support to 500 to 600 children. The Kiwanis Clubs' two-year-old "Young Children Priority One" program encourages prenatal care and maternal education, sometimes working through hospitals.
 
Focus on Children
 Both Mr. Chernev and Mr. Johnson of the Kiwanis Club say they think that their clubs' focus on children will attract parents of young families to their ranks.
Some clubs have increased their involvement in "hands on" projects. Some members of the Secaucus Rotary Club, for example, are in training to become literacy volunteers. Ms. Morganstern's Fair Lawn Rotary Club helped build a park this summer, and this month will "adopt" another, taking responsibility for painting, cleaning and some maintenance. The Eatontown Lions Club built a home ramp for a handicapped local resident and rebuilt a halfway house for women.
Though networking is traditional in the service clubs, some groups are exploring new ways of doing it. The Jaycees publish Biznet, a statewide list of Jaycees members cross-referenced by address and occupation.
The Secaucus Rotary Club will meet with neighboring Rotary Clubs to hold a "business card exchange" this month. As part of this exchange, businesses in the area will be charged a nominal fee to send representatives who will, it is hoped, mingle with the participating Rotarians, making contacts and exchanging business cards.
In the long run, Mr. Wagner of the Lions said, he expects that membership will increase as New Jersey and the rest of the country become further removed from the attitudes of the 80's. He is convinced that refugees from 80's-style selfishness will eventually find that the route to altruism runs straight to the time-honored service organizations.

HEADLINE: 2 Old Foes Square Off Again in Bid for Congress

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
THE battlefield is new -- a Congressional district once contained entirely within Westchester, which now, after redistricting, also includes a thin strip of the Bronx as well as most of central Queens -- but the contestants are familiar, certainly to each other, and so are most of the issues. 
 The 18th Congressional District, as it is now designated, was the 20th Congressional District when Joseph J. DioGuardi, a Republican-Conservative, won it in 1986 with a narrow, 51 percent majority over Oren J. Teicher, a top aide to Richard L. Ottinger, who was retiring. Mr. DioGuardi, claiming to be the first certified public accountant ever elected to Congress, captured a seat long considered safe for Democrats.
 
Defeated by Nita Lowey in 1988
 It was his first bid for elected office and he won re-election in 1986, beating Bella S. Abzug, a transplanted Manhattan resident seeking a return to Congress. But in 1988, in a stunning upset, he lost the seat to another novice, Nita Lowey, who was making her first bid for elected office.
Mr. DioGuardi sat out the 1990 campaign, when Ms. Lowey won re-election easily over Glenn Bellippo with a 63 percent margin, but now the New Rochelle resident has decided to challenge Ms. Lowey in what appears to be a grudge match. He says the new district favors him and could reverse the 1988 results, when he lost by fewer than 6,000 votes.
Their earlier face-off was bitterly contested, and among the nation's most expensive Congressional races, with each candidate spending more than $1 million. The rematch has the earmarks of another costly race. Mr. DioGuardi, who spent $1.6 million in 1988, said last week that "it will cost us another $1 million dollars; we've already raised $350,000."
The race, he says, is among the most closely watched Congressional contests in the country and a "top target" in New York State for the National Republican Congressional Committee. "I expect to get the maximum assistance, $60,000, from the N.R.C.C. -- $10,000 in cash and $50,000 in services." He said he has "probably the best opportunity of anybody to take out an incumbent."
 
Pinning His Hopes on Redistricting
 One reason for Mr. DioGuardi's confidence, he said, is that redistricting removed 83,000 voters from the new district, reducing the percentage of voters representing minority groups. In 1988 Ms. Lowey beat Mr. DioGuardi by 56 percent to 44 percent in that part of the old 20th Congressional District that is no longer in the new 18th Congressional District, but in the part of the old 20th remaining in the new 18th, Mr. DioGuardi got 51 percent.
He says the top issue is economics, jobs and taxes. Ms. Lowey "is the quintessential tax and spend liberal, even more so than Barney Sanders from Vermont, the only Socialist elected to Congress. He has a 95 percent favorable rating with the Americans for Democratic Action, while they give Nita Lowey 100 percent.
"She's walking around describing herself as a moderate. That's what this election is all about -- to expose who she is and to alert the people to who I am. I'm the only practicing certified public accountant elected in 215 years who understands the process of capital formation.
"I wrote a book, 'Unaccountable Congress: It Doesn't Add Up,' that's been out only three months," Mr. DioGuardi said, "and I've been on 76 radio talk shows." He speaks of the national debt as being tallied on a "Mickey Mouse cash basis of accounting" and says "the Congressional voting card is the most expensive credit card in the world; they just put off payment until the next generation."
If this sounds familiar, it is. Mr. DioGuardi made much of his accounting skills in earlier campaigns, but this time he is also emphasizing his criticism of Ms. Lowey for voting against the death penalty "for drug kingpins and warlords if they commit murder."
He said that on the death penalty issue, "she is just like Governor Cuomo, who trained her. He's her mentor; she worked for him." Ms. Lowey was employed in the New York Department of State for 12 years, the last two as Assistant Secretary of State.
Mr. DioGuardi has also criticized Ms. Lowey's position on "obscenity and pornography," saying she supports controversial programs financed by the National Endowment for the Arts, and he has rebuked her for voting against sending troops to the Persian Gulf.
Ms. Lowey said Mr. DioGuardi is "good on rhetoric but is a failed former Congressman who cannot talk about his accomplishments because he has none."
She said she has voted for economic-growth incentives, has helped bring jobs to Mount Vernon (a proposed transportation hub), Yonkers (manufacturing subway cars), New Rochelle (relocating the Navy Motion Picture Service there) and White Plains (a new Federal courthouse). She said she helped prepare a report that calls for cutting $60 billion to $85 billion in wasteful Government spending.
 
Anti-Crime Bill Supported
 She said she has been active in improving educational assistance, especially in Head Start, child care and other early-childhood areas. She supports a comprehensive anti-crime bill designated to put more police officers on the streets, establish boot camps for first-time youthful offenders and help keep drugs out of schools.
Mr. DioGuardi takes credit for helping to establish a chief financial officer in the Federal Government and for "setting up the Long Island Sound Caucus and the Hudson River Caucus, which made my opponent's role easy; she uses those platforms well, as she should, but they were my ideas."
These and other issues may dominate a series of debates between the candidates scheduled to begin in mid-October. So far, the prospective debates have been overshadowed by accusations from both sides about illegal campaign tactics in the 1988 race and by a dispute over responsibility for the cost to the town of Harrison of a site for a new regional post office.
Mr. DioGuardi, who was campaigning against Ms. Lowey two months before he officially entered the race last January, included her use of "illegally unreported campaign funds" in radio ads at that time. She has, in turn, recalled similar accusations against the former Congressman, in his case probably instrumental in his losing the election.
 
Committee Paid $3,500 Penalty
 In July 1991, the Lowey campaign committee agreed to pay a $3,500 civil penalty for failing to disclose that Ms. Lowey lent the campaign $250,000 during her 1988 race. The loan, which came in four installments, was made during the final days of the race.
Federal election law requires that during the last days of a campaign, committees must disclose contributions of more than $1,000 within 48 hours of the contribution. Mr. DioGuardi has often stated that "the Congresswoman bought her seat by hiding the last-minute loans from the voters."
The other incident exploded on the election scene two weeks before polling day with a report that Joseph Crabtree, a New Rochelle auto dealer and member of the DioGuardi campaign finance committee, had apparently violated Federal laws by reimbursing employees with "bonuses" equal to contributions they had made to the DioGuardi campaign.
The candidate denied any involvement, but Mr. Crabtree told a Federal judge in May 1989 that Mr. DioGuardi had masterminded the scheme. Mr. DioGuardi has since repeated his denials. He said in a recent interview that he has a completely new campaign staff for this year's race.
Last Thursday, Dennis Mehiel, the County Democratic chairman, said that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee was writing that day to the Federal Election Commission demanding that its investigation of Mr. DioGuardi's alleged involvement in the Crabtree incident "be brought to a conclusion."
Mr. Mehiel, at a news conference, said the commission "may have held its investigation in abeyance pending the outcome" of the Justice Department inquiry that resulted in Mr. Crabtree's conviction. United States Attorney Otto Obermaier on Aug. 26 said Mr. DioGuardi was "neither a subject nor a target of an investigation" by his office.
 
Agreement Negotiated
 In the post office dispute, Mr. DioGuardi has accused Ms. Lowey of accepting $1,000 in campaign contributions from Lowell Schulman, a developer whose company sold land in Harrison to the Postal Service for $21 million. The land is for a regional postal plant.
Mr. Schulman was one of 29 members on a committee named by Ms. Lowey in 1989 to find an alternative location to the Postal Service's preferred site at the County Airport in Purchase. The committee recommended a site in Yonkers, which postal authorities rejected, picking the Schulman property instead.
Ms. Lowey negotiated an agreement last winter with the former Postmaster General, Anthony M. Frank, in which the Postal Service was to pay the town $400,000 in partial compensation for the estimated $1.7 million in taxes it would no longer receive from the Schulman property once it became tax exempt as Government property.
Mr. DioGuardi said Ms. Lowey had made a bad deal -- a one-time payment of $400,000 for the loss "in perpetuity" of the much larger tax payments -- and failed to monitor the agreement properly. The Postal Service recently decided to retract its offer to pay the $400,000 because the town had "rejected" the amount and because the Postal Service could not afford it.
Delays by Harrison officials in acknowledging the deal evidently was taken by postal authorities as rejection of it. Meanwhile, Ms. Lowey and Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government, joined in getting approval for an amendment to an appropriations bill "directing" the post office to pay Harrison the promised $400,000.

HEADLINE: 'Who Prospers?'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In its preoccupation with the chapter on blacks, Jason DeParle's review of my book "Who Prospers? How Cultural Values Shape Economic and Political Success" (Aug. 16) misses the basic point not only of the book but also of the chapter on blacks. 
 "Who Prospers?" seeks to demonstrate (1) that, among the numerous factors that influence why some nations and ethnic groups do better than others, culture is, in the long run, the most important, indeed influencing some of the other factors (for example, politics and policies); and (2) that culture changes, often as a consequence of politics.
The point of the chapter on blacks is not to do a comprehensive analysis of the ghetto problem, which Mr. DeParle correctly implies would itself require a book, but to examine culture as an alternative to the other broad explanation -- racism and discrimination -- of the ghetto tragedy. This is why the chapter focuses on the two-thirds of America's blacks who have made it into the middle class; black immigrants from the Caribbean (for example, Colin Powell's parents), who do better than white Americans; and the relevance of the tragic histories of Haiti and Liberia.
The force and persistence of culture are underscored by the poverty of Appalachia, which Mr. DeParle attributes to "the conquering coal industry, not the laboring miners trapped in company towns."
As the historian David Hackett Fischer has documented in "Albion's Seed," the roots of Appalachian poverty trace back to precolonial north Britain, whence came most of the "backcountry" settlers. They brought with them traditions of highly inequitable income distribution, little concern with education and suppression of entrepreneurial activity, which, coupled with the isolation that so often accompanies poverty, lie behind Appalachia's distress.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Has the Dollar, At Long Last, Hit Bottom?

BYLINE: By Steven Greenhouse

 BODY:
Since 1985, the dollar has gone from Schwarzenegger-like to 98-pound weakling. Last week it slid to record lows against the Japanese yen and flirted with new lows against the German mark.
The question now is whether the once-almighty dollar will become a slightly heftier 108-pound weakling or an 88-pound pipsqueak.
The dollar could continue its slide if the Federal Reserve cuts rates further to pep up the torpid economy, as many economists predict. A rate cut would hurt the dollar by encouraging money managers to buy marks or yen as they seek higher-yielding investments abroad. 
 Administration officials insist that the dollar is so weak because Germany's interest rates are so high, not because American economic growth is so anemic. This assertion seems to ring a tad hollow, because when the dollar rose during Europe's currency crisis, White House officials said this was a sign of America's economic strength.
David D. Hale, chief economist for the Kemper Financial Companies, said the dollar "has finally scraped bottom" against the mark because of the belief that German interest rates have peaked. He added that the dollar "will get weaker against the yen" because Japan's trade surplus continues to burgeon.
Paul Chertkow, director of global currency research for UBS Phillips & Drew in London, was not as optimistic. "The dollar is still very vulnerable on the downside against the German mark," he said. "There is a good chance the dollar will test new lows, primarily because of continued German intransigence toward cutting rates."
He said the dollar, which closed at 1.409 marks on Friday, would soon test the 1.40 barrier, and if it fell through that, it could sink past the record low of 1.386 and reach 1.35.
Most economists forecast that the dollar will rebound against the mark next year. "I think the dollar could close the year at 1.50, and in the first half of next year it could go up rapidly to 1.70," Mr. Chertkow said. "Next year we will see the Germans cut their rates," and "that will occur when, we believe, the U.S. economy will be recovering more solidly."
John P. Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said that as a result of a lackluster American economy and the likelihood of further rate cuts, "the upward move of the dollar against the mark should be relatively modest." He sees the dollar clawing back to 1.60 marks, at most, next year.
But Mr. Lipsky sees the yen continuing its rise against the dollar as the yen remains the preferred haven during Europe's currency crisis. The yen looks so attractive because Japan's economy should soon pick up steam thanks to an immense public works program.
"The yen should be aided by the upturn in Japanese economic growth and the prospect that Japan has finished easing its monetary policy," Mr. Lipsky said. He predicted that the dollar, which closed Friday at 119.35 yen, would drop "to 115 yen certainly or perhaps even less."

For Novice Shareholders 'Adam Smith' in Russian

BYLINE: By F. DUAYNE DRAFFEN

 BODY:
Goodness knows, the Russians need all the help they can get as they ease into the fast lane of free enterprise. And who better to lend a hand than Adam Smith? Of course, this "Adam Smith" is the nom de television of George J. W. Goodman, the host of the Public Broadcasting Service business program.
"In one big leap, the Russians have passed the United States in terms of individual shareholders," Mr. Goodman said. "Think about that." He was referring to the state vouchers that can be used to buy stock that every Russian citizen started receiving on Thursday. 
 "Adam Smith," which has been seen in Russia since 1990, started its ninth season in this country on Thursday with a segment videotaped in Moscow. The segment dealt with the continuing, and in some cases deepening, problems that President Boris Yeltsin faces as he makes radical economic reforms.
Mr. Goodman, 62 years old, is also author and has written several books about economics and finance, including "The Roaring 80's" and "The Money Game."
He said the Russians' favorite program topics were American inventors and patents and "anything about women starting up a business."
He said the program was shown with a translator doing a voice-over narration of the topic being discussed. While this works fine in most cases, Mr. Goodman said, a show on the economics of baseball apparently proved a bit too much.
"Now I am of course speaking perfect English," Mr. Goodman recalled the translator telling him when they later met. "But you must realize that in Russia serfdom ended in 1863. After 1917, the Communists said you could not even employ someone as a chauffeur, maid or other servant. Yet in your show you said Boston sold two men as outfielders to Chicago. How can this be?"
In Russia, the program can be seen on Channel 1 of the All Union network, with a potential viewership of 100 million. Imagine the fund-raising possibilities.

Hamburgers or Home Decorating? Businesses That Sell

BYLINE: By VERONICA BYRD

 BODY:
Though the harsh economic climate has battered many major corporations, franchisors, the companies that license their names and expertise to entrepreneurs eager for a lucrative piece of the American Dream, have as a group seen increasing gains in both ownership and sales.
In fact, part of that lift has come because of the recession, as companies cut back by dismissing workers with severance pay and offering sometimes-generous buyout plans. Many former executives, managers and employees have turned to buying franchises. 
 For an initial investment and yearly royalty payments, franchise buyers can often get training, business name recognition, start-up financing and even advertising help.
This weekend, more than 25,000 people curious about joining those ranks are expected at the American Franchise Association show at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, L.I. There, some 120 companies have set up booths to display their versions of how easy it can be to prosper as a franchisee.
But a darker side of the industry is emerging. Saying that they were misled by slick or unscrupulous companies, franchisees are increasingly calling for new Federal regulations. Many of these business owners say franchisors hype the potential for profits, pressure them to sign one-sided "take it or leave it" 50-page contracts and provide little help afterward if their operations run into trouble.
The International Franchise Association, a Washington-based trade group that represents more than 800 franchisors, dismisses such charges as the complaints of a small number of people who probably do not have what it takes to run a business.
 
Starting Up
The Industry Gains During Hard Times
 The total number of franchises in the United States grew 4 percent, to 542,496 in 1991, from 521,215 in 1990, according to Francorp Inc., a franchise development and consulting firm. That is expected to rise nearly 15 percent in 1992, based on the rosy projections of a study this year by the I.F.A. John Reynolds, executive vice president of the association, acknowledged that in light of last year's meager rise, the expected increase "is very optimistic." He added, that "it doesn't mean that every single franchise will do this well."
Continued growth is expected in print shops, restaurants, retail shops and car servicing outlets. New kinds of franchises expected to surge include Kitchen Tune Up, a remodeling business, and United Coupon, a small-business coupon service. And businesses targeting the booming children's market, like USA Baby, a furniture store, and those aimed at older people, like Reading Glasses to Go, should also do well, consultants say.
"The franchise industry thrives during tough economic times," said Michael H. Baum, executive vice president of Francorp, which is based in Olympia Fields, Ill., outside Chicago. "When recessions hit, a lot of people who are out of work start their own businesses. They often don't have a lot of capital, and franchising is the best way to go into business without a lot of capital."
Some franchises, like a simple home decorating or commercial-cleaning operation, can be started for as little as $5,000, but the average investment, including equipment and other initial costs, is about $140,000. And the privilege of owning a top established restaurant or hotel can cost $1 million or more.
In addition to a one-time franchise fees, franchisees are required to pay yearly royalty costs, typically 2 percent to 8 percent of gross sales.
Franchises "come with a lot of the same risks as any small business," said William B. Cherkasky, president of the International Franchise Association. "But because of the many support services provided there is a far greater chance of success than starting a small business on your own."
 
The Competition
Sometimes, Dreams End Up Going Sour
 Even franchise buyers who thought they had done careful research have ended up losing their homes and cars when their business soured.
Especially vulnerable are franchises built on an idea that is easily duplicated. Owners of The Country's Best Yogurt, also called TCBY, found themselves in fierce competition for customers as the franchisor, based in Little Rock, allowed too many shops to be established near one other. At the same time, two or three other yogurt franchises were vying for the same spaces in shopping malls and business districts around the nation.
"Frozen yogurt is a seasonal product with not a lot of upscale potential," said Mr. Baum of Francorp. "Other more diversified snack food companies began offering the same product and taking their business away."
Consultants advise obtaining a copy of the franchise disclosure circular, one of the few documents the Federal Trade Commission requires of all franchisors. The circulars include a detailed description of the business, start-up costs and applicable fees.
But when it comes to dealing with a franchisor, it is wise to remember that "franchising is simply a relationship, a method of distribution," said Edward Kushell, president of the Franchise Consulting Group. "One of the most important things to learn is how to manage that relationship."
Some chains seem to have as many stores close each year as they have new ones opening. But figures from an I.F.A. study found more than 95 percent of companies opened in the last five years were still operating.
Mr. Reynolds of the I.F.A. did note that 15 percent of the franchises that opened in the last five years no longer had the original owner.
"That means that something happened to those people," he said.
 
Making the Choice
Shopping Around For a Business
 Many of the newest franchise owners are former corporate executives who were laid off or became disgruntled with corporate life.
Donald Boyle opened his Alphagraphics Printshops of the Future store in March 1991 in Stamford, Conn., with a $340,000 start-up investment. He decided he could use his managerial and sales skills -- gained from more than 25 years in retailing -- to break the company's record for first-year sales.
Mr. Boyle, a former executive vice president with Lord & Taylor, and former chairman of Hahnes, a department store, accomplished that and more. His store had almost $500,000 in sales the first year, he said.
Begun in 1970 in Tucson, Ariz., the Alphagraphics chain now has 325 stores in 14 countries.
Wayne Hale and his wife, Carolyn, of Crossville, Tenn., spent more than a year extensively researching restaurant franchises before buying a Krystal Kwik hamburger outlet. The fast-food restaurants have dual drive-through lanes and outside seating only.
In addition to researching food costs, employee training and legal fees, Mr. Hale parked near restaurants and counted the cars in their lots. "That gave me a pretty good idea of the kind of traffic the restaurants were getting on an average day," he said.
The Hales opened their first Krystal Kwik in Crossville, about 80 miles west of Knoxville, in September 1990, becoming the first Krystal Company franchisee. They have just opened a second one in Cookeville, about 40 miles east of the first restaurant.
Mr. Hale, who had owned a medical equipment company, said 18-hour days, seven days a week were typical for the first six months. But he is optimistic that his Krystal Kwiks, where a hamburger costs 43 cents, will be a big draw for families. "People are very conscious of their spending," he said. But at Krystal, you can feed an entire family with $10 and have change left over."
 
 
OPEN-DOOR RECRUITING
 When Renee C. Greenleaf and her family began the search for a franchise, their biggest concern was finding one "that would provide a needed service to the community, rather than one that was a luxury," she said.
Ms. Greenleaf, the owner and operator of a Mail Boxes Etc., which provides postal and business services in downtown Newark, said she; her mother, Marguerita Calloway, the company's vice president, and her brother, Albert Calloway, who is president, were attracted to franchising because of the training and skills they could take advantage of.
"An independent person would have to stumble over and take the hard knocks for themselves," Ms. Greenleaf said. "But the franchisors are there to provide the necessary training and ongoing support."
The Calloways, who are black, are among a small, but growing, percentage of minorities in franchising.
Franchisors say they are increasing their efforts to recruit more women and minorities into the industry by aggressive recruiting, advertising and special programs.
In April, the International Franchise Association created the Alliance for Minority Opportunities in Franchising with the goal of increasing the number of opportunities for women and minorities to own franchises and to expand the use of minority vendor and supplier companies.
About 14,000 -- or 2.5 percent -- of the 550,000 United States franchises are minority-owned, according to the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in Washington. In a study of 366 franchise companies, the International Franchise Association reported 9.5 percent were owned by minorites.
Reaching out to women and minorites "is not a social responsiblity but a business imperative," said Ron Harrison, the chairman of the I.F.A.'s Minorities and Women in Franchising Committee.
The committee is encouraging major franchisors like McDonald's, Baskin-Robbins and 7-Eleven to develop programs and become more involved in their local communities.

THE ECONOMY
 
Standing on a Platform of 'Fair-Share Sacrifices'
 

In a voting system reminiscent of the one that elected Nikita Khrushchev -- all votes were counted as "yes" -- Ross Perot's volunteers (and others who happened to call his 800 line) overwhelmingly urged him to run. Mr. Perot accepted their draft in a no-nonsense speech. Building on his first foray into Presidential politics, when he was criticized for being long on color ("I'll clean out the barn") but short on specifics, Mr. Perot re-emerged with a credible economic platform filled with statistics. But unlike the economic plans of President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton, Mr. Perot's platform puts shrinking the Federal deficit ahead of economic growth. His plan requires no lip-reading, either. He would raise taxes on the wealthy (to 33 percent, from 31 percent), raise taxes on gasoline and tax the Social Security benefits of well-heeled retirees. The plan also calls for spending cuts of 15 percent for programs other than debt costs and entitlement programs like Medicare. Mr. Perot said implementing the plan would require "fair-share sacrifices." He will begin getting his message out this week with $1 million worth of network air time.

More Jobs, or Fewer Seekers?
 
When the Labor Department reported that unemployment fell in September to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent in August, President Bush said it was "very good news" and meant a full recovery was under way. But Gov. Bill Clinton had a different take on the last unemployment report before the election. It showed Mr. Bush's policies would keep unemployment high "with no end in sight," he said. To economists, the report was inconclusive. Unemployment did go down, but only because "fewer people were out there looking for jobs," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities Inc. With job creation sluggish, they had few reasons to pound the pavement.

A Slip in the Leading Indicators
 
The Government divines the nation's economic future with the aid of the index of leading economic indicators. The index, which consists of 11 components including stock market prices and the length of the work week, forecasts economic growth three to nine months hence. Right now it's saying the end of the year will be anything but rosy. The index slipped 0.2 percent in August, the Commerce Department said, the second decline in the last three months. "The economy is really showing very few signs of life," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.

Consumers' Dampened Spirits
 
American consumers, peering out at the world, seem to be losing their nerve. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 56.4 in September from 59 the month before. It was the third decline in a row for the index, which registered a chipper 72.6 in June and a positively buoyant 100 in 1985. Most troubling for the economy is that consumers, who account for two thirds of all economic activity, don't spend when they feel pessimistic. What's troubling them? Jobs. A "sluggish economy and weak job market are continuing to dampen consumer spirits," said Fabian Linden, who directs the survey.

Manufacturing Takes a Hit
 
It was some of the worst economic news for the manufacturing sector this year. The index of the National Association of Purchasing Managers slipped to 49 percent last month, from 53.7 percent in August. A reading below 50 indicates economic contraction, above 50 indicates expansion. The index is considered a reliable gauge of growth in manufacturing. "Although the overall economy continued to expand in September, the manufacturing sector ground to a halt," said Robert Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee.

The Senate's New Tax Package
 
After four days of raucous debate, the Senate finally came up with a new tax package. Trouble is, it still must be harmonized with a House measure that is very different. And because the Senate bill makes permanent a phase out of exemptions for Americans wealthy enough to be profiled by Robin Leach, it has caught the ire of the White House. The bill also increases tax incentives to businesses that invest in impoverished city neighborhoods, gives a tax credit to first-time home buyers (the House version does not) and expands the use of individual retirement accounts to nearly all taxpayers, allowing them to deduct up to $2,000 annually. And it includes a capital gains write-off on long-term investments made by start-up companies. Is the measure dead in the water? "We'll have to get closer to the provisions of the House bill before there's enactment," said Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
A Stretch of Bad Road
 
Germany's Porsche A.G. makes sports cars that are pretty, pricey and fast. That's a tough market to be in right now. Thanks to the weak global economy, Porsche's sales fell 15 percent in the year ended July 31, to $1.9 billion. Last week, Porsche said it would eliminate 1,000 jobs and restructure itself. With these and other cuts, Porsche will have eliminated 20 percent of its work force, bringing it to 6,200 by mid-1993. Though Porsche has a deal with Daimler Benz to assemble the ultra-luxurious Mercedes 500E, that car's sales are also falling. Analysts wonder if Porsche can continue to exist on its own. "Maybe Daimler or some other auto maker will take a stake in Porsche," said Peter Fliegel, who follows the company for Berwein Wertpapierhandels-und Boersenmakler, a brokerage in Munich.

An International Food Fight

Forget trade frictions over cars. A war now seems to be heating up between Japan and the United States over sushi. To get around Japan's ban on importing American rice, Sushi Boy, an Osaka restaurant chain, opened a sushi plant in Escondido, Calif. The sushi was placed on a ball of rice, frozen and flown to Japan. Sushi Boy wanted to import two million pieces of the sushi a year. It reasoned that Tokyo customs officials would treat the sushi as processed fish -- not rice. Wrong! The first shipment was impounded last week by Japanese customs police and remains in an airport freezer until the Government can decide what to do with it.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Back to Basics for Sears
 
Last week Edward A. Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck & Company, announced that Sears would sell its securities business, the Discover credit card, its real estate operations and up to 20 percent of its Allstate insurance subsidiary. "We are responsive to our shareholders," Mr. Brennan said, indicating that some of the proceeds of the sale would be disbursed among owners of Sears stock. Selling off a slice of Allstate is expected to bring in $1 billion to $2 billion alone. Mr. Brennan also indicated that Sears would go back to basics and focus on its retailing operations. When Mr. Brennan took over in 1985, Sears was the nation's No. 1 retailer; since then it has slipped to No. 3, behind Wal-Mart and Kmart. But while Wall Street appreciated Sears's new direction -- its stock rose $3.375 on the news to $44.75 and finished the week at $43 -- retailing specialists think Sears will really have to struggle to regain market share. "They've got to perform now," said Walter F. Loeb, a retail analyst. "There can be no more excuses."

Big Blue's Blues
 
Not so long ago, the International Business Machines Corporation was corporate America's equivalent of a cover girl. Big Blue seemed to do everything right. But more recently, the world's No. 1 computer company hasn't been looking so good. Its core business, mainframe computers, is depressed; Big Blue is taking a $415 million charge on those operations this year. And while I.B.M. is still the world's largest PC manufacturer, that business has been hammered, while its bid to grab control of the market for PC operating-system software has fizzled out. Last week, I.B.M. said a total of 40,000 jobs would be eliminated this year through buyouts. The cutbacks would reduce earnings in 1992 by $2.1 billion, offset in large measure by $1.9 billion from accounting changes. Since 1985, I.B.M. has reduced its work force by 25 percent. With the cuts, Big Blue "will achieve an improved balance between assets and current business needs," said John F. Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman. Investors were not convinced. I.B.M.'s stock fell $1.75 on the news, to $81, and finished the week at $78.50.

Magic Is Back
 
Magic Johnson may have the virus that causes AIDS, but that hasn't slowed him down: His ball-handling wizardry led the American Olympic team to victory last summer in Barcelona. Last week, Magic -- who dazzled the fans and filled the stadium when he played -- rejoined the Los Angeles Lakers, part time. He will play 50 to 60 games next season. To bring him back, the Lakers gave their star a raise. While his old contract was worth $2.5 million a year, plus a $600,000 bonus, the new one will be worth $14.6 million -- about $240,000 a game, if he plays all 60. But does he still have the stuff? "I have more muscles than I ever dreamed of," he said.

Planes From the Great Satan?
 
Remember when Iranian officials called America the Great Satan? Last week, state-owned Iran Air placed an order with the Boeing Company -- the Great Satan's leading exporter -- for 16 737 jetliners worth $900 million. But there is little chance the sale will go through: The State Department bans aircraft sales to Iran (the Iran-Contra scandal notwithstanding). If the sale is stopped, "Iran Air is going to look elsewhere," said Thomas J. Whalen of Condon & Forsyth, a Washington law firm that represents Iran Air. Elsewhere probably means Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium -- Boeing's chief rival.

The heads of Delta, American Airlines, United Airlines and Federal Express wrote to Transportation Secretary Andrew H. Card Jr. asking him to stop British Airways from investing in USAir Group Inc. The carriers said the arrangement violates laws limiting foreign ownership of American carriers and that an existing agreement grants American carriers limited access to the British market.

HEADLINE: An Oasis Rich in Shady Operators

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

DATELINE: BOCA RATON, Fla.

 BODY:
Joseph Del Raso leads the way through a gleaming marble lobby into the spanking new suite that housed College Bound, a chain of scholastic-test coaching centers that was a stock market favorite before collapsing this year.
Now the suite is deserted, half the furniture gone to satisfy debts, with dollies and packing crates ready to carry out the rest. Peach-colored afternoon sunlight slants through the dust as Mr. Del Raso walks to a pile of company documents. 
 "Here," he says, stooping to retrieve one of the brochures. "Have a piece of total fiction." The document is College Bound's last annual report and audit. It depicts a healthy and expanding company, a far cry from the insolvent business Mr. Del Raso found when he was named bankruptcy trustee in April. In June, the company agreed to settle the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil charges that it had inflated its revenues and profits. Its founders, George and Janet Ronkin, remain under investigation; they insist they have done nothing wrong.
College Bound is not unique in Boca Raton. Indeed, in the past year, this expensive enclave has experienced the financial equivalent of a cancer cluster. Six local corporations, including College Bound, have fallen under S.E.C. investigation; a seventh has been shut down and its chairman arrested and accused of running a Ponzi scheme. Dozens of other companies based here are little more than corporate shells created by boiler-room brokers, or financially flimsy companies whose chief products seem to be their own stock and news releases boasting of their prospects.
Regulators policing the penny stock market refer to the area's unsavory brokers as the Boca Bunch, and state investigators have dubbed the area "the Maggot Mile." The United States Attorney's satellite office next door in West Palm Beach, once a three-person operation, now keeps 14 attorneys busy.
 
'Very Appealing Location'
 "Once it was North Miami that had become notorious, then Fort Lauderdale," said Caroline Heck, executive assistant United States Attorney in Miami. "Now, Boca is a very appealing location."
Charles A. Harper, the regional administrator for the Miami office of the S.E.C., agrees. "We've definitely seen problems moving up the coast."
To be sure, some nationally known companies are based here. W. R. Grace moved its headquarters here last year. Most major Wall Street firms have large offices here, and many local investment managers, newsletter publishers and institutional brokerage firms have solid reputations.
"We don't have the luxury of picking and choosing our residents, but these scandals certainly haven't hurt us," said M. J. Arts, president of the Greater Boca Raton Chamber of Commerce. "Our unemployment rate is consistently under 5 percent. We've announced more new companies locating here in the past year than some entire states. Boca Raton, in the corporate world, is a very attractive address."
But there is another aspect to Boca Raton's business life. A computer-assisted search of S.E.C. filings by The New York Times found that besides College Bound, a number of local corporations are being investigated by the S.E.C.:
* Cascade International, a retailing chain that owned the Diana Shops and Allison's Place stores and was forced into bankruptcy last year. The collapse came after its chairman and chief executive, Victor Incendy, vanished in November, just before he was to answer accusations, later found true, that Cascade's financial statements were wildly exaggerated.
* Great Oaks Financial, an insolvent if once impressive insurance company, and its related finance company, the FHC Acceptance Corporation. The S.E.C. is examining the company's books for inadequate disclosures or fraudulent statements about its financial strength.
* Ringside International, an inactive boxing promotion company revived over the summer by stock promoters from Texas. The S.E.C. has been asked by a Congressional committee to examine why trading in Ringside resumed when the company had not filed financial statements for nearly two years.
* Dycom Industries, which supplies equipment to power utilities and is being examined for "possible financial misstatements," according to company documents.
* A.B.E. Industrial Holdings, a flimsy financial holding company that said it is cooperating with an S.E.C. examination of how it came to acquire an apparently fraudulent mortgage on a French vineyard.
Other members of the local financial community, while not under a regulatory microscope, clearly have blindsided their investors. For example, the Met Capital Corporation, a furniture holding company, released an overdue 1991 audit in July. The audit, besides revising the 1990 figures, disclosed two bankruptcies the officers had left off their corporate resumes and revealed that insiders had been selling the company's stock for three years without disclosing the sales as required by law. Company executives attributed the belated disclosures to bad legal advice.
According to court records in Miami, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which has since emerged as one of the largest bank frauds in history, opened a branch here just to cater to Munther Ismael Bilbeisi, a Jordanian businessman and Boca Raton resident indicted in August 1991 on tax evasion charges stemming from a coffee-smuggling scheme financed by B.C.C.I. Mr. Bilbeisi left Boca a fugitive.
Cary Maultasch, who testified under a grant of immunity against Michael R. Milken in 1990, still lives here, as do other former Wall Street lions from the scandals of the 1980's, including Martin A. Siegel, who pleaded guilty to insider trading charges involving Ivan F. Boesky.
Flim-flam has long been a problem in Florida, of course. Its well-to-do but often nave elderly residents are a magnet for the fast-buck crowd. Drug money courses through hidden channels in the economy, and a transient population has learned not to look too closely at the people across the street -- or across the bargaining table, for that matter.
But why has Boca Raton become home to so many dubious companies and habitual swindlers?
It is unarguably a beautiful town -- a low, lush beachfront community where candy-pink Mediterranean shops and homes mix with glittery Miami-modern office buildings on spacious shaded grounds. Fountains splash in plazas, decorator-perfect cafes attract tanned and unhurried visitors, and a car with more than a few years on its paint job is a rare sight. About 65,000 people -- one quarter of them 65 or older -- live within Boca's 27 square miles of beach, fairways and Bermuda grass.
Conventional explanations for Boca Raton's problems -- lax enforcement and lazy media watchdogs -- do not seem to apply. Florida's securities regulators at both the state and Federal levels get high marks from their peers. And the area's newspapers and business magazines are tireless in their exposure of local con artists.
 
Historical Roots
 A more likely contributing factor, said Mr. Harper, is rooted deep in Boca's own history, from the land-boom swindles of the 1920's to the boiler-room operations of the 1980's. Whenever regulators have shut down an illegal operation, its employees and the professional advisers typically have remained in the community, available to unsavory entrepreneurs.
And while Boca has all the glitz of the wealthy communities to the north -- Palm Beach and West Palm Beach -- those communities are more established and perhaps less open to a newcomer on the make, Ms. Heck said. Lawyers also note that Florida's laws permit bankrupt ex-millionaires to protect a handsome amount of assets from creditors.
Moreover, a construction boom in the past decade produced a glut of beautiful office buildings. A suite sure to impress visitors can be leased for a song -- or, for a while at least, for nothing. College Bound's lease on its palatial space in the Crocker Center included an 18-month "rent holiday," Mr. Del Raso said. And the region's wealthy population is migrating from the crowded communities to the south into the newer, more secure communities along the Broward-Palm Beach County line. "Crime tends to follow that population," Ms. Heck said.
But the most common explanations echo the view of Mr. Del Raso. "Boca is different," he said. "If you have money here, you can be 'in' real fast, no questions asked. It's like 'The Great Gatsby' in modern times."
 
A Popular Figure
 Jay Gatsby, meet Thomas R. Mullens.
Mr. Mullens, 47 years old, was until recently chairman of Omni Capital Group Ltd., a private financial firm (unrelated to any of 17 publicly traded companies using the "Omni" name) that occupied an expensive building on Glades Road. An avid golfer, he was a popular figure on Boca's several courses and a member of the Chamber of Commerce. At 7:30 every Friday morning, he steered his Rolls Royce to Bruno's Hair Salon for a trim and a manicure. A $50 tip was routine, said Bruno Dominijanni, the owner.
Mr. Dominijanni was sufficiently impressed to invest $45,000 with Mr. Mullens. So were other wealthy members of the Boca golf crowd. So were more than 100 retired couples on Florida's west coast.
On the morning of April 24, agents of the S.E.C. and the Federal Bureau of Investigation shut down Omni's headquarters. Mr. Mullens was subsequently arrested and, on June 26, was indicted on charges of operating a Ponzi scheme that may cost investors at least $10 million.
Mr. Mullens's criminal history includes a 1976 conviction for mail fraud arising from an earlier Ponzi scheme and a 1983 conviction for customs fraud. He is in jail near Tallahassee, awaiting trial on the new fraud charges. His lawyer, Van Stillman of Boca Raton, refused to permit Mr. Mullens to comment on the case, noting only that a plea of "not guilty" had been entered.
"One of my customers called me at home that Monday," said Mr. Dominijanni in his salon. "He said: 'Bruno, we've lost all our money. The guy is all phony. It's not real.' "
Nor is Mr. Mullens an isolated case. Other members of the community include Lionel Reifler and Leonard Tucker, confessed swindlers who have begun new careers as Government witnesses against former associates. Both are awaiting sentencing on their most recent convictions.
Mr. Reifler's criminal record began in 1970, when he pleaded guilty of mail fraud and conspiracy. He subsequently pleaded guilty to other finance-related fraud charges (in 1975, 1989 and 1990) in a flim-flam career that stretched from New York to Louisiana, and from the stock market to the savings and loan industry. In 1985, according to S.E.C. court filings, he and two associates met at St. Andrews Country Club here and hatched the Hughes Capital Corporation, a fraud the S.E.C. shut down in 1987.
Lenny Tucker, in his heyday, headed the Boca Raton operation of F. D. Roberts & Company, a penny-stock brokerage that promoted a host of other dubious companies, including Goldcor, a phony enterprise that boasted of being able to extract gold from Costa Rican beach sand. Investors, hooked by hyperbole and high-pressure telephone sales tactics typical of boiler-room operations, lost at least $50 million when Goldcor collapsed in 1988. F. D. Roberts shut its doors in 1989, amid a Federal criminal fraud investigation that has produced guilty pleas from Mr. Tucker and nearly three dozen others, many of them Boca residents. Mr. Tucker, who also agreed to give the Government his stake in his mansion here and his Rolls Royce, is cooperating with the investigation.
"He was the driving force behind the firm's Boca office," said Alain Leibman, an assistant United States attorney in Newark, where the case is being handled. The firm's headquarters was in Paramus, N.J., but most of its brokers were in Boca Raton, Mr. Leibman said. "They were mostly waiters and waitresses, kids just out of college looking for jobs."
Mr. Tucker's lawyer in New York, Barry Slotnick, declined to permit his client to be interviewed.
 
An Embarrassing Gift?
 Other traces of Boca Raton's dark side appear around town. The school of business at Florida Atlantic University is the home of the Stuart-James Research Center -- named for, and partly financed by, the Stuart-James Company, a penny-stock brokerage that closed its doors in 1990 after paying $1.9 million to settle civil charges of price gouging.
The center, set up five years ago, is a worthy program that provides computer laboratories to students and Census data to local businesses. Has the Stuart-James name become an embarrassment? "I've never been asked that before," said Professor Paul Guglielmino, the center's director. "I don't think it is an issue at all. From my perspective, we accepted the gift in good faith and did very positive things with it."
A local legend in Boca is Joel S. Nadel, whose troubles with securities regulators date back more than 20 years. Mr. Nadel, who lives in a house the size of a small office building in the St. Andrews Country Club development, is best-known among regulators as the publisher of more than a dozen market newsletters, including one that claimed to be the product of a secret investing society in Liechtenstein. Investors who followed his newsletters' tips frequently found themselves holding worthless shares. Postal authorities know him as the former operator of direct-mail "sweepstakes" programs that allegedly promised far more than they delivered.
In April 1991, the Postal Service obtained an unusual magistrate's order freezing nearly $7 million of Mr. Nadel's assets, based on an affidavit by postal authorities charging that the sweepstakes violated Federal mail-fraud and money-laundering statutes. No charges have been filed, and lawyers for Mr. Nadel have filed motions to have the order lifted.
Ira L. Sorkin, the New York lawyer representing Mr. Nadel, confirmed that settlement talks have been held but said he could not predict when the matter would be resolved. He said neither he nor his client would comment further about any aspect of Mr. Nadel's business life. In June, without denying or admitting guilt, Mr. Nadel paid $100,000 to settle a two-year-old S.E.C. complaint. The agency had charged that he violated securities laws by failing to tell his newsletter subscribers that several penny-stock promoters, since convicted of fraud, had paid him to tout their dubious companies. One of the stocks that figured in the complaint was Goldcor, the gold-extraction company that collapsed.
 
'We Don't See Them'
 "You have to understand," said Mr. Arts at the chamber, "that these people just don't surface here: We don't see them, we don't deal with them, they're not involved in the community, they don't contribute. We don't even know they're here. It just doesn't affect us."
But some members of the financial community here are growing quietly worried about the recent scandals. Local newspapers have run articles analyzing the impact of the cases on Boca Raton's image. "Everyone I know talks about it, and it's a real concern," said Mr. Del Raso, the court-appointed trustee for College Bound. Several other local financial executives said privately that they too were worried. One willing to say so publicly was Robert A. Anderson, first vice president of Southeast Research Partners, an institutional brokerage and research firm.
"Our own credibility is harder to defend every day because of this," Mr. Anderson said. "We're about at the point where you'd feel better with another address." He turned to a colleague. "What do you say -- West Palm Beach?"
 
 
INVESTIGATIONS AND THE BOTTOM LINE
 His investment newsletters attracted complaints from the Securities and Exchange Commission. His direct-mail "sweepstakes" was investigated by the Postal Service. What's next for Joel S. Nadel, a well-known entrepreneur in Boca Raton?
Well, the roster of Boca-based companies includes Quantum Ventures Group, a Nasdaq-listed corporation that has lost money for four of five years and trades for about $1 a share. Quantum controls certain rights to the Bernard Haldane employment counseling system. Mr. Nadel is chairman of Quantum's three-man board.
The address Quantum lists with the S.E.C. is a handsome North Military Trail complex where nothing called Quantum Ventures was listed on the building directory. The caretaker had no idea where it was, nor had the Federal Express driver who regularly makes deliveries there.
A secretary at the telephone number listed with the S.E.C. explained that the address is the law office of a Quantum director, Jeffrey G. Klein. Mr. Klein previously served as president of an investment newsletter company named by the S.E.C. in a complaint it filed against Mr. Nadel in 1990. That complaint, which charged that Mr. Nadel failed to disclose payments he received for touting specific stocks, was settled last June with a payment of $100,000 by Mr. Nadel, but without an admission or denial of guilt by anyone.
Jerold P. Weinger, the third Quantum director and its president, later called to explain that the company "splits its time" between the Boca Raton office and one on Park Avenue in New York. Mr. Weinger, a former broker, settled civil S.E.C. fraud charges in 1987, without admitting or denying guilt, and was disciplined by the National Association of Securities Dealers in 1989 for violating industry registration rules.
Mr. Weinger acknowledged in a recent interview that Mr. Nadel's history is "something of a negative" for Quantum shareholders -- in a very tangible way, because $145,000 of Quantum's money has been tied up in an asset freeze imposed on Mr. Nadel by a Federal magistrate last year at the request of postal inspectors. "But his business attributes make up far more than that," he added. "So the bottom line would be positive."
 
SEARCHING THE RECORDS
 The New York Times pursued its investigation of Boca Raton businesses under regulatory scrutiny by purchasing data tapes from the National Archives that contained names and addresses of companies that had registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell securities to the public.
A computer was used to search the tapes for zip codes in the Boca Raton area. The result was a list of 145 companies. Current S.E.C. filings, news releases, articles and court documents relating to 82 companies were examined in detail.
Of the remaining 63 companies, no information beyond outdated S.E.C. entries could be found for 30. The rest were either limited partnerships, whose local sponsors were examined, or subsidiaries of companies based elsewhere.

Financial-Services Funds Rebound

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
The stock market continued its indecisive course in the third quarter of 1992, as the average equity mutual fund rose 1.4 percent. For the year as a whole, stock funds have been almost motionless, dropping five-tenths of 1 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J.
While the average has been steady, the losers have outnumbered the gainers 14 to 9. The worst performers include funds that invest in Japanese equities (down 18.5 percent), health and biotechnology funds (down 17.5 percent) and environmental funds (down 14.5 percent). 
 The group that has performed best in 1992 encompasses the 14 funds that invest in financial services companies. This sector has gained 16.7 percent. The $1.3 billion financial services group consists mainly of funds that invest in bank stocks but also includes funds that specialize in brokerages or insurers.
The group's excellent performance can be attributed mainly to the surge by the stocks of banks and savings and loan institutions, some which have registered phenomenal gains after having hit bottom in late 1990. Since then, problems with loans on real estate and overseas loans have abated somewhat. These trends and low interest rates have helped increase banks' profitability.
"But over a longer period they're not up as much as you would think," said James K. Schmidt, manager of the $80 million Freedom Regional Bank Fund in Boston. Now the bank stocks sell at roughly 11 times earnings, a big discount to the overall stock market, which is trading about 18 times 1992 earnings. But some managers say the easy money has already been made.
Mr. Schmidt said lower interest margins next year would be balanced by lower costs of credit for banks, yielding projected returns from bank stocks of 15 to 20 percent in 1993. His biggest holdings are Seacoast Banking in Stuart, Fla.; the Hawkeye Bancorporation in Des Moines, and the First Commercial Corporation in Little Rock, Ark.
Returns in the 15-to-20 percent range are also the goal of Stephen Binder, who manages the $135 million Fidelity Select Regional Bank Fund. The fund's biggest holdings are Comerica Inc., based in Detroit; Nationsbank, created by the merger of NCNB and C&S/Sovran, and the Bank of New York.
Bank stocks also seem to have been helped by institutions and others who have invested in them as other growth stocks have performed unimpressively, said Bruce T. Herring, who manages the $100 million Fidelity Select Financial Services Fund.
In July bank stocks dropped about 10 percent because of profit taking and a feeling that the banks' earnings had peaked. But after the dip, the stocks became attractive to investors looking for bargains, and this -- along with a slowly improving economy -- should propel the group upward. His fund's largest holdings are the Midlantic Corporation, Citicorp and the Bank of New York.
Karen L. Finkel, manager of the $50 million Paine Webber Regional Financial Growth Fund, which is about 65 percent invested in banks, believes the bank stocks still have a long way to grow. "I would expect to see continued response by the stocks, albeit more gradually, as earnings kick in as problem assets continue to abate," she said. The fund's biggest positions are in the Mercantile Bancorporation in St. Louis; First Empire State in Buffalo; and the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, which buys home mortgages and sells them to investors.
The year's biggest winner among the financial services funds is the Fidelity Select Savings and Loan Fund, which has risen 30.3 percent. David H. Ellison, who runs the $95 million fund, says the year's sizzling returns stemmed mostly from economic improvements in the Northeast.
He says there is still money to be made when California, whose economy is still worsening, begins to turn around. But he cautions that rebuilding the banking industry "doesn't take six months -- it takes years." His favorite holdings now are Albank Financial in Albany and Excel Bancorp in Quincy, Mass.
The biggest loser in the group is also a Fidelity fund: the Select Brokerage and Investment Management Fund (down 10.2 percent), which buys stock brokerages and mutual fund companies, among others. Last year, when most fund companies had their best year ever, the fund returned 82.3 percent; even with 1992's slippage, it earned 63.6 percent from Jan. 1, 1991 through Sept. 30.
The stocks with the heaviest weighting in its portfolio are Paine Webber, which he says is trading at 85 percent of its book value, and Franklin Resources, which stands to benefit from its recent acquisition of John Templeton's mutual fund empire.

Nowhere to Go But Higher?

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA

 BODY:
And now, a nice word for silver.
Paul Macrae Montgomery, an economist at Legg Mason Wood Walker, does not have anything against gold, but he says silver looks even better. Better, that is, if you're a fearless bargain hunter. 
 Silver has suffered the third-worst bear market of any commodity ever, he said, citing statistics from The Investors' Edge, a California newsletter. "Virtually anything can be a bargain at some price," he said.
Big risk takers "might begin to investigate the equities of silver-related companies," he said. Silver moves by greater percentages in both bull and bear markets than gold does, Mr. Montgomery warns. Which means winners win big. And losers are happy to have canned food in the basement.

HEADLINE: At Work;
Celebrating Success by Giving

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
When Lynn Bignell and Janet Tweed, co-principals of an executive search firm, decided they wanted to celebrate their 20th anniversary in business by making a contribution to society, they did not reach for a batch of Rainforest Crunch. Instead, they gathered several of the people who work for them at GilbertTweed Associates in Manhattan and started brainstorming. How could the firm best use its resources to give something back to the people and organizations that helped it grow?
What Gilbert Tweed decided to do -- in late October or early November it will hold a lottery to give away more than $100,000 worth of search, consulting and training services to 20 nonprofit organizations -- represents what one expert has dubbed "philanthropic economics." 
 Corporate philanthropy is nothing new, of course, said the expert, L. Lawrence Embley, author of "Doing Well While Doing Good," a survey of 1990's-style corporate good deeds to be published shortly by Simon & Schuster. "Large corporations have always done it," he said. "The significant change is that businesses of all sizes are beginning to see the connection between the bottom line and social responsibility."
Mr. Embley attributes rising social awareness to greed fatigue from the 80's and to the ascension of a growing number of survivors from the rebellious 60's to positions of power in companies. "It's the second coming of the flower-power generation," he said.
While there may be people at Gilbert Tweed who brake for macrame, the decision to give away services seems to have stemmed from a broader source than radicalism redux. Ms. Bignell initiated the conversation on "giving something back," and the rest of the firm took the thread and ran with it. Discussions turned immediately to the nonprofit sector, in part, because the spirit of volunteerism, in churches, on boards and so on, lives large at Gilbert Tweed. "All of the partners personally do a great deal of volunteer work," Ms. Bignell said.
Of course, it is no coincidence that two of Gilbert Tweed's search specialties are in prime nonprofit territory -- health care and education -- or that those are the two areas designated for awards. In that respect, the firm's initiative provides evidence for Mr. Embley's contention that more businesses are realizing a connection between bottom-line and social concerns -- a connection Ms. Bignell acknowledges. "It provided us with a win-win scenario," she said. Nonprofits are "a practice area where we realize revenue. It would make us more noticeable to that community."
It took Gilbert Tweed two months to figure out what sort of outreach to do. A close second to the lottery was a plan that would have matched, with time off, the time employees spent volunteering, up to 40 hours a year. That suggestion was rejected because of the bookkeeping it would have entailed and because, as Ms. Bignell said, "we felt our impact would be splintered."
The firm could hardly have chosen a sector riper for impact. Nonprofits, always forced to look for ways to slenderize, have been hit especially hard by the lingering recession. Otis A. Jackson, planning and development executive vice president at Inroads Inc., a St. Louis-based organization that matches talented minority college students with corporate internships and jobs, said one of his affiliates applied for the Gilbert Tweed lottery to increase its competitiveness. "The labor market is very difficult now," he said. "We are competing with people who have been 'downsized' and who have much more experience."
If Inroads comes up in the lottery, it could win an executive search, worth $30,000, or expertise in recruiting or a seminar on hiring . The opportunity would come at a propitious moment for Inroads. The human resources department of the 22-year-old organization is beginning to focus more on staff development. "We could really use the services, especially interview training for staff," Mr. Jackson said. Managerial proficiency is becoming more important. "We work with senior-level officers and managers," he added. "Our organization emulates the business community as much as possible."
Lynn Bignell said Gilbert Tweed had been flying by the seat of its pants on this project, streamlining and improvising as it goes. It chose a lottery format because, she said, the firm does not want to be in the business of making judgments about programs. "We don't think we're qualified to rank people's needs," she said.
Gilbert Tweed is in the middle of what Ms. Bignell calls the "administrivia," decisions on such weighty matters as how the lottery will work. Six envelopes? Six fishbowls? By its nature, the administrivia is taking more time than she would like.
But she is convinced Gilbert Tweed's impulse is meeting a widespread need. One inquiry came from the Environmental Protection Agency. At least officially, the Federal Government is not a nonprofit.
 
 
 
AN AWARDS LOTTERY FOR NONPROFITS
 Gilbert Tweed Associates' "Serving America" awards program is open to nonprofit organizations in health care or education. Awards -- one to an applicant -- will be made in each area of Gilbert Tweed's expertise: 2 in executive search, 8 in consulting and 10 in training, and they will be split evenly between health care and education.
The one qualitative requirement Gilbert Tweed imposes is a commitment to diversity. "Diversity is a big issue today," Ms. Bignell said. "If it's not in a nonprofit, it should be. Hiring practices should reflect the populations they serve."
In addition to a two-page application, applicants are asked to submit their most recent annual reports or brochures; lists of board members; financial statements, and material supporting the commitment to diversity. The deadline for applications is Oct. 15. For information, contact Bettina Nelson at Gilbert Tweed Associates, 630 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; 212-697-4260.

HEADLINE: Arms Makers' Latest Tune: 'Over There, Over There'

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Hurt by dwindling Pentagon orders, United States military contractors are relying more heavily than ever on foreign sales.
The value of agreements to sell arms to foreign countries has nearly quadrupled in five years to $24.1 billion already this year, from $6.5 billion in all of 1987, according to the Pentagon. Foreign orders should account for at least 25 percent of American arms production in the next few years, up from about 15 percent now, industry officials say. 
 To some extent, the overseas orders this year are wrapped up in Presidential politics: Most sales of American-made arms must be approved by Washington, and the President's authorization of such sales can translate into votes in communities where factory jobs were saved. In the last month, President Bush rejected protests from Israel and its supporters by approving the sale of 72 McDonnell-Douglas F-15 fighters to Saudi Arabia, saving some 7,000 aerospace jobs in St. Louis. He also reversed a 10-year-old limit on sales of advanced weaponry to Taiwan by clearing the sale of 150 General Dynamics F-16 fighters, saving 3,000 jobs in Fort Worth.
Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, also supported the Saudi and Taiwan sales, largely because of the economic benefits.
Industry officials say that with no rebound in sight for shrinking American military budgets, overseas orders will help pick up the slack for companies converting to commercial work or repositioning themselves in the leaner military arena. They also argue that the increased volume that results from sales to foreign customers allows weapons makers to charge the Pentagon less for each unit.
But arms-control groups and several members of Congress decry this trend, contending that arms proliferation, particularly in the Middle East, will escalate political tensions. There has recently been a stampede of Western arms merchants seeking to sate the growing appetite of Persian Gulf countries for arms.
A study issued last week by the Congressional Budget Office argued that limiting arms sales to the Middle East might permit reductions in American military spending. The office reasoned that if Middle East countries were less armed, the United States would not have to involve as many Americans in a Middle East war. "It is shortsighted to stimulate the arms race for the purpose of redressing economic problems in the United States," said Representative Dante B. Fascell, a Florida Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
But Jeffrey E. Garten, an investment banker and author of "A Cold Peace: America, Japan, Germany and the Struggle for Supremacy," thinks that "we're unlikely to sacrifice economic interests to take the moral high ground on curbing arms sales."
Why military contractors are looking overseas comes down to simple math:
* Saudi Arabia will buy seven times as many General Dynamics M1-A2 battle tanks as the United States Army in the next five years. The United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Sweden are also shopping for tanks.
* After 1993, McDonnell-Douglas will sell two of its top three combat aircraft -- the F-15 and the AV-8B Harrier -- only to foreign customers, as United States Air Force and Navy orders wind down. Foreign orders to the McDonnell-Douglas Corporation's aircraft division will probably rise to about 33 percent of sales in the next few years from 20 percent now, said George Hibbard, director of international business development.
* More than 20 percent of Raytheon's sales this year are expected to come from Patriot missiles, mainly to countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, South Korea and Israel.
"In the short run, exports are going to be imperative to keep defense lines open and keep a warm industrial base in place," said Joel L. Johnson, international vice president of the Aerospace Industries Association in Washington. Mr. Johnson said that as Pentagon orders wane, American contractors will have to be more sensitive to foreign customers' needs, "even at the design phase and when putting together contractor teams."
Foreign sales stave off work-force cuts in the short run, but some economists argue that companies may use overseas orders as a crutch, to avoid the painful conversion to commercial production.
American companies cite strong demand not only in the Middle East but also in Southeast Asia, including Taiwan and Singapore,as United States military forces reduce their presence in East Asia. International competition in the global arms bazaar is already heating up among Washington's historical allies, including France, Britain and Germany, as well as Russia and China. For example, the Saudis were weighing British-made Tornado aircraft before Washington approved the F-15 sale. The American M1-A2 and the British-made Challenger are vying for a Kuwait order of about 250 battle tanks.
Industry officials say that international sales will help domestic production by keeping down unit costs for Pentagon purchases. For example, Mr. Hibbard said that the 325 F/A-18's that McDonnell-Douglas is selling over the next several years to foreign customers, including Finland and Switzerland, shaved $2 million off the cost of each of the 871 F/A-18's the United States Navy has bought for $24 million each.
As overseas orders become more important to military contractors, the Government has been under increasing pressure to facilitate such sales. Even before the Bush Administration exercised what critics call a jets-for-votes strategy, it was for the first time paying for United States warplanes and other arms to be flown to the big air shows in Singapore and Paris. The Europeans have done this for years to help their industries.
In addition, the Administration recently announced that it would end its policy of charging a fee on sales abroad of military equipment or commercial derivatives that were developed with Government research money. It also agreed to seek to repeal legislation that requires such fees on sales of major military equipment by the United States Government to other nations.
There is also greater support in the Administration for an industry-backed proposal under which the Government would guarantee private credits for foreign purchases of American military products.
"We've had more of a proactive and cooperative role from our Government than in past," said Toby G. Warson, chief executive of Alliant Techsystems Inc., a large munitions supplier based in Edina, Minn.
Companies are not relying solely on Goverment help. They are also experimenting with new strategies. Raytheon last year opened offices in Dubai and Jidda, Saudi Arabia.
Other companies that had not been big players overseas are jumping in. Martin Marietta, which assembles missiles and launchers for the Patriot missile and builds the Lantirn night-navigation and target system for F-15's and F-16's, expects foreign orders to climb to about 20 percent of total sales by 1994 from 5 percent in 1989.
Meanwhile, the politics of lobbying for foreign sales is shifting. In the F-15 sales, McDonnell-Douglas mustered a coalition of industry chief executives as well as labor union leaders to lobby the White House.
"The big difference is that manufacturers have tried to translate the impact sales are having on their bottom lines into domestic political leverage," said one Defense Department official involved with arms sales. "They've done it more effectively in the last two years than ever before."

BYLINE: By RICK MARIN

 BODY:
THIS is some kind of weird nightmare. Watching commercials that are half an hour long. Epic pitches for makeup, shampoo, hair conditioners, juicers, steamers, fitness machines, rhinestone setters and stain removers. Or for Jessica Hahn's 900 number, "Love Phone."
Watching them not just between television shows but as television shows. Lulled by their monotone, the spiritual opposite of MTV, and feeling powerless to turn off the smiling famous faces and euphoric, satisfied customers who promise a better, younger, prettier, richer, happier, more personally empowered you. 
 "What people seem to want from the infomercial is an experience that is wholly and brainlessly affirmative," said Mark Crispin Miller, professor of media studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. "It may be commercial television in its purest state."
Or self-help in its purest state. In a decade with much talk about dysfunction, the world of the infomercial is mesmerizingly functional, even multifunctional. Everything works, or seems to. And if it doesn't? There's always the money-back guarantee.
BLURRING the ever-blurrier line between television programming and advertising, infomercials generated $750 million in product sales last year. Two weeks ago, they even had their own awards ceremony, the first Play awards (Play is an acronym for program-length advertisements of the year) in the grand ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria.
No longer lurking on cable television's late-night fringe and no longer a demimonde of Hollywood has-beens, these mock-talk, mock-news, mock-cooking shows increasingly feature celebrities like Cher, Ted Danson and Jane Fonda. Dionne Warwick's "Psychic Friends Network," which invites viewers to call psychics via a 900 number, is the mostly frequently broadcast infomercial, according to Jordan Whitney, an industry analyst. In Denver, Playboy's "Secrets of Making Love" infomercial gets higher ratings than "Late Night With David Letterman."
And on Thursday, ABC is to introduce "Nitecap," a late-night half-hour starring Robin Leach that will feature famous guests and offer products for sale by 800 number. As of last week, though, the producers did not know which famous guests and what products.
Thirty-two ABC stations will carry the show; New York's WABC-TV will not. Disdaining terms like "home shopping show" or "infomercial," the network has even devised a new name for the hybrid format of "Nitecap": transactional talk.
The transactional genre has already made rich men of Jay (the Juiceman) Kordich and Joe Sugarman, the bearded guy who sells Blublocker sunglasses. Richard Simmons grossed $40 million last year from the "Deal-a-Meal" diet plan sold via his teary, hand-holding half-hours. Tony Robbins's "Personal Power" series, featuring his celebrity friends Fran Tarkenton and Martin Sheen, has sold $100 million worth of motivational videos.
And Victoria Jackson, queen of the mail-order make-over, has sold $150 million worth of makeup during the last three years exclusively through "Beauty Breakthroughs," her girl-talk sessions with Ali MacGraw, Meredith Baxter and Lisa Hartman.
Victoria's secret? Step into her living room. Grand yet intimate, the setting is a rented Beverly Hills mansion, a sedative venue. Two large columns frame a picture window, and light floods into a room meticulously accessorized with plants and cut flowers.
Meredith and Ali -- first names only -- sit on a pillowy ivory sofa. Victoria, a soft-eyed brunette with a slight lisp and perfect nails, is in a matching chair on the other side of a glass coffee table arrayed with her monogrammed makeup and skin-care line.
They talk quietly, earnestly.
Meredith: "I wanted to tell you that I read in The Los Angeles Times that you have had an absolutely phenomenal response to the commercials that you guys have done."
Victoria: "It's been incredible! I mean, it's just overwhelming. From the first week we were on TV, we were selling 10,000 kits a week. It's been incredible."
Ali shares next. How she is stopped in supermarkets and airports by women who tell her, "I've been using Victoria Jackson, and it's great, just like you said it was!"
Occasionally, the three pause to "watch" testimonials gathered from places like Waukesha, Wis., or Champaign, Ill. Before-and-after split screens transform wan, depressed-looking women into smiling, radiant beauties.
Lisa Hartman comes on, in a different living room, to give her own endorsement for the makeup and an 800 number. The full Victoria Jackson line is "available," she says, for just three easy payments of $39.95, the mail-order trade's magic price tag.
The infomercial cost $750,000 to produce, as much as Madison Avenue's slickest 30-second spots. The direction (three-camera video, soft-focus glow) is seamlessly conversational. The artful imagery -- the columns, mirrored table, Victoria's red dress -- is meant to register on some deeper level than the disclaimer racing across the bottom of the screen. It reads: "All claims and representations made in this program-length advertisement are the sole responsibility of the sponsor."
Caveat emptor. In 1984, the Reagan Administration erased the Federal Communications Commission's limit of 12 commercial minutes per hour of programming. Last seen in the 1950's, the 30-minute commercial, now with the dubious prefix "info," was back. Soon the President's own son, Michael Reagan, was extolling the Euro Trym Diet Patch, whose manufacturer was later sued by the Federal Trade Commission for false advertising. The F.T.C. caught the same company peddling a bogus impotence cure on a "talk show" with the television personality Lyle Waggoner as host.
"It was like a frontier town," said Jeffrey Knowles, counsel for the National Infomercial Marketing Association in Washington. When Congressional hearings threatened to shut down infomercials for two years because of rampant charlatanism, the trade and lobbying group was formed to police its own members.
Slouching towards legitimacy, infomercialists now talk sensitively of their "craft" and decry the "fringe element," the snake-oil salesmen and carnival barkers who give the business a bad name.
"I, from a creative perspective, hate most of the infomercials that are on the air," Tim O'Leary, marketing director of Tyee Productions, an infomercial company, told an audience of 350 colleagues and potential clients last month. They had paid $395 each for a daylong conference at the Waldorf-Astoria that promised to reveal the "secrets" of the infomercial trade. (Mr. O'Leary disclosed that he always shoots on film, never video, for his Nordictrack account.)
Rick Bradley, an agent of the William Morris agency who represents Victoria Jackson and Richard Simmons, estimates that Cher was paid $1 million, plus a percentage of the gross, for her role in selling "Aquasentials," a line of hair-care products. "Celebrities feel more comfortable now about doing them because more of them have jumped in and seen the potential to make a lot of money," he said.
A mid-range celebrity can make $25,000 an infomercial, plus up to 5 percent of gross sales. Bigger stars can get $250,000 and 7 percent of sales.
A handful of companies rule the industry, with some cross-pollination. Victoria Jackson is engaged to Bill Guthy, whose Guthy-Renker Corporation does the Tony Robbins series. Mr. Robbins's producer, Lenny Lieberman, is producing Georgette Mosbacher's new infomercial for her beauty line.
The dominant presence is American Telecast (15 Play award nominations), a highly secretive family business that has made millions off Richard Simmons, Victoria Jackson and others, but shuns media coverage. "The spouting whale gets harpooned," a company spokeswoman said.
Stations charge companies like American Telecast anywhere from $500 a half-hour in a small market to $50,000 for a slot in New York or Los Angeles, though many are embarrassed to admit it.
"What do you want me to say?" said Martin Blair, a spokesman for New York's WCBS. "Yeah, we run them. So what?" Substituting commercials for programming is a recession neccessity, said WNBC's president and general manager, Bill Bolster, predicting that "as the economy improves, they'll be the first thing to go."
At the conference, Phil Beuth, ABC's vice president of late-night programming, was hailed as a "visionary" for resisting network snobbery and pushing "Nitecap" onto the schedule. After Mr. Beuth's speech, a fan approached to shake his hand and said, "It's nice to meet someone at the network level who understands the American dream!"
Marvin S. Traub, former president of Bloomingdale's, said infomercials drove the store's juicer sales up "geometrically," from 5 to 10 sales a week to hundreds a week. Similarly, he said, when Bloomingdale's Labor Day catalogue featured Toastmaster's $90 Grillerie, a product introduced by Ricardo Montalban on an infomercial, the housewares department sold more than 100 of them in the first week.
DOES Bloomies' good housewares seal of approval herald a new era of respectability for informercials and their wares? Possibly not. Consider the bizarre Flowbee "vacuum haircutting system," parodied in the opening scene of "Wayne's World." Or the "chef" touting the joys of the Jet-Stream Oven, who notes that his chicken breast is golden brown while the one cooked in a microwave oven resembles "cadaver meat." Or the anti-baldness cures or the real estate "seminars" invariably conducted from a beach in Hawaii.
Lawsuits brought by consumers abound. Consumer groups like the Center for the Study of Commercialism are lobbying Congress to mandate branding any infomercial as paid advertising with a continuous symbol in the corner of the television screen.
"I bought three mixers and all of them burned out in a week," said Rader Hayes, an assistant professor of consumer science at Marquette University in Milwaukee. Her Juice Tiger died after three days.
And yet people buy and buy. "I can't explain that behavior," Professor Hayes said. "There is a percentage of people who respond to these things, and we don't know why."
Prof. Todd Gitlin, director of the mass communications program at the University of California at Berkeley, has his own theory. "They let your eyes do the walking," he said. "The same people who would otherwise be out at the mall are getting the mall experience at home. Shopping is pleasure for a lot of people, and with infomercials they can fool themselves into thinking they're learning something at the same time."
The pitch is delivered in the guise of a talk show or news report, Professor Gitlin said, because "after all these years, these forms of television have become the forms of thought."
It was an awards ceremony like any other: lights, cameras, a host in a dinner jacket and a hostess in sequins. Elation and envy in the air. A funny-looking statuette.
The first Play awards honored the industry's best director, best performance, most innovative product.
"And the winner is . . . Miiike Leveeeey."
Mike Levey is host of "Amazing Discoveries," an informercial that sells car wax by setting the hood of a Rolls-Royce on fire. He was also the host of the awards ceremony.
"I never anticipated this," Mr. Levey said, choking back emotion. "You all have helped me realize a dream. A vision can become reality. Thank you very much!"
This was the fifth little glass globe Mr. Levey had accepted since the evening began, including one on behalf of the late Michael Landon for best celebrity performance. Accepting, Mr. Levey let out a little "Yay!" -- the same noise he makes when the car is set on fire -- and hurried to the next category: most innovative product.
"And the winner is . . .tThe Jet Stream Oven!"
Call now.

HEADLINE: The Reckoning;
No Painless Way Out for the Next President

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHOEVER is elected President 30 days from now, the next few years will be rough.
Ross Perot touched on this last week when he got into the race for the final lap and called for "fair-shared sacrifice." But Mr. Perot did not tell the full story, and George Bush and Bill Clinton have ducked it during their campaigns. 
 Over the long haul, the only way out of the country's budgetary and economic mess is for most people to pay higher taxes, for popular Government programs to be cut and for medical care to be rationed. Economists differ on the means and the timing; few disagree on the point.
The prevailing view among politicians and political scientists is that the new President needs to tackle this right away when he is strongest politically. "There's a golden window that opens in the first six months or so of a new Presidency that allows grand and bold accomplishments," said Donald F. Kettl, political scientist at the University of Wisconsin.
Franklin D. Roosevelt pushed the main elements of the New Deal through Congress in his first 100 days as President. Lyndon B. Johnson had two honeymoons: The first, in 1964 shortly after the Kennedy assassination, he used to get a tax cut and a civil rights bill. The second, in 1965 after his election, led to the Great Society. Ronald Reagan completely overhauled the economy with supply-side tax cuts his first year in the White House.
Mr. Bush, on the other hand, skipped the chance to make his mark at the outset. When he took office in 1989 the economy was strong, and the deficit could have been addressed with a tax increase and a spending cut. But Mr. Bush was stymied by his no-new-taxes pledge and the overwhelming Democratic majority in Congress. As a consequence, the deficit now, about $330 billion, is more than twice what it was four years ago and dealing with it will be many times more severe.
The country's economic problems are no secret, but the huge Federal debt -- now $4 trillion, four times what it was a decade ago -- has severely limited the Government's options for solving them. Personal incomes have been stagnant for years. Businesses have failed in record numbers. Medical care swallows up 15 percent of the nation's economic output, far more than in any other country, yet millions of Americans still have no health insurance. One American in 10 is on food stamps. Assembly-line jobs, a mainstay of the American middle class, are going abroad or being replaced by machines. Hundreds of thousands of defense industry workers fear layoffs, their highly honed skills no longer applicable. Bridges, highways and airports are rotting. Americans consume too much and save and invest too little.
"These weaknesses will continue to erode our economic strength and further burden future generations," a bipartisan commission under the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research institute, said last week. "Addressing these vulnerabilities will require reforms that will be painful at first."
 
Synthesizing a Solution
 The problems are even more intractable because the solutions are so contradictory. Today's bad times probably require a fiscal stimulus -- a tax cut, more spending or both -- but that would increase the budget deficit, which is gradually corroding the economy. Reduced military spending is the centerpiece of a lower deficit, but it means more people in the unemployment lines. Cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, the fastest growing part of the Federal budget, would force individuals, companies and communities to pay more themselves for medical care, leaving them less to spend on productive enterprises that would fuel economic growth. Lifting trade restrictions would expand exports and improve the overall economy, but many jobs would also be lost. Low interest rates, which encourage investment by Americans, discourage the kind of investment here by foreigners that has propped up the economy for years.
The political situation is worsened by the fact that Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton have offered only painless, inadequate ways to resolve these conflicts. As for Mr. Perot, he has put forth a detailed, generally plausible plan for balancing the budget by raising the top income tax rate, by imposing a 50-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and by cutting Government programs across the board. But Mr. Perot rarely talks about the unpleasant aspects of his program. And while he may play spoiler, he cannot be elected President.
So the next President's job will be harder because he will not have a mandate from the voters to call for sacrifice. Some Presidents -- Jimmy Carter, for example -- have failed because they did not have clear mandates for their policies. But Woodrow Wilson had no mandate to enter World War I. And Roosevelt said nothing about the New Deal during his first campaign.
"You don't need a mandate for this," said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office. "There is a general understanding in America that the chickens have come home to roost and that we are going to have to tighten our belts. If a leader comes forward with a balanced and gradual package to do this, there will be reluctant acquiescence in Congress and among the American people."
Neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Clinton has articulated such a package. But in political and academic circles as well as on Wall Street a consensus is slowly developing on what the main elements should be.
To get the stalled economy moving again, a temporary economic stimulus of $50 billion or so should be approved in the form of tax credits to encourage business investment and public works projects that would improve the national economy in the long run. At the same time, in the same legislation, the President and Congress must enact specific tax increases and spending reductions, not just general principles, to be put into place gradually over the rest of the decade. The deal would have to be reinforced with rigid rules allowing the tax and spending measures to be rescinded only in extraordinary circumstances.
Whether that is practicable is another matter. "Multi-year programs have proved not to be credible," said Robert D. Hormats, who has advised several Presidents on economics and international affairs and is now an investment banker in New York. "The public and the markets are going to be skeptical."
One person who thinks it can be done is Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, the chairman of the Budget Committee. Mr. Sasser, a Democrat, says he favors such an approach but fears it could cost him re-election in 1994.
"Our problems," he said, "are so serious and the only solutions are so unpleasant that I wonder whether any of us can come out of this with our popularity intact."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
In the New Russia, Children Are Born Fighting the Odds

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
"IS It Easy to Be Young?" was a film that came out in Moscow in the mid 1980's, causing one of glasnost's early sensations with its stark portrait of wan and listless youth. Since then, from the once tight-lipped government ministries has come a mountain of data showing the condition of many of Russia's 40 million children to be not only difficult but deeply troubling.
It is as if the old Communist regime had left behind a poison pill for the next generation -- a decaying environment that damaged their mothers' health, a rising level of alcoholism that increases their risk of birth defects, a health care system unable to cope and a society that has lost its bearings. Add to that an uncertain economic climate, and it is understandable why fewer parents in Russia consider themselves capable of bringing up children. The birth rate in Russia, with a population of 150 million, is falling sharply, from almost 2 million births in 1990 to 1.8 million in 1991. 
 Already, more than half of the families in Russia have only one child. More children are born out of wedlock -- almost 15 percent in 1990 (far fewer than in the United States, where the rate is above 25 percent, but shocking in this society, which is unaccustomed to candid information on its social problems). In Russia, as in other countries, more and more children are being brought up by single parents. But in the last year, when the standard of living took a nose dive, more were abandoned by parents to state institutions. Last year, the number of orphans jumped from 49,000 to 59,000.
The record low birthrate has caught the eye of Russian nationalists who worry about the future of the nation. But for the country's harried health and social welfare officials, other figures are more worrisome: an increasing number of children born with birth defects, a rise of criminality among Russia's youth, and new evidence of the devastating effects of a polluted environment on children, starting in the womb.
"The problem is not just the fall in the birthrate but the increase in unhealthy children," said the Minister of Social Security, Ella A. Pamfilova. "The more I look at these problems, the more worried I get. If we are not careful, we will simply gnaw away at our future. And right now, because of our extraordinary situation, all we can do is act as firemen."
 
'Breathe Less'
 On Sept. 1, millions of children gathered in schoolyards across Russia for the traditional opening day of classes. The sight of rows of fidgety first-graders in traditional pinafores, floppy bows and blue suits was a comforting reminder that life here goes on, in spite of all the difficulties. But a recent government report on the condition of children painted a different picture, outlining in detail the damage done by the state's careless management of the environment and, now, by the convulsive changes in its economy.
In general, children in Russia are not well. By definitions used by the Health Ministry, only 14 percent can be said to be in good health. Between 15 and 20 percent of preschool children suffer from chronic diseases; up to 60 percent have rickets, are underweight or have allergies. More than 10 percent are anemic. And in areas where pollution has done its worst damage, the situation is even more troubling. In some oil- and chemical-producing regions, children are 10 times more likely to get pneumonia and 5 times more likely to have bronchial ailments than in relatively clean areas.
The poisoning of the environment is one of the Communist system's most terrible legacies. "It is the water, it is the food, it is the air," said Murray Feshbach, a professor of demography at Georgetown University and an expert on Soviet health statistics. "As one minister once said, 'To live longer, we should breathe less.' "
 
Mothers at Risk
 "What worries me most is the health of pregnant women, " said Dina I. Zelinskaya, head of the Mother and Child department at the Health Ministry. She noted that in 1988, the number of mothers who died during pregnancy and childbirth -- 52 per 100,000 births -- was 10 times higher in Russia than in developed countries.
The high abortion rate, estimated at 3.6 million a year in 1991, is considered the principal culprit, because abortion in huge and impersonal clinics, rather than contraception, remains the main means of birth control. These clinics have long had a reputation for giving too little attention to hygiene and the individual problems that might affect a woman's future ability to bear children. But recent evidence shows that women in Russia, and their future children, have also been the victims of the staggering neglect of the environment, and a faulty medical system.
Since 1981 the incidence of disease among pregnant women has soared, and there are now 2.5 times as many cases of anemia, twice as many of liver ailments, and 4.8 times as many of toxemia, Mrs. Zelinskaya said.
These problems have led to an increase in the number of children born with birth defects, which continue to rise even as the birth rate falls. In 1991, 347,500 children were born in the Russian Federation with abnormalities, compared to 272,800 in 1988, according to the Ministry of Health.
At Children's Institute No. 28, home to about 500 children with severe handicaps, about half of them orphans, doctors say that from their practice, they see more and more children born with deformities as a result of toxemic pregnancies.
"Before we always said it is due to alcoholism," said Galia A. Cherburchanova, deputy medical director of Institute No. 28. "Now I think it is due to ecological problems, what we eat and what we drink."
"Now if a woman's pregnancy proceeds without any problems, it is almost a rarity," said Mrs. Cherburchanova. "If a child is born healthy, we thank God."
 
Psychic Shock
 Seven decades of silence about society's dirty secrets -- pollution, abortion, child neglect, juvenile crime, retardation, mental illness -- have left many Russians unprepared for the worsening reality they and their children now face.
Some of these problems are as great, or greater, in the West, where people have become inured to reports about environmental diseases, broken families, child abuse, teenage drug abuse and violent youth gangs. But taken together, the portrait of a generation at risk has been a shock here, disturbing a complacency rooted in the notion that the state had the people's interests at heart. Now people realize that the state was in fact looking the other way as the problems of the modern industrial world piled up around them.
As information about the condition of society has come out, the state itself has changed its role. Citizens are being asked to take greater responsibility for their lives and to make their own choices. Private clinics are opening alongside state-supported hospitals, private schools are offering more specialized education and local governments are facing a difficult choice, familiar in the West, between a cleaner environment and more jobs.
At Telephone Trust, a hot-line for troubled teen-agers, counselors say callers report a new kind of problem. "Now the majority of questions have to do with money problems: Where can I make money? How can I survive?" said Nadezhda I. Kosova, the senior nurse. "Children do not know what to do with themselves, what to do with their free time."
At the same time, there have been cuts in state support for kindergartens and summer camps, for Sports Palaces and other childrens' programs, even as Moscow is reported to have 160 gangs, not necessarily criminal but each with its own organization and code of behavior.
 
Teen-Age Despair
 The Interior Ministry reports that crimes committed by juveniles have almost doubled in 9 years -- from 91,311 cases in 1982 to 173,375 in 1991. At the state-run Serbski Institute of General and Forensic Psychiatry, doctors describe the evolution of a young criminal underclass, children of troubled, typically alcoholic parents who then become wards of state orphanages and boarding schools, before being set loose into an unwelcoming society.
Two-thirds of the 3,000 children examined at the Serbski Institute each year in preparation for criminal proceedings have been physically abused -- by their parents, relatives, teachers or peers. Not surprisingly, two-thirds of these children consider crime an appropriate way of achieving their goals.
In Russia, the state continues to play parent to more children than experts think is healthy. More than half a million children, from infants to 17-year-olds, are under state care. Most are in special schools for the retarded or handicapped, about 15,000 in prisons but also about 100,000 in regular orphanages, and another 100,000 are in full-time and part-time state boarding schools for children whose families can not bring them up because of illness, poverty, alcoholism or work that keeps them away from home.
These boarding schools, a product of Communist assumptions that the state can succeed where parents fail, are in many cases breeding grounds for criminal behavior. According to studies done by the Serbski Institute, almost half of the children brought up in state institutions leave with some kind of nervous disorder, and they are 80 percent more likely than other children to commit crimes.
Family counseling, school psychologists, out-reach and support groups for relatives of alcoholics, mental health clinics -- such institutions, now commonplace in the United States, are either nonexistent, or in their infancy in Russia. The result is that troubled children, and children from troubled families, often have nowhere to turn.
"We have a sick society," said Valeria A. Guryeva, chief of the adolescent forensic department at the Serbski Institute. "We destroyed our intelligentsia once, twice, three times. That was the policy of the government. Why are there are so many alcoholics in Russia? It is all part of an accumulative process."
"It's only recently that we are even allowed to talk about psychology, about Freud, about psychoanalysis," she said. "Now we are involved in a regenerative process. The question is, will they give us a chance, or not?"
 
Rules in Flux
 Attitudes are changing. Mrs. Zelinskaya points to a proposed new government program to offer women a choice among effective birth control devices, which, until now, have been shockingly rare.
And a trend toward taking children out of institutions is slowly developing. Already, more Russians are adopting orphans than they did before -- 48,300 in 1991 as against 39,200 in 1980. Families are being encouraged to take children under a kind of foster-child arrangement, for which the Government will now, for the first time, provide a realistic allowance.
The Government is also preparing a new system for psychological counseling, to be made available without the old stigmas. Classes will be offered in regular schools for children with special needs.
"Before our attitude was to treat these children as second class," said Sanal A. Bodmayev, a deputy minister of education. "We raised them and then let them go into a society where they couldn't do anything -- they couldn't iron their pants, boil an egg or use money. Now, we are taking measures that are more preventative, trying to look at why it is these kids have problems in the first place."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: Without the U.S.;
China Envisions A New Order

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
IT was a memorable week in the Chinese capital, with a first visit from Roh Tae Woo, President of South Korea, a spectacular fireworks show to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the opening of relations with Japan and the installation of a new, ruddy-faced portrait of Mao on the Gate of Heavenly Peace.
But if this was part of an effort to show a new, proud and pragmatic China asserting itself in the post-cold war era, there was also a sour note: relations with the United States.
China and the United States have been threatening to retaliate against each other in bitter disputes over trade and American weapons sales to Taiwan. And China was unimpressed when President Bush vetoed a bill last week to revoke China's favored access to the American market unless it eased its human rights policies and opened its economy more swiftly. The Chinese felt the threat was unfair in the first place. 
 What the contrasts suggested was how complex the relationship between Beijing and Washington is, especially in an Asia that is changing rapidly. Relations have been unsettled since China suppressed its pro-democracy movement three years ago, but even as the two countries express discomfort with each other they avoid a serious rupture.
 
Bickering, Not Breaking
 For instance, China says it will do without the American market if the United States imposes trade sanctions against China for not moving faster to lower its barriers to imports. But the threat seems hollow, considering that China sends a quarter of its exports to America. After President Bush's decision to sell 150 F-16 jet fighters to Taiwan, on the other hand, China did pull out of a round of weapons-control talks in Europe that the United States had hoped would help slow arms sales to developing countries.
In China's view, it boils down to this: In their attempt to define more independent policies and shake their frustrations with Washington, Chinese leaders and intellectuals seem inclined at least to talk more forcefully of building a new order in East Asia without the United States tipping the balance of power or even mediating. "Most of the conflicts in the region have been eliminated over time," said Liu Tian Chun, a scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Scientists. "China is taking the lead now in forming an overall peaceful order. We don't need outside pressures to do that."

HEADLINE: New Realities Fight Old Images of Mother

SERIES: The Good Mother/First article of a series: Searching for an Ideal

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FREMONT, Mich.

 BODY:
The American mother -- that self-sacrificing, self-effacing, cookie-baking icon -- has been shoved into the center of a political morality play, one where stick-figure mothers battle in a debate that does not begin to suggest the complexity, diversity and confusion of being a mother in 1992.
Instead of Marilyn Quayle and Hillary Clinton, those emblems of stay-at-home and working mothers, talk to Toni Rumsey, who cried when her first child was born and realized she would have to keep her factory job at Gerber Baby Foods here in Fremont or face living in a trailer. 
 Or Stacy Murdock, who watches every penny on her farm in Murray, Ky., because her family's income dropped by more than half when she quit teaching, unable to bear leaving her children.
Or Nancy Cassidy, a garment worker in Easton, Pa., who loves to work and believes her children are the better for it.
 
Redefining Motherhood
 These mothers are haunted by the ghost of the mythical 1950's television mother -- one that most women today cannot be, even if they want to. Caught between a fictional ideal, changing expectations of women's roles and the reality that many mothers now work because they must, women around the country are groping for a new definition of the good mother.
The old images linger, but they fit fewer people's lives. Motherhood in America has undergone a breathtaking transformation in little more than 30 years, propelled by shrinking wages of husbands and changing social attitudes.
In 1960, 20 percent of mothers with children under 6 years old were in the labor force; by last year the figure had swelled to 58 percent, with most of them working full time. Twenty-nine percent of all American families are now headed by one parent.
Some more affluent women choose to work for self-fulfillment, and some who started out that way found that they could not afford to leave their jobs as the economy soured. Whether or not a conservative backlash movement is trying to shame women into staying at home, more and more mothers see work as a financial and personal necessity.
Small wonder, then, that Republican strategists quickly folded their family values banner when they found the reality of motherhood in this election year at odds with campaign slogans. With politicians in both parties now courting middle America, many of these same working-class women have been forced to take jobs outside the home, often monotonous and regimented ones at low wages that may not allow them to buy help with child care and housecleaning.
As interviews with more than 30 mothers around the country show, politicians have waded into one of the most wrenching issues of American life.
"I never feel like I'm a full mom," said Mrs. Rumsey, a 34-year-old mother of two who checks Gerber's baby food for shards of glass and signs of spoilage from 7 A.M. to 3 P.M. "I make the cookies, the homemade costumes for Halloween. I volunteer for everything to make up to them for not being here. When I do all that, I make myself so tired that they lose a happy cheerful mom, and then I'm cheating them again. It's hard when you were raised with Donna Reed and the Beav's mom."
In another factory in Easton, Pa., Mrs. Cassidy inspects sportswear, and her life as a working mother, for flaws. "I think you can work and be a good mother," said the 42-year-old mother of two. "We're doing it. When people compliment you that they're nice children, then I think you've been a terrific mother."
 
The Old Ideal
Mythic Verities And Apple Pie
 Some women have found that they could not be good mothers in the old sense because working has become so important to their identities. These women say they know in their hearts that being at home all day does not automatically make a good mother.
"You can be there without being there," said Cheryl Moorefield, a labor nurse in Winston-Salem, N.C., who has two children.
Yet ask most women their image of a good mother, and the old verities come tumbling forth. "A mother doesn't have a right to be tired or sick," said Deborah Gray, a 38-year-old mother of six whose shift can run 12 hours a day during the busy summer season at Heinz's pickling plant in Holland, Mich. "A mother must be available no matter what. A mother is a person that can perform miracles."
In Murray, Ky., which boasts the National Scouting Museum, tobacco and soybean farms, a state university branch and what seems like a church on every corner, Stacy Murdock comes close to this cherished ideal. Mrs. Murdock, who gave up her teaching job, is up at 6 A.M., starts breakfast and then wakes her three children a half-hour later. The whole family eats breakfast at 7 A.M., and then her husband drives the two older children to school. Her husband, one of a vanishing breed of small farmers who can work close to home, tends his 600 acres of corn, beans, wheat and cattle while his wife plays with her 14-month-old daughter, cleans, cooks and pays bills. At noon he returns for a hot meal with his family.
By 2:30 P.M., Mrs. Murdock is on her way to school to pick up her older daughters. Some afternoons she takes them to dancing school, which she pays for by keeping the school's books. On Wednesdays the children's grandmother drops by to baby-sit so that Mrs. Murdock can volunteer at the older children's school.
"The most important thing you're going to get in your life is your children," Mrs. Murdock said, explaining why the family has given up eating out, planning for a bigger house and having many other extras. "I just can't imagine giving that responsibility to someone else."
It is precisely because convictions about what kind of mother is best run so strong and deep that family values became such an explosive issue. Despite all the talk about fathers' becoming more involved with children, it is mothers who remain at the center of this debate, and mothers who shoulder the praise or blame. Most women interviewed said they were worried about the future of the family, but many said the debate, at least as conducted by politicians, seemed irrelevant or insulting.
"Family values is a cheap way out," Mrs. Rumsey said. "We all believe in family morals and values. I'm not going to put down what you're doing and don't put me down for what I'm trying to do."
For some, the debate intensified their own guilt. "My heart pounds a little bit," said Kris Northrop, the mother of a 4-month-old girl, who has just returned to her job running a candy-wrapping machine at the Life Savers plant in Holland, Mich. "I think, Is this right? Should I try to not be a working mother, even though my image is of an independent mother?"
And for others the verdict is clear: working and mothering small children cannot mix. "I had these children and I wanted to raise them," said Celisa Cunningham, a Baptist minister's wife who returned to work designing and supervising asphalt mixes once her children started school. "I've given 10 years to my children and I'm going to give 30 to my career, and I'm going to see more from those 10 years in the long run than from the 30. I think many mothers cop out and make a life-style choice."
 
The New Reality
Harried Jugglers On a Tightrope
 But for many working-class women, Mrs. Murdock's life, and the comfortable certainties invoked by the champions of family values, are as remote as the television characters that helped shape their idea of the good mother.
Instead of family breakfasts and school volunteer work, Jan Flint works nights and her husband works days in a Welch's juice and jam plant in Lawton, Mich., so that one of them can always be home with the children.
"That's what God meant for me -- to stay at home, cook and sew, and I can't do that," said Mrs. Flint, who had to return to work seven years ago when money got tight. "I used to have a clean house all the time. I always enjoyed being involved in my older two's education. Last night was open house and my children wanted me to go. I bribed them -- 'I'll let you bring friends over if I don't go.' That's what's happening to the American family. Nobody's there, and children don't have full-time guidance."
Measuring themselves against such an exacting, idealized standard, where good mothering equals how much time is spent with the children rather than how secure or happy the children are, many working women feel they fall short. For the most part, these women struggle without help from society or their employers, who seldom give them long maternity leaves or flexible hours.
And because motherhood itself has been transformed in less than a generation, these mothers have no guides. "What is happening now is that parents are relying on child care who themselves were often raised by their mothers," said Deborah Phillips, a psychologist and expert in child development at the University of Virginia. "So there is incredible anxiety and uncertainty, especially in a society that holds firmly to the belief that mother care is superior."
Sheila Lencki, a mother of four who works as a school secretary in Murray, Ky., says she fears she is failing to meet the standard her own mother set.
"My own mother stayed at home, and that's what I wanted to do," she said. "I respect my mother so much. I think that everything she does is right."
Even more troubling, many women fear they have somehow relinquished their children. "When I put them in day care, I did feel a pull; I'm not the one raising my children," said Mrs. Moorefield, who raised her two children alone for seven years until her remarriage several years ago. "Who's teaching them values?"
That anxiety deepens if mothers suspect their child care is not very good, a suspicion that experts in the field say is often correct. Working-class women usually cannot afford to buy one-on-one attention for their children; most of the women interviewed either left their children with relatives or took them to the home of another mother who was looking after several children for pay.
The quality of such care, in both the physical settings and the attention the children receive, varies considerably. The best care is also often the most expensive, and many women said government could help them most by giving them some financial help with child care.
Many women said they felt lucky to have found help from their families or loving baby sitters. But some said they were making compromises that disturbed them, either leaving children as young as 9 at home alone until they returned from work or having to switch baby sitters frequently.
Although she loves her work, Mrs. Moorefield is torn because she believes her recent change to a 12-hour shift may be hurting her children, who are not doing well in school. She is considering sharing a job, but she must first wait to see whether her husband, who works in an airline stockroom, goes on strike.
Generally, though, most women say, with an air of surprise, that they believe their children are actually turning out all right, even if working interferes with their ideal of a good mother.
"For me, looking at my kids tells me I'm doing O.K.," Mrs. Rumsey said. "My kids are excellent students. They are outgoing. They have minds of their own. No matter how much I've never wanted to work, there's never been any drastic indication from my kids that I shouldn't."
 
Blazing a New Path
Leaving the Land Of Make-Believe
 With little chance of living out their ideal of the good mother, many mothers are searching for a new way to think about motherhood.
Elesha Lindsay works days checking references at Forsyth Memorial Hospital in Winston-Salem, N.C., and two nights a week studying for a higher-paying job as a medical stenographer while her husband juggles four jobs as a cook. She leaves her 16-month-old daughter at the hospital's day-care center, where she believes her daughter is happy and well-cared for. Yet she cried all week when she first had to return to work, when her daughter was 9 weeks old. She and a friend filled in for each other so she could add three weeks onto the hospital's normal six-week maternity leave.
Although she would rather work part time when her daughter is small, Mrs. Lindsay sees herself as a good mother, and work as a welcome part of her life.
"Being a good mother depends on what type of person you are and what you instill," she said. "My mother wasn't there the majority of the time, but I was watching her, knowing the type of person she was. We knew what our mother expected from us. That child is spending more time with that day-care giver than you, but I still feel like I'm a better person for her, out working, financially helping the family."
Mrs. Cassidy, the garment worker, also believes that too many mothers become obsessed with motherhood's gestures rather than its substance. "It doesn't matter if you bake cookies for them, and don't take them to Cub Scouts every time," she said. "You're not going to be there for their first step. But I never heard mine say, 'You were never there when I needed you.' "
Still, many mothers worry that they may be deluding themselves. "It looks fine to me," Mrs. Lencki said, "but maybe I'm not looking."
While there is debate about the effects of extensive nonmaternal care early in life, experts agree that with conscientious, loving parents and high-quality care the vast majority of children do just fine, by any measurement of intellectual and emotional development. Some studies suggest that mothers' attitudes are crucial; if they are happy, whether staying at home or working, that will have an enormous impact on their relationship with their children.
Employer flexibility clearly makes a difference, said Arlie Hochschild, a sociologist and author of "The Second Shift: Working Parents and the Revolution at Home" (Viking, 1989), who is now studying the workplace and its effects on family life. "We have to acknowledge that the majority of American women will work for the majority of their lives through their childbearing years and we have to adapt the workplace," she said. "Don't pretend they're men who have wives at home to do this."
One reason Mrs. Cassidy feels little guilt is that she was able to take off work to watch her children in school plays, or tend them when they were sick. But other companies, particularly factories where workers' absences may slow assembly lines, are not so lenient. Several women said their employers required 24-hour notice for sick days -- an impossibility with children -- or docked their pay if they wanted to go to an event at their children's schools.
But even if they did not choose to work, some mothers have found that working has brought unexpected benefits: a new sense of identity, a role in a broader community, pride in their independence, a temporary escape from children that may allow them to be better mothers in the time they share.
And while women may yearn for the safe world of mythic families, they have seen enough of the sobering reality of divorce and widowhood to cherish the financial independence that working confers. "My mother stayed home, and when my father divorced her she had nothing to fall back on," said Donna King, a hospital laboratory supervisor who is a mother of four.
In fact, most of the women interviewed said they would prefer working to staying at home -- but most wanted to work part time.
These days, some more affluent and educated women say they would feel embarrassed to tell their friends that they did not work. Yet many working-class mothers who have found that they are happy working treat it like a guilty secret. Mrs. Lencki dropped her voice almost to a whisper when she talked about enjoying her job, despite her guilt that her youngest son had not had her full-time presence.
Pride, embarrassment and defiance competed as Mrs. Moorefield talked about work. "For me, the ideal mother is one who is able to choose," Mrs. Moorefield said. "Even if we could financially afford that I not work, I still think I would need at least some other contact, part time. You want to be there for your children, and on the other hand you want to be able to provide for them well. This sounds like I'm anti-family values . . ."
NEXT: Single mothers bring up their children in a landscape vastly different from the one in which they themselves were raised.

HEADLINE: Macedonia, in Fight Over a Name, Is Reeling From Trade Embargoes

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Macedonia, the odd republic out in the Yugoslav conflict, is groaning under the weight of trade embargoes imposed by Greece in the south and Serbia in the north, officials here and in the Macedonian capital say.
The embargoes have blocked critically needed imports, especially of oil, two Macedonian officials told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee late last month. 
 Michalis Papaconstantinou, the Greek Foreign Minister, acknowledged this week that Greece had cut off oil supplies to Macedonia. But he said at a news conference here on Thursday that his country was prepared to renew the shipments under a European Community arrangement. "We don't want to do any harm to them," he said.
 
Issue of Recognition
 Three former republics of the old Yugoslav federation -- Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina -- now enjoy international recognition as sovereign states. And the republics of Serbia and Montenegro, reconstituted as a truncated Yugoslavia, retain widespread diplomatic ties despite the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the United Nations General Assembly and the imposition of heavy sanctions on it.
But Macedonia is recognized by only a handful of countries. The rest are holding off because of objections by Greece. For nearly 12 months, the Athens Government has demanded that Macedonia change its name, asserting that the use of the word "Macedonia" should be the exclusive right of Greeks.
The resumption of oil supplies from Greece has been held up by a Greek demand that the authorities in Skopje sign end-user certificates with a name other than "Macedonia." The Macedonian Government has so far refused.
 
Economy Falters Week by Week
 The Republic of Macedonia is a multi-ethnic country whose majority is Slavic, as is its official language.
Robert Frowick, a retired American ambassador posted to the Macedonian capital of Skopje on an international peace mission, said by telephone that he had noticed a deterioration of the economy in just two weeks.
"It is worse now," he said. "They are in an energy crisis. Precious few tractors are pulling wagons filled with people because there is no fuel for buses."
Mr. Frowick is leading a mission created by the 51-member Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in an attempt to prevent the Balkan war from spilling over into Macedonia.
The visiting Macedonian officials, Jane Miljovski, the Minister of Privatization, and Ljube Trpeski, the Minister for Economic Relations, said Greece added to Macedonia's problems last month by imposing a total embargo.
The two officials said that ambulances in their republic lacked fuel to carry sick people and babies, and that there was not enough diesel oil for tractors to haul in the harvest.
 
'A Very Hungry Winter'
 Serbia, which opposes Macedonia's declaration of independence, has barred shipments of vitally needed food to the republic, the officials said.
"We are expecting a very hungry winter," Mr. Miljovski said.
He and Mr. Trpeski attended the annual International Monetary Fund meeting here late last month in an effort to get some financial relief for their country, but to no avail.
"We need the I.M.F. endorsement to help attract business to Macedonia," Mr. Miljovski said. "The Greek blockade, especially, is killing us."
The two Macedonians also called on Senator Claiborne Pell, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, but they immediately faced a seemingly impossible demand. "Just drop the name 'Macedonia' and everything will be all right," the Rhode Island Democrat said by way of greeting.

HEADLINE: Haldore Hanson, 80, Chronicler of China and Victim of McCarthy

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Haldore Hanson, a State Department official who was cleared of charges by Senator Joseph McCarthy that he was a Communist sympathizer, died on Sept. 24 at a hospital in Texcoco, Mexico. He was 80 years old and lived in San Nicholas, Mexico, and Arcola, Va.
He had heart disease and died after a leg operation, his family said. 
 As a foreign correspondent in the 1930's, Mr. Hanson covered the Chinese civil war and the invasion of China by Japan. Traveling rural roads on bicycle, he rotated among the warring forces and occasionally was arrested by one side or the other.
His book on the war, "Humane Endeavor" (Farrar, Rineholt, 1939), was praised as a rare close-up from the remote front lines. Because of his expertise, the State Department hired him in 1942. After the war he became assistant director of the Point Four development aid program for Asia.
 
'I Am a Loyal American'
 In 1950, Senator McCarthy denounced him as having "pro-Communist proclivities" and accused him of being on "a mission to communize the world." The Senator offered no proof.
Mr. Hanson denied any involvement with Communists, saying, "I am a loyal American." A Senate subcommittee found no evidence against him, but the charges still damaged Mr. Hanson, who told the subcommittee how neighbors in Virginia had circulated a petition to drive him out, and how one had called him a Russian spy.
After surviving the controversy, he lost his job in 1953 in a staff reorganization and cutback that the agency said were unrelated to the charges.
In the 1960's he worked on development in Burma, Iran, Nigeria and Pakistan for the Ford Foundation and other organizations. From 1971 to 1978 he headed the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center in Mexico, supported by the Mexican government, the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation.
Born in Virginia, Minn., Mr. Hanson grew up in Duluth, Minn. He graduated from Carleton College.
He taught school and did freelance writing for publications in China and abroad, covering floods, famine and the opium trade. The Associated Press promoted him to full-time correspondent in 1937 and he returned to the United States in 1939 to work in domestic bureaus.
Surviving are his wife of 53 years, the former Bernice Brown; a son, Eric of Burlington, Vt.; a daughter, Signe Hanson of Pompton Lakes, N.J.; a sister, Janet Hanson of Duluth; and three brothers, Chuck Hanson of San Clemente, Calif., and Fritz Hanson and Richard Hanson, both of Duluth.

HEADLINE: Congress Set to Rein In Foreign Aid Agency

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Responding to accusations that the Federal Government's embattled foreign aid agency has been subsidizing the export of American jobs, a House-Senate conference committee decided late Friday night to restrict the agency's future operations.
The prohibition, added to the $14 billion foreign aid bill, orders the Agency for International Development not to finance any overseas projects that could result in further job losses. The ban follows the release of a two-year investigation by labor unions into the support that the agency has provided for investment promotion boards in Central America and the Caribbean. 
At a press conference on Friday, union officials charged that an A.I.D.-subsidized organization in El Salvador, the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development, had lured American apparel manufacturers by taking out advertisements in American trade magazines. One of the advertisements showed a woman, identified as Rosa Martinez, sitting in front of a sewing machine.
"You can hire her for 33 cents an hour," the ad promised. A senior A.I.D. official acknowledged in an interview that the agency had given $100 million to the organization since 1984, but contended that only 6 percent of the money had been used for attracting foreign investment to El Salvador.
The A.I.D. official, who insisted on anonymity, said the rest of the money had been spent on economic studies and small-business development projects. But Charles P. Kernaghan, who headed the investigation on behalf of 21 unions, said he had found little evidence in El Salvador that those other projects were receiving any money.
A Salvadoran Government official said American businesses "could move anyway, and it happens to be they chose El Salvador."
The results of the unions' investigation were first reported on Sept. 27 by the CBS News program "60 Minutes."
The ban approved by the House-Senate conference committee was actually one of the mildest responses proposed. A California Democrat called for banning A.I.D. from providing any money to free-trade zones and foreign investment promotion boards in poor countries. And a group of 28 other representatives went even further, calling for the agency's $500 million in annual operating expenses to be cut off until the accusations were investigated.
A.I.D. officials had no reaction today to the prohibition, which is likely to become law when the foreign-aid bill comes up for final votes in the House and Senate, probably on Monday.
Union officials and sympathetic members of Congress have so far focused their criticism narrowly on A.I.D. But by highlighting the issue of job losses from international competition, many of them also hope to strengthen their position for an effort next year to block Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The trade ministers of the United States, Canada and Mexico are scheduled to initial the free-trade pact on Wednesday at a ceremony in San Antonio to be attended by President Bush.
Unions are using the A.I.D.'s financial support as the basis for a broader attack on the Administration's foreign assistance philosophy of encouraging trade in addition to paying for conventional aid projects, like building schools or providing immunization injections.
Representative George E. Brown Jr., Democrat of California, said at a press conference with union leaders on Friday that A.I.D. should limit its private-sector projects to helping small businesses.
The senior A.I.D. official pointed out that American exports to Central America and the Caribbean ballooned in recent years, making them two of the few regions in the world where the United States has a trade surplus. The United States ran an overall trade deficit of $66.3 billion last year.
Part of the increase in American exports to Central America consists of American fabric shipments. Central American and Caribbean nations are allowed to import American-made cloth, assemble it into garments and ship the garments to the United States free of the quotas and most of the import taxes.

HEADLINE: Abrams and D'Amato Use Opposite Strategies

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
Looking for the extra luster and momentum that only a front-runner can offer, Attorney General Robert Abrams has begun his race for the United States Senate by embracing any support that Gov. Bill Clinton might provide over the final weeks of the campaign. At the same time, his opponent, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato is keeping a calculated distance from President Bush and his sagging fortunes in New York State.
For Mr. Abrams, who won the Democratic primary two weeks ago by the smallest of margins, a close attachment to Mr. Clinton is likely to enhance his standing in a state where the Arkansas Governor holds a lead of nearly 20 points over the President and twice that over Ross Perot in at least one poll, from the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. 
 For those who believe in coattail politics, that relationship could be important upstate, where Mr. Abrams's support is weaker than in New York City and its nearby counties.
But the polls also suggest that Mr. D'Amato, who is seeking a third term, is plotting a proper course by keeping an arm's length from a once-popular President whose approval ratings have plummeted. In recent public appearances Mr. D'Amato has been stressing many of his differences with the Administration. 
 
'It's Textbook'
 Charles Cook, a political analyst in Washington who specializes in charting Senate races, said Mr. D'Amato would be foolish to run his campaign any other way. "It's textbook," he said. "He's doing a really good job. It's smart for him to do it, and he'd be crazy not to."
In fact, among the 12 incumbent Republican senators seeking a new term, several, like Bob Packwood in Oregon, are adopting a similar posture, playing down attachments that seem obvious liabilities and playing up constituent services. That is a stark contrast to 4, 8 and 12 years ago when so many Republican candidates for the Senate did everything they could to identify themselves with Ronald Reagan.
Even without an incumbent who was as widely popular as President Reagan was through the 1980's, Congressional candidates can routinely benefit from the financial contributions and media attention that a sitting President can bring. But this year is different.
"Now they are running on their own achievements, as someone who can bring about change," said Stuart Rothenberg, another Washington-based political analyst. "Nobody is running with the President. They're running as individualists, emphasizing their own accomplishments for the state and trying to put some distance between themselves, Washington and politics in general.
"People like Bob Packwood and Fritz Hollings are acknowleding their incumbency but focusing on what they have done in their states. Very few candidates are linking themselves to the national candidates."
 
Recalling Truman and Reagan
 Senator Hollings, a conservative Democrat who is seeking his fifth full term, went so far as to associate himself with former President Reagan in one of his television advertisements. In a season that has already seen Mr. Bush comparing himself favorably to Harry S. Truman, a populist Democrat, Mr. Hollings's ploy should not seem so unusual.
Mr. Reagan was not so pleased, however, calling it "misleading" and making clear that he endorsed Mr. Hollings's Republican challenger, Tommy Hartnett.
Objections notwithstanding, Mr. Cook agreed that any relationship a candidate can establish with the larger political winds at their back can help. "But the race is so fluid," he said. "Nobody knows exactly what to do. I find it's not an anti-Republican tide out there to the extent people are disenchanted with the Republican party. It's the President, personally, not his party."
Mr. D'Amato's campaign aides say that even if the Presidential polls change, as they could if Mr. Perot siphons support from his opponents, Mr. D'Amato would continue his independent foray.
Mr. Bush and the Senator have joined forces only once this year, at a dinner June 29, and with all indications that Mr. Clinton will win the state, D'Amato campaign officials say they do not expect Mr. Bush to return.
In his absence, though, Secretary of Housing Jack F. Kemp, a former Congressman from New York and potential Presidential candidate in 1996, has assumed a most visible profile as an ardent supporter. He has made television commercials for the Senator and has appeared at numerous events with him around the state, including a fund-raiser in Manhattan last Wednesday night.
 
Differences With Bush
 Members of Mr. D'Amato's staff seem to be almost going out of their way to flag the Senator's differences with the Administration. One aide at Mr. D'Amato's West 28th Street campaign office beamed the other day, producing statistics that reflect how often Mr. D'Amato and President Bush have disagreed on issues. The evidence, from the Congressional Quarterly Almanac, showed that the Senator voted against the Administration 32 percent of the time in 1989 and 1990 and 21 percent of the time last year.
It has always been a point of pride with Mr. D'Amato that he portrays himself as a independent Republican, not a rubber stamp for the Administration, even though those same statistics can be inverted to reflect the fact that he supported the President 68, 68 and 79 percent of the time, and often on major issues, like the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court last year and the veto of a civil rights bill in 1990.
"I'm never afraid to take a position that's different with the Administration," Mr. D'Amato said to reporters after his appearance with Mr. Kemp, supporting his point with a few examples: the Administration's acceptance of Boris N. Yeltsin as the Russian leader (too slow), the need to confront Saddam Hussein in Iraq (too late) and the President's 1990 tax agreement (simply wrong).
He was also critical of the Republican platform adopted at the convention in August, calling its emphasis on family values "too intense," when most Americans are far more concerned about economic issues.
 
'Pretty Much in Sync'
 While Mr. Abrams's strategy is largely driven by the Presidential polls, his aides insist he is in relative agreement with Mr. Clinton on most major issues. Mr. Abrams may be of a "more progressive bent than someone who runs for President," said Ethan Geto, Mr. Abrams's campaign director. "But on economic and social issues, we're pretty much in sync."
If Mr. Abrams suffers it won't be for the close alignment but for the probability that, feeling secure in New York, neither Mr. Clinton nor Mr. Gore will return before the election, thus eliminating a valuable fund-raising asset.
So far, Mr. Clinton has appeared with Mr. Abrams three times in New York -- all on one day two weeks ago -- and Mr. Abrams spent two days on the Clinton-Gore campaign bus upstate after a brief appearance with Mr. Gore.
While Mr. D'Amato's supporters argue that New Yorkers are sophisticated enough to make the necessary distinctions to split their votes, experts say the Senator could suffer if the public feels the Clinton ticket has so large a lead by Nov. 3 that they do not bother to vote.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton to Endorse Free Trade Accord

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton, who has been walking a tightrope on the issue of free trade for weeks, hopes to lay the issue to rest this weekend with the help of his supporters in the organized labor movement and Congress.
He will announce his support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, campaign officials said, but will also try to mollify opponents of the measure by pushing for legislative guarantees that call for worker training and environmental protections. 
 Advisers to Mr. Clinton said he had long sought a way to declare his support for the measure but wanted to devise a way to "fill in the gaps" that he felt still existed in it. The announcement could come as soon as Sunday.
"Ultimately he just wanted to be for it," one campaign official said. "And this was a way of doing it."
 
'Not Worried About the Politics'
 Mr. Clinton campaigned here today with Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who is the House majority leader and who has opposed the trade agreement, saying it would cost American jobs.
The Democratic Presidential nominee today would not confirm his intention to support the agreement, in part because he had planned to notify major supporters of his campaign in advance. But he said he has always supported negotiating with Mexico on expanded trade.
"I'm not worried about the politics of it," he said. "I'm going to say this is about the economic future of America. I'm going to do what I think is best for the average Americans and their economic future.
"This is not a decision you can make politically. It's too complicated. You can't calculate what the fallout's going to be. You just have to do what you think is right, and that's what I'm going to do here."
Mr. Gephardt has suggested that a border tax or other measures be adopted to build further protections for American companies that have to compete with companies in Mexico, where environmental standards are less rigid. It is not clear what exceptions Mr. Clinton would require in exchange for his support, but Mr. Gephardt said today that he trusts Mr. Clinton to make the agreement a workable one.
"We all support a treaty with Mexico," Mr. Gephardt said. "I have supported it for a long time. The question is: 'Is it going to be done right? Are you going to take care of the collateral problems?' I have great faith in Bill Clinton to do that. I have no faith in George Bush doing that right."
The issue of free trade has been a constant undercurrent as Mr. Clinton took his campaign through the industrial Midwest this weekend. And President Bush has already begun criticizing him on the trade issue, asserting that the Arkansas Governor was trying to have it both ways by advocating free trade while assuring labor groups that he would not do anything to hurt them.
Mr. Clinton said today that Mr. Bush was in no position to accuse him of switching positions on issues. The Bush campaign has begun broadcasting a commercial that focuses on the varying explanations Mr. Clinton has offered on how he avoided the draft during the Vietnam War.
"The American people know he's a big flip-flopper," Mr. Clinton said of Mr. Bush. "From 'read my lips' to being against the civil rights law to being for it.
He added, "If I put on a flip-flop ad against him, it would be both more accurate and far more powerful, because it's about things that affect real people's lives."
 
'Campaign for Future'
 Today was the first anniversary of Mr. Clinton's announcement that he would seek the Presidency. At a rally here that attracted thousands of Clinton supporters, Mr. Clinton reminisced about his year on the campaign trail.
"This is not just a campaign for the Presidency," he said. "It is a campaign for the future, for the forgotten hard-working middle class of America who deserve a government that fights for them for a change."
Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton toured a farmers' market and went out of his way to pose with a merchant who identified himself as a war veteran who said he was supporting Mr. Clinton.
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd outdoors afterward, Mr. Clinton suggested that they express their support by going inside to buy the President's least favorite vegetable.
"Go in there and buy some broccoli," he said, as the crowd laughed. "I like broccoli."
Mr. Clinton also belittled the President for saying that the upcoming debates would help Mr. Clinton because he attended Oxford University in England as a Rhodes Scholar.
"I never studied debate at Oxford," he said. "Mr. Bush went to Greenwich Country Day School and to Yale. I think he can take care of himself."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Pulse -- Texas;
In Texas, Three 'Neighbors' Battle for a Vital Prize

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
More than anywhere else, perhaps, the Presidential campaign begins all over again this weekend in Texas, the nation's third-most-populous state.
This is, after all, President Bush's political base. It is also Ross Perot's home turf, and Bill Clinton, born just a few miles across the Arkansas border, has had close ties to Texas since his earliest days in politics. A Presidential contest involving three candidates, all from the same compact area, has no recent precedent. 
 So no one is sure exactly how their struggle for the 32 electoral votes at stake here will play out, although few (outside the Perot inner circle at least) give the Dallas billionaire any chance of carrying the state. Discerning the shape of the contest is particularly difficult in the volatile atmosphere created by Mr. Perot's unpredictable behavior and the prospect of three-way television debates.
Already, however, Mr. Perot has all but monopolized the Texas news media for a week, costing the President time in his desperate scramble to pull out a victory here.
"It's safe to say that Perot will have more impact in Texas than in any other state," said George Christian, an Austin political consultant who served as press secretary for President Lyndon B. Johnson. "He could get as much as 15 percent of the vote here, though it will probably be less. He'll take votes from both of the other guys. You can't say yet with confidence who suffers most."
 
Crucial State in the Race
 There is no overstating the importance of the struggle here.
Presidential strategies begin with the assumption that a candidate can carry his home state. Since World War II, all the winners have done so, and among the losers, only Adlai E. Stevenson (twice) and George McGovern failed. It is a measure of Mr. Bush's problems, as well as a reflection of Mr. Clinton's regional appeal, that the President has had to work so hard in Texas just to stay even.
Polls by The Dallas Morning News and Mason-Dixon Research, both taken before Mr. Perot resumed his active candidacy on Thursday, showed Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton in a dead heat.
For the Republicans, the importance of Texas is heightened this year by Mr. Bush's miserable prospects in California, the most populous state. Without California's 54 electoral votes and New York's 33, Texas and Florida constitute the indispensable base for a Republican victory, and even at that, Mr. Bush would have to come close to sweeping the swing states of the Midwest.
"If he loses Texas," said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, this state's most influential Democrat, "the President is finished. Period."
 
Clinton Strategy
 For Mr. Clinton, with his strength elsewhere, the stakes are not quite so high. Still, top Democrats constantly remind one another that no member of their party has been elected President without carrying Texas since it entered the union in 1845.
Mr. Bentsen is working hard for Mr. Clinton, and his 254-county organization will prove valuable in mobilizing the party's vote next month.
Robin Rorapaugh, Mr. Clinton's state manager, said that "at a minimum" the Arkansas Governor would do enough in the state "to force Mr. Bush to spend more time here, recultivating his base," and less in the swing states he also needs to win. Ms. Rorapaugh argued that Mr. Clinton had a real chance to carry Texas, in part because of the popularity of Gov. Ann W. Richards.
But another leading Democrat said he saw "no signal that Clinton is ready to go flat-out in Texas." He noted that most of the money for radio and television had gone elsewhere, "to the states that constitute the meat and potatoes, not places that would add the gravy."
That Democrat and a leading organizer of Hispanic voters, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Clinton campaign had lots of work to do to guarantee the kind of Hispanic turnout that Democrats need to carry Texas. Even in the best of times for Democrats, the Hispanic vote here is far from monolithic, and this year, Mr. Clinton has to contend with the scandal surrounding Lena Guerrero, a promising Hispanic Democrat who was forced to resign from a powerful state post when it was disclosed that she had falsified her academic record.
 
Vulnerabilities for Each Side
 Another potential weak point for Mr. Clinton is East Texas, where rural and small-town Democrats have been voting Republican in recent Presidential elections. The area, adjacent to Arkansas and Louisiana, is more Southern than southwestern in its political culture, and Mr. Clinton has played on that.
But people there, and especially older white men, have not seemed entirely comfortable with the Arkansas Governor; polls show a large undecided vote in East Texas, and it could be a fertile hunting ground for Mr. Perot, who was born in the area, in Texarkana.
If Mr. Clinton is vulnerable in East Texas, Mr. Bush has his troubles in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. It is normally a Republican bastion, but every poll has shown that it is also the best area for Mr. Perot, who lives there. The President has been hurt by cutbacks in military spending that have hurt the aircraft and electronic companies in the area.
In the Permian Basin in West Texas, a center of the oil industry, which is normally heavily Republican, the economy and the President's reputation have both been starkly eroded, even though that is the region where Mr. Bush made his start as a businessman.
Disaffection with the President is also noticeable in the wealthy suburbs of Houston he once represented in Congress. Bill Archer, the Republican who now holds the seat, reported in July that 57 percent of the 18,000 constituents who responded to an informal survey in his district said they disapproved of Mr. Bush's performance.
 
Help for the Economy
 Mr. Bush has done what he could to respond to the state's economic ills, which are his biggest problem here as elsewhere. He cut a deal to keep financing alive for the $8 billion atom smasher to be built south of Dallas in Waxahachie, with 7,000 local jobs involved, and he authorized the sale to Taiwan of F-16 fighters made in Fort Worth by the General Dynamics Corporation. The sale, it was said, could eventually produce $6 billion in contracts, many in Texas.
Beyond that, Texas Republicans have taken the offensive against Mr. Clinton on the economy with tactics that have not yet been seen elsewhere. A rush-hour radio commercial in Houston proclaims: "Fewer jobs for Texans. You can't trust Bill Clinton. He's all wrong for America."
Fred Meyer, the state Republican chairman, predicted more of the same, with emphasis on Mr. Clinton's plans for deeper military cuts; on his somewhat ambiguous attitude towards the President's free-trade agreement with Mexico, which is highly popular in this state, and on Mr. Clinton's proposed tax increases.
"There's only one issue: the economy," Mr. Meyer said. "It's hurting us. Until we neutralize it, we go nowhere, but we're starting to do that."
The wild card remains Mr. Perot.
Ernest Angelo Jr. of Midland, a member of the Republican National Committee, stated his party's hopes: that the billionaire businessman "will stir the pot, halt Clinton's momentum and make it look more open." Perhaps then, Mr. Angelo said, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Perot would split the anti-Bush vote fairly evenly.
Prof. Richard Murray of the University of Houston spelled out a different scenario. If Mr. Perot gets 12 percent of the vote, which seems a reasonable estimate, he said, "six or seven points come out of Bush's hide, maybe two or three will come from people who had planned to sit it out, and only three or four are lost by Clinton."
"But the real point is that he keeps anyone from locking the state up," Professor Murray added. "He forces Texas into the competitive zone and keeps it there until Nov. 3."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Overview;
Impact of Perot On Race So Far Is Termed Scant

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
A survey of political professionals around the country shows that Ross Perot has not succeeded in fundamentally altering the 1992 Presidential campaign simply by re-entering the race.
But many of them emphasize that his true impact cannot be gauged until he begins his expected advertising blitz, and until he makes his debut in the coming Presidential debates. 
 Across the board, these analysts and strategists agree that the economy continues to drive this campaign, and that President Bush continues to fight a tide of economic discontent. But many political professionals argue that Mr. Perot, with his deficit-reduction program of "fair-shared sacrifice" and a promise to raise gasoline taxes by 50 cents a gallon over five years, may find it hard to attract voters in hard times.
 
Loss of Momentum
 This is only one indication of the difficulties Mr. Perot is facing in re-starting his campaign only four weeks before the Nov. 3 election.
In assessing Mr. Perot's current support, the most striking fact to emerge from a survey of political leaders is that even in the Rocky Mountain West, once a hotbed of Perot backing, important states do not seem to have rallied to his banner.
Indeed, the Dallas executive faces a daunting challenge in re-establishing his credibility in areas where he once threatened President Bush's base of support and where Gov. Bill Clinton has since moved into position to challenge Mr. Bush.
In Montana, where Mr. Perot had a 2-to-1 lead in public opinion polls last summer, party officials say they expect him to win a percentage of the vote in the teens. In Colorado, a poll made public on Friday showed Mr. Clinton remaining in first place, with Mr. Perot a distant third.
So far, Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton have yet to fully exploit Mr. Perot's tax program, which grass-roots leaders of their parties regard as one of the Texan's greatest vulnerabilities. But state and local leaders, unlike their nominees, were not holding their fire this weekend as they judged Mr. Perot's impact in their states.
"Ross Perot's plan is full of misery and despair for Michigan people," said Steve Gools, a spokesman for the Michigan Democratic Party. Anne Scherr, press secretary for the Bush-Quayle campaign in Connecticut, said, "We've been saying that a vote for Clinton or Perot is a vote for higher taxes."
Republicans around the country expressed the hope that Mr. Perot would help Mr. Bush by splintering off anti-Bush, change-oriented voters from Mr. Clinton, who maintains a significant lead in the national polls. This hope is particularly fervent in states like Florida, which are crucial to the Republican Presidential base but are unusually competitive this year.
"I think that Bush will carry Florida, and I don't think Perot will do anything but help that by splitting any anti-Bush vote," said Mac Stipanovich, a Tallahassee lawyer who is a Republican strategist.
 
Voting-Booth Decisions
 But many Democrats argue that such voters may flirt with Mr. Perot in the coming weeks, but will ultimately show the historic unwillingness of Americans to stick with a third-party candidate trailing in the polls.
Sam Barone, executive director of the Ohio Democratic Party, said Mr. Perot would hurt Mr. Clinton in his state, but only in the short term. "Perot voters are voters who think the country is on the wrong track," Mr. Barone said. "Clinton reaped a lot of the benefit when he withdrew. But in the long term, I think the people are taking this election seriously, so they won't want to waste their vote."
In California, whose 54 electoral votes the Democrats are hoping to make the anchor of a victory this year, and where Mr. Perot showed remarkable appeal last spring, several analysts are also predicting only a slight impact from Mr. Perot's second effort.
"Perot's re-entry will clearly hurt Clinton, but Clinton is so far ahead that Perot's effect is marginal," said Mark DiCamillo, associate director of the Field Poll, a California polling concern.
 
'White Republican Voters'
 Martin Wattenberg, a political science professor at the University of California at Irvine, asserted that Mr. Perot's final core of supporters would be small and that, contrary to many predictions, it would ultimately come from Mr. Bush. "Perot is attracting white, Protestant, upper-income supporters," Mr. Wattenberg said. "Perot will gain the white Republican voters who have voted for Bush."
Many of these political professionals, however, noted that the endgame of this campaign is hard to predict, with the added feature of an extraordinarily compressed series of three-way Presidential debates from Oct. 11 to Oct. 19.
Pat Paniccia, a member of the Democratic National Committee from Connecticut, was one of several Democrats who worried about the impact of a third force in a forum that Democratic strategists are hoping will help Mr. Clinton close the sale with the voters, much as Ronald Reagan did in 1980.
"I think he just gets in the way," Ms. Paniccia said of Mr. Perot. "It's going to give Bush less time to answer the tough questions."
Some Republicans said that Mr. Perot and Mr. Clinton could end up presenting an unattractive tableau: two challengers beating up on a President. But there were also general signs of apprehension among Republicans over the coming debates, which were widely seen as a pivotal opportunity for a lagging President to make his case.
 
'Debates Will Be Key'
 Jeffrey P. Hastings, executive director of the Cuyahoga County Republican organization in Ohio, said: "The debates will be key. He's going to have to tell people what he's doing to provide jobs. He needs to do better to articulate what the Administration has done."
Mr. Perot's advertising campaign, which is expected to begin this week, is another important variable, several political professionals said. Many said they would not be surprised to see Mr. Perot gain in the public opinion surveys early this month.
But many polls this week suggested there was a limit to how far Mr. Perot could rise because of ill feelings about his on-again, off-again candidacy. A Newsweek Poll made public today, conducted Thursday and Friday, showed Mr. Clinton retaining his lead over Mr. Bush, 44 percent to 36 percent. Mr. Perot had the backing of 14 percent in this survey of 752 registered voters, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
The poll also showed that while 26 percent said Mr. Perot was following the wishes of his volunteers in re-entering the race, 63 percent said he was manipulating them.
The cover of Newsweek this week carries a picture of Mr. Perot with the headline, "Ego Trip," and judging from the interviews with political professionals, it is a charge that will be heard in the coming weeks. Ms. Paniccia in Connecticut said: "I just think it has to do with his ego. I don't think he liked being called a quitter."
Beneath the upheaval in recent days is a campaign that just four weeks before Election Day, still finds the Democrat in a commanding position. What was striking in the interviews with political professionals was Mr. Clinton's success in keeping Mr. Bush on the defensive even deep in the Republican base.
Noting that the President was campaigning in Florida today, Robert Joffee, a Miami poll taker for Mason-Dixon, said it was comparable "to a football team that is losing in the fourth quarter starting from behind its own 20-yard line."
Still, many analysts said their states were hardly locked up. Merle Black, a professor of political science at Emory University, said of Georgia, where public polls show Mr. Clinton in the lead, "Some new information could surface, he could make a mistake in one of the debates, and we've yet to see massive negative advertising, as we are sure to in the month to come."

HEADLINE: Politics Keeps New York State Mental Unit Open

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
GOWANDA, N.Y., Oct. 1 --
A rattling wind slams against the red-brick facade of Building 86 of the Gowanda Psychiatric Center, then whistles down the hallways of what was once a ward in one of New York's state-run mental hospitals.
Like many of the other structures at the sprawling complex here, Building 86 is empty. But Gowanda, which in its heyday in the 1950's had 3,710 patients on grounds surrounded by farmland, is not closed. On the second floor of Building 67, amid wall stencils of horses, sunsets and a space shuttle, 14 mentally ill people live on a single ward. They are the only patients here. 
 With local lawmakers fighting fiercely to preserve the hospital and the jobs it provides, the state continues to spend $2.9 million a year to keep Gowanda open -- paying for a round-the-clock admissions center, a staff of 44 including full-time psychiatrists and services ranging from physical therapy to ceramics classes.
It is an amount that many mental-health advocates call frighteningly high, because it could pay for more than a hundred beds in community residences at a time when thousands of the mentally ill are homeless in the streets of New York City.
But so far, the Legislature has not provided the legal authorization for the center to be closed.
So Gowanda has become a sort of Love Canal of state mental-health policy, a ghostly setting that lingers while the bureaucracy fights over what to do with it. And like Love Canal, it is perhaps even more potent as a symbol than for the actual dollars spent here: what is happening at Gowanda, 40 miles south of Buffalo, is likely to happen elsewhere in New York as the state tries to close or reduce services at several other large mental hospitals upstate that are vestiges of another era.
In each case, a powerful combination of community leaders, local lawmakers and unions are fighting off the planned closures of the mental hospitals, which often have been the dominant employer in their area.
Their campaigns provide an oddly direct contrast to the "not in my backyard" phenomenon that has stymied attempts downstate to build many of the community residences for the mentally ill, which are far cheaper and considered by experts to be more humane and more effective in treating most sick people. While almost everybody agrees that some of the hospitals need to be phased out, the local groups plead against closing the one in their backyard.
What has happened, in essence, is that the debate over how best to spend the state's mental-health dollars has been overwhelmed by a classic political struggle over how to fairly divide money between upstate and downstate.
"There is tremendous pressure on lawmakers to keep these hospitals open until they can find other employment for the people who work there, and I can sympathize with that," said Steven Greenfield, the executive director of the Association of Community Living Agencies in Mental Health, a nonprofit advocacy group. "But to some extent," he said, "mentally ill patients are being held hostage for the sake of economic development."
Although the vast move to deinstitutionalize the mentally ill has emptied New York's mental hospitals of all but 11,000 patients, there are nonetheless 22 hospitals in the system -- four more than there were even in 1953, when the mental-hospital population hit its peak of 93,000. Nearly two-thirds of the state's mental-health budget is spent on the hospitals, even though the goal of deinstitutionalization was to channel most spending to the community programs.
So while New York continues to lead every state in per-capita spending on the mentally ill, there is nowhere near enough money for the estimated 170,000 mentally ill people outside the hospitals. And up to half of the patients in the hospitals could themselves be treated in community residences if there were rooms available, state officials say.
As the patients at Gowanda wander the silent grounds on a chilly fall afternoon, the physical isolation here only magnifies the sense that some are trapped in worlds of their own. "Do you feel that?" asks a woman named Carol, her eyes brimming with tears. "Do you feel the winter feeling coming on?"
Others say that if there is nobody around, they like it that way. "You know that when all these buildings are empty it's good -- you don't have to look around for anybody looking at you," said Douglas, a bearded 34-year-old man who was committed to Gowanda after the police found him ripping paneling from a house he had formerly lived in. (He said he still considered the wood his.)
 
'It's Eerie'
 Outside of Building 67, which houses the ward and staff offices and an outpatient treatment center nearby, Gowanda is a virtual ghost town.
"It's eerie, it's strange," said Peter L. Smith, who started working here as a mental-therapy aide in 1966. Now, as the sergeant in charge of safety and security, he makes the rounds of the empty buildings, guarding against water leaks or cracked pipes.
"Imagine coming through here at midnight," Mr. Smith said as he took a visitor through the abandoned Building 86. "Just you and a flashlight and your shadows."
For most workers at Gowanda, there is a lingering sense of bitterness that the hospital, rated among the state's best, was the first to be phased out, and many are convinced that the action has led directly to more homelessness.
"We opened the back door and closed the front door," said Wayne Jones, a mental-health-therapy aide and the president of the union local. "That's all the state did."
The state Office of Mental Health announced plans last year to close Gowanda and three other hospitals and cut services at seven other hospitals. The long-term savings would be $420 million a year, or enough to nearly double the budget for community programs.
But the policy has run into political roadblocks. "It's very easy to stop things in New York State," said Richard C. Surles, the state's Commissioner of Mental Health. "It can be very hard to do them."
 
Foes See a Ploy
 State lawmakers from western New York, however, have an entirely different perspective on the situation at Gowanda. They say that the problem is not that the institution has stayed open too long, but that it was emptied too fast. And they contend that by keeping an almost absurdly small number of patients there, mental-health officials have deliberately created a white elephant in a bid to increase the public pressure to close Gowanda entirely.
Under the state's Mental Hygiene Law, none of the hospitals can be closed without specific legislative authorization. But the Office of Mental Health is legally able to curtail services to an absolute minimum, which is what has happened at Gowanda.
"It galls me that the system is being manipulated this way," said State Senator Dale M. Volker, an Erie County Republican. "They decided to close Gowanda down, come what may, and they decided to blame the Legislature. Now they're saying it's costing us a ton of money, and it's your guys' fault."
Mr. Volker and other lawmakers from the area have declared that they will not let Gowanda close until they are persuaded that the Department of Mental Health has a workable plan for providing acute-care and emergency services for the mentally ill in local hospitals in southwestern New York.
The state has committed itself to such a plan and says it should be in full operation within the year. John R. Collier, the executive director at Gowanda, warned that it would be a mistake to shut Gowanda down before the state had demonstrated that it would follow through on the alternatives.
"The stupidest thing we could do is renege on our promises," said Mr. Collier. "The Legislature will say forget it, if this is the way you play ball, then you won't close Willard, you won't close Harlem Valley, you won't close anything else." He was referring to two other mental hospitals slated for closure, in Seneca and Dutchess counties.
 
Inmates Are Jobs
 Assuming the dispute is settled, Gowanda will most likely become a prison. Indeed, half of the original grounds has already been turned into one, the Collins Correctional Center. But there is also some reluctance among upstate lawmakers in Albany to develop a widespread policy of turning mental hospitals into prisons, since it could jeopardize a separate agreement to build five new prisons in upstate areas. Prisons are a major source of jobs in many rural areas.
In any case, there is no question that the closings and the up to 9,000 jobs that would be lost, could represent a devastating economic blow to areas that have already been through tough times. The Willard center in Romulus, for instance, is the third-largest employer in Seneca County, which is also facing the prospect of losing another of its largest employers, an Army depot.
"There are economic reasons why communities don't want to give up the hospitals," said David Mechanic, the director of the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research at Rutgers University. But, he added, "From the point of view of mental health, it's totally irrational to have small numbers of patients in outmoded physical plants that are extremely costly to keep up."
That is nonetheless exactly what is happening at Gowanda now, where the average spent per patient last year was $192,833, and the costs could grow even more exorbitant.
And C. Richard Orndoff, the regional director in western New York for the Office of Mental Health, said that as long as the Legislature refused to close the hospital, the law would require that it maintain its accreditation with full staff, doctors, services and an admissions unit -- even if it was not treating anyone.
"It's not beyond the realm of possibility that we could be sitting here a year from now with 44 staff and 20 empty beds," he said. "We might be open, but with no patients at all."

HEADLINE: New Riots, Old Story, Panel Finds

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 3

 BODY:
A state legislative committee has concluded that the spring rioting here was caused by the same problems that led to the Watts riots of the 1960's.
In a report made public Friday, the Assembly Special Committee on the Los Angeles Crisis urged wide-ranging changes in state and local laws to encourage economic development in riot-torn areas. 
 "The Kerner and McCone commissions identified poverty, segregation, lack of education and employment opportunities, widespread perceptions of police abuse and unequal consumer services as the principal grievances which led to civil disturbances of the 1960's," the report said of two panels picked to study the Watts riots. "Little has changed in 1992 Los Angeles."
The report was prepared by a 17-member bipartisan committee led by Assemblyman Curtis Tucker, Democrat of Inglewood. The committee includes the entire Los Angeles County delegation in the Assembly and was formed after the riots last spring to analyze the unrest and recommend ways the state could improve the inner city of Los Angeles.
The committee recommends several ways to improve the climate in the inner city, while also acknowledging that the state budget crisis makes changes difficult.
Mr. Tucker said most of the recommendations depended on redistribution of existing funds and changes in the way private business was handled in those areas.
The panel also urged legislation to encourage investment of state employee pension funds in the inner city. It said the Public Employees Retirement System and the State Teachers Retirement fund had investments all over the world but not in Los Angeles.
The panel recommended that the funds invest in a special Recovery Capital Fund semiannually, provided that such investments were determined to be prudent.
De Witt Bowman, chief investment officer for the state employees' fund, said he was already looking for such investment opportunities.

Mexico's Economist Kings

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
There we were in the modern presidential office of Los Pinos, or The Pines, the Mexican White House: President Carlos Salinas, bald on top, very slight build, somehow floating in his large black-leather chair; I, to his left, on a very soft matching sofa, sinking, knees approaching chest.
I moved to reduce the gap, noting we both had Harvard Ph.D.'s. He smiled under his rectangular mustache. 
 It seems to me, I said, that you and your ruling group are like Plato's ruling philosopher kings. But with differences. Plato's rulers shunned office; your group eagerly seeks it. And Plato's kings were philosophers; you're economists. All the same, you both represent your republics' best and brightest and think you know the public good better than the people do. You both believe democratic politics prevents making the hard and right decisions, and you both exercise authoritarian power.
Observers of Mexico say that your goal is to make your country a modern industrial nation. They say you are doing so by making the rich richer, expecting that wealth will eventually trickle down to the poor masses. They say you are liberalizing the political system, but that you will not share power or democratize the system for many years, if ever.
"Mexico's system is more complicated than that" Mr. Salinas responded without a trace of rancor and with the absolute confidence of a man who knows his solid international reputation and current popularity at home. "There is much more consultation and negotiation than you understand. . . . We have to be open to criticism and demands. . . . If you present us as a small group who believes it has the Truth, this wouldn't do justice to the Mexican people."
He cited the fact that opposition parties already hold hundreds of state and local offices. And, he insisted, "we are committed to simultaneous economic development and political reform; one is impossible without the other."
The conversation ran on in this vein to an amiable end. I left impressed, as all seem to.
But I kept remembering the warning of Robert Pastor of Emory University: "Mexico is a country that has learned to keep its secrets, from itself and from Americans." For one, government salaries and perks are never made public.
The secrets are hidden in a small power elite within a party that has ruled Mexico, uninterrupted, since 1929. Within this system, the principal constitutional restraint is that the president may serve only one six-year term. But during that term, the president has monarch-like powers, including the sole right to name his party's next presidential candidate.
The others in the ruling group wait their turn for high office. Their families have known each other for generations. They are mostly well-to-do or rich, highly educated (half the Cabinet members hold Ph.D.'s from the best U.S. universities), talented and tough. They compare favorably with counterparts in the industrialized world.
Opposition party leaders are convinced this group will never willingly share wealth or relinquish power. Luis Alvarez, leader of the right-wing party, told me they were "despots." Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, leader of the left-wing party, was much less complimentary.
Mr. Cardenas, in quiet fury, recited a long list of grievances: half the nation, some 40 million, in poverty; the corrupt and secret financial links between the state and the ruling party; police brutality and no real access to the two main TV stations.
All true. The political system needs fundamental reforms. Yet Mexico is now filled with people unafraid and able to damn the Government publicly -- unlike any authoritarian society I have seen -- though it is hard for them to make themselves heard. Opposition leaders now hold offices throughout the country, though not on the national level.
In the novels of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, everything can be true, even mutually contradictory truths -- especially truths unknown.
The intentions of the Salinas group remain murky. Yet they seem to be groping to modernize the nation, help the poor and slowly liberalize politics -- whether willingly or because they feel they have to. Mexico seems to be moving, in its own way, toward a fuller form of democracy, led by the few.

I Am Oz

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
I found it intriguing that Ross Perot described women reporters who prepare rigorously for interviews and ask difficult questions -- what we in the trade call "doing our jobs" -- as "trying to prove their manhood."
I'm intrigued because his manhood is precisely what Mr. Perot has refused to reveal to the American people. 
 I don't mean the sort of manhood that some might find reflected in his collection of military memorabilia or his hobby of sicking investigators on folks who have annoyed him.
Nor am I talking about what we saw last week: a man who left the Presidential race because, he said, he had no wish to be disruptive, who found himself weary of life outside the spotlight and so re-entered the fray. A man who surely knows that the chance of victory is nil and the opportunity to disrupt still considerable.
In fact, maybe "manhood" is not what I'm looking for at all.
Personhood comes closer. Humanity. Who you are.
Mr. Perot likes to say those issues have no place in this race. "We're talking about performance here and not personality," he said when he announced for President, as though the two were mutually exclusive. He's helped in this by a country tired of the cult of personality, the photo op, the Christmas-card portrait.
Mr. Perot took widespread disillusionment with bloated government and inflated image and turned it into an either/or scenario. Either you can be the C.E.O. of the U.S.A. or you can be an official portrait. Not both.
That's just wrong. In certain European nations they have split the roles; they have a prime minister to do the country's business and a king or queen to be the figurehead on the Ship of State. But in America one person must attempt to do both. Personality is a key to character, and character the bedrock of leadership.
Like the displaced carny working the whiz-bangs and gizmos of Oz the Great and Powerful, who bleats from his hiding place "Pay no attention to the man behind that curtain!" Mr. Perot wants to keep who he is separate from his political ambitions. It is obvious why this is so. When the curtain to the Perot character is pulled aside, you find a man who stands in front of a room full of African-Americans and calls them "you people."
You find a man who hired legal pit bull Roy Cohn to sandbag the Vietnam Memorial project because he hated the design. You find a man whose company dismissed an employee for wearing a beard in violation of a corporate ban on facial hair. You find a man who has a penchant for private investigators and vendettas, who is alleged to have undertaken a disinformation campaign against his own daughter's boyfriend.
You find a man who suggests that women reporters who do their jobs the way they are meant to be done are somehow suspect. Talking with Barbara Walters on Friday night, Mr. Perot said that the manhood crack had been distorted. "It has nothing to do with the problems facing the country," he added.
And he's right. It has nothing to do with the deficit or jobs or the national debt; it's a blip on the screen compared with those things. All it shows is a little bit about how Ross Perot deals with being challenged, and a little bit about how he stereotypes women. Those little bits add up. By the end of an election, we've amassed enough of them, like people putting together a jigsaw puzzle, to tell whether we can respect a candidate or not.
Our deep disenchantment is the result not only of the economy, the bureaucracy or the insularity of the Beltway boys. Although we say we've given up on heroes, I bet there are more than a few of us who still yearn for the kind of President we can envision on the front of a nickel or the side of a mountain. Giants. Or, at the very least, good guys.
Mr. Perot is neither, with that grim grin, its friendliness belied by the hard points of his eyes. His candidacy will be rejected because he has become just what he decried, a politician who perpetrated a con job on the people for the sake of his own high opinion of himself -- and then tried to do it again.
But his failure will represent something bigger than that as well, a tacit understanding that while personality cannot rule the race for the White House, it should play some part. Mr. Perot wants to keep personality out of the campaign for his own sake, not for ours. In the shadow of his big talk and big bankroll, his character, when revealed, seems small.

HEADLINE: Voters See What's Behind 'Family Values';
'Disposable Fathers'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Maggie Gallagher gets it backward in "An Unwed Mother for Quayle" (Op-Ed, Sept. 24). The proposition that "fathers are just another new disposable item," a rephrasing of Vice President Quayle's salvo, never made much sense in contemporary American family life. Yes, a few women set out to have children without mates, but they are a small percentage of all single mothers. 
 When fathers are "disposable," it is all too often because they have turned their backs on the children they helped bring into the world. If "single mothers are six times more likely to be poor than married mothers are," it is because men have been allowed to abandon their responsibilities by a society that considers both contraception and parenting woman's work. Scapegoating single mothers obscures the reality that mothers, single or not, still do most of the work of child rearing, and would welcome more paternal participation.
Ms. Gallagher does not tell us whether single parenthood was a choice she now regrets or a role thrust upon her by circumstance. Either way, it is not clear how the Vice President would solve her problems. No government can protect its people against mistakes in their personal lives, and attempts to do so would be incompatible with democracy.
Political solutions to the problems of single mothers include pay equity, child care and strong enforcement of child-support agreements. Reducing the number of unwed mothers would require new economic opportunities for poor young women and men, and a new consciousness about men's responsibility for contraception and parenthood. None of these items have ever been high on the Bush-Quayle agenda.

How States Wiggle Out Of Tax Increases

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
FOR months, Bush and Clinton supporters have been wrangling over how many times the Arkansas Governor raised taxes. Was it 128? Or 43? Was it more or less often than the President? (Who did it just once or 133 times, depending on who's counting.)
Everybody's missing the point.
"Counting the number of tax increases that have been signed into law has nothing to do with whether government is taking a bigger or smaller bite out of peoples' incomes," said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of States in Albany. 
 The best way to tell whether state and local taxes are going up or down is to see whether they are growing or shrinking as a share of the personal income of the state's citizens.
By that yardstick, even though Arkansas has raised its sales tax twice and other taxes several times, the total tax burden for Arkansans is roughly the same today as it was in 1979, when Governor Clinton first took office: $9.17 per $100 in income in 1979 vs. $9.60 in 1990.
The real surprise is that Arkansas is part of a broader national trend. Contrary to what many Americans believe, state and local tax burdens across the country are about the same as they were at the end of the 1970's, even though the Carter, Reagan and Bush Administrations insisted that the states pick up more of the tab for health, education and environmental costs at the same time as Federal aid to the states was shrinking.
The Federal tax burden for the average family, incidentally, is also proportionally the same today as it was at the end of the 1970's -- about 23 percent of income.
The average state and local tax burden for all 50 states was $11.44 per $100 in 1990, the latest year for which Department of Commerce data are available. In 1979, it was $11.37.
 
But Spending Went Up
 In between, the burden edged down as far as $10.59 in 1982, then drifted up again. It dropped during the property tax revolt of the early 1980's that was spurred by California's Proposition 13 in 1978. But it rose again after a round of tax increases, notably in 1984, and the recovery from the 1981-1982 recession.
"It's not at an all-time high," said Jim Poterba, a public finance economist at M.I.T. The all-time high was in 1973, the peak of baby boom school enrollments. State and local taxes reached $12.41 per $100 of income.
However, none of this kept governors and mayors from spending. Expenditures by state and local governments reached nearly a record high by the end of the 1980's.
The result is the state fiscal crises that have erupted since 1989. To cope, some like California and New York ran deficits, and many states have borrowed billions by issuing bonds.
Others have taken money away from things like roads, parks and state universities to pay for things the Federal Government requires them to subsidize, like Medicaid and welfare. That has left middle-class taxpayers, in particular, feeling that they've been robbed.
"Even though tax burdens are lower than in 1973, people feel bad because their tax burdens have gone back up in recent years but they aren't getting more services," said Lawrence F. Katz, an economist at Harvard University. "In the past you got a new school or better sewers."
 
Pressure Still On
 Despite a fresh round of tax increases in 1991, it seems likely that the need to raise taxes, improve government efficiency or shift costs to the private sector will persist.
"It's very clear that there are pressures for higher taxes," said Robert D. Ebel, an economist at the accounting and consulting firm KPMG Peat Marwick in Washington. "On the other hand, the states really have a very strong record of adjusting by restructuring expenditures."
To compensate for the tax revenue that isn't there, most state and local governments have shifted the cost of many public services, especially college tuitions, tolls and trash collection, to consumers. So-called user fees have gone up rapidly, to $2.64 per $100 of income in 1990 from $2.18 in 1979. New York and California have raised tuition at state colleges by more than two thirds since 1987.
To be sure, these are simply another way of taking dollars from citizens' pockets, but they tend to raise less resentment because they produce an immediate return, like a college education. It's more gratifying than just mailing a check to the tax collector.
And, in a pinch, states are papering over deficits by underfunding pensions, spinning off assets or even just not paying bills. New Jersey sold 4.4 miles of interstate highway to its own state turnpike authority for $400 million last year. Illinois ran up over $900 million in unpaid bills.
 
The Tax Menu
 But tracking a state's tax bills is not always the best way to tell how a state is raising its cash. The Federal Government raises most of its money through income and payroll taxes. State and local governments collect those, of course, but an imaginative government goes after just about anything from property taxes to sales taxes, sewer and water taxes, gas taxes, liquor taxes, cigarette taxes, parking taxes, movie seat taxes, mortgage recording taxes, university tuition, bridge tolls, unclaimed nickel-a-bottle deposits and license fees for dogs, drivers and manicurists.
Focusing exclusively on the number of times some of these incremental taxes were raised or lowered, as the sparring sides in the campaign have, is pointless because, as Mr. Gold and other public finance experts explain, most of the rise and fall in tax burdens doesn't result from legislative changes at all but rather from the interaction between the tax system and the economy.
In a state that relies heavily on the income tax, for example, a politician who brags that he's lived up to his "no new taxes" pledge might be guilty of quibbling. As tax rates remain constant, revenues tend to outpace incomes as inflation pushes people into higher brackets anyway.
Conversely, something that looks like a tax increase might, on closer examination, be nothing of the sort. An increase of a few pennies in taxes on cigarettes may not be enough for the tax to keep up with inflation.
"In a 13-year period in which inflation went up 70 percent, counting every nominal change in charges for government services is loony," said Professor Katz.
 
Anti-Tax Arkansas
 One reason Arkansas was the country's third- or fourth-lowest-tax state both before and during the Clinton administration, experts say, is that its constitution requires three-quarters of the state's legislators to vote to raise the income tax.
It's also pretty hard, it turns out, for the Governor of Arkansas to be a big spender. The state has a unique contingency-budgeting process that automatically lowers spending during the fiscal year if revenues fall short of expectations.
For states that are not so constitutionally girded against higher taxes, the constraints may be competitive and psychological.
States can't afford to price themselves out of the market lest businesses and residents move elsewhere and shoppers slip across state lines to make purchases.
And voters have been expressing displeasure with politicians who raised taxes.
"The state and local tax burden rose sharply in the 1960's, but at that time real income was growing fast," said Mr. Gold. "With real income flat or declining, it's much harder for government to take a bigger share of people's income."
Voters tend to blame the Governor and the Mayor, not Washington, when they're getting fewer local services for their rising property taxes. So the real test of state and local governments in the years ahead will almost certainly become how effectively they can spend their scarce dollars.

HEADLINE: The 1992 CAMPAIGN -- Issues: Foreign Policy - Looking Abroad: Clinton
and Foreign Policy/A special report.;
Clinton's Foreign-Policy Agenda Reaches Across Broad Spectrum

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Under the pressure of a Presidential campaign, Gov. Bill Clinton has been trying to outline his own unique foreign policy, while at the same time fending off criticism from the Bush White House that he is a closet dove masquerading as a hawk and that his experience in world affairs is limited to breakfast at the International House of Pancakes.
 Although foreign policy has not been a big issue in this first campaign after the cold war, Mr. Clinton has laid out his internationalist vision in four speeches over the last year, knowing that he cannot pass the Commander in Chief test without appearing credible in this area. 
The Clinton foreign policy is hard to summarize in a single phrase, but it is a blend of idealism and pragmatism, internationalism and protectionism, use of force and reliance on multinational institutions. Mr. Clinton's critics say it is all of these things, because he wants to be all things to all men and has not really made up his mind. He and his aides contend that after the cold war alot of the old divisions in foreign policy, which particularly plagued the Democratic Party, can be bridged and that this is what "Clintonism" is all about.
 Indeed, Mr. Clinton's team of foreign policy advisers is an ideological peacock made up of every wing of the Democratic Party. It is dominated by old hands from the faction of the Carter Administration most averse to using force abroad, but there is also a heavy representation of members of Congress like Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin who are associated with the more conservative wing of the party, as well as neo-conservative Reagan Democrats and a new generation of foreign-policy thinkers who might be called "Clintonites."
 In fact, Mr. Clinton has embraced so many advisers that he relies on no single elder statesman and no single adviser stands out as first among equals. The question of whom he might appoint as Secretary of State or national security adviser is a mystery, even to his closest aides. Mr. Clinton rebuffed repeated requests to be interviewed for this article.
 At the core of Mr. Clinton's thinking is the contention that with the cold war over, American foreign policy needs a whole new focus. For him, that begins with revitalizing the American economy. Without doing that, he argues, the next President will have no chips with which to play abroad and will have no mandate from the American people for engagement abroad, because the public will be obsessed with domestic affairs.
 "In this new era our first foreign priority and our domestic priority are one and the same: reviving our economy," he said in a recent speech in Los Angeles. "This has been the Administration's most glaring foreign policy failure. An anemic, debt-laden economy undermines our diplomacy, makes it harder for us to secure favorable trade agreements and compromises our ability to finance essential military actions.
 "I will elevate economics in foreign policy, create an Economic Security Council, similar to the National Security Council, and change the State Department's culture so that economics is no longer a poor cousin to old-school diplomacy."
 Though he emphasizes the importance of economics in his foreign policy, Mr. Clinton up to now has avoided coming out either for or against the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, for fear of alienating union voters. Aides say he has finally decided to support the trade accord, but wants to couple any endorsement with a proposal for legislation that will retrain American workers who lose jobs.
 
Some Call It Waffling
 "Waffling is too kind to describe his position" on the agreement, said Peter Rodman, a former member of the Bush National Security Council.
 Mr. Clinton has argued that he will also diverge from the Bush Administration in two other fundamental areas. One is the question of values, where he says he would assign a much greater weight than Mr. Bush to promoting democracy abroad, rather than settling for stability based on authoritarian governments that repress human rights. In that vein, for instance, he has said he would support the use of selective trade sanctions against China to get that country to ease its repression of human rights.
 As Mr. Clinton put it in a speech in Milwaukee this week, "I believe our nation has a higher purpose than to coddle dictators and stand aside from the global movement toward democracy." Mr. Bush's aides counter that the President helped to foster the rise of democratic governments from Nicaragua to Poland, and that extrapolating from his less-than-successful China case is wildly unfair.
 Mr. Clinton also declared, long before the Bush Administration was ready to consider military action, that the United States should be prepared to join with a multinational coalition to "shoot its way into" the Sarajevo airport to make it safe for a relief airlift if necessary. He said the United States should "take the lead in seeking U.N. Security Council authorization for air strikes against those who are attacking the relief effort." Bigger Saving on Arms
 The second area where he says he would differ from the Bush Administration is military strategy. Mr. Clinton has proposed a five-year plan that would reorganize American forces in a way that he contends would save $60 billion more than the Bush plan would through 1997. He would shift money away from the full-scale, space-based "Star Wars" program and focus on a more limited, ground-based anti-missile plan. And he would reduce the forces on the old Soviet front in Europe to 100,000 troops from 150,000, emphasizing instead smaller, more mobile forces to meet regional threats elsewhere.
But would Mr. Clinton, once in office, act on these stated views?
 "It is impossible to predict," said Michael R. Beschloss, a historian of American foreign policy. "With any political leader, and especially a President, what they do in foreign policy is made up of two things: one is past experience and general philosophy, and the other is the pressure of events. In the case of Clinton, the past experience is severely limited. As far as the press of events, with the cold war now over, our ability to predict the foreign policy challenges of the next President are as unpredictable as at any time in 50 years."
 As a man who has spent his entire career in state government in Arkansas, Mr. Clinton has no foreign policy record to run on or be judged against. Therefore, critics say, he has had the luxury of defining himself purely through a series of speeches. None of his ideas have had to meet the test of the real world.
 For instance, while Mr. Clinton has supported the use of force to bring aid to Bosnia under United Nations supervision, what would he do if the United Nations or the allies were not ready to cooperate? Would he go it alone? What if American troops got shot at or bogged down in Sarajevo?
 Mr. Clinton now says he supported the use of force against Iraq in the Persian Gulf war. But in the weeks before Congress was scheduled to vote on a use of force resolution in January 1991, a group of hawkish Democrats approached Mr. Clinton about signing a full-page ad that would run in various newspapers around the country urging Congress to back the President. Mr. Clinton told them that he would consider it and get back to them. He never did.
 Later, after the vote, Mr. Clinton said: "I guess I would have voted with the majority if it was a close vote. But I agree with the arguments the minority made." The statement does not seem to indicate with any certainty how he would have acted in the Oval Office.
 "Some of the things that he is saying are the right things, but let's look at the record," Mr. Rodman said. "The gulf war was the biggest national security issue in a decade and he totally muffed it. What it tells you is that there is a lot of the standard liberal weakness underneath all the posturing about being in the center of his party."
 
His Instincts

 Background Clues To Future Policies
 In some ways, the better question to ask is not what is in Mr. Clinton's speeches, but what sort of long-held instincts would he bring to the foreign policy task if elected?
 By his own admission, Mr. Clinton is not a man who has thought as long and hard about the nation's imperial role, as he had about the challenges of welfare or health care reform. And his insecurity shows up in his speeches by the way he repeatedly invokes the names of others to make a point, as if his own word is not good enough. His speeches are laced with: "As Admiral William Crowe says" or "As Senator Sam Nunn says" or " As Senator Al Gore says."
Mr. Clinton's personal attitudes on foreign policy seem to be a combination of instinctive and acquired tastes. If World War II was the defining moment in the formation of George Bush's instincts on foreign policy, going through the Vietnam War while a student at Oxford University in England, was the parallel defining moment for Bill Clinton.
 He rubbed shoulders at Oxford with students from all over the world and traveled extensively around Europe during vacations, and when he returned home from Oxford, he served as George McGovern's campaign director in Texas in 1972. These experiences, say friends, seem to have shaped him into what might best be called a sober internationalist.
 As one old friend from the Oxford days put it: "His world view is shaped by Vietnam. Underneath the internationalism is a lot of caution. You don't want to get involved in foreign problems unless there is a direct American interest, or unless there is such a horror, like Nazi Germany, going on that it could easily begin to affect the rest of the world."
 But Mr. Clinton is no starry-eyed moralist either, says Samuel Berger, his old Yale Law School classmate and now a foreign-policy adviser. He knows the history of the world is not the history of arms control. He grew up in the deep South, where it was never fashionable to see America as the source of all evil in the world. And, according to Mr. Berger, he never bought into the isolationist, Come-Home-America, shun-the-use-of-force ethos that came to symbolize McGovernism in subsequent years.
 
Opposition to Vietnam War
 "What brought us to the McGovern campaign was opposition to the Vietnam War -- period," Mr. Berger said.
 Mr. Clinton's instinctive internationalist outlook seems to have been reinforced by his political experiences, in two ways. First, as a governor of a small state heavily dependent on foreign trade in both agriculture and manufactured products, he learned on the job that what happens inside nations is often much more important than what happens between nations. His foreign policy travels as Governor consisted of three trade missions to Japan, Taiwan and other East Asian nations, two to Western Europe and one to the Soviet Union.
 Second, Mr. Clinton had the unpleasant experience of watching every Democratic Presidential candidate in his adult life, save for Mr. Carter, be defeated in national elections in large part because they were perceived to be unwilling to use force to confront the Soviets in various regions around the globe and because they were too willing to cut the military budget.
 With his eye on the Presidency, Mr. Clinton, one aide said, calculated that to "pass the Commander in Chief threshold test" he had to make clear that he viewed the use of force as a normal part of foreign policy. As such, he gravitated to the more muscular foreign policy articulated by the Democratic Leadership Council, the group of moderate Democrats who banded together in 1985 to move their party back from the left to the center in all fields.
 Which brings to mind another of Mr. Clinton's instincts that seem relevant to foreign policy: He is a skilled political animal, which can be an asset and a liability in a statesman. It could be a liability in that Mr. Clinton has repeatedly demonstrated a tendency to try to be all things to all people, and to avoid clear-cut decisions that could alienate constituencies. Such waffling in foreign policy can be deadly, literally.
 But as Franklin Roosevelt, another untested state governor who became a consummate player of the game of nations demonstrated, political skills are the greatest asset any President can bring to the job of foreign policy, which is primarily a matter of politics, deal making, consensus building and getting opposing factions all to buy into a single decision.
 Will Marshall, one of the founders of the Democratic Leadership Council and a Clinton speech writer, asserts that the next President will have to spend more time than any in 50 years justifying foreign policy, fighting off isolationist instincts and persuading Congress to spend money on foreign endeavors, "and that is something for which Mr. Clinton will be very well suited."
 
His Advisers

 Former Opponents Narrow Differences
 At a recent briefing at the National Press Club in Washington, a team of foreign policy advisers to the Clinton campaign answered questions from foreign reporters when a Panamanian journalist asked: "What would be the Carter -- excuse me, the Clinton Administration policy?"
 Mr. Berger, who was moderating the panel, quickly responded to the reporter's slip, saying, "A very important correction!"
 But also a very revealing slip, for many of the advisers to the Clinton campaign, both formal and informal, seem to be veterans of the dovish, Cyrus Vance wing of the Carter Administration, who have been out of office for 12 years. Mr. Berger, Anthony Lake, who headed the State Department Policy Planning staff for Mr. Carter, and Warren Christopher, who was Deputy Secretary of State for Mr. Carter, are among the most prominent.
 Another important group, though, are the new generation of Democratic foreign-policy thinkers like Mr. Marshall and Michael Mandelbaum, a professor of foreign affairs at Johns Hopkins University, as well as members of the Senate and the House, who found that as Democrats the only way to get foreign-policy experience in the last decade was by getting elected to Congress.
 
Many Sources of Advice
 Mr. Clinton consults regularly with Representative Aspin, who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and supported the use of force against Iraq, as well as two other Democratic hawks, Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, who heads the House Intelligence Committee, and Representative Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn. But he draws equally heavily on Senator Nunn, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who opposed the use of force and Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana, who is slated to be the next chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
 A fourth group, though is emerging: neo-conservative Reagan Democrats, a hawkish faction that split off from the party's liberal majority after Vietnam and remained split on issues from Nicaragua to detente with Moscow. This hawkish group, who were at odds with the Carterites and frozen out of that Administration, includes the likes of Richard Schifter, former Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights in the Bush Administration, Josh Muravchik of the American Enterprise Institute, and Penn Kemble, a senior associate at Freedom House, a human-rights group.
 On July 21, Representative McCurdy organized a lunch between the Reagan Democrats and the Carterites to bury the hatchet once and for all. "It was an opportunity for people to begin to build bridges," Mr. McCurdy said. "People just reintroduced themselves."
 
Producing Accommodations
 Since then the neo-conservatives have been consulted on Mr. Clinton's foreign-policy speeches. The philosophical basis of the reconciliation, one of the neo-conservative advisers said, was that with the end of the cold war, the Carterites are now much more willing to contemplate the use of force, because there is no longer the risk that it will lead to a global confrontation, and the neo-conservatives are much more willing to pursue a human rights and pro-democracy agenda abroad, because they no longer fear it will destabilize allies needed to confront the Soviet Union.
 "There is an agreement," said Mr. Lake, Mr. Clinton's longest-serving foreign affairs adviser. "American foreign policy now has to be based on being prepared to meet the likely military threats of the 90's, not fighting the wars of the 1970's; on promoting Democracy in practical ways, and on rebuilding our domestic economy to remain engaged abroad. If you sat in on some of our debates on Bosnia you would not have been able to determine who were once perceived as hawks and who were once perceived as doves."
 But for how long? All of these different advisers can coexist around Mr. Clinton not only because philosophical differences have eased, but also because in the absence of any serious foreign-policy debate, Mr. Clinton has not really had to choose between them, or between their nuances of difference that remain just beneath the surface.
 
A Clinton List?
 The names most often mentioned for Mr. Clinton's Secretary of State have been Mr. Christopher and Mr. Hamilton, and more recently Senator Nunn and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. But those close to the candidate insist that this list is a media invention. Mr. Berger said: "There is no list. I have never heard Clinton talk about it. Does he have some ideas? Possibly. Has he thought through fully who exactly he would want in these positions? I doubt it."
 Some Democrats, and even Clinton advisers, fear that because he is insecure about his foreign-policy expertise, and because he intends to focus primarily on domestic affairs, Mr. Clinton will choose safe establishment types to run his State Department and National Security Council.
 "My main concern about the Clinton foreign policy, is that while he is rightly confident about his abilities in domestic affairs, he seems less confident about foreign policy," said Michael J. Sandel, a political theorist at Harvard University. "There is a risk, therefore, that he will embrace the conventional wisdom in foreign policy of the old Democratic Party establishment."
 This would be a mistake, Mr. Sandel said, because America's role in the world at the end of the cold war is badly in need of imaginative redefinition, and that is not usually the forte of the foreign-policy or diplomatic establishments.

HEADLINE: Tempers Grow Short As Congress Lurches To End of Its Session

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3 --

 BODY:
The 102d Congress lurched toward adjournment tonight, arguing over taxes and energy policy in private and debating abortion, fetal-tissue research and patriotism in public, often in rancorous tones.
 After a long day of closed-door talks, Senate negotiators announced in late evening that they had tentatively agreed with their House counterparts on a tax bill that would establish enterprise zones for depressed neighborhoods. House negotiators continued to meet on the proposal after the Senate had quit for the night. 
The tentative compromise would eliminate Senate provisions increasing the taxes paid by those in upper-income brackets that President Bush has said he would veto. To make up for the loss of revenue, the agreement would scale back a proposal to expand the availability of individual retirement accounts.
 Lawmakers warned that the deal was not final, and it remained unclear whether President Bush would sign the bill if Congress passed it, since it contains many tax increases.
 "Considering what he has laid out during the campaign as to what he will and won't do, it's going to be very difficult for him to sign the tax bill," Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, the ranking minority member of the House Ways and Means Committee, said of Mr. Bush.
 Lawmakers also planned to put finishing touches on a House-Senate energy compromise that would encourage the use of alternative-fuel vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.
 The most important bill passed today was a compromise version of the Freedom Support Act, marking the end of the cold war by authorizing $1.4 billion in aid to Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet republics. The measure was sent to President Bush on a 232-to-164 House vote.
 Otherwise, the legislation actually voted on today was largely either uncontroversial or symbolic. For example, the House voted 363 to 47 to adopt a $245.7 billion appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Education, and Housing and Urban Development, and it voted 312 to 97 in favor of greater authority for the President to rescind appropriations next year -- a bill it knows the Senate will not consider.
 But as time drew short before a hoped-for Monday-night adjournment, so did tempers. Representative Les AuCoin, an Oregon Democrat, was rebuked by an ally on an abortion bill. Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, said Mr. AuCoin demeaned his own arguments when he repeatedly called the President "George Herbert Hoover Bush." Mr. AuCoin said it was "a slip of the tongue."
 Time was a crucial factor on one issue after another. The delay in getting the energy measure in final form added to the bill's problems. Opponents planned to try to delay it as long as they could in the Senate, hoping their colleagues' desire to go home would either win them changes or kill the bill.
 But nowhere was time more of an issue than on legislation that was intended to ease the way for using the tissue of aborted fetuses for federally financed research into Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and diabetes.
 After legislation reversing an Administration ban on such research was successfully vetoed by President Bush, he announced the creation of a tissue bank to use tissue from miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies, but not from voluntary abortions. That was opposed by lawmakers who said the bank would not produce enough tissue.
 Since Friday morning, the Senate has been tied up by opponents of a new version of the bill, sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. His bill would try the Administration's approach, but would allow researchers to use tissue from voluntary abortions after March 1994 if the tissue bank proved insufficient.
 Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican, proposed giving the Administration approach a longer trial to insure a fair test, allowing voluntarily aborted tissue to be used only after Jan. 1, 1995.
 Only 12 senators stood firm against any change at all, so Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kennedy and their party leaders, Senators Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, and George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, spent much of Friday afternoon and evening negotiating, trying to reach a compromise that Mr. Hatch said he would urge President Bush to accept.
 But negotiations broke down after other conservatives rallied on the Senate floor during a lengthy quorum call. Senator Bob Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, and several aides of other conservative senators, huddled for more than an hour. They were joined, remarkably, by two House conservatives, Representatives William E. Dannemeyer and Robert K. Dornan, both Republicans of California, who feared that if the Senate passed any version of the bill, it would be quickly adopted in the House.
 Senator Hatch said it was Mr. Kennedy's fault that no agreement had been reached.
 But Mr. Kennedy, in an angry floor speech, said "blind extremists" were thwarting the Senate's will. Of the sudden conservative meeting, he said, "It was as though the worst of the Houston Republican convention had arrived to bar the research door and defeat any possible compromise and keep the filibuster going."
 If the opponents remain adamant, they could block until Tuesday a final Senate vote on the bill, which would also direct the National Institutes of Health to expand research into women's health issues. That would delay action on the tax and energy bills, and no one expects Mr. Mitchell to continue the fight for this bill that long.
 The angry words did not all come from Democrats, who have been defeated again and again this week by Republican stalling tactics. Mr. Dornan continued his daily regimen of severe attacks on Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic Presidential nominee. Today he said that the effort to include women in all aspects of the armed services would send the candidate's daughter, Chelsea, "into the combat her father avoided."
 And Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, threatened to filibuster the tax bill if, as he had heard, it omits a provision designed to help the Smith Corona typewriter manufacturers in Cortland, N.Y., deal with Japanese competition. Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, said the provision Mr. D'Amato defended would hurt companies in New Jersey and Tennessee.
 The energy measure seeks to promote conservation and alternative energy sources but would do little to reduce the country's dependency on foreign oil. It would encourage the use of automobiles powered by natural gas or methane and provide lower mortgage rates on better insulated homes. It would also streamline the rules for licensing nuclear plants.

HEADLINE: Shedding Some Light On Course of Recession

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN

 BODY:
THE patient is sick and the prognosis for a quick recovery is not good. That was the assessment of the economic health of the New York City region that Rosemary Scanlon, the chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, gave to 125 Westchester business leaders at the seventh yearly fall economic symposium late last month at the Westchester Marriott Hotel here.
"On the regional level, this is the strongest, deepest recession we have experienced since World War II -- of two years and three months' duration in Westchester," Ms. Scanlon said. "To date, 700,000 jobs have been lost in the metropolitan area. The only section of the country that is worse off than we are is New England." 
 What's more, Ms. Scanlon continued, the plight of the region has been aggravated by unrealized expectations.
"We were expecting to see signs of recovery in 1992, but it hasn't happened," she said. "We are exactly at the same point as we were a year ago. And there has been no lift at the national level to help. Even though interest rates are low, the money supply is slow, and there have been no sales-tax revenue gains in our area, which shows that retail sales haven't picked up either."
 
More Capital Programs Urged
 In order to see the economy rebound from the long, painful, dangerous recession, she said, not only is more lift from the national economy needed but state and local governments also have to move on capital programs and get started on public-works projects.
"On the positive side, we're seeing the beginning of a turnaround on Wall Street," she said. "Corporate profits are staying up, which gives a boost to lending in leading industries and should account for some employment gains. Low interest rates and the dollar exchange rates are good for long-term business investments, but Manhattan has to turn around first, then Westchester will benefit from the spillover in activity."
Saying that there is more vacant office space in the region than anywhere else in the country, Ms. Scanlon added:
"Maybe we should think now how to use space differently. We should also be asking ourselves if we have enough support systems such as infrastructure and housing for the amount of office space we have. The answer is, no, we don't, which means that we should be investing heavily right now in public works such as transportation systems."
The symposium, sponsored by the Westchester County Association and the Westchester County Bankers Association, was co-sponsored by the Westchester Business Partnership and the Westchester chapter of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants.
 
Four Executives on Panel
 Westchester's role in the regional and global economies was examined by a panel of executives from four Westchester companies.
Paul E. Konney, senior vice president of Tamprands, the newest Fortune 500 company in the county, described the tampon manufacturer's move to White Plains from Long Island. "The headquarters office lease for the former AMS Building was the largest in 1990," he said. "The key to our move was accessibility to New York City. We were also attracted by the hospitable business environment in Westchester and the real estate stock here, also the transportation system, which is better than Long Island's."
Although Tamprands is national in scope, with 45 percent of sales outside the United States, Mr. Konney said that the company employs 150 people in Westchester and has brought substantial new tax revenues into the county.
Frank J. Fee 3d, the third member of his family to head his family's business, the Reliable Automatic Sprinkler Company in Mount Vernon, said the company is one of the few in Westchester that still makes products. Mr. Fee noted that the manufacturing base in Westchester has steadily deteriorated.
 
'Our Strength Lies in Mount Vernon'
 "We have been in Mount Vernon since 1937, Mr. Fee said, "and we employ 499 people there, 250 of them as hourly workers. Our strength lies in Mount Vernon where we have access to a labor force that can't be duplicated anywhere else in the county. For the 75 years our company has been in business, one immigrant group of workers has replaced another on the factory floor."
Nynex, with 6,500 employees, is one of the largest employers in the region, said Jeffrey S. Rubin, Nynex chief financial officer, another panel member. Some new jobs have opened up in parts of Nynex's operations, Mr. Rubin said, adding that employment opportunities there would remain flat for both the near and the far term.
Although the panelists were not optimistic about the prospect for economic recovery soon, none were as pessimistic as former Lieut. Gov. Alfred B. DelBello. In decrying the practice of wooing companies from other areas and inducing local companies to remain in Westchester as a solution to economic problems, Mr. DelBello said, "What we're doing is cannibalizing ourselves." A more effective method, he said, would be for leaders in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut area to work together for economic development for the entire region on such projects as airport planning, cleanup of Long Island Sound, transportation systems and waste disposal.
Mr. DelBello also suggested that Westchester join with Long Island and New York City to demand state assistance programs for service industries.
 
Small-Business Loans Endorsed
 "We must make ourselves a political force," he said. "All the state incentive programs are geared to manufacturing in other areas of the state. We have a service-based economy in Westchester, and we need help. If we're going to keep business in the county, we need programs for service industries."
Citing Erie County, Mr. DelBello said, "They are doing good up there, thanks to the dollars the State of New York has poured in to keep their manufacturing base from eroding."
When asked how banks could aid the economy's recovery, Derrick D. Cephas, the State Superintendent of Banking, acknowledged that recovery efforts would be speeded up if banks made more business loans to small businesses.
"We believe there is a shortage in the availability of small-business loans," Mr. Cephas said. "There are several reasons for it. The loans tend to be costly to originate, costly to administer and inherently risky. But we believe a consortium of banks sharing the risk, capitalized by the banks and professionally staffed and managed could engage in small-business lending on behalf of member banks and would substantially increase the availability of credit to small businesses. And this is something we are working on now."

HEADLINE: Overcoming a Linguistic 'Glass Ceiling'

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

DATELINE: VALHALLA

 BODY:
IN order to stimulate conversation in her English as a Second Language class at Westchester Community College here, Esperanza Cano, an assistant professor, brought in a box of various household items last week for the class to discuss. One of them was a whistle.
"Who can tell me what this is used for?" she asked.
A student from Nicaragua was the first to answer. "The police use it to call the people," he said. 
 Professor Cano wrote the word on the board. There ensued a troubling discussion about the silent H and the silent T in the word. Ms. Cano acknowledged that English was a difficult language to learn. "Crazy, too," offered one member of the class.
The teacher then pulled a sponge out of the box; its use was easily recognized. "For wash the dishes," said several students, a number of whom work in restaurants. This was followed by a rubber band. "To tie the money?" suggested a student from Colombia.
Scotch tape was familiar to most of the class, though Ms. Cano said that Scotch was not the name of the item but the company that manufactured it. This led to a discussion of the tape dispenser's plaid design, characteristic of tartans. A student from Peru asked if the same company made Scotch whisky.
 
An All-Day Saturday Class
 And so it went, as the class practiced conversation, pronunciation and grammar from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M., with a 45-minute lunch break. Ms. Cano's weekly Saturday class is a Level 3 course, for a mid-level understanding of English. The college divides classes into seven levels.
The profile of students in Ms. Cano's class is similar to that of students who study English at the college: the majority of them are of Hispanic background, with some from other nations. Her 15 students are from Peru, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Paraguay, Ecuador, Colombia, Nicaragua, Zaire and Switzerland. Three native tongues are spoken: Spanish, French and German. ("Actually it's Swiss German," said the student from Switzerland. "Germans don't understand Swiss German.")
Registration figures for English as a Second Language at the community college also mirror the Hispanic majority of immigrants in Westchester. Of the 467 students enrolled in the noncredit program, 285 use Spanish as their native tongue. This semester, a total of 49 countries are represented on the campus and 22 native tongues are spoken.
According to administrators, many students -- particularly those from Latin America -- come to the United States to make money and hope to return to their own countries to pursue better jobs because they will be able to work in the tourist industry.
Many studying at the college were professionals in their own countries but are forced to resort to menial work here because of limited English. Immigrants must contend with a sort of linguistic "glass ceiling" until they can overcome the language barrier. But they face a dilemma, because the type of work they can find is low paying.
Fernando Vasquez, 31, had been wanting to study English since he came to this country from Colombia eight years ago. But this is the first year he was able to do so. "The first few years I needed to collect money to bring my family here," Mr. Vasquez said. He lives in Port Chester and works as a busboy in a restaurant but said he wants to pursue a career in electronic engineering, a field he studied in Colombia.
 

Many Are Well Educated
David C. Bernstein, the administrator of the English as a Second Language program, said many students are well educated before they arrive in the United States. "There are many cases of people coming with degrees in accounting, engineering, sometimes medicine or a degree in law from the country they come from," Mr. Bernstein said. "But they don't know the language and they don't know the system and they don't see how they can work in their field without English."
Some students have also had their studies disrupted in their own countries because of political and economic turmoil. Mr. Bernstein said students from countries like Peru and Colombia come with little faith in the stability of their native country.
In Ms. Cano's class, some students had arrived as recently as seven weeks ago, while others had been here years before starting formal study.
 
Easy to Get By on Spanish
 Ironically, the large influx of Hispanic immigrants has resulted in making the study of English particularly problematic for Spanish speakers, because many speak Spanish at home with their families as well as with their co-workers, many of whom are also from Latin American countries.
"For Spanish speakers in many of the neighborhoods in Westchester it can be very hard to learn English because you can speak only Spanish and survive perfectly well," Mr. Bernstein said. "They live at home with people who speak Spanish, they shop at stores where people speak Spanish -- there are five newspapers, two television stations and several radio stations in Spanish. But there's still a tremendous motivation."
Ms. Cano said she is aware of the realities of her students' lives. Before she started to give a homework assignment, she first asked if it would be possible for everyone in the class to complete it.
Ms. Cano explained that it was not uncommon for students to be juggling two or three jobs, family obligations and school and that some students literally did not have any spare time for extra work. Students sometimes are worn out by the end of the six-hour class.
"It's amazing that they have as much energy as they do," Ms. Cano said. "They work very hard all week, and they still want to learn the language. I had a student last year from Turkey who was working 18 hours a day in a gas station, saving money for his family. But he never missed a class," she said.
Ms. Cano's students are committed. Maria Dias, who was a schoolteacher in Brazil, said that it might be difficult to do assignments because she cleans houses by day and baby-sits at night. Nonetheless, Ms. Dias said she would find the time.
"Everything I love here," Ms. Dias said. "I love English. I want to learn more; I bring my dictionary everywhere I go. I wanted to come here for a long time."
Gustavo Jacquet, who came from Paraguay six years ago, is working as a chauffeur for an executive. Since he has been here, Mr. Jacquet has worked as a groundskeeper at a country club, a dishwasher and a cook.
"For me, to learn English is a dream. Anywhere you want to go, you have to speak English -- Russia, Japan, anywhere," he said.
 
Culture Shock Every Day
 Almost all the students acknowledged that they missed the families they had left at home. Holidays can be sad times, and America often seems strange and different.
"They experience culture shock every day," Mr. Bernstein said. "As comfortable as life can be here, even for the immigrant, it's tough. It's true even if they're coming from a country like El Salvador where they were literally in fear of their lives. They come here, and they don't have to worry about that, at least. But they are still strangers in a strange land."
Mr. Bernstein said that class members tend to bond with one another and that it takes only the slightest suggestion to get people interested in a class party. Many class members continue to see each other socially, long after the semester is over.
At the lunch break, Ms. Cano's class discussed students' future plans. Johnny Fernandez said he wants to return to his native Mexico and hopes to use his English to get a job in a hotel.
 
Feeling at Home
 "Most of my time I spend listening to music," Mr. Fernandez said. "My favorite singer is Jim Morrison. Also I like the Cream, the Byrds, the Yardbirds and Sly and the Family Stone. In Mexico, they play a lot of American music on the radio. I said, one day, when I get there, I'm going to have all that music just for me."
Luz Para, who cleans houses, will soon bring her 14-month baby over from Colombia, where he is being cared for by her mother.
"When Matthew is going to school, I want to help him with homework and talk to his teacher," Ms. Para said. "I want more education. I want a better job. If I don't learn English, I can't do it."
And Mr. Vasquez is getting married. After the wedding next June, he said he plans to move to Georgia, where his fiancee works. "There's no Hispanic people down there. Now I really got to learn English," he said.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Amid Los Angeles's Ruins, An Opportunity

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
As Cathy A. Rodgers, an I.B.M. executive, was being driven last month around sections of Los Angeles burned out by rioting, she became irritated because she was sure she was not being shown the most devastated areas.
"I have a background in disaster preparedness, so I've seen the extremes of natural disasters," she said. "But I need to know the spectrum and size of the problem." 
 When she finally saw the worst areas of the April violence up close, "it was a little frightening," she said. "But I viewed it as a great opportunity."
Ms. Rodgers, western region procurement manager for the International Business Machines Corporation, helped to devise the computer giant's five-year $31 million plan toward redeveloping the city, which was announced last week. The plan is part of the Rebuild L.A. effort being led by Peter V. Ueberroth. Like other corporations, I.B.M. has pledged to increase contracts with minority-owned suppliers in the inner city and to donate equipment and services to job training centers.
But Ms. Rodgers, 37 years old, takes particular pride in an innovative feature of the I.B.M. plan: a mentor program to coach mom-and-pop business owners on just how to get contracts with I.B.M. She said the plan's twin goals were to develop a broader supplier base for I.B.M. and to help inner-city businesses become more competitive and grow.
By next year, about a dozen I.B.M. procurement employees will become mentors in Los Angeles. Initially, the corporation will sponsor business fairs and an outreach program to identify potential suppliers. Then, mentors will match supplier services with I.B.M.'s needs and work with individual companies to improve their business practices.
Ms. Rodgers said I.B.M. was already considering a mentor program for suppliers before the riots. The unrest made the need for such a program more apparent.
"It's not a grant or a gift or a donation," she said. "It's a commitment. It's not something you put in an envelope. It's something you hand carry."
Ms. Rodgers, a former junior-college teacher, joined I.B.M. as a disaster preparedness safety engineer in 1978.
With no procurement background, last year she accepted her present job in San Jose. She now oversees office supplies, furniture and construction services for I.B.M. offices in 13 states and Guam. She said her management style was to encourage and motivate her staff to take good risks and to lead by example.

HEADLINE: This Old House, It Gets Help . . . Selling

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WHEN the State Department of Transportation needed to get rid of a 1700's center-chimney Cape-style house on Barnes Road in Wallingford, it got its best response not from real estate classifieds or legal notices, but from a free listing in a one-page newsletter.
The newsletter, the Historic Properties Exchange, was responsible for about 8 of the 15 calls that came in, said Philip J. Melchionne, a fiscal administrative officer with the department. 
 Mr. Melchionne said the state has put the sale on hold for now because the highway project was not proceeding, but his office's first experience with the Exchange, a bimonthly listing of five to eight endangered historic properties, impressed him.
"We plan to use them again because it created so much interest," Mr. Melchionne said.
Another property on the list last month was the 19th-century home of the sculptor Chauncey Bradley Ives whose representations of Connecticut's signers of the Declaration of Independence are in Statuary Hall in the Capitol in Washington.
"The buildings don't have to be pedigreed to be on the list, but they do have to have some historic integrity," said Mary W. Neustadter, director of real estate services at the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, which publishes the Exchange in Hartford. "If we put on any property that came along we'd have 10 pages every month."
The Exchange has a circulation of 3,000 to 5,000, with subscribers nationwide, largely architects, real estate brokers and developers. For many of the properties listed it is their last chance before demolition, Ms. Neustadter said.
The Trust keeps no statistics on how many of the properties listed are eventually sold, since it serves merely as a bulletin board and hears back from owners only occasionally. But Ms. Neustadter said the Exchange offered owners of old buildings an opportunity to reach Trust members and others who were serious about preservation.
"Not everyone likes old houses, but there are enough people who do so that they retain their value very well," Ms. Neustadter said. "The people who do love old buildings, they're wonderfully fanatic about it."
The Exchange was created three years ago, when the real estate market was collapsing. Nevertheless, it has seen several successes. When St. Luke's Episcopal Church needed to remove an old house to make way for a modern social-services building, it found a buyer through the Exchange. In another case, a developer in Granby purchased property and wanted the original farmhouse moved or demolished, but there was so much interest after the farmhouse was listed in the Exchange that the developer renovated it himself.
 
Costs Borne by Architects
 But all listings are not successful, said Christopher Wigren, a project manager with the Trust. An old house in Meriden was advertised but months went by without any interest, and finally it burned to the ground.
"That's one of the saddest cases," Mr. Wigren said. "We tend to get buildings that no one cares about to begin with. Some of them are sitting empty and uncared for for a year or more after they're listed. We try to make sure everything we list is a reasonable prospect for renovation."
Ms. Neustadter said the bills for publishing the Exchange, between $2,000 and $5,000 a year, are paid for by Cesar Pelli and Associates, an architectural firm in New Haven.
"The firm values this sort of preservation and the importance of historic buildings in our cities and towns," said Jack A. Gold, a spokesman for Mr. Pelli.
Mr. Gold said Mr. Pelli had been involved with the renovation of the Masonic Temple in Waterbury for the Mattatuck Museum, as well as designing a 60-story tower to complement Carnegie Hall in New York.
"The firm is always very conscious of historic issues, and the need to design with history in mind," Mr. Gold said. "Something like the Exchange, it gets realtors and municipal officials and other people who might not usually be aware of preservation at least thinking about it."
 
$2 Million Buys City Hall
 Among the offerings in a recent issue are the circa-1904 former City Hall in Norwalk ($2 million), the 1806 Jared Ives House in Hamden ($135,000), the 1855 Palladium Building on Orange Street in New Haven ($577,500), and the Lincoln School, a turn-of-the-century Gothic Revival building and oldest schoolhouse in New Haven (no asking price listed).
For many real estate agents the Exchange represents a last-ditch effort, to reach out to members of the Trust who might be most interested in preserving the properties. But even that is often not enough, given the economy, they say.
Robert Katz of Katz Realty represents Norwalk in the sale of the old City Hall. With 16,911 square feet on two floors, a basement and parking for 70 cars, all within walking distance of the SoNo Historic District and the Maritime Center, it would seem to be an attractive property. But Mr. Katz said there has not been any interest generated by any listings.
"You don't have too many buyers when the banks won't write mortgages to buy the properties or fix them up," Mr. Katz said. "When credit starts to loosen up maybe some of these properties will move."
John H. Kennedy, owner of the Kennedy Agency in New Haven, who represents the Jared Ives House, where the neoclassical sculptor Chauncey Bradley Ives was born, said even in a good economy it might be difficult to find a buyer since the house has been boarded up for four years.
 
'Wrong Timing, Wrong Market'
 "It's not what I would call habitable," Mr. Kennedy said. "It's the wrong timing, the wrong market, for this kind of thing. Five years ago, now -- then it would have sold in a week or two."
Charles Shafer of Southport, owner of a restoration contracting company that bears his name and a regular reader of the Exchange, agrees that a lot of people turn away from houses that need a lot of work.
"Most people these days are looking for a house that's in really fine condition," Mr. Shafer said. He attributed that to the economy, which has created a buyer's market.
But Mr. Shafer said interest in renovating old homes remains high, and many of his clients believe that buying an old house and renovating it is cheaper than buying a fully restored house.
Ms. Neustadter said she has seen another effect of the economy on the market for old houses.
"What's interesting is the type of property we're getting now -- the large houses, foreclosed on, that are difficult to re-use ," she said, explaining that such large old houses are typically in neighborhoods of single-family houses, but that these are too large to be used by one family these days.
Sometimes the listings demonstrate cultural changes, Ms. Neustadter said. One of the first issues listed three small shops that had to be moved from Main Street in Torrington, to make way for a large retail complex.
"It was really kind of a statement about how Main Streets have changed," Ms. Neustadter said. "You really don't see those small, mom-and-pop single-use buildings anymore."
In some cases the Trust is aware that the old houses will end up being renovated for offices or shops and lose much of their historical integrity in the process. But the Exchange sets no conditions on the sales to get the listing, Ms. Neustadter said.
"We'd rather see it used in some fashion than torn down," Ms. Neustadter said. "You can't always have things the way you want them."

THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE
By Edward O. Wilson.
Illustrated. 424 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
The Belknap Press/
Harvard University Press. $29.95. 
 IN the Beatles cartoon "Yellow Submarine," there is a creature called the Vacuum Cleaner Monster, which sucks up everything in sight until it is the only thing left, and then it sucks itself up too. In the biological realm, this is a difficult trick to pull off. Most species that start destroying their own habitat simply manage to reduce their food supply, and so shrink in number before they can do further damage. The only species with real destructive powers are those whose adaptability and varied appetites allow them to switch to new food sources when they have exhausted old ones. Our planet does, however, house one species that takes adaptability and varied appetites to perilous extremes.
The central message of Edward O. Wilson's stirring new book, "The Diversity of Life," is that Homo sapiens is in imminent danger of precipitating a biological disaster to rival anything in evolutionary history. Mr. Wilson, the Frank B. Baird Jr. Professor of Science and the curator of entomology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, is the doyen of American biology. Two decades ago he popularized the term "sociobiology," and generated a small industry of speculation about the biological basis of human nature. In this book he stops asking what biology does to humans, and asks instead what we humans are doing to biology.
The focus of his book is the extinction of species. As Mr. Wilson observes, other kinds of environmental damage can in principle be repaired, but a defunct species is gone forever. Not that the destruction of animal species by humans is a new phenomenon. For those who still believe there was a golden age of ecological harmony before our technological fall, Mr. Wilson produces strong evidence that prehistoric tribes killed off the mammoths, the moas and many other large animals.
STILL, the human population explosion of the late 20th century has lifted our destructiveness to altogether new levels. Our hunger for agricultural land and grazing pastures means that we are now wiping out not just individual animals, but whole ecosystems. As we chop down and burn primeval forests, we also suck species into oblivion -- now at the staggering rate, Mr. Wilson estimates, of 27,000 species per year, 74 a day, 3 every hour.
Even at this swift rate, though, it will take hundreds of years to exhaust the stock of species, so diverse are the creations of nature. No one knows exactly how many species currently exist. About 1.4 million are catalogued, of which insects constitute more than half, higher plants 250,000, birds 9,000 and mammals 4,000. But it is anybody's guess how many more species are still lurking in forest canopies and at the bottom of the oceans. Few biologists would put the figure at under 10 million, and some think it may be 10 times that.
"The Diversity of Life" is as much a celebration of this profusion as a warning of its imminent demise. Mr. Wilson, who is also the author of "On Human Nature" and "Sociobiology," writes urgently, as if to capture the kaleidoscope of nature before it breaks up into long-lost fragments. In the Amazon basin, he lists the lives hiding among the fallen trees and rotting branches: "basidiomycete fungi, slime molds, ponerine ants, scolytid beetles, bark lice, earwigs, embiopteran web spinners, zorapterans, entomobryomorph springtails, japygid diplu rans, schizomid arachnids, pseudoscorpions, real scorpions." The green conure parrot of Mexico, he tells us, provides a habitat for 30 species of feather mites, each of which lives on different parts of different feathers. In the forests of Costa Rica, he watches insects that eat the lichen that grows on the small trees that grow on the beds of orchids that grow on the big trees. Mr. Wilson even seems to delight in the cigar-shaped, half-meter-long cookie-cutter shark, whose habits were exposed in 1971: "It thrusts its maw into the bodies" of living porpoises and whales, he writes, and "twists to slice out five-centimeter-wide conical plugs of skin and flesh."
Interleaved with this catalogue of marvels is an introduction to macroevolutionary theory. In sharp contrast to the pleasingly simple laws that dictate developments within existing species, the forces that govern the proliferation of new species are complex and ill understood. Mr. Wilson is an excellent guide to the broad movements of evolution. He explains how each geographical setting has room for only a limited number of species, and how accidents of migration often determine which new species will take root. A species that arrives at an empty place, like the first finches on the Galapagos Islands, radiates into different niches and eventually divides into different species. This process, Mr. Wilson explains, has yielded a steady increase in the diversity of species since evolution began, an increase that has accelerated over the last 100 million years.
Some of this acceleration is the result of the continents having split into separate landmasses; with the formation of new, smaller continents, the number of sites where species could form multiplied. Equally important has been the proliferation of tropical forests, places that contain many isolated habitats whose boundaries are created by differences in climate and altitude. This womb of biodiversity at present houses about half the species on earth.
But now the trend has reversed; the number of species is decreasing. Mr. Wilson suggests that at the current rates, 20 percent of existing species will become extinct in the next 30 years. The last comparable evolutionary disaster was the disappearance of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Many paleontologists now think this was caused by a meteorite six miles in diameter colliding with the earth and sending up a huge cloud of dust and smoke that blocked the sunlight. It took 20 million years -- more than 2,000 times the span of recorded human history -- for species levels to recover.
The imminent collapse, caused by overpopulation, overgrazing and deforestation, won't be quite as sudden, but its effects will last just as long. What is to be done, then? How can we stop the destruction that is already under way? Mr. Wilson suggests that we make a complete survey of the world's fauna and flora in order to identify the "hot spots" for conservation. He also hopes to persuade deforesters that they are acting against their own economic interests and that there are alternatives. For instance, he suggests that "extraction farming" -- harvesting the natural products of the forest without harming it -- is feasible in many tropical areas. He cites as a model the half-million traditional rubber tappers of Brazil, who make their living from forest latex and other wild products. Mr. Wilson suggests that this kind of farming will spread as the world develops a taste for tropical fruit, and perhaps even for river turtle and iguana.
ECONOMIC arguments, however, only stretch so far. Some tropical regions may well be economically suited to extraction farming, and in those cases the opportunity should be taken. But other regions can increase their profits only by cutting down trees and creating pasture instead. While it is true that short-term profits may incur long-term costs (Mr. Wilson mentions that important pharmaceuticals may be lost when certain species disappear) and that climatic side effects will probably follow large-scale deforestation, these prospects have little economic force. Precisely because the effects of deforestation are long-term and, for the time being, intangible, they are outweighed in economic calculations by the short-term certainties of profit.
At the end of his book, Mr. Wilson takes off his gloves. Killing species is not just economically unwise, he says, it is wrong. The diversity of nature is as much part of our heritage as paintings and buildings. It may not be our own creation, but it is an essential part of the world that nurtures us and makes us human. We quite rightly go to great lengths to preserve the Parthenon and the Mona Lisa. But our descendants will not thank us if at the same time we allow the elephant, the chimpanzee and hundreds of thousands of other species to perish.
This is not to say that every species must survive. After all, occasional extinctions are normal, and it makes little biological sense to fight for every last one, however feeble and uninteresting, no matter what the human cost. What we're facing in the next few years, though, is not the natural turnover of evolution, but massive and irreversible annihilation. Once we fully appreciate this threat, the economic arguments seem to fade into insignificance.
The real question, though Mr. Wilson does not emphasize it, is not whether biodiversity is worth saving, but who is going to pay for it. For better or worse, most of the threatened species are in countries with few economic resources, countries where the concern for diversity is likely to be viewed as a luxury for the rich. These countries are understandably unreceptive to moral lectures from the nations that cut down their own primeval forests long ago, that now dispense huge subsidies to keep those areas as farmland and that maintain strict immigration controls to keep aliens out.
It is difficult not to sympathize. The collapse of biodiversity will be the whole world's loss, and those who live in relative ease cannot expect the most hard-pressed nations to bear the brunt of stemming it. This year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, in which the nations of the world tried to outline a coherent environmental policy, did, despite the squabbling, put the issue of biodiversity on the international agenda. But real progress will occur only when a general political will develops in the northern nations. As long as politicians are still able to win votes by putting industrial jobs ahead of conservation, it will be clear that the message has not hit home. "The Diversity of Life" should play an important part in getting it across.
 
 
 
ALONG CAME A SPIDER
 Krakatau, earlier misnamed Krakatoa, an island the size of Manhattan located midway in the Sunda Strait between Sumatra and Java, came to an end on Monday morning, Aug. 27, 1883. It was dismembered by a series of powerful volcanic eruptions. . . .
Rakata, the ash-covered mountain of old Krakatau, survived as a sterile island. But life quickly enveloped it again. In a sense, the spinning reel of biological history halted, then reversed, like a motion picture run backward, as living organisms began to return to Rakata. . . .
The first search for life on Rakata was conducted by a French expedition in May 1884, nine months after the explosions. . . . The ship's naturalist wrote that "notwithstanding all my researches, I was not able to observe any symptom of animal life. I only discovered one microscopic spider -- only one; this strange pioneer of the renovation was busy spinning its web."
A baby spider? How could a tiny wingless creature reach the empty island so quickly? Arachnologists know that a majority of species "balloon" at some point in their life cycle. The spider stands on the edge of a leaf or some other exposed spot and lets out a thread of silk from the spinnerets at the posterior tip of its abdomen. As the strand grows it catches an air current and stretches downwind, like the string of a kite. The spider spins more and more of the silk until the thread exerts a strong pull on its body. Then it releases its grip on the surface and soars upward. Not just pinhead-sized babies but large spiders can occasionally reach thousands of meters of altitude and travel hundreds of kilometers before settling to the ground to start a new life. Either that or land on the water and die. The voyagers have no control over their own descent. -- From "The Diversity of Life."

HEADLINE: The Truth About the Deficit

BYLINE: By Charles J. Zwick and Peter A. Lewis; Charles J. Zwick was director of the Bureau of the Budget and Peter A. Lewis was assistant director in the Johnson Administration.

 BODY:
In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson's Commission on Budget Concepts issued a report on how the budget deficit should be defined and presented. At that time, the Government faced an $8 billion -- or $13 billion -- deficit, depending on how the budget was defined.
Today, when the deficit may exceed $400 billion, when Ross Perot argues that it is the country's most pressing problem and George Bush and Bill Clinton express concern, not one person in 10,000 -- including most members of Congress and professors of economics -- has the foggiest idea how the deficit is, or should be, defined. 
 This disagreement arises because the budget is not simply a way to divide up revenues but also a way to stimulate or cool down the economy by influencing purchasing power, growth, inflation, interest and exchange rates.
Although there never will be a right or perfect budget, the nation must agree on what is in the budget and its deficit before it goes to war over its size and strategies to deal with it.
There are at least six major questions for which there are no simple answers but whose answers dramatically change the size of the deficit.
Should interest payments be part of the deficit?
No, some say. They argue that when interest rates go up, the deficit automatically rises by the increase in interest costs, yet unlike normal budget expenditures this increase does not create any new demand for goods and services. They argue further that interest costs relate to the financing of the deficit and should not be considered part of the deficit.
Opponents of this view, including us, argue that interest payments, which absorb 18 percent of Federal revenue today, could eventually absorb almost all such revenue -- and then what?
Is a deficit caused by a shortfall in revenues in a recession a true deficit?
No, some say. During recessions, taxes fall. This creates a deficit, but it is not a bad deficit, for there is slack in the economy and additional purchasing power will not create inflationary pressures.
But we argue that recessionary deficits increase debt and long-term interest burdens, and therefore cannot be ignored.
Should capital expenditures be included in the same budget as ordinary expenditures?
No, some say. Capital expenditures, they argue, are long-term assets; thus, deficits created by spending on roads, schools and harbors should be excluded from the operating deficit. All growing businesses would show a deficit if capital costs were deducted immediately against earnings rather than being amortized over the life of a project.
Opponents argue that capital and other expenditures chase goods and services and have an immediate economic impact and thus should be included. We would propose a separate capital budget as part of the grand total.
Does inflation reduce the deficit?
Yes, some say. Inflation reduces the value of outstanding indebtedness, so that when such debt is repaid it will be in cheap dollars. For example, a 3 percent reduction in $3 trillion of debt would be equivalent to a revenue gain of $90 billion -- a large percentage of our deficit.
Yet, most experts, including us, would say that inflation does not cut the deficit. Inflation is not an unmixed blessing and has no immediate cash impact.
Should the savings and loan fiasco be included in the budget?
No, some say. They would argue that depositors in failed banks gained no additional purchasing power because of the Government rescue. These depositors never realized their savings were in jeopardy. If the Government had not protected them, many depositors would have been wiped out and national purchasing power would have been drastically reduced. On balance, we agree with this analysis.
Opponents argue that the Government must still borrow money to replenish the insurance funds and that such borrowing creates higher long-term interest burdens.
Should the Social Security programs remain in a unified budget?
No, some say. Social Security funds are trust funds held for the benefit of participants and should not be used to distort the size of the deficit.
But we argue that the surplus (or deficit) in the trust funds has a major impact on the economy and that this overwhelming reality should be recognized.
Depending on which items are included, the $351.9 billion deficit in President Bush's budget request for fiscal 1993 could be as high as $470 billion or become a surplus of $155 billion! The issues cannot be answered with a simple yes or no. A campaign is not the ideal time to have these issues addressed.
But the President-elect should immediately appoint a new bipartisan commission to review the rules.
When a new debate is joined over a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget or a revised Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction act, the participants, the press and public should first know what is meant by the deficit.

HEADLINE: Pounding the Pundits

BYLINE: By Adam Platt; Adam Platt is the co-author of " 'I've Seen the Best of It,' " the memoirs of Joseph W. Alsop.

SOUND AND FURY
The Washington Punditocracy
and the Collapse of American Politics.
By Eric Alterman.
352 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers. $23. 
 'TODAY they own dinner coats," a sour H. L. Mencken wrote in 1927, "and some of them even own plug hats." His barb was directed at journalists, who Mencken thought had grown too rich as a professional class, too fatheaded. In 1988 David Broder, a political columnist for The Washington Post, identified a new beast: a "hybrid creature, an androgynous binding of politician and journalist called The Washington Insider." Shuffling between television studio and word processor, these types fill the air with fatuous import and opinion. Sometimes, as Patrick J. Buchanan has demonstrated, they even run for President.
Eric Alterman, a freelance journalist, has made a reputation in Washington tracking the rise of what he calls "the punditocracy." In "Sound and Fury" he declares that this small claque of political columnists and television commentators is the closest thing the capital has to a permanent aristocracy. He may be right. Exposure, in this world, counts for more than content. John Sununu, the former White House chief of staff, eagerly filled Mr. Buchanan's chair on CNN's political chat show "Crossfire" when Mr. Buchanan went off to campaign. William Safire, the New York Times columnist, was asked if he would enjoy a stint as Secretary of State. "Why step down?" Mr. Alterman quotes him as saying.
Journalism has less to do with this new equation, Mr. Alterman insists, than theatrics, ideology and easy money. Panelists on shows like "Crossfire" and "The McLaughlin Group" earn huge extracurricular speaking fees. Few have done time in a city room, and many belong to what Mr. Alterman calls "the New Right." During the Reagan years, in his view, conservatives like Mr. Buchanan, George Will and Robert Novak hijacked public debate. Beating their drums on behalf of what the author calls "disastrous Reaganite innovations" (Star Wars, supply-side economics), they helped "de-legitimize liberal solutions." Honest democratic discourse died in the process.
Mr. Alterman means this as an objective critique, but of course it isn't. Like his mentor, I. F. Stone, Mr. Alterman has an outsize capacity for moral outrage. He charges modern pundits with nothing less than "the slow degradation of the economic, social and political foundation for the sustenance of the American Dream." Mr. Alterman's book is filled with angry mouthfuls like this. There is an awful lot of gratuitous slanging, as he thrashes around for the appropriate sound bite. Mr. Buchanan is "a kind of white man's Louis Farrakhan"; the punditocracy as a whole is "a convent run by sex criminals."
Mr. Alterman traces this sorry situation back to 1896, the year Adolph S. Ochs began marketing The New York Times as a paper of impersonal, objective record. Old-style journalism, in which opinion was delivered with the news, went out the window. In time, megapundits like Walter Lippmann and Joseph Alsop filled the void. Mr. Alterman attributes vast power to Lippmann. "The Government," he writes, "depended upon him to explain its role, to the citizenry and to itself." Lippmann and Alsop were men of the establishment center, Mr. Alterman continues, and they used their influence to forge consensus, not obliterate it. Their high point was the propagation of the bipartisan foreign policy that followed World War II.
After Lippmann retired in the mid-1960's, madness struck. The center dissolved over Vietnam, and Watergate left the news media riding high. Establishment liberals exhausted themselves, Mr. Alterman says, while dirty corporate dollars gave Republicans the means to churn out pundits and ideas. Talented "ideologues" like Mr. Safire and Mr. Will began telling Washington what to do, and Ronald Reagan listened. While the President focused on Soviet expansion, military gizmos and "the Nicaragua fetish," the United States slid into decline. "It was still 'morning' in the punditocracy," writes Mr. Alterman, "and all opposing arguments sank from public debate without a trace."
This analysis is flatly ideological, and arguably wrong. No less significant, however, is Mr. Alterman's attitude. Again and again he displays the most basic kind of insider arrogance. He seems to believe the course of the free world is decided by loudmouthed men in television studios. He has interviewed no Government officials or politicians as far as I can tell. For the most part his sources are the pundits themselves. Much of the book is given over to gossip about John McLaughlin and the cronies on his show, and to the endless rhetorical spitball fights at institutions like The New Republic. Some of this is diverting; most of it is stale.
Television has changed the standards of our public debate. Voices are louder and more strident; attention spans are shorter. Liberal pundits, as Mr. Alterman says, are often more moderate than their conservative counterparts. But life goes on. The country is more conservative now than 20 years ago. That will probably change, and the left will find its voice again. Then Mr. Alterman won't have to write books. He can become a pundit and rave away.

HEADLINE: Rise in Single Parenthood Is Reshaping U.S.

SERIES: The Good Mother -- Second article of a series: Going It Alone

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
As Janice Edwards drives home after work to the small, neatly kept house she bought last year, she proudly tells the story of how she has kept her family going since her husband left her five years ago, just before their second child was born.
"I thought we'd fall apart with no man there," she said. "There was a time I had no money for formula, no gas, no water, no electricity, and I didn't know what in the world we would do." 
 What Ms. Edwards, 27 years old, has done is work: an office job during the day and another job after hours, at Kmart, or, at one point, delivering newspapers from 2 A.M. to 5 A.M.
"I'm going to work 17 jobs if I have to, but I'm going to take care of these children," she said. "I'm not going to listen to people who tell me single mothers are bad. I'm not single by choice; I'm single by force, and I'm not going to listen to those negative things."
As single motherhood becomes an ever more common fact of American life, millions of women raising children by themselves are grappling with practical problems of child care and tight finances, and more elusive concerns about their children's development and their own place in society.
Most feel themselves in unfamiliar terrain, bringing up their children in a landscape profoundly different from the one in which they themselves were raised. But in dozens of interviews with single mothers, the feeling that was expressed most often and most strongly was a great pride in finding that, against all expectations -- theirs and society's -- they are managing reasonably well.
Given their pressing financial needs, most of them seem to spend less energy than their married counterparts agonizing about how to divide their energies between children and career, and suffer less guilt about the trade-offs working mothers make.
As Sarah Banton, a divorced mother of two sons in Columbia, Mo., put it, her standards changed when she became a single parent. "I now say to myself, 'So what if I didn't make homemade cookies?' " she said. "If everybody's been fed and everybody's got clean underwear, the needs have been met."
But, she and others said, coming to terms with single parenthood is not a simple task. Ms. Banton, a nurse, remembers laughing hilariously when another single mother showed her a 1953 etiquette book she had unearthed, full of outdated advice about how divorced women should not have their children at the ceremony if they remarry, but she stopped laughing when she realized that some vestiges of the old attitudes remained, even inside herself.
"My self-image as a parent had a difficult couple years when I got divorced," Ms. Banton said. "I believed that my children could have a full rich life with only one parent, but I wasn't sure I could be and do all that. It's only this last year that it's begun to feel natural to live this way, the three of us as a family unit."
That transition is one that most American families may have to make, for the stunning demographic fact is that more than half of all children born in this country in 1980 will probably spend some time living in a single-parent household before reaching age 18.
Last year, according to the Census Bureau, a quarter of the nation's children under 18 lived in single-parent households, 22 percent of them with their mothers, and 3 percent with their fathers. In 1970, only 12 percent of the children under 18 lived with one parent, 11 percent with their mothers and 1 percent with their fathers.
"Sure, there are still some segments in society that look down on single parents, but I think we're beginning to outnumber them," said Stephanie Seate, a divorced mother of two teen-agers in Atlanta.
Public discussion of single mothers today tends to center on either pregnant teen-agers who go on welfare or, with the recent attention to the television character Murphy Brown, older, single career women who decide to have babies before it is too late.
Last year, one in four babies was born to a mother who was not married, and that percentage has been growing steadily. It is a worrisome phenomenon, because unmarried mothers tend to be younger, poorer, less educated and more dependent on welfare than those who were married at the time of the birth.
While never-married mothers are the fastest-growing group, they are still a minority. Two out of three single mothers today are women who have been divorced, separated, abandoned by their husbands or widowed, according to 1991 Census Bureau data.
Most, like Ms. Richards, work full time, but earn no more than $20,000, receive little child support and face a constant wearying struggle to maintain a family. Many say they are stretched for both time and money, spending their days in such a rush of errands and work that they must consciously set aside time with their children in which they can be more like a mother and less like a drill sergeant.
Whether divorced or never married, most said that society does not give them enough credit for their efforts to build good lives for themselves and their children, and that they resent the recent uproar over Murphy Brown's pregnancy, in which Vice President Dan Quayle expressed his disapproval of the character's decision to become a single mother.
"I feel like he was putting her down, and I'm a single parent with kids, so he's putting me down, too," said Sharon Lewis, 28, who is raising two children in Dixon, Miss., on $180 a week that she takes home from a factory where she packs chickens. "I need help with my kids; I don't need put-downs. I'm having a hard time, and I do the best I can."
 
The Worries
Of Child Care And Role Models
 Most of the women interviewed, even those who described their family life in glowing terms, admitted to nagging worries about how single parenthood affects their children. Whatever the child's problems -- bed-wetting, learning disabilities, reluctance to date -- they wonder how it might be related to the absence of a father.
"I grew up in that typical middle-class family, where someone was there with cookies and milk when you got home, but I think I'm a good mother for the situation I'm in," said Cheryl Baillis, 24, an unmarried mother in Grafton, Ohio, whose daughter, Nicole, was born while she was in high school. "Sometimes I fantasize about the white picket fence, the marriage where the wife stays home with the kids. In a way I feel that this is something I did to myself, but my daughter's paying the price, too."
For mothers of young children, good child care seems to be the biggest worry. But as children get older, the worries change. Mothers of boys worry about finding good role models for their sons.
"In the P.T.A. it came up that one thing we wanted as single mothers was to keep some male teachers visible to our kids, especially our boys," Ms. Edwards said. "That's why we have a man here in the morning at 7:20 when I drop the kids off at school for breakfast. I pick the role models I want and put a bug in their ear to watch out for my son."
Mothers of girls approaching adolescence wonder whether their daughters will ever trust a man.
"My daughter asked for a baseball mitt and ball for her 10th birthday, and I had to ask a male friend to go with me to buy it," said Liz Torres, a New York City teacher's aide whose two daughters live in a world peopled largely by women. "I do worry sometimes that having a single mom will affect how they feel about men when they grow up."
Many also wonder whether they are good enough disciplinarians, especially when they are worn out and want time to relax. "Setting the consistent limits kids need takes a lot of energy, but if you don't do it, it leads to behavior problems," Ms. Banton said.
 
The Problems' Roots
The Companion Is Poverty
 While it is clear that children in single-parent families are more likely to have behavior and academic problems than those in families that are intact, it is difficult to sort out the causes. For all the mothers' worries, sociologists say there are little data showing that single parenthood in itself causes dire problems for children. Most of the problems, they say, appear to result from poverty that often accompanies single parenthood, or disturbances preceding the divorce, rather than parenting itself.
"The economic differences between children from one-parent families and children from two-parent families are much greater than the psychological differences," said Frank F. Furstenburg Jr., a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania.
In a long-term study comparing children growing up in divorced families with those in two-parent families, he said, there were consistent differences on things like mental health, problems with the law and school achievement. "But they were modest differences," he said, "and a fair amount of the differences were due to what preceded the divorce."
In contrast, the link between single parenthood and poverty is clear. Almost half of all female-headed families with children under 18 live in poverty, and the median family income for two-parent families is three times that of female-headed families.
Tight finances can affect parenting decisions: Every morning, after Paula Brightbill gets her two older children out the door for school and leaves for her job, her 6-year-old, Michael, stays home alone for a half-hour, watching cartoons until it is time to join a child next door for the walk to school.
"There is a program before school he could go to, but it costs $21 a week, and I'd rather have that money for food," said Ms. Brightbill, 36, a divorced secretary in Harrisburg, Pa. "I worry about it: Did the door get shut and locked? Did he remember his lunch money?"
"The bottom line of being a single parent is money," said Barbara Webb, 38, a mother of three in Norfolk, Va., who separated from her husband in 1988 and now lives with her mother and father, who came out of retirement to help support the extended family.
Douglas J. Besharov, a family-policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a research center in Washington, argues that there are basic differences between never-married mothers and those who married, had children and became single parents when their marriages dissolved.
"The ones who were married, as a group, have higher family incomes, are older, better educated, more likely to hold full-time jobs, less likely to go on welfare," he said. "When we talk about single parents as a social problem, we're really talking about the young unmarried mothers, 40 percent of whom end up as long-term welfare recipients, compared to only 14 percent of the divorced mothers. The worrying thing is that never-married mothers account for most of the children now entering single-parent households."
The merging of the two categories in public parlance is relatively recent. Until the 1970's, women were either called divorced mothers or unwed mothers, and there was no all-inclusive label. The widespread acceptance of the undifferentiated term 'single mother,' experts say, signaled a de-stigmatization of the role.
But many children still wish for a mom-and-dad household. Ms. Banton, the Missouri nurse, described the picture that her son made this fall when his first-grade teacher asked him to draw his family.
'He drew himself and his brother and a mother and father, all holding hands," she said. "I felt sad for him when I saw it, the kind of twinge you get in the playground if your kid isn't picked for the team."

HEADLINE: Haldore Hanson, 80, Chronicler Of China and Victim of McCarthy

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Haldore Hanson, a State Department official who was cleared of Senator Joseph McCarthy's accusation of being a Communist sympathizer, died Sept. 24 at a hospital in Texcoco, Mexico. He was 80 years old and lived in San Nicholas, Mexico, and Arcola, Va.
He had heart disease and died after a leg operation, his family said. 
 As a foreign correspondent in the 1930's, Mr. Hanson covered the Chinese civil war and the invasion of China by Japan. Traveling rural roads on bicycle, he rotated among the warring forces and was occasionally arrested by one side or the other.
His book on the war, "Humane Endeavor" (Farrar, Rineholt, 1939), was praised as a rare close-up from the remote front lines. Because of his expertise, the State Department hired him in 1942. After World War II, he became assistant director of the Point Four development aid program for Asia.
 
'I Am a Loyal American'
 In 1950, Senator McCarthy denounced him as having "pro-Communist proclivities" and accused him of being on "a mission to communize the world." The Wisconsin Republican offered no proof.
Mr. Hanson denied any involvement with Communists, saying, "I am a loyal American." A Senate subcommittee found no evidence against him, but the charges still damaged Mr. Hanson, who told the subcommittee how neighbors in Virginia had circulated a petition to drive him out and how one had called him a Russian spy.
After surviving the controversy, he lost his Point Four job in 1953 in a staff reorganization and cutback that the agency said were unrelated to Mr. McCarthy's accusation.
In the 1960's he worked on development in Burma, Iran, Nigeria and Pakistan for the Ford Foundation and other organizations. From 1971 to 1978 he headed the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center in Mexico, supported by the Mexican Government, the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation.
Born in Virginia, Minn., Mr. Hanson grew up in Duluth, Minn. He graduated from Carleton College.
He taught school and did freelance writing for publications in China and elsewhere abroad, covering floods, famine and the opium trade. The Associated Press promoted him to full-time correspondent in 1937, and he returned to the United States in 1939 to work in domestic bureaus.
Surviving are his wife of 53 years, the former Bernice Brown; a son, Eric of Burlington, Vt.; a daughter, Signe Hanson of Pompton Lakes, N.J.; a sister, Janet Hanson of Duluth; and three brothers, Chuck Hanson of San Clemente, Calif., and Fritz Hanson and Richard Hanson, both of Duluth.

HEADLINE: Japan's Plan to Ship Plutonium Has Big and Little Lands Roaring

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 4

 BODY:
As President of one of the world's tiniest nations, Bernard Dowiyogo of the Republic of Nauru usually follows a simple rule of economic and foreign policy in the Pacific: Stay out of Japan's way.
This weekend, with a touch of trepidation, he violated the rule. Arriving in Tokyo, the head of the eight-square-mile country of 9,000 people suddenly found himself the spokesman for a growing number of nations telling Japan to keep the largest sealift of plutonium in history out of their territorial waters. The island is on the equator, 2,500 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia. 
 The opponents of the sealift are also demanding that Tokyo end the secrecy surrounding shipments that may begin in just a few weeks.
 
'Japanese Arrogance'
 For the Japanese, President Dowiyogo's appearance here this weekend was the latest in a series of diplomatic troubles erupting over the imminent shipments of one of the most toxic materials in the world. In the last few weeks, South Africa, Chile, Malaysia and Indonesia have all told Japan that its transport ship, which is to carry roughly a ton of plutonium from reprocessing centers in Europe to civilian nuclear reactors in Japan, will be barred from passing through their territory.
Cabinet officials in both Singapore and Indonesia have expressed strong concerns and urged that the ship steer clear of populated islands and avoid the most direct route, the Strait of Malacca, where piracy and collisions have been frequent recently. Several countries have said that if the ship runs into trouble, Japan should not count on making an emergency port call.
 
Neighbors in the Dark
 Japanese officials have repeatedly offered assurances that the risk of a major accident is minuscule. But much of the friction over the shipments seems prompted by what one Southeast Asian diplomat recently termed "Japanese arrogance" in not disclosing the security and emergency arrangements for what many say is a ripe target for terrorists: a slow-moving, lightly guarded cargo of nuclear fuel that, albeit with considerable work, could be turned into dozens of crude atomic weapons.
The cargo ship, the Akatsuki Maru, left Yokohama in August for Cherbourg, France, where it will pick up the plutonium. The date of its departure from France has not been announced.
Japan has little choice but to go ahead with the shipments. For years, it has been shipping the waste from its nuclear plants to France and Britain for reprocessing, and those countries have said they will not become permanent storage sites for the material.
After developing a security plan with the Pentagon -- the United States has approval rights over the shipment because it originally sold the nuclear fuel to Japan -- Tokyo has refused to tell its neighbors what countries the ship will pass in its long voyage across the Atlantic and Pacific. In a terse statement the other day, the chief Cabinet secretary, Koichi Kato, said, "The route will be decided shortly before the ship leaves France."
No matter which way it traverses the globe on a journey of roughly 15,000 miles, the ship seems virtually certain to cut through the heart of the South Pacific, a region used for decades as an atomic testing ground for the United States and France, a dump for radioactive wastes and recently a destruction site for chemical weapons.
"The pattern is this," President Dowiyogo, who was not invited by the Government, said today at a conference of opponents of the plan that Japanese officials declined to attend. "Other countries, larger and more powerful than us, impose upon the Pacific peoples the unwanted costs of their technologies, while they extract all of the benefits."
 
Warnings Called Overwrought
 Plutonium is so toxic that a mere speck can cause cancer, and its radioactivity persists for thousands of years. But Japanese officials say that warnings of calamity are grossly overwrought, the product of a campaign by environmental groups and antinuclear campaigners. The cargo, they note, will be placed in specially designed containers and escorted by a lightly armed Japanese Coast Guard vessel that recently left Tokyo -- again amid great secrecy -- for France.
An earlier plan to fly the plutonium to Japan was rejected by the United States Congress because of the risk that the containers of plutonium would be breached if the plane crashed in Alaska. Some senior American officials also have reservations about the current plan.
The shipments -- several a year are planned -- will be the first step in a Japanese plan for energy independence that has been in the works for two decades. The idea is to create a self-sustaining source of nuclear power by reprocessing nuclear wastes from Japanese power plants and using the resulting plutonium as new fuel in special "breeder reactors" -- which make more plutonium -- and specially converted conventional reactors.
Eventually Japan will reprocess the fuel on its own soil, but for the next 15 to 20 years it plans to depend heavily on plants in England and France.
But the plan, which was considered visionary in the 1970's, has become the subject of heated debate in the 1990's. With dismantlement of huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons, there is already a world oversupply of plutonium. Moreover, the project now seems wildly uneconomical because ordinary nuclear fuel, made from uranium, has become far more plentiful and far less expensive than anyone anticipated two decades ago.
Over the last few years, the shipments have become a magnet for Japan's tiny antinuclear movement, which charges that Tokyo plans to import far more plutonium than it can burn. Most of the objections, though, have come from outside of Japan.
In July the South Pacific Forum, made up of countries throughout the region, called for the shipments to be delayed or abandoned. Further, Gov. John Waihee 3d of Hawaii has said that he is "not satisfied that adequate safeguards are in place.
Today, the Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands, Lorenzo I. De Leon Guerrero, said the residents of the American territory "do not believe Japan and the United States have taken all reasonable safety steps," and urged that the shipments be stopped.
 
Relations 'Very Friendly'
 But it was President Dowiyogo, with his mouse-that-roared warnings to Japan, who caught the attention of the Japanese press today. Reporters jammed his news conference, and one tried to tempt him into threatening to intercept the cargo if it came too close to Nauruan waters. But the President deflected the question, with an aide noting later that, like Japan, Nauru likes to say that it holds no offensive military capability.
"As far as Nauru and Japan are concerned, our relations have been very friendly," President Dowiyogo said. The country sells some of its phosphate to Japanese industrial companies and it has invested some of its considerable wealth in the Japanese stock market.
Things were not always so good between the two countries. In World War II, Japan invaded Nauru and sent more than a thousand of its people to be slave workers on Truk Island. But perhaps because it receives no economic aid now from Japan, Nauru has felt a little easier than some of its neighbors about speaking out.
"They say all of the risks have been taken care of," Mr. Dowiyogo said. "It's really up to whether you believe them or not. So far, we don't."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Independent;
Perot's Quiet Campaign: An Odd Form of Politics

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Ross Perot said he was going to be an unconventional candidate. But so far, his rehabilitated bid for the Presidency has been more like a stealth campaign.
After keeping the nation on tenterhooks for more than a week about his intentions and then restarting his abandoned Presidential campaign on Thursday with much ballyhoo, the unpredictable Texas businessman has virtually dropped out of sight. 
 In doing so, Mr. Perot eschewed the traditional political strategy of immediately hitting the hustings after a big event like a nomination to take advantage of the increase in public interest and curiosity.
In the three days after the Republican National Convention in August, President Bush made campaign appearances in seven cities in six states. After the Democratic National Convention, Gov. Bill Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore, embarked on a bus trip through eight states. In contrast, Mr. Perot granted one television interview since re-emerging as a candidate and then retreated to his Dallas home to work on campaign strategy.
 
'He Just Re-Entered the Race'
 "We're trying to plan out the rest of the month," Sharon Holman, Mr. Perot's press secretary, told The Associated Press today. "Obviously, this has not been planned for a long time. He just re-entered the race."
Mr. Perot's disappearance when he commanded public attention has baffled some students of government and politics. For even a self-described amateur, they say, not to understand how useful it would be to get his message out when he occupied center stage is beyond unconventional.
"You would think once you step back into the arena on the justification that we have to get the parties to discuss the issues, your next step would be to get the attention of the public on those issues you want to discuss," said Hugh Heclo, professor of government at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. "Any professional adviser would have told him to seize the moment and go from there. But he has just disappeared into the ether."
Such an unconventional course perhaps foreshadows the type of campaign Mr. Perot intends to run.
"This is what we expected," said a top official in the Bush campaign who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. "We expect the only times you're ever going to see Ross Perot are on his paid ads, selected talk shows like 'Larry King' and the 'Today' show and the debates."
Still, said Torie Clarke, spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, Mr. Perot got noticed even without traditional campaigning. "People have been talking about him," she said. "You see stories about him every day. I think his presence is still felt out there."
To be sure, Mr. Perot's silent weekend could be a two-day version of the two-month hiatus he took after his withdrawal from the race on July 16: a period of behind-the-scenes activity that ended with an explosive re-entry onto the Presidential scene. His aides told The Associated Press that he was likely to unveil the first of his commercials during the Dallas Cowboys game against the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday night. And Mr. Perot has bought a half-hour block of television time on CBS for Tuesday night and a half-hour block on ABC for Friday.
Mr. Perot's seclusion undoubtedly stems in part from his unwillingness to expose himself to the news media, which he has accused of being inaccurate, sensational and biased.
 
Accusations by Perot
 "Anybody who's not trying to be politically correct would make it clear that journalism needs to clean up its act," Mr. Perot told Barbara Walters on the ABC News program "20/20" on Friday, the single post-announcement interview. "They've got their agendas; they've got their candidates."
Except for that interview, Mr. Perot has left it to surrogates to carry his message. The results have not always been ringing endorsements for him.
Orson Swindle, national director of United We Stand, America, the organization that Mr. Perot set up and financially nurtured after withdrawing from the race in July, did strongly promote Mr. Perot during an appearance today on ABC's "This Week."
But while John P. White, the Eastman Kodak executive who was the driving force behind the development of Mr. Perot's austere economic plan, touted that plan on "Meet the Press" today, he seemed lukewarm about a Perot Presidency. When asked if he would vote for Mr. Perot, Mr. White replied, "I don't know how I will vote."
 
Criticism Keeps Coming
 As Mr. Perot seeks to run on his own terms, the political world keeps spinning, issuing criticism of Mr. Perot without a response from the candidate or the campaign. Today, Hal Riney, the media adviser dismissed by Mr. Perot in July, told a television interviewer in San Francisco that Mr. Perot was "kind of like Jimmy Swaggart with a lot of tantrums, and I'm not sure that's Presidential material."
Mr. Riney said Mr. Perot, a billionaire, had paid him only half the money owed for the work that Mr. Riney's company did for him. "So I guess if that's the way he's going to take care of our country's bills, I'm not sure I want to be on Social Security."
And in the issue that will be on the newstands on Monday, Newsweek magazine, citing former Perot volunteers, said Mr. Perot's re-entry had been planned long ago. Newsweek reported that on July 18, two days after he dropped out, Mr. Perot told volunteer leaders gathered in Dallas that "if anyone thinks I've quit, they're going to be in for an October surprise."
While the Bush and Clinton campaigns let no accusation go unanswered for more than a few hours, inquiries seeking the campaign's response to articles and criticism from Ms. Holman went unanswered.
"I think they're in a cocoon and have no sense of the need to anticipate or even react to what's going on outside that thing," Mr. Heclo said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Says Clinton Tried to Aid Iraq

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
In an apparent attempt to shift some of the political heat over the Bush Administration's policies toward Iraq before the Persian Gulf war to Gov. Bill Clinton, President Bush tonight accused the Democratic Presidential nominee of trying to arrange agricultural loans to Baghdad.
In an interview on the CNN program "Larry King Live," Mr. Bush said that he was unaware of any illegal sales of military equipment to Iraq and that it was "fallacious" to suggest that his Administration had deliberately built up Iraq's military capability as a counter to Iran, as has been suggested in some published reports. 
 Pressed further on the issue, which the White House and the Bush campaign have tried hard to keep out of the center of the election debate, Mr. Bush said: "Do you know who wanted to make loans, grain credit loans, and get hold of Mr. Hamdoon, the Iraq Ambassador, on grain credits? Governor Clinton. I mean, of course."
But Mr. Bush offered no evidence or even a detailed explanation of his assertion about Mr. Clinton. When Mr. King asked the President if the Arkansas Governor had wanted to arrange loans for Iraq, Mr. Bush replied, "I believe that's the case."
Referring to Nizar Hamdoon, who was then Iraq's Ambassador to Washington, Mr. Bush said: "I think he met with him and wanted -- you know, was pleased that the U.S. agricultural loans -- we were making agricultural loans. We were trying to bring the guy along."
Iraq is Arkansas's biggest customer for its rice crop, its main agricultural products, but the Clinton campaign tonight said that Mr. Clinton had never been involved in arranging loan guarantees and had only met once with Mr. Hamdoon, a brief courtesy call in 1986.
Mr. Bush's comments on Mr. Clinton came in the midst of a rambling, hourlong interview in which Mr. Bush seemed unusually defensive, blaming the press for most of his political troubles and criticizing the basketball star Magic Johnson, whose resignation from the President's commission on AIDS was a public relations blow to the White House, as not attending the panel's meetings regularly.
Mr. King's program, which is normally broadcast live with viewers calling in questions, was taped in advance at the insistence of the White House.
In recent weeks, Mr. Bush has come under fire from his Democratic opponents for efforts to improve relations with Iraq in the years before the Persian Gulf war.
At the time, the United States considered Baghdad to be a strategic balance to Iran and the Bush Administration provided guarantees to private banks that were willing to make loans to Iraq so it could purchase agricultural products. Although Mr. Bush referred tonight to the United States as "making agricultural loans" to Baghdad, the program was limited to credit guarantees, not outright loans.
Critics of the policy say the loans permitted the Iraqis to use other money to build up their chemical, biological and ballistic missile programs. They also have asserted that some of the money may have directly gone into financing Iraqi weapons programs and that suspicions about such diversions were raised within the Bush Administration at the time in numerous memorandums. The accusations of money diversions have never been proved.
George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, said the only record at the campaign of Mr. Clinton meeting with Mr. Hamdoon was on Sept. 26, 1986. "Hamdoon was in town to speak to the Arkansas Rice Council and the Little Rock Committee on Foreign Relations," he said. "He had a courtesy call on the Governor, something that is routinely done with all foreign dignitaries."
Mr. Clinton denounced Mr. Bush's accusation as "pathetic." Speaking at an airport in Kinston, N.C., tonight, Mr. Clinton said: "That shows you how desperate and pathetic they are. They will not take responsibility for what they have done. It is a sad day that he is so desperate that he would equate a few minutes courtesy call by an ambassador six years ago that occurred before the facts in question."
In the interview on CNN, Mr. Bush refused to say what, if any, changes he would make in his Cabinet if he was re-elected, but he made it clear that James A. Baker 3d, who left his job as Secretary of State to take over the White House staff and the re-election campaign, would be returning to his diplomatic post.
"He's a close enough friend and he's got such a superb record that I would -- I don't know, I mean, I would think he'd want to go back there and I'd want him there," Mr. Bush said.
Asked why he was trailing in the polls and why opinion surveys indicate that Americans are dissatisfied with his economic stewardship, Mr. Bush said: "Well, when 92 percent of the news coverage, Larry, on this -- what is the man's name, Lichter's surveys -- have been negative on the economy, how else do people get the news? You get it from news programs or you get it from print. And yes, things have been tough, but they haven't been that tough."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Pulling Punches on the Environment

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis., Oct. 2

 BODY:
Mounds of radioactive dirt and heaps of old plastic milk jugs often turn up as backdrops for the speeches of Senator Al Gore because he puts more emphasis on environmental issues than anyone else who has ever run for national office.
Even so, Mr. Gore is pulling his punches on the environment as he campaigns for Vice President. He knows that he is doing it. He readily admits that he is doing it, and he says that sound political judgment requires it. 
 "I am making the environment the single most prominent part of my campaign message," he said in an interview this week, speaking slowly and carefully. "I am doing my best to elevate it to a position it has never before had in national politics, but I have a responsibility to do more than that beside. My focus in these next 30-some-odd days is to do everything I can to help Bill Clinton win this election, and that means delivering a broader message as well."
Near the beginning of his best-selling book, "Earth in the Balance," Mr. Gore says he, like other politicians, was guilty of "failures of candor" about environmental issues. During his unsuccessful Presidential campaign in 1988, he said, "I simply lacked the strength to keep on talking about the environment" in the face of a lack of interest from the reporters and advice from poll takers that it did not play as an issue.
 
Book Rarely Mentioned
 These days the 393-page book is often mentioned by speakers who introduce him to crowds as a famous defender of the environment, but in his own speeches the Senator rarely mentions the book's central theme: mankind, he argues, is destroying the earth and only fundamental changes in human civilization will save it.
On the stump, the Tennessee Senator never discusses many of the book's specific proposals, like a tax on fossil fuels based on how much carbon dioxide each releases into the atmosphere.
These are the ideas that Republicans seize on when they denounce Mr. Gore as an environmental extremist. Campaigning in Michigan last week, President Bush said the Democrats' proposals for stringent automobile fuel-efficiency standards "would toss 40,000 auto workers out on the unemployment lines."
Mr. Gore insists that the environmental issue is working to the Democrats' advantage.
"Bush sounds schizophrenic every time he opens his mouth on the environment," Mr. Gore said. "He can't attack me on the environment without in the same breath claiming to be environmentally sensitive."
When Mr. Gore explains why he is toning down his environmental message, he looks far beyond the November election.
"I said in my book that the maximum that is politically feasible today still falls short of the minimum of what is really effective in solving the global crisis, but that doesn't lead me to hopelessness and despair," he said. "It just leads me to the conclusion that we have to patiently and effectively expand the definition of what is politically feasible, and that is part of the reason I'm in this campaign."
The subtle message has gotten through to at least some of his readers. Maureen Flynn waited several hours on a cold sidewalk in Hartford, Conn., on Wednesday, so Mr. Gore could autograph her copy of the book. "I wouldn't use the word radical to describe what he says because he's talking about plans not just for right now but for the future," she said.
And Mr. Gore is confident that his running mate understands.
"Bill Clinton endorses the general thrust and the central premise of my book," the Senator said, "but I have not, and would not, ask him to endorse every detail of the plan that I propose." The Presidential candidate has not adopted all of Mr. Gore's tax proposals.
Mr. Gore closely coordinates his efforts with the Clinton campaign, and there is a distinct note of deference towards the Governor when he talks about their proposals in areas like health care or student loans.
But on the environment, it is clear he speaks on his own authority, at least within an agreed-upon agenda. When the running mates appeared here together on Thursday night on "Rockline," a call-in interview program broadcast by college radio stations, it was Mr. Clinton who deferred on this subject.
 
An Environmental Theme
 Almost every day Mr. Gore travels to some kind of campaign event built around an environmental theme. One day this week he extolled the virtues of a recycling plant near Scranton, Pa., and the next morning he deplored the pollution caused by a former atomic weapons factory near Cincinnati.
These appearances usually revolve around three criteria, he said. A grass-roots environmental group is involved. Or jobs are being created by environmental action. Or lastly, as he put it, "I am following the trail of broken promises the 'environmental President' has left all over the country."
His speeches start out on local matters and then become an indictment of the Bush Administration's environmental policies, but they rarely proceed to more than a brief mention of what his book calls strategic environmental issues, like global warming, that affect the entire planet.
Mr. Gore seems increasingly confident this will change.
"In the debate about the environment, the most basic argument is still in play: do we shift our basic attitudes or not?" he said. "We have a direct conflict with Bush and Quayle on that question. If we win that argument, and we are in the midst of winning it big time, then we have the basis for moving the debate to the next level of detail. Then we can start looking at the best way of achieving our goals."
Beyond its sweeping policy proposals, Mr. Gore's book argues for a deeply personal, almost spiritual change in attitude toward the planet. It is a measure of Mr. Gore's growing confidence that this theme is now starting to appear in his speeches.
Late Thursday night after four hours of appearances before big, enthusiastic crowds around Madison, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore addressed more than 1,000 people in a darkened courtyard on the University of Wisconsin campus here. Starkly illuminated by television lights, each delivered impromptu and emotional speeches. When Mr. Gore finally hit on the theme of his book, the crowd roared with approval:
"What this election is about," he said, "is developing a new understanding of yourself and how you relate to your community and how you relate to the earth."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Media;
Fueled by Words Alone, Radio Ads Are Nastier

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
When the new Bush campaign commercial attacking Gov. Bill Clinton's credibility went on television on Friday, the Presidential campaign by some measures reached a new level of nastiness. By some measures, though, it was already there.
Two weeks ago, the Bush campaign began broadcasting advertisements in Michigan accusing Mr. Clinton of equivocating on everything from his draft history to his position on higher taxes. Those commercials, even more biting in tone than President Bush's new ones, were broadcast only on radio. 
 In an era when Presidential campaigns are fought primarily on television, radio commercials may seem to be a curiously antique form of weaponry, like those filigreed pistols in museums. Yet radio, political analysts say, remains the medium that candidates use for their meanest assaults.
"Radio is tougher than television," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania. "That's almost invariably true."
 
Hard Shots on Radio
 It was on radio that Mr. Bush first raised the draft issue against Mr. Clinton. "He said he never received a draft notice, then admitted he did," the radio commercial broadcast in Michigan said. "He said he respects the military, but wrote of his loathing for the military. He said he supported the Persian Gulf war, then he said he sympathized with those who opposed the war."
The Bush advertisements were in response to Clinton radio commercials, also broadcast in Michigan, accusing the President of ducking debates. After listing grim economic statistics, the announcer in the Clinton commercials said: "The American people have a lot of questions. Bill Clinton is ready to answer them. So why won't George Bush debate?"
During the Presidential primary campaign, radio was clearly the medium of choice for candidates who wanted to inflict serious damage.
Mr. Bush and Patrick J. Buchanan exchanged some of their most pointed digs over radio in New Hampshire. Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas broadcast a commercial on black-oriented radio stations in the South criticizing Governor Clinton for an outburst against the Rev. Jesse Jackson that had been picked up on an open microphone.
 
Playing to Angry Audiences
 Heading into the New York primary, Mr. Clinton put an advertisement on radio suggesting that his opponent, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, opposed legal abortion. The commercial was so tough -- and according to the Brown staff so misleading -- that the Clinton camp was forced to pull it after a brief run.
Theories abound about why radio has become a haven of attack ads. Some political consultants say the secret lies in the circumstances under which people listen to radio -- often while stuck in traffic jams. "The conventional wisdom is that radio is the medium where you can be much tougher," said Carter Eskew, a political consultant working on the Clinton campaign. "People listen to the radio in an angry mood, sitting in traffic, as opposed to the escapist mood when they watch TV."
 
Leaving No Fingerprints
 Others say that paradoxically the things radio lacks are precisely what make it so well-suited to negative campaigning. Without faces or images, radio commercials are generally less memorable than those on television: their message tends to become disassociated from its messenger. This, media experts say, makes radio a relatively inefficient way to promote a candidate, but it enables a candidate to transmit negative information about a rival without being tarred by the information himself.
"With radio, the information doesn't stay tied to its source, like it does with television," Ms. Jamieson said. "It's a stealth medium."
Radio also allows candidates to aim at specific audiences with far more precision than television does.
Radio stations appeal to distinctly different demographic groups: easy-listening stations, for example, tend to attract older audiences; classical-music stations have affluent and more Republican audiences, and some other stations attract obvious ethnic groups. This fragmentation allows candidates to send a radio message to one demographic group that they would not want another group to overhear. Mr. Tsongas's advertisement on black-oriented radio stations, for example, was clearly intended to bypass whites.
 
Line to Specific Groups
 "You can talk to specific groups that you want to reach," said Tony Schwartz, a consultant who is considered the dean of political advertising on radio. "You can do your damage and not have it get as much attention."
Candidates keep careful track of their opponents' television advertisements, but just as low-flying planes avoid radar, radio commercials are often able to escape detection. "With radio it takes a while to catch up," said Michael Shea, a political consultant in Boston. "It can be running for weeks, and you don't know where it is."
Because it is so hard to keep track of radio commercials -- a media market with four or five local television stations may have dozens of radio stations -- they are an especially good way to put out misleading information.
Ms. Jamieson recalled that during the 1972 campaign, President Richard M. Nixon broadcast radio commercials in cities near military bases warning the cities would suffer job losses if the cuts advocated by his opponent, George McGovern, were made. The numbers were wildly inflated, Ms. Jamieson said, because added together, the job losses cited in the commercials equaled the total number of people in the Army.
"Nobody," she said, "ever caught on."

HEADLINE: Mexico's Chief, in a Shift, Meets Two of Castro's Main Foes in Exile

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 4

 BODY:
In an extraordinary departure from Mexico's tradition of political support for Cuba, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has met privately with two of the Communist Government's most prominent opponents in exile.
A Mexican official and foreign diplomats linked the meetings to efforts by the Salinas administration to win the support of Cuban-American leaders for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mexico has negotiated with Canada and the United States. 
 But senior Mexican officials who confirmed Mr. Salinas's separate sessions here with Jorge Mas Canosa, president of the conservative Cuban American National Foundation, and Carlos Alberto Montaner, head of the smaller and somewhat more middle-road Cuban Democratic Platform, said they were also intended as a signal of Mexican support for broad political changes on the island.
"What happens in Cuba is the responsibility of the Cubans," a senior Mexican official said, echoing the country's long-cherished principle of noninterference in the affairs of other countries. But he added that the island's future was up to "all Cubans, those in Cuba and those in Miami."
Mr. Salinas met with Mr. Mas Canosa on Aug. 4 and with Mr. Montaner on Sept. 13.
 
Castro's Hated Adversary
 Mr. Mas Canosa, perhaps the single adversary most hated by President Fidel Castro, did not return telephone calls to the office of his construction company in Miami or his foundation's public relations agency in New Jersey. Mr. Montaner could not be reached in Miami or at his offices in Madrid.
The widening of differences between Mexico and Cuba comes at a bad time for Cuba, analysts said. Having lost nearly all the trade and economic support it once received from countries of the former Soviet bloc, Cuba has worked vigorously over the last two years to strengthen its economic and political ties in Latin America.
Mexico, which has long been a diplomatic lifeline for the Cuban Government, became increasingly important to that strategy as some other Latin American governments and Spain grew more openly critical of Mr. Castro's unwillingness to move toward more pluralistic government.
With the House of Representatives' recent approval of a bill to strengthen the United States economic embargo against Cuba, Latin American diplomats and other experts had expected Mexico's role as a channel for foreign investment and trade to increase.
While Mexico still buys only a tiny fraction of Cuba's exports, the value of Mexican imports jumped from $7.5 million in 1988 to $48.9 million in 1990, according to figures of the Mexican Central Bank. Mexican exports to Cuba have fallen slightly, from $118.9 million to $100.1 over the same period.
 
Cuban Voices 'Astonishment'
 In an interview Wednesday, a member of the Cuban Politburo, Roberto Robaina, said that when Cuban officials learned of Mr. Salinas's meetings with the two exiles, "we made clear our disagreement, and more than that, our astonishment."
"This is very strong," said Mr. Robaina, the leader of Cuba's Communist youth organization. "These two people are symbols of the greatest reactionism, of the greatest aggression against our internal stability."
Mr. Robaina spoke almost as sharply about the meetings during a news conference Sept. 25, but he was received by Mr. Salinas hours later at the presidential residence. The Mexican Foreign Ministry also issued a brief communique stating, "There are no consequences or reasons that modify the current state of bilateral relations, which correspond to the traditional friendship that prevails between the two peoples."
But a Mexican official and foreign diplomats said the meetings had followed appeals to Mexico by United States officials who stressed the potential importance of Cuban-American support to Congressional passage of the trade agreement next year.
Some Cuban-American leaders have threatened to withhold support for the accord because they believed that Mexico was providing economic sustenance to Cuba. Mexican officials said they denied to Mr. Mas Canosa and Mr. Montaner that this was the case.
In their explanations to Cuban officials, Mexican officials said they stressed that Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain and Presidents Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, Luis Alberto Lacalle of Uruguay and Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina had all asked Mr. Salinas to meet with the exiles.
A senior Mexican official, who like others discussed the issue on the condition he not be identified, said the Government believed that while Mr. Castro still commanded much support from his countrymen, Cuba's economic crisis made political change imperative.
The official said Mr. Salinas had told Mr. Castro that Cuban membership in the Latin American community would depend on his willingness to adopt the values of democratization and economic liberalization that most of the region's countries hold.
"He has shown no sign of moving toward anything like a transition," the official said of Mr. Castro. "He cannot claim at the same time to want to be part of this community but to be against these trends."

The Economy
 Congressional negotiators agreed on a tax bill offering $27 billion in tax breaks and investment incentives in the next five years, many of them meant to aid depressed cities, help the housing industry and encourage personal savings and industrial investment. The measure, which the House and Senate will vote on today or tomorrow, puts President Bush in a political bind: should he sign or veto a bill that cuts some taxes and raises others? [Page A1.]
Lacking other ideas, economists have turned to the consumer, that abiding American hero, to provide the push the economy needs. All that is needed, these experts say, is a surge in confidence. Then people would loosen the purse strings and start spending again, awakening the economy. [D1.] 
 The Midwest is seen as the bright spot in an elusive economic recovery, for all its dependence on manufacturing. Unemployment in most Midwestern states is at or below the national average, production outpaces the rest of the nation. And real estate, which never boomed, has not gone bust. [A1.]
Federal Reserve policy makers meet tomorrow to decide whether to lower interest further. Because so many strategists expect an easing, bonds are already priced as if the central bank had cut its rates. [D1.]
Congress required that 10 percent of Sematech's $100 million 1993 budget be used for environmental research. [D1.]
Bill Clinton said he endorsed the free-trade pact with Mexico and Canada, but said he would not sign it unless agreements were reached to require tougher environmental standards and improved conditions for workers in Mexico. [A1.]

 Why did no crisis erupt when the dollar plunged recently to record lows against the yen? Why did a huge crisis erupt when the pound slipped a few percent against the mark? The answer holds plenty of pointers about the future of Europe's -- and the world's -- monetary system. News Analysis. [D1.]
A look at the last quarter illustrates the twinned risks of foreign recessions and currency market convulsions. Britain? Stock prices were about even, but the pound's decline gave American investors a 6.4 percent loss. Germany? Stocks were off so sharply as the economy slowed that the mark's strength merely limited American losses to 9.6 percent. [D3.]
 
The Media Business
 At NBC, daytime programming is under pressure. "We're not really a network anymore," Warren Littlefield, president of NBC Entertainment, said of daytime operations. [D1.]
Does the British invasion of top magazine editors' jobs reflect better language skills, snob appeal or what? Deirdre Carmody: Magazines. [D6.]
Kmart is undertaking an intensive effort to sell fashion amid aisles of appliances, weed killer and toothpaste. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D7.]
How street book peddlers get their wares and how they manage to sell them for such low prices is a mystery that has vexed city authorities and bookstore owners. Street merchants say they buy their books legitimately and just make smaller profits. [D6.]
The success of Details, the two-year-old men's fashion magazine, came even though it broke the No. 1 rule for success by repeatedly changing its identity. [D6.]

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
D'Amato and Abrams: Tit-for-Tat War on Ethics

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Forget recession, health care and the environment. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and State Attorney General Robert Abrams have managed to make the New York campaign for the Senate a contest of "Really, Bob!" vs. "Come on, Al!" -- a tit-for-tat war of television commercial tag lines, listing each other's supposed sins.
That is just how Mr. D'Amato wants it since he has been under fire for years over his personal ethics and faces a tough fight for a third term. Mr. Abrams, adopting the prevailing political wisdom that an attack left unrebutted is an attack that might ring true, has responded in kind. 
 But all the buzzing back and forth not only relegates other issues to the sidelines but also obscures the marked differences between the kinds of ethical questions repeatedly raised about Mr. D'Amato's conduct in office and a state commission's criticism of Mr. Abrams's fund-raising practices several years ago.
"He's trying to muddy the water," Maureen Connelly, a Manhattan political consultant who has worked for both Republicans and Democrats and is not involved in this race, said of Mr. D'Amato's aggressive advertising, which began the day after Mr. Abrams's narrow primary victory. "It's like a local version of comparing whether Clinton evaded the draft with whether Bush knew about Iran-contra. They're not the same thing."
Local media consultants and political strategists say they are not sure Mr. D'Amato's strategy will work since Mr. Abrams is a well-known and record vote-getter statewide with a strong reputation. But they say the Senator's efforts are tactically brilliant in several ways.
First, Mr. D'Amato -- with a war chest of nearly $4 million, compared with $750,000 for Mr. Abrams when the general-election campaign began -- promptly defined the terms of the debate, putting Mr. Abrams on the defensive and forcing him to scurry out from fund-raising efforts to rebut a wave of insinuations. Mr. Abrams is also trying to stress his differences with Mr. D'Amato on issues like abortion rights, but with limited time and money, his advisers say, he cannot afford to let Mr. D'Amato's attacks reverberate unanswered.
Second, a bruising primary fight in which Mr. Abrams and City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman made harsh attacks on the ethics and personal finances of their rival, Geraldine A. Ferraro, enabled Mr. D'Amato to paint Mr. Abrams as a nasty brawler, while the Senator himself could point to the upbeat radio ads stressing his reputation for constituent service that he had been broadcasting for weeks. Ms. Ferraro's angry refusal for two weeks to concede defeat, and her continued reluctance to endorse Mr. Abrams, only helped foster this image.
Third, Mr. Abrams himself gave Mr. D'Amato the slenderest of openings by saying in his election night speech that he wanted to go to Washington to "shake things up" while Mr. D'Amato had been there "shaking people down." Within 48 hours, Mr. D'Amato was broadcasting ads accusing Mr. Abrams of a "fund-raising shakedown" for soliciting contributions in his past campaigns for Attorney General from people who had business pending before his office -- and asserting that he was merely answering Mr. Abrams's invective.
 
'A Calculated Decision'
 "I think D'Amato made a calculated decision that this was not going to be a Senate race between two honest people of high character and that his only option was to drag Abrams down, so it becomes a contest between two people who are tarnished," said Hank Morris, a Democratic political consultant.
But there are real differences in the patinas of Mr. D'Amato's political pot and Mr. Abrams's kettle.
Mr. D'Amato has figured at one time or another in recent years in investigations by the Justice Department, the United States Attorneys in Manhattan and Brooklyn, the Nassau County prosecutor, the State Investigation Commission and the special prosecutor investigating allegations of political favoritism at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The Senator is fond of saying he has never been charged with any wrongdoing, and he refers to a Senate ethics committee report, after a lengthy investigation into purported favors for contributors and other matters, that he says "cleared" him. In fact, the committee found "insufficient, credible evidence of wrongdoing" by Mr. D'Amato, a clenched-teeth finding by a body of his colleagues not known for being harsh on their own.
But the committee's report said he had conducted "the business of his office in an improper and inappropriate manner" that allowed his brother, Armand, to use the office to lobby for a defense contractor.
By contrast, Mr. D'Amato's allegations about Mr. Abrams center on the 1989 report of the State Commission on Government Integrity, which criticized Mr. Abrams, along with other statewide officials, for soliciting contributions in person from real-estate developers and others who had business before his office.
The commission said such practices raised "appearances of conflicts of interest, many of which are similar to those we have noted in our analysis of other statewide elected officials."
Richard D. Emery, a Manhattan lawyer who was a member of the commission and among those who criticized Mr. Abrams most harshly at the time, said any comparison between Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Abrams in this regard was not apt.
 
'Exactly the Opposite'
 "Our criticism of Bob Abrams was based on the appearance of influence, without any finding whatsoever, even a hint of a finding, of any quid pro quo for a contribution," said Mr. Emery, who stressed he was speaking personally and not for the commission and who acknowledged that he now supported Mr. Abrams's campaign.
"The situation is exactly the opposite with Al D'Amato -- repeated allegations of favors for contributors. The only reason Al D'Amato didn't get slammed by the Feerick Commission far worse than anyone else is that he's a Federal official and we didn't examine their conduct."
Mr. D'Amato's barrages pose risks for Mr. Abrams, if only because they force him to respond, and serve to keep the disputes alive. But some experts say Mr. D'Amato may be pushing too hard. For example, he is now broadcasting a radio ad that uses two votes by Mr. Abrams in the State Assembly 26 years ago in an effort to paint him as soft on crime for voting against a bill that allowed for denial of parole to convicted murderers.
"Crime has always been an important issue to the voters of this state, and his views are relevant," said Mr. D'Amato's campaign spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha.
But Mr. Morris, the political consultant, said Mr. D'Amato's tactics cut both ways. "If you're Al D'Amato, you don't want the agenda to be ethics," he said. "But by doing what he's doing, he's guaranteeing that it becomes part of the agenda."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Details Magazine Defies Fickle Ads and Fashions

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
The success of Details, the two-year-old newcomer to men's fashion magazines, presents a compelling contrast to last week's demise of M magazine.
M is being closed because, it contends, there is not enough advertising in the men's luxury marketplace to go around. But Details' entry into the field just as advertising had begun its plunge shows that the right magazine at the right time can succeed -- if it has enough money behind it. 
 The story of Details is particularly striking because it broke the No. 1 rule for success by repeatedly changing its identity. Details began as a funky downtown Manhattan publication, scrapped that format, reinvented itself as a funky men's magazine, foundered badly, reinvented itself again in a more mainstream mode and finally got it right.
And just to make things more difficult, the target audience was young men in their 20's, a group with no previous history of reading magazines. Or much of anything else, for that matter.
"Women historically have been magazine readers, but men don't read magazines; just look at the numbers," said Arthur Cooper, editor in chief of GQ, the older corporate brother of Details and the leader in the men's fashion magazine field with a circulation of 636,000.
When S. I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Conde Nast, bought Details in 1988, its circulation was about 100,000. It finished the first six months of this year with an average paid circulation of 250,300.
Mitchell B. Fox, publisher of Details, said circulation in September would total 330,000. For the first six months of the year, Details' newsstand sales of 122,182 surpassed Esquire's 118,869, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations -- although Details' overall circulation is almost a third less.
 
Advertising Rises
 Details' advertising pages have also continued to rise. Stephen Croncota, the magazine's marketing director, said 269 pages had been sold so far for the last quarter of 1992, more than double the 120 pages in the last quarter of 1990, right after the magazine was reintroduced with a new design. And all of this growth came during the most perilous period in decades for magazine publishing.
"It's sort of found a nice niche with the young, college-graduate yuppie," said Martin S. Walker, chairman of Walker Communications, a magazine consultant. "If you look at Esquire and GQ, they are too old, too mature for this group. Esquire looks a little tired. GQ is not for the mid-20's, early 30's. Details has found that niche."
Mr. Walker said he thought M failed because its publisher, Fairchild Publications, while very successful in putting out trade publications like Women's Wear Daily, did not really know how to market a consumer magazine. That, however, is a forte of Conde Nast.
Unlike so many fledgling and underfinanced publications that struggle to survive, Details has the backing of Mr. Newhouse, who is known for his deep pockets and generous commitment to his company's new magazines. Mr. Newhouse, who started both the revamped Details and Allure during the recession, is fond of saying there is no such thing as a good time or a bad time to start a magazine as long as the idea is right.
Mr. Newhouse acquired Details four years ago for a reported $2 million. Since Conde Nast is a privately held company and does not divulge financial information, Mr. Fox declined to talk about how much had been invested to overhaul Details or when it was expected to turn a profit.
 
Magazine's Transformation
 In September 1990, Details went from covering the hip downtown scene to becoming a magazine for hip young men who hang around clubs. The redesigned magazine had a bold, tabloid style with a kind of neon look to its slashing, jagged design.
But it was too jarring for many of the advertisers the magazine hoped to court. "We held out a long time; it was just too radical," said Maryanne Harmon, senior vice president and director of media planning for the Arnell Bickford agency, who places ads for Ray Ban glasses.
James Truman, the magazine's editor in chief, agreed. "It looked like nothing on earth," he said. "It was very rough, very raw. People would stop me on the street and say, 'I hate your magazine.' "
The magazine still has an irreverent tone, as exemplified in the comments of its panel of style commentators on the fashions of passers-by. The members range from the designer Bill Blass to Play, a member of the rap group Kid 'n' Play. (Sample panel comment: "He's trying real hard to get the white homeboy thing happening," said Anka Radakovich, Details sex and style columnist. "But something about those baggy pants reminds me of children's snowsuits.")
Mr. Truman explained that Ms. Radakovich did all the "sexual pieces" in the magazine "because the last thing I want with the magazine is that kind of locker-room, sexual tone."
The October issue includes articles on the Needle Boys, who pump up their bodies with steroids to get high; "Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down, a Day in the Life of a Dominatrix," about the nether world of sadomasochism and an interview with the poet Allen Ginsberg.
"The magazine does a really good job at talking to young men in an intelligent and entertaining way," Ms. Harmon of Arnell Bickford said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Industrial Midwest;
An Inert Economy Is Driving Rust-Belt Voters From Bush

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 4

 BODY:
It may be a measure of the economy's dismal performance that stasis is good and that the Middle West, for all its dependence on manufacturing and its all-but-imperceptible growth, is seen as the bright spot in an elusive recovery.
Unemployment in most Middle Western states is below the national average, production outpaces the rest of the nation, however meagerly, and real estate, which never boomed here, has not gone bust. 
 The weak dollar has meant greater demand abroad for the machinery made here, although the advantages have been tempered by recessions in Europe and Japan. And the region has been spared the pain of most of the cuts in military industries; it never had much of that business to begin with.
 
Calm Facade Belies Anger
 This would seem to make the Middle West a safe haven for an incumbent President running on the premise that things are not as bad as they seem.
But in interviews with more than 90 voters in three Rust Belt towns that voted Reagan-Reagan-Bush in the last elections -- Peoria, Ill., Springfield, Ohio, and Roseville, Mich. -- there was anger and ferment over an economy that seems adrift, and disgust with all the Presidential candidates.
Terri Bowler and Lynette Randall are two Michigan women with blue-collar husbands, bills backing up and a sinking feeling that things will not get better any time soon. To them, recession is an economist's word. They only know that life is hard and that it wasn't supposed to be this way with George Bush in the White House.
They both left their Democratic roots to vote for Mr. Bush in 1988, as they had for Ronald Reagan before him. Now, over a cup of coffee in Mrs. Randall's Roseville kitchen in the heart of the bellwether county of Macomb, Mrs. Bowler said President Bush had let her down.
"He didn't do anything I wanted him to do," she said. "I wanted sunshine. I wanted to see the rainbow. The rainbow didn't come. It's like Christmas, and there's nothing under the tree for us with Bush."
People like Mrs. Bowler matter a lot this election season. Many strategists say it is here, in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin, that the election will be won or lost four weeks from now.
These states took a beating in the early 1980's, enduring double-digit unemployment as manufacturers retooled and eliminated jobs.
The region's identity is still bound up in making things -- automobiles and bearings, sheet metal and machine tools. People here are wise to the cycles of the economy. They expect layoffs when demand is down; they work overtime when orders pick up. And the numbers suggest that this recession is not nearly so painful as the last.
Nevertheless, people say it is tough to find a job that pays enough to feed a family. Many work two or more jobs and constantly fear layoffs and plant closings. They are angry that they cannot afford a movie or dinner out. And it does not seem to matter that they may be doing better than people in Massachusetts when they are having trouble paying their bills.
"This is about as good as it gets, and people find it hard to believe," said Diane Swonk, the senior regional economist at First National Bank of Chicago. "We're not the ones at the bottom of the barrel this time. We're doing relatively well, but 'relative' is a dangerous word in this economy."
Middle Westerners have watched an entire way of life phased out in less than a decade: the loss of high-paying factory jobs that allowed a high school dropout to raise a family comfortably.
More than anything else they want to see the economy moving again.
Whether Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic nominee, smoked marijuana a generation ago or whether his wife, Hillary, takes depositions as a lawyer or bakes cookies as a mother is irrelevant to them. Many say they do not care much whether President Bush is being held back by Congress or knew about the Iran-contra arms-for-hostages deal, and they have become so cynical that they say they have come to expect scandal and mendacity in public officials.
"They all lie," declared Betty Dye, a Springfield cafeteria worker who voted for Mr. Bush in 1988. "They'll say anything to get in. Nobody cares about us. We have to take care of ourselves."
What these people say they want is someone who can fix the economy. They worry about whether Governor Clinton would do what he says and how much it would cost them. They worry about whether Mr. Bush really understands their misery. They fear that a trade agreement with Mexico, which Mr. Bush has long supported and which Mr. Clinton endorsed today, will take more jobs away. And they seem soured on Ross Perot for leaving them the last time.
 
Rust-Belt Dinosaurs
 Patrick Mantel had a pained and heavy look on his face as he sat with a half-dozen fellow Navistar workers on a park bench near their plant in Springfield the other day. They compared check stubs and war stories about the times they'd been laid off, and commiserated about the second and third jobs they had taken to help pay the bills. They talked about being dinosaurs.
"I don't see a future," said the 29-year-old Mr. Mantel, a Budweiser in one hand, a Marlboro in the other. "I work seven days a week, and I still can't save any money. I got two kids, a wife and a house payment. I don't know what's going to happen with my kids. I don't even know how to plan for them. My future is very unstable."
Over his shoulder-length hair, Mr. Mantel wore an old white cap that said, "International," as in International Harvester, Navistar's old incarnation as a giant farm-equipment manufacturer with 57,000 workers. Restructured in the mid-1980's, it now makes trucks and diesel engines and has 12,000 workers.
Downtown Springfield, along High and Main Streets, is haunted by the ghosts of a once-booming city: the old Block's Department Store, the shuttered State Theater on Fountain Street, an empty office-machines shop on Columbia Street, the boarded-up Tecumseh Building, the "Rent Me" signs instructing potential tenants to "Call Big Al."
For many residents, all the goodwill that Mr. Bush earned during the Persian Gulf war has evaporated. "He's not a hero like he was then," said Hiram Van Hoose, a retired tool-and-die maker in Springfield who is a Republican. "Look at all those old factories. Those jobs are never coming back."
 
'We've Gotta Have Change'
 Such sentiments make this fertile soil for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Perot. Between them, Mr. Clinton seems to have a tremendous edge here. People say they are afraid to waste their vote on Mr. Perot, whom many see as a spoiler. Some speak with a sense of urgency about the race, as if their mortgages were on the line.
"My God, we've gotta have change," Mr. Mantel said, throwing his hands in the air. "If we all split our votes, Bush'll get in again."
For all the Sturm und Drang, Ohio has not been hurt nearly as bad as it was in previous recessions. Unemployment is 7.1 percent, as against 7.5 percent nationally. The state has lost about 200,000 manufacturing jobs since the recession of the early 1980's, according to figures from the Ohio Department of Development. At the same time, it has gained close to 700,000 new jobs, many of them lower paying and service oriented.
"Unlike the national economy, in Ohio it has been a moderate downturn," said Richard K. Vedder, a professor of economics at Ohio University in Athens. "I'm not saying all is hunky-dory. But compared with other recessions and other states, for the first time in my life, we can be a little bit smug."
That is exactly how John Fisher, an assembler at Navistar, feels. And that is why he says he is sticking with President Bush.
"I have five kids, three grandkids, a Mustang, a Firebird, a Ford Ranger, an '89 Camaro, a '92 Chevy van at 8.9 percent interest, a color T.V., a V.C.R. and a Nintendo," Mr. Fisher said. "Am I doing good or what? I'm doing damn good since Jimmy Carter got out of office. I don't want a change."
 
G.O.P. Still Plays in Peoria
 Peoria is Bush country -- mostly Republican, moderate to conservative, looking fairly prosperous with several new glass office towers downtown flanked with flowers.
But Peoria is feeling the pressure, too. Everyone seems to know someone who has been laid off or looking for extra work, and even the most well-situated professionals pay close attention to what happens at Caterpillar, the maker of earth-moving equipment and the city's biggest employer.
The city bottomed out in the mid-1980's after Caterpillar laid off half its 38,000 workers and the housing market crashed. Back then one out of every four Peorians worked for Caterpillar. Now it is about one out of 12.
After watching the boom on the coasts through the 1980's, Illinois, like much of the region, is benefiting from the relative restraint that businesses here had to show just to stay afloat during that decade.
Still, many Peorians are agonizing over what to do on Nov. 3.
"I really consider myself a Republican, but I'm marginal right now," said Thomas Russell, a computer consultant who was a Perot supporter before the Texas billionaire dropped out in July. "I'm disappointed in all three of them. I'm just looking for somebody to give me a reason."
A moderate, he was turned off by the Republican convention, saying, "They're catering to the far-right Bible vote."
Edward Habecker, a 39-year-old Peoria lawyer who voted for Mr. Bush in 1988, said he was leaning toward Clinton because when he thought about all the things President Bush said he was going to be -- the Education President, the Environment President, the anti-drug President -- he saw broken promises.
"I think Bush enjoys being President, like you enjoy being president of your class in high school," Mr. Habecker said. "I'm just not sold on his commitment to making America a better place for the average American."
He worries about whether Governor. Clinton is a "wild liberal" beneath the veneer of moderation, but says he is willing to take a chance on him: "It's change for change's sake almost."
In interview after interview, people seemed willing to give Mr. Bush his due on foreign affairs but seemed to hold it against him at the same time.
"I think he's forgotten what country he's president of," said Sally McQuellon, a Peoria legal clerk.
 
Blue-Collar Michigan Suffers
 Macomb County, Mich., with its brake shops and Dairy Queens, would seem an unlikely kingmaker. But that is precisely how it has come to be seen in recent elections, as candidates come courting its well-paid, blue-collar voters who were born Democrats but will vote Republican in an eye blink.
Kelley Wolfgang of Roseville is one of them. A draftsman and mother of two, she was laid off last week when the machine shop where she worked closed. If she is typical of Reagan Democrats, Mr. Bush may be in for a long four weeks.
"I'm lower middle class and falling," Mrs. Wolfgang said. "We had a good roll for a while in the '80's. We were riding high. Everybody had a job. Everybody was working. Everybody had money. That's over. We're supposed to growing, and we're not."
She says she plans to vote for Mr. Clinton. "The only way to have change is change," she said.
Of all the Middle Western states, Michigan is faring the worst, the only one whose unemployment rate, at 8.8 percent, exceeds the national average.
"Everybody here is used to being out of work occasionally," said Les Koska, an economist at the National Bank of Detroit. "But this recession is dragging on so long you can't see the turnaround coming."
The cutbacks and plant closings at General Motors weigh heavily on every Michigan resident. The fact that the state is doing better than in the last recession seems to make little difference to people like Rob Schippert, an unemployed mechanic and the father of two in Roseville. He normally takes care of his family by calibrating gear measurements for machine shops. But now, "business is so slow they can't afford to have me come in."
He is selling his house because he can no longer keep up the payments. His wife has taken a job at an Air Force commissary. He takes odd jobs to help pay the bills, and he has worked out a deal with a machine shop: he works for free in exchange for health benefits he could not otherwise afford.
He said he had made up his mind and was going with Mr. Clinton. "I wasn't paying much attention before this election," Mr. Schippert said. "Now that I'm losing everything, I'm waking up."

HEADLINE: Waiting for Consumers to Spend

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Sometimes a burst of consumer spending lifts the nation out of recession. Sometimes a pickup in housing construction does the trick. Sometimes business investment gives the economy the needed push forward.
And with the dollar so weak, many economists and Government officials have been hoping that exports, for the first time, will pave the way to a robust recovery. 
 But all these engines of economic growth have stalled or malfunctioned. So, lacking anywhere else to turn, many economists are looking to that abiding American hero, the consumer, for a push-start.
 
Confidence Ebbing
 All that is needed, they say, is a surge in consumer confidence, which remains stubbornly low. Then consumers would loosen the purse strings and start spending again. Because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic output, that would do the trick, getting factories humming again.
"The reason they're not spending is they're concerned about their own and their families' prospects and job security," said Humphrey Taylor, president of Louis Harris & Associates, the polling organization. "Until these concerns change, which is a psychological thing, not a material one, confidence is going to stay low."
So the question becomes: What will it take to lift consumers out of the dumps?
A cornucopia of proposals have urged government to do more to cheer up consumers. Those recommendations include an aggressive round of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve going well beyond the Fed's previous cuts, new tax incentives that would stimulate investment, and a multibillion-dollar public investment program that would put Americans back to work.
The push for a large public works program got a lift today from economic advisers to Gov. Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. Appearing on "Meet the Press" on NBC, Robert Reich, an adviser to Mr. Clinton, and John P. White, author of Mr. Perot's deficit-reduction plan, called for fiscal stimulus if the economy does not pick up soon.
"If, in fact, we are in the state we're in for several more months, which would be tragic," Mr. White said, "then there's going to have to be something else done in a stimulus way."
Mr. Reich said he agreed that if the economy is as bad in January as it is now, he would accelerate planned spending for public investment. Mr. White and Mr. Reich said any fiscal stimulus, which would increase the estimated $330 billion budget deficit, should be accompanied by a serious plan to reduce the deficit longer term.
Previous administrations often used fiscal stimulus, sometimes called pump-priming, to propel the nation out of recession. But many Bush Administration officials and economists have opposed this approach because it would increase the budget deficit.
On "Meet the Press," Richard G. Darman, the Administration's budget director, said he favored some acceleration of planned spending to speed up growth, but he added, "If we became much too loose minded in the short term, we would just compound the long-term problem."
But economics handicappers say fiscal stimulus and other new Government efforts to end the slump appear highly unlikely over the next few months.
 
A Vicious Circle
 Still, one thing is clear: if consumers do not get out of their funk soon, the economy will remain in a funk for months. Many forecasters fear that growth will remain anemic well into 1993, languishing far below the 3 percent rate needed to get the jobless rate down significantly.
In the view of some economists, the election results might make a big difference for consumer confidence. Some say Mr. Clinton, simply as a new presence in the White House, could give a psychological lift to depressed consumers and businesses.
"If we give a new Clinton Administration the benefit of the doubt, and they come on real strong and give us lots of happy talk the way Ronald Reagan did, maybe that will revive animal spirits and consumer confidence enough that it would feed on itself and the economy would improve," said Edward Yardeni, a prominent Wall Street economist at the C. J. Lawrence brokerage firm.
But Jason Bram, a consumer research expert at the Conference Board, a research organization, argued that whoever is elected will make little difference to confidence. "If the 48 percent who voted for the new President feel more confident, and the 42 percent who voted against don't, it's not going to have a big effect," he said.
The economy appears to be caught in a vicious circle. When Americans trim their spending, sales weaken, pushing Corporate America to lay off workers and hold the line on pay increases. This in turn squeezes household incomes, contributing to a downward spiral.
"What's making people so cautious is you just haven't had much job growth," said David D. Hale, chief economist for the Kemper Financial Companies in Chicago.
Last Friday's employment report is not expected to raise confidence; the decline in the jobless rate to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent was coupled with a drop of 57,000 in the number of Americans employed. While the nation is technically out of recession, growth remains so feeble, at around 1.5 percent, that employment has stubbornly refused to grow.
Federal Reserve officials see some rays of hope. Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, and his colleagues see a halting pickup, as consumers reduce the huge debts they developed during the overheated binge years of the 1980's.
But Fed officials acknowledge that the process will not be easy. Even as Americans pay off their debts, the value of many homes has declined, making the owners feel their financial plight is not improving.
"We are moving along slowly, painstakingly, in working our way through these problems," said David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. "We believe this period is systematically laying the foundation for a much healthier economy going forward, one in which debt ratios are in line, in which businesses are far more competitive, and in which inflation is much lower."
No one will ever broadcast nationwide that debt levels have dropped so much that every American should start spending again. Instead, Americans here and there will conclude they can loosen their purse strings.
"There is no real catalyst that is suddenly going to catapult us into a boom," said Mr. Bram of the Conference Board. On Tuesday, the Conference Board reported its index of confidence, with 100 being normal, slipped to 56.4 in September from 59 in August.
Earlier this year, consumers did their duty and went on a spending spree. In the first quarter, consumer spending soared 5.1 percent. But in the second quarter it fell.
The problem was that this boomlet was not matched by improved business confidence. Like consumers, corporate executives felt queasy about the economy, and despite the jump in consumer spending, they remained reluctant to invest or increase production.
 
Profits Up, Investment Down
 "When consumer spending picked up, we didn't have the follow-through of employment and capital investment," said Roger E. Brinner, chief economist at DRI-McGraw Hill. "The business community turned so conservative about the strength and durability of this recovery that they said, 'I'm going to wait until this is a convincing recovery.' The business community, acting very logically, one by one short-circuited the normal recovery process."
Many businesses also hoped to expand by selling more abroad, but export growth stalled as Europe and Japan became mired in slumps.
Now, no one expects business confidence to revive magically. Even though corporate profits are up, reflecting the reduced costs brought on by layoffs and plant closings, investment remains weak because executives see little need to expand.
 
Investment Incentives Sought
 That leads to the call for investment incentives, like temporary investment tax credits or accelerated depreciation allowances. Higher investment would increase employment and consumer confidence, healthy developments that should feed on themselves.
"If the Government took some of its wasteful expenditures," said Allan Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, "and put that to use in the form of incentives to spur investment, I think within six months we'd see some good effects on the economy."
While Republicans stress investment incentives, Democrats urge public works spending to lift the economy. Many Democrats, including Mr. Clinton, support heavy investment in new highways, railroads and telecommunications systems, even though this would increase the estimated $330 billion budget deficit.
In this view, public investment will help build a more efficient economy and serve as the most readily available engine to encourage growth and jobs while other sectors languish.

HEADLINE: U.S. Social Well-Being Is Rated Lowest Since Study Began in 1970

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
With reports of child abuse and teen-age suicide on the rise, and with older Americans spending more of their income on health care, the nation's overall social well-being has skidded to its lowest point since the study began in 1970, according to an index tabulated by social scientists at Fordham University that was released today.
The annual study, "The Index of Social Health," seeks to evaluate the cumulative effect on Americans of 16 major social problems, among them unemployment, drug abuse and highway deaths linked to alcoholism. In an effort to quantify the overall impact of those problems, the study boils down reams of national statistics, most of them gathered by the Federal Government, into a single, annual measure on a scale of zero to 100. 
 In 1970, the first year the index was calculated, it stood at 75. But in 1990, the last year for which complete statistics are available, the index plummeted to 42, a decrease of 44 percent over 21 years. The index reached a high of 79 in 1972 and has fallen fairly steadily ever since.
"What's troubling to me is that the social health of the country has been so low for so long," said Dr. Marc L. Miringoff, the author of the study and the director of the Fordham Institute for Innovation in Social Policy in Tarrytown, N.Y.
"While the economic indicators in the 1980's went up generally after the '82 recession, the social indicators that I measure really remained at a low point," Dr. Miringoff said. "The general trough that we've reached may explain, in part, why people feel a bit more hopeless than they did in 1982."
A companion study, "The Index of Social Health for Children and Youth," found that the social well-being of American children declined in 1990 for the fifth consecutive year, to a record-low of 44. The children's index hit its highest point, 78, in 1976.
Dr. Miringoff described child abuse as the social problem that became most acute over the 21-year period measured in the children's study. "The rate of reported child abuse in 1990 was more than four times the rate in 1970, and it has worsened every year without exception since 1970," he wrote.
He also cited the number of children living in poverty -- a figure that has increased 33 percent since 1970 -- and the rate of suicide among teen-agers, which doubled during the same period.
Those statistics also helped drive down the overall index of social health, Dr. Miringoff said. Another factor measured by the index included the poverty rate among Americans over 65 years old, which improved nearly 50 percent during the 21-year period of the study.
In addition, the study found, older Americans spent a greater percentage of their income on health costs than in any other year since 1970. The index also showed that the gap between the incomes of the nation's richest and poorest families had widened to a record degree in 1990.

HEADLINE: FATE OF TAX BILL IS FAR FROM CLEAR

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Congressional negotiators have agreed on a tax bill that offers more than $27 billion in tax breaks and investment incentives in the next five years, many of them meant to aid depressed cities, help the housing industry and encourage personal savings and industrial investment.
The measure, which the conferees are expected to present to the House and Senate this week, puts President Bush in a political bind: should he sign or veto a bill that cuts some taxes and raises others, including some of each proposed by his Administration? To pay for the tax breaks and incentives, Congress raised dozens of taxes and curtailed some deductions, just the kind of approach that Mr. Bush has so often criticized Gov. Bill Clinton for approving.
 
Bush Stance Hard to Predict
 Some provisions that increase taxes were proposed by Congress, like the limit on the deductibility of moving expenses for people changing jobs. Others were proposed by the Administration, like changes in quarterly tax payments by corporations and the self-employed. 
 Whether any of the provisions might lead Mr. Bush to veto the entire bill is unclear. Even some Republican lawmakers had complained during the negotiations that they were not certain what Mr. Bush considered an unacceptable tax increase.
Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, said today that the White House would have to examine the bill in detail before the President decided whether to sign it. "It isn't a tax-increase bill if he's going to sign it, let me just say that," Mr. Darman said in an appearance on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
Mr. Clinton said today that the bill "does raise taxes to pay for good things."
"There's no question that if he signs it," Mr. Clinton added, "it's inconsistent with his position, which is that he is not going to raise any taxes, even though we all know he's raised a slew of them."
On Saturday, Mr. Bush kept his vow to veto another bill, one that would regulate the price of local cable television services. It was the President's 36th veto, and came in the face of large majorities that approved the bill in each house.
A vote seeking to override is scheduled for Monday afternoon, and Mr. Bush and his aides spent today vigorously lobbying for votes to sustain the veto. Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming said that at a White House breakfast for Republican senators, Mr. Bush criticized the Democratic leadership, saying: "They're out to embarrass me. Now we are down to raw politics."
Senator Simpson said he would switch his vote to accommodate the President.
 
10 Days for Bush to Decide
 If Congress passes the tax bill before its scheduled adjournment, which could be as early as Tuesday, President Bush will have 10 days to decide whether to sign it. That is a period during which he will for the first time debate both Governor Clinton, who says he would focus tax increases on the wealthy, and Ross Perot, the independent candidate who has called for tax increases to be shared by the middle class.
If the President does nothing, the bill will die by a "pocket veto," which Congress could not override because it would be out of town campaigning.
The Congressional negotiations culminated late Saturday night with a tentative agreement that House and Senate members of the taxation committees are likely to present to the full Congress on Monday or Tuesday, after staff experts finish up the technicalities today.
During the negotiations, conducted mainly by the Senate Finance Committee chairman, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, and the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the lawmakers dropped two provisions that would have made permanent some temporary tax increases on upper-income taxpayers that are scheduled to expire in the next few years. Those provisions would surely have invited a veto.
To pay for that change, the conferees scaled back Senator Bentsen's proposal to expand the availability of tax-deferred individual retirement accounts. The bill would nonetheless make tax-deferred I.R.A.'s available to individuals with income of up to $75,000 and couples with income of up to $100,000 -- ceilings considerably higher than current limitations.
In addition, the lawmakers focused their attention on revenue-raising provisions that the Bush Administration proposed at the beginning of this year, when it presented its budget and economic program to the Congress.
 
Obscure but Significant Steps
 Many of these provisions are not well understood by the voting public, but they can make a big difference to the affected individuals and businesses.
A good example is a provision that would change the way stock and bond dealers value the inventories of securities that they hold at the end of each year. Under current law, traders may value their inventories at the lower of two prices: what the security was originally purchased for or its current market price. This allows them to avoid reporting paper profits that would be subject to tax.
The President's proposal, which has been adopted with some changes by the Congressional negotiators, would force traders to report the paper profits at the end of each year, raising an estimated $3.7 billion by 1997.
Another provision, which lawmakers approved after Bush Administration officials said during hearings that they would support it, would raise $3.9 billion from individuals and $5.7 billion from corporations by requiring them, when they estimate their taxes, to set aside a larger payment in each quarter in order to avoid possible penalties for underpayment at the end of the year. While the actual tax owed would not change, many people and companies would end up paying it earlier.
Several tax increases in the bill were put there by Congress, not the Administration.
For example, the lawmakers set a limit of $10,000 on moving expenses that can be deducted by people when they take new jobs, and disqualified the closing costs of buying a home from the acceptable deductions. That would raise an estimated $3.2 billion in new revenues.
They also decided to delay previously scheduled reductions in estate taxes, raising $1.4 billion from wealthier individuals. The lawmakers raised another $1.4 billion by disqualifying private club dues as a business deduction.
 
Items That Bush Favors
 The bill also has many tax cuts that Mr. Bush proposed. One is the "passive loss" provision, costing $2.1 billion, which would let investors in real estate deduct their losses from other forms of income. But this was more than offset by lengthening the time over which real estate can be depreciated. By slowing down the deductions, the legislation would raise $3 billion.
Another measure that is favored by Mr. Bush is the repeal of luxury taxes on expensive boats, planes and furs. This cut will cost $540 million. It is partially offset, though, by repealing the exemption from diesel-fuel taxes that is currently granted to yacht owners. Mr. Bush had also proposed an end to the luxury tax on expensive cars, but Congress did not go along.
Several other proposals by Mr. Bush to reduce taxes were not included in the agreement reached by lawmakers.
For example, the measure does not include a special tax credit for first-time home buyers or an increase in the depreciation that could be taken by businesses in the first year after making a capital investment.
 
Some Omissions, Too
 Congress never seriously considered the President's often-repeated request for a reduction in the capital gains tax on individuals, although the compromise bill's enterprise-zone provisions do include such a cut for businesses that invest in economically depressed areas.
Jack Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said today on the ABC News program "This Week With David Brinkley" that the Congressional urban program "basically isn't going to get the job done."
If Mr. Bush chose, he could veto the bill for what it left out, rather than for the tax increases it included.

IN 1984, as almost everyone in the world must know by now, Tina Brown, editor of The Tatler, left London to come to New York and take over as editor in chief of Vanity Fair. What no one knew, however, was that a British invasion of American magazines had begun.
Ms. Brown was followed three years later by Anna Wintour, editor in chief of British Vogue, who took over HG and soon thereafter Vogue. Over the next few years, British editors took over the helm at The National Review, Conde Nast Traveler, Details, The New Republic, TV Guide and Harper's Bazaar. 
 Ms. Brown is now the editor of The New Yorker. And just last week, Gabe Doppelt, a South African who was trained in London by both Ms. Brown and Ms. Wintour, became editor in chief of Mademoiselle.
What is going on here?
"It may be that the English are so well trained in language and that we are experiencing a reinvigorated appreciation of language, partly in reaction to TV omissions and partly because language counts," said Roger Rosenblatt, a contributing editor at The New Republic and Vanity Fair.
Or maybe this is just snob appeal. As Mr. Rosenblatt puts it, "The Economist is everybody's favorite magazine to call their favorite magazine."
British editors may simply carry a kind of cachet, which probably has more to do with their accents than their editing. "I think we are talking about images," said Edwin Diamond, media critic for New York magazine. "I think it is an emotional love affair. I don't think there is any confirmed data that says that British women have better taste or sharper editing instincts than American women."
Nonetheless, charismatic force seems to be an increasingly requisite quality for editors of high-profile magazines. When Hearst wanted to shore up Harper's Bazaar this year, it turned to Elizabeth Tilberis, a glamourous and talented editor who succeeded Ms. Wintour at British Vogue. Ms. Tilberis's first issue of Harper's Bazaar was a self-proclaimed testament to the new elegance in fashion -- and its very elegance became an unstated testament to the renewed vigor of the tired magazine.
The British influence extends beyond magazines. Harry Evans former editor of The Times of London, became founding editor of Conde Nast Traveler and later became president of Random House. (Mr. Evans reports to Alberto Vitale, who was born in Italy and raised in Egypt and who also has under him Sonny Mehta, an Indian who worked for many years in Britain and now heads Knopf.)
But British publications are known for taking not only the high road -- glossy, gossipy magazines with beautiful pictures of aristocrats and royalty -- but the low road of lurid tabloid journalism. Interestingly, three American equivalents -- The Star, The National Enquirer and The Globe, all supermarket tabloids -- are headed by British editors.
In fact, some people say there is a kind of high-culture, low-culture synthesis that is peculiarly British. It is the mix of soap opera reportage and investigative journalism that Anthea Disney is bringing to TV Guide and the mix of celebrity and serious journalism that became the mark of Vanity Fair under Tina Brown.
Graydon Carter, a Canadian who succeeded Ms. Brown at Vanity Fair, said British magazines, which have smaller circulations than their American counterparts, were more conducive to experimentation. "You can be braver and more adventurous if the mistake may be the difference of 10,000 copies in Britain than of 300,000 here," he said.
David Hirshey, deputy editor of Esquire, agrees. "We are going through a particularly cautious phase in the history of magazines," he said. "In come our British friends with their brash enthusiasm for the daring and the raunchy filtered through this pristine cultivated sensibility that renders them safe for American consumption."
In what would once have been considered an outrage, Ms. Brown is bringing over Alexander Chancellor, a British writer, to edit The New Yorker's "Talk of the Town," a quintessentially American feature.
James Truman, the British editor in chief of Details, says the British sometimes have a sharper ear and a different eye for life here that Americans simply take for granted.
"I think I have an overheated romanticism about American things," said Mr. Truman, who has lived in the United States for 11 years. "I'll sort of get excited about something here, and Americans will look at me and say, 'Are you crazy? That's not exotic.' "
But like Andrew Sullivan, British editor of The New Republic, Mr. Truman said he had come to feel more American than British. "I moved here when I was 22 years old and I felt like I had finally found home."
Mr. Chancellor and the other British journalists Ms. Brown lured to The New Yorker and Vanity Fair are examples of what Leslie Hinton, president of News America Publications, calls "the snowball dynamic when you get English editors who know English editors." The better-known editors are at the top of the mastheads, but the British influence is found throughout many magazines.
"From the pieces Tina Brown selected at Vanity Fair, you could see clearly the British sensibility was driving the magazine," Mr. Rosenblatt said. "The English have certain historical skills, such as the skill of argument with grace. Maybe bring ing in these English editors shows that we are feeling a little more comfortable with ourselves and allowing ourselves to embrace self-mockery."
"We lost self-mockery and irony in the 60's with political seriousness, and we have not gotten them back," he added. "Oddly, we have now sent abroad for them."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Bookstores' Growing Rival: Bargains on the Curb

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN

 BODY:
At the Shakespeare & Company bookstore at 81st Street and Broadway, Stephen King's latest best seller, "Gerald's Game," sells for the publisher's list price of $23. Two blocks north at Barnes & Noble, the book is discounted to $16.10.
But a block south from Shakespeare, on the very same stretch of Broadway on the Upper West Side, Ottavio Quaalini is selling the book from a tabletop for $14. 
 How street book peddlers get their wares and how they manage to sell them for such low prices is a mystery that has vexed city authorities and bookstore owners.
Street merchants say they buy their books legitimately and just make smaller profits on their sales, nothing sinister at all.
 
'Bookstore Without a Roof'
 Mr. Quaalini said he obtained his books "where everyone else gets them," through wholesalers, publishers and other middlemen. And he described his business as "just a bookstore without a roof" -- pointing out part of the street peddlers' competitive edge over bookstores with expensive leased storefronts.
Mr. Quaalini, like every one of more than a dozen book peddlers interviewed in Manhattan, said none of his books were stolen. But he did say he was sure other peddlers were selling stolen books.
Indeed, police officials and many bookstore owners would agree. Booksellers cited rising thefts in their stores, often by professional thieves who somehow conceal and pilfer a dozen books at a time. And the police say many books sold on the street are most likely stolen, but they note that it is nearly impossible to identify a stolen book.
While book peddlers work the sidewalks of many cities, booksellers say they are most pervasive in New York. Broadway, St. Mark's Place, Madison Avenue, Fifth Avenue and other streets often have more outdoor bookstands than indoor bookstores.
 
First Amendment Rights
 Unlike other street vendors, book peddlers enjoy certain constitutional rights. And this presents a moral quandary for many booksellers.
"Balancing the First Amendment issues with the commercial issues is very ticklish," said Avin Domnitz, vice president of the American Booksellers Association and a partner in the Harry W. Schwartz Bookshops in Milwaukee.
"On the one hand, we clearly understand the economic problems of booksellers who pay high rents on nice streets, create ambiance in their stores, pay sales tax, and then some peddler sets up a table across the street and undercuts the bookstore's prices," Mr. Domnitz said. "On the other hand, we understand the need to protect the First Amendment. What if this was Thomas Paine selling 'Common Sense'?"
New York City, citing the First Amendment, does not require book peddlers to obtain the same licenses as other vendors. But the city does require them to collect sales taxes, said Lieut. J J Johnson, commander of the Peddler Task Force for Manhattan South, which runs from 59th Street to Battery Park, from the Hudson River to the East River.
 
Complaints About Vendors
 He said his office received about five complaints a day about book peddlers -- about a fourth of the total vendor-related complaints. Some come from merchants who say the peddlers are obstructing sidewalk traffic, while others come from booksellers who say the peddlers' books are stolen.
"If someone could identify stolen property as being theirs, we could do something," Lieutenant Johnson said. "But with books, it's very hard to prove that these books, even though they're the same titles as the ones that were stolen from your store, are in fact the ones stolen."
He added, "Right now, we are trying to work with the tax department to weed out the illegitimate stands."
But Leonard Riggio, chairman and chief executive of Barnes & Noble and vice chairman of the Fifth Avenue Association, said city officials "are not really taking any measures, and we are constantly complaining to them."
 
'A Nuisance and an Eyesore'
 Mr. Riggio said that he was not worried about competition from street peddlers who undercut even Barnes & Noble's discounted prices -- "we're too big for that" -- but that the First Amendment issue was being exploited.
He added that the peddlers were "a nuisance and an eyesore, and they're growing."
On Friday morning on Broadway, a customer asked Mr. Quaalini about a particular art book. Mr. Quaalini, whose stand has a wide selection of best sellers, said he did not have the book, but promised to call Golden Lee, a Brooklyn-based book wholesaler, to see if he could get it.
But Lee Heiman, president of Golden Lee, said later that day that neither Mr. Quaalini nor any other street vendor had an account with him. He said his company would sell books only to regular bookstores, the kinds with roofs, doors and walls. All the major and regional book wholesalers who were contacted -- including Baker & Taylor, the Ingram Book Company and Bookazine, as well as Golden Lee -- said that to open an account, a merchant must provide a resale number, credit history and a proper street address.
"It's possible that he or some of these other book peddlers are affiliated with small bookstores in Queens or Brooklyn, or have friends who own small bookstores, and they place their orders with us through the bookstores," Mr. Lee said. "If I did know who was supplying him, I'd stop selling to that store because I think these peddlers are a drain on the whole book industry."

HEADLINE: Global Investors Faced Twin Perils in Quarter

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
If the last three months are any evidence, global investors might need to stuff their money into safes and socks to protect their wealth from exchange-rate and stock-market convulsions.
A look back at the last quarter illustrates the twinned risks of foreign recessions and currency markets gone berserk. Britain? Stock prices were about even, but the pound's decline gave American investors a 6.4 percent loss. Germany, home of the mighty mark? Stocks were off so sharply as the economy slowed that the mark's strength merely limited American losses to 9.6 percent. 
 In Mexico, stock prices fell as interest rates were soaring to temper inflation and keep flight capital from taking wing. In Spain and Italy, a combination of currency and stock-market declines cost many American investors more than a fifth of their wealth.
Among 24 leading world markets, in fact, only 6 produced gains for American investors. Half had double-digit losses. The worst declines came among those that like Spain and Italy fled the disintegrating European monetary system and let their currencies fall.
 
Weak Currencies Hurt Foreigners
 "The lesson turned out to be that devaluation doesn't pay," said David C. Roche, Morgan Stanley's global strategist. He explained that stocks seldom rise enough to make up the difference for foreign investors.
Weaker foreign currencies hurt American investors, because their foreign holdings are worth less when converted back into dollars. Lower interest rates might help stock markets in Britain, France and Germany over the coming year, but they would erode the value of those countries' currencies by making dollar investments relatively more attractive. With the dollar now undervalued in terms of its international purchasing power, rising interest rates in the United States could compound the dollar's appreciation and the resulting losses for Americans in foreign markets.
Those who held Japanese stocks during the last quarter, however, found that currency gyrations can sometimes help. Japan's 13.2 percent gain in dollars, the best among the leading stock markets, came on both rising stock prices and a stronger yen. The yen drew strength from buyers fleeing the turmoil in Europe, while the Tokyo market received Government resuscitation that included vast spending plans.
"The authorities were throwing everything they could at the market," said Andrew Garthwaite, head of global strategy at S. G. Warburg in London. "Basically, they were manipulating it."
 
Buying Selectively in Japan
 Some analysts find bargains among Japanese manufacturing stocks, but warn against buying the whole market. The large banks, some say, are overpriced, as if the financial and real estate bust had no effect on them.
The quarter's gains still left Japanese stocks with a 19.8 percent loss in dollars for the year, reflecting the retreat of a market once worth in total far more than all publicly held stocks in the United States.
All the other foreign markets that advanced in dollar terms during the quarter did so at least in part as a result of currency gains. The Swiss, Dutch and Belgian markets all fell, but their stronger currencies produced gains for American investors. Malaysia, meanwhile, posted gains in both its stock market and its currency.
The third quarter's currents were so strong that the order of winners and losers for the whole year looks strikingly similar, Japan and Hong Kong excepted. Hong Kong, whose currency is pegged to the dollar, has gained 29.2 percent for American investors this year despite an 11.9 percent loss for the quarter.
As an export and service center for South China, Hong Kong rallied as neighboring provinces adopted its free-wheeling economic ways. Stocks pulled back in the third quarter as China's new bourses suffered riots and panicked price swings.
With so much carnage elsewhere, a 2.4 percent gain by the United States market ranked fifth best among the 24 nations. Most of that gain has already evaporated in the last few days, but compared with the prospects elsewhere, the United States does not look so bad.
"Finding value and positive earnings momentum is difficult," Mr. Garthwaite said. "Curiously, at the moment you find those in the U.S." And where else is there so little currency risk?

HEADLINE: A Currency Quandary;
Debate Over Fixed vs. Floating Rates Is High on European Leaders Agenda

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Why did no crisis erupt when the dollar plunged recently to record lows against the yen? Why did a huge crisis erupt when the pound slipped a few percent against the mark?
The answer holds plenty of pointers about the future of Europe's -- and the world's -- monetary system. For when the European Community's prime ministers meet next week to discuss how to stabilize their wobbly currencies, the pros and cons of floating and fixed rates will certainly be on the agenda. 
 As the world's economic colossus, the United States is eager to have full control over its own economic and monetary policies, and it keeps its freedom by having the dollar float against other currencies. The dollar's slide late last month against the yen and its 17 percent plunge earlier this year against the mark, reaching a record low in August, did not bring on a crisis because Washington has not pledged to peg the dollar at a certain rate. So Washington can shrug off the dollar's weakness.
But sometimes a sliding dollar makes the stock and bond markets tumble, and then Washington cannot shrug off the dollar's behavior. Usually a floating exchange rate means rocking with the waves, but once in a while those waves grow so big that they create queasiness.
"You can get big imbalances under floating rates -- just look at how the dollar was 50 percent overvalued in the mid-1980's as a result of high American interest rates," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
A fixed exchange-rate system does have its advantages. Businesses and investors know more or less what exchange-rate relations will be in three years.
But if Washington joined a fixed or semi-fixed exchange-rate system with the mark or yen, America's economic sovereignty would be sharply limited. Imagine how President Bush would have felt in August if the Federal Reserve had raised interest rates. But that is almost certainly what would have happened -- despite the nation's slump -- if the dollar fell below its floor in relation to the mark.
In Europe, several nations chose to set up a system of fixed exchange rates in 1979 because they wanted to create a zone of exchange-rate stability without the volatility that gives businesses and investors the willies. The hope was that the stability of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, as the system is called, would encourage trade, investment and growth. Indeed, economists say the system was one reason Europe's economy performed so strongly in the late 1980's.
"It has worked to bring about convergence on inflation and monetary policy and to create exchange-rate stability," said Richard Portes, director of the Center for Economic Policy Research in London. "If you're a relatively small country, open to the world economy with heavy trading ties to your neighbors, the advantages of floating rates are much lower than fixed rates."
Some countries joined the system because they knew it would force them to get serious about combating inflation.
The mark became the anchor of the Exchange Rate Mechanism because Germany has Europe's largest economy and its inflation rate rarely exceeds 3 percent. Under the system, a country with 10 percent inflation that pegged its exchange rate to the mark would, to keep its currency from sliding, have to increase interest rates to bring down inflation and attract investors to buy its bonds.
The French say the external discipline of the fixed-rate system helped them squeeze down inflation to 2.8 percent from 13 percent in 1981.
The reason Europe's monetary system exploded last month was that Germany's economy and economic policies were so out of sync with the rest of the continent.
As a result of unification, Germany's economy started growing faster than Europe's, its budget deficit ballooned, and its central bank raised interest rates to 9.75 percent to fight inflation. This forced Britain, France and Italy to lift their rates even though their problem was not inflation, but high unemployment and slow growth.
"The big problem with the system is it creates perverse monetary policies," said Sir Alan Walters, chief economic adviser to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
 
Crisis Before a Vote
 After working like a charm since 1987, the Exchange Rate Mechanism slid into crisis just before the Sept. 20 French vote on whether to approve the next steps toward European unity. Many investors thought a "no" vote would torpedo Europe's plans to form a single currency by 1999, and they concluded that a "no" would force a realignment.
Speculators bet against the pound, convinced that Britain, locked in a two-year-old recession, would not raise interest rates indefinitely to defend its currency.
When the wave of speculation pushed the pound below its floor, the British Government withdrew the pound from the system in what was an effective devaluation. (Italy and Spain also devalued their currencies.) The monetary crisis fostered a political crisis because Prime Minister John Major had staked his credibility on defending the pound's value against the mark. He plans to pursue an independent policy of cutting interest rates to lift Britain's supine economy.
"If individual countries want to pursue autonomous policies, then that's not compatible with the kind of system they've been trying to operate," said Anna Schwartz, an economist at City University of New York.
 
Two Options for Europe
 The countries of Europe are leaning two ways. They might try to glue the shattered 11-nation Exchange Rate Mechanism back together, creating a system with more frequent realignments to prevent explosive pressures from forming.
The other option might be for a half-dozen low-inflation countries to adopt a single currency in the next few years. The most likely candidates are Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. These countries might be joined by three low-inflation countries outside the European Community -- Switzerland, Austria and Sweden.
Countries like Italy might be able to join once they drastically cut their inflation.
European leaders say they do not want their nations moving toward a single currency at two speeds. That seems like wishful thinking.

Hollywood vs. America
Popular Culture and the War on Traditional Values
By Michael Medved
386 pages. HarperCollins. $20.
"Hollywood vs. America," Michael Medved's ack-ack attack of a book, addresses an issue that seems to be weighing on many minds these days: the growing disparity between the values upheld by traditional Americans and what Mr. Medved and some others see as the foul-mouthed, obscene, excessively violent, unpatriotic, antireligious, antifamily, antiauthoritarian, antiheroic, flat-out ugly and negative picture of life in this country that Hollywood films, network television and popular music now insist on portraying. 
 A television film reviewer and the author of "What Really Happened to the Class of '65?" (with David Wallechinsky), among six other nonfiction books, Mr. Medved lands a few glancing punches in his latest work. For instance, he makes the telling point that whenever someone protests a movie like Martin Scorsese's "Last Temptation of Christ"), Hollywood takes the position that free speech is the only issue. Yet, he argues, if that is truly the case, why does Hollywood not make films promoting the virtues of the Ku Klux Klan or the speciousness of the Nazi Holocaust? Because the film industry does have ethical standards, which it ought to be willing to define and debate.
Unfortunately, his argument is so repetitive, his prose so cardboard and his analysis of individual films so superficial that even readers inclined to share his outrage will eventually be forced to think about what he is really saying. And the logic of his reasoning cannot bear much analysis.
An abstraction of his argument goes as follows: Works of popular culture are growing increasingly negative. This negativity -- the excessive portrayal of violence, for instance -- is doing such severe damage to American culture that people of conscience (like Mr. Medved) are forced to protest. When they do, the producers invariably take the position that their works are only reflecting the reality of the culture.
But that isn't so, Mr. Medved retorts. The works are diverging from culture. For instance, while Hollywood is growing more violent, America is growing less violent. In fact, he concludes, the producers of popular art are becoming so out of touch with the culture that they are in danger of losing their audiences.
Readers may pause to scratch their heads and ask, if the country has grown less violent or more religious in the past decade, as Mr. Medved reports, then where is the harm that the purveyors of shock and ungodliness are ostensibly inflicting? And if people are drifting away from the product, then what is there to worry about?
Mr. Medved repeats this flawed line of reasoning so often that finally even he takes note of it. After referring to "what is going wrong in our country" and to "the prevailing atmosphere of despair that has become a destructive feature of our national life," and remarking three pages later, "If anything, the direction of public opinion involves a return to and renewal of traditional values, rather than any embrace of the radical alternatives so frequently promoted by Hollywood," he wonders if "the power of the entertainment industry may have been greatly exaggerated."
His answer? Aha! Media influences are "gradual and cumulative, not immediate, and they occur only after extended exposure." The problem is a recent development; "the violent, sexual, and degrading elements have become far more intense in just the last few years." So: "Considering the determined and energetic nature of Hollywood's assault on reigning conventions, there is good reason to question whether core values will remain as firmly implanted in years to come as they are today." What a relief! The problems of which he sees evidence everywhere won't hit the culture until years from now.
But hold everything! Earlier he has argued that the decline of the popular media is the fault of the countercultural uprising of the 1960's, whose occurrence you have to wonder about, incidentally, if Mr. Medved is right about the powerful long-term influence of popular art and its wholesomeness in the 1940's and 1950's. And later he sets the date of Hollywood's decline at about 1967, the year of the violent "Bonnie and Clyde," which reminds you of films like "The Godfather" (1969) and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (1975) and makes you wonder why, if violence on the screen begets violence in real life, those particular films didn't do the trick. Why, as Mr. Medved argues, did violence decline in the 1980's?
Still, granting that Mr. Medved is right about popular culture's descent into the gutter, what does he propose to lift it into the clouds again? As should be evident by now, whenever he gets down to details, it's films, not television or pop music, that he's really worried about. He's against censorship or resurrecting the old Hays Office Production Code. He's for lobbying groups and the power of the economic boycott. Yet most of all he just wishes that Hollywood could voluntarily start making uplifting films again.
What does he mean by uplifting films? He mentions the works of Frank Capra and "The Sound of Music" and all the good movies released in 1939, from "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" through "Young Mr. Lincoln" to "Gunga Din." But the most vexing problem of "Hollywood vs. America" is that Mr. Medved never goes inside movies, whether they're good or bad. To him, the images they convey are the message, and the message is all. "Going My Way" presents a positive image of priests, and is therefore good. "The Silence of the Lambs" is about cannibalism and sex freaks, so it's bad.
Never mind that the 1991 multi-Oscar winner subtly explores a question that Mr. Medved's survey of morality in contemporary popular art ought to be pre-eminently concerned about: whether absolute evil can be harnessed by good in the cause of defeating a lesser evil. Such enigmatic quandaries, which are harder to think about than dirty words or violent sex or if the Persian Gulf war should be celebrated by more films more enthusiastically, never begin to trouble Mr. Medved's deep sleep of reason.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: CANDIDATES ON THE ISSUE;
Where They Stand on the Deficit

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

 BODY:
The annual Federal budget deficit, the difference between what the Government spends and the tax revenue it receives, is now about $330 billion and is projected to rise to $500 billion by the turn of the century. The deficit began mushrooming in the 1980's because income taxes were cut deeply under Ronald Reagan, while spending increased substantially, especially for Medicare and Medicaid. 
 Some economists on both the left and right ends of the political spectrum play down the importance of the deficit. But most economists in the mainstream hold that the deficit is gradually crippling the country by forcing the taxpayers of the future to pay for today's consumption.
 
THE RECORDS
 BUSH: As Vice President, Mr. Bush was in the Administration under which the deficit growth began, and in his own Presidency it has more than doubled. The increase under Mr. Bush was not all his fault. Some was caused by the savings-and-loan bailout. Some was a result of the lower tax revenues and higher spending that grew out of the recession.
The budget agreement Mr. Bush and Congress negotiated in 1990 kept matters from getting even worse. Congress rejected some of the spending cuts Mr. Bush proposed, but over all, Congress appropriated less money than Mr. Bush requested.
The main reason the deficit has risen so much is that although Government spending increased during the Bush Presidency by an average of 7.5 percent a year, after adjusting for inflation (as against 1 percent under Ronald Reagan), Mr. Bush refused to support offsetting tax increases.
 CLINTON: Bill Clinton's record as Governor of Arkansas is not directly comparable to that of the President. The Arkansas constitution requires a balanced budget, and to comply with that Mr. Clinton has backed increases in the sales tax and taxes on cigarettes, insurance premiums and gasoline.
He tried to raise the state income tax but was blocked by the legislature. Thousands of the poorest Arkansas residents were given exemptions from state income taxes. Only eight states have lower taxes.
The state's budget under Mr. Clinton more or less doubled in size, partly because of inflation and partly because of increased spending for education and other programs.
PEROT: Mr. Perot has never held public office.
 
THE PHILOSOPHIES
 BUSH: Controlling the deficit is important but not so important as keeping taxes low as a way of generating economic growth and jobs.
 CLINTON: Controlling the deficit is important but not so important as "investing" money to improve highways, communications networks and other installations, as a way of generating economic growth and jobs.
 PEROT: The Federal deficit must be eliminated, not just lowered, before the nation's other problems can be dealt with.
 
THE PROPOSALS
 BUSH: In July, Mr. Bush offered a program that he said would reduce the deficit to $118 billion by 1997, but since then, he has proposed more than $140 billion in additional tax cuts. He insists he will not raise taxes in any circumstances.
His deficit-cutting measures are grounded in his plan to limit the growth in mandatory programs like Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and veterans benefits, excluding Social Security. Mr. Bush has never said how the limits would be imposed. He has also proposed freezes on other domestic spending programs, a reduction in Federal subsidies to some affluent Americans like wealthy farmers and a lowering of the military budget.
Mr. Bush favors a Constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, but he has never offered a balanced budget himself nor explained what specific steps he favors to reach such a goal.
 CLINTON: Clinton promises to cut the deficit to about $140 billion by 1996. That is based in part on the assumption that the economy will grow somewhat faster than most economists believe is likely. The main deficit-reduction elements are tax increases of about $150 billion and cuts in military spending about $40 billion deeper than those proposed by President Bush.
About two-thirds of the increased tax revenue would come from higher income taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans (joint annual incomes over $200,000), a surtax on incomes over $1 million and a higher minimum tax on wealthy taxpayers with large deductions. Taxes would be cut for families with annual incomes below about $90,000 and for some businesses.
Mr. Clinton also proposes better collection of taxes from foreign companies, a 3 percent reduction in administrative costs and more efficiency in the savings-and-loan bailout. With a goal of generating economic growth and jobs, Mr. Clinton would increase spending by about $220 billion over four years. This "investment" would go to things like education, job training and public works.
PEROT: Mr. Perot promises to balance the budget after five years. The gasoline tax would be raised 10 cents a gallon each year for five years. The top tax rate would be raised to 33 percent from 31 percent for couples making more than about $90,000. Taxes would be raised on the Social Security benefits received by upper-income taxpayers, and benefits from other Government programs would be taxed. Employers would be taxed on health-insurance premiums worth more than $335 a month.
Deductions of mortgage interest would be limited to mortgage amounts of $250,000 or less. Federal spending on programs other than the military, mandatory programs and interest on the debt would be cut by 15 percent by eliminating "unnecessary and outdated" Government programs. Military spending would be reduced by $40 billion below the level proposed by Mr. Bush. The capital-gains tax would be eliminated for small businesses, and businesses would get other tax breaks for investment and research. An additional $70 billion would be spent over five years for public works.
 
SCORECARD
 The deficit will be a major problem facing the next President. But neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Clinton has made it a central campaign issue, and neither has a credible plan for dealing with it. Both candidates have promised to revamp the health-care system. But neither has explained how he would meet the increased cost to the Government, which could run to tens of billions of dollars a year. The only way to reduce the budget deficit is to raise taxes on most Americans, cut popular spending programs or both, and neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Clinton has proposed doing so. Mr. Perot's proposed tax increases would raise hundreds of billions of dollars over five years, but the spending cuts he offers are less precise and less realistic. He has not developed a plan for limiting medical costs, identified the unnecessary programs he would abolish or explained how some programs like, say, the air-traffic-control system, could be cut by 15 percent without doing grave damage.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, 148 Million Capitalists

 BODY:
Last week, Russia began issuing every adult and child a voucher worth 10,000 rubles, or about $50. Next year, they'll have to decide whether to sell the vouchers for cash, invest them in a mutual fund or use them to buy shares in the thousands of factories being put up for sale.
In other words, every Russian will become a capitalist. 
 That's an astonishing change from the cradle-to-grave security blanket that enclosed Communist Russia little more than a year ago. More than astonishing: audacious. President Boris Yeltsin's shrewd plan forces Russians to engage in capitalist calculations, leading to decisions that will dictate personal fortunes.
It's the largest, most fateful variation on the social and economic transformation of this generation. Privatization is sweeping across Eastern Europe. Czechoslovakia began a voucher program last spring; Poland is poised to begin and Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania are speeding along. All paths point in the same direction: capitalism.
Americans will desperately want, and no doubt help, the Russians to complete the perilous journey. At risk are the democratic and market reforms that have turned archenemy into budding ally.
Fast-track privatization is shrewdly designed to solve a formidable economic problem. The Yeltsin Government dismantled Communist controls; market controls haven't yet taken their place. That has left factory managers in charge but accountable to no one -- an invitation to mismanage and steal. By creating instant owners, the plan would force managers to take proper care.
But Mr. Yeltsin has political concerns too. The plan is designed to give beleaguered Russians a stake in his market reforms. It's also designed to buy the allegiance of industrial managers, whose privileged status is threatened by market reform. Under the plan, they would get an inside track to owning and controlling the factories they manage. Not wholly fair, but it is a clever way to dissipate opposition.
Indeed, putting existing factory managers in charge helps solve another problem. After ownership rights are distributed, the factories must be governed. And a factory owned by everyone is a factory controlled by no one. Giving savvy insiders the upper hand concentrates control.
Will the plan work? There are reasons to worry. Billions of illegally earned rubles would be used to buy up vouchers, a slick way to launder ill-gotten gains. Uniquely, the plan would allow investors to use a combination of vouchers and cash to buy factories. That favors well-informed, well-financed domestic and foreign investors. Again, that's unfair, but it may get firms running under wise management.
The Russians haven't figured out critical details, like how investors will actually bid for shares. Nor have they controlled inflation, closed huge budget deficits or clarified bankruptcy rules. These daunting challenges will have to be met before privatization has a chance.
But given the political peril, Mr. Yeltsin judged, perhaps wisely, that speed should win out over caution. Factories are preparing privatization plans; Russians are picking up their vouchers. Once the bidding begins, it might well be impossible to turn back the tidal wave to markets.

Rise, Sir Rebuttal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
Moderator: Good evening and welcome to lap one of the American Debatathon, or "Honey, I Shrunk the Candidates."
Listen closely because I won't explain this again. Our format tonight is to have one panelist direct a question to one of the three candidates. After a two-minute reply, each of the other candidates will have a one-minute rebuttal, followed by a surrebuttal by the original questionee. 
 Panelist: Do you think, Mr. President, that after watching six hours of debating in one week, the American people are likely to adopt these debate formats as a means of intra-family communication? And if they do, part two of my question is: What sort of interpersonal issues would lend themselves to this debate format for a family sitting around the kitchen table?
Bush: Family values -- or traditional values, as we now call them, because some people treat "family" like a dirty word . . . uh, I kinda like the idea of a family sitting around the kitchen table, Mom and Dad and the kids, chewing things over -- nothing wrong with a family without kids, or a single-parent type of situation -- though not in the military, and make no mistake, General Powell is right with me on that -- but sure, I think that debates, especially the tightly organized kind, like the one tonight, help people decide who they can really trust because that's what it all comes down to, not how many points you can memorize, or dreary statistics about the past, but character, no waffling, but who you can trust in the middle of the night when the phone rings and it's the man with the football, the nuclear codes, who sleeps right outside my door next to Millie . . . yes, that's the sort of disciplined debate I think is healthy for American families. Wholesome --
Moderator: Your rebuttal, Governor Clinton?
Clinton: Can we trust a man who claims to be "out of the loop" on Iran-contra, when everybody else says he was profoundly looped? Can we trust a politician who said "read my lips, no new taxes" and then raised taxes? Can we trust rosy promises about pulling out of hard times from a man whose economic record is the worst since Jimmy -- since Herbert Hoover?
Back in April, I issued a five-point paper on ways the debate idea can bring American families -- just like Hillary, Chelsea and I, or me -- together again. One, pick a relevant topic, like bedtimes. Two, get your neighbors to form a joint commission to sponsor your kitchen-table debates. Three, each one of us has to accept responsibility for making sure there are plenty of cookies and milk handy, or a six-pack of beer, for the time-outs that resolve the tension, especially in broken homes caused by Bush-Quayle socio-economic hardship, and four -- actually, it was a three-point program for change in our debating system. We've had enough of the same old debating, the divisiveness, the polarization by the current Administration, and now I remember the fourth point, we must --
Moderator: Time.
Clinton: Change!
Moderator: Mr. Perot, your rebuttal.
Perot: Did you just hear what I heard? You ever hear such unadulterated poppycock in your life? They don't have the solution; they're the problem. Peas in a pod, the both of 'em, spoutin' off about some idiot question from the gotcha media while the deficit is down there in the basement and they're treating it like a crazy aunt, pretending she ain't there. Folks, the lady down in my basement is my aunt, and she's crazy as a coot, and I have her chained to the wall for her own good, but I can tell the difference between Aunt Sadie and the red-ink budget, which neither of these birds here could do in a lifetime in politics. That's all I have to say; you can take the rest of my time, Mr. Moderator, and stick it in your ear.
Moderator: A 30-second surrebuttal, Mr. President.
Bush: Ross, I hear you, and while we may differ about some of the details about the treatment of the mental illness of your Aunt Sadie -- a wonderful family woman, I'm sure, whose Medicare is safe with me -- I think it's wrong for you and Governor Clinton to want to slam her with a 50-cent-a-gallon gas tax, so that when you let her out of the dungeon she couldn't afford to drive away. In the few seconds I have left, I just want to say trust, trust, trust, trust --
Moderator: Time, gentlemen, please.

HEADLINE: Tribal Colleges Helping Renew Indians' Spirit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While your report on poverty at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation is largely accurate ("Sad Distinction for the Sioux: Homeland Is No. 1 in Poverty," Sept. 20), I believe there is a major element missing in the picture you presented of life there. 
 Having lived on the Pine Ridge Reservation for 16 years, first as a youngster from grade school through high school and later as an adult from 1976 to 1984, I will tell you that our people do suffer many hardships there, as they do on most Indian reservations. Yet in spite of the desperate physical poverty and deprivation, there is still humor, camaraderie and a strength of spirit. These resources are nurtured by a rich cultural heritage and values that, despite organized efforts to destroy our culture and force assimilation, have survived and are upheld in the reservation setting.
This strength of spirit has carried us through the last 150 years, the lowest point in the history of the Indian people, during which we have fought for our physical and cultural survival. I believe we are now at a most hopeful turning point in our history. As one Pine Ridge resident was quoted in your article, after years of government interference, we Indians are taking our affairs back into our own hands and finding our own solutions to our problems.
Arguably, the most successful effort so far in the Indian movement toward greater self-determination is the establishment of tribal colleges over the last 25 years. There are now 26 Indian colleges found on and near reservations in 12 Midwestern and Western states -- including Oglala Lakota College on Pine Ridge.
These colleges are bringing new opportunities to our people in the way of academic degree programs and vocational training. We have seen great achievements in our students, attributable in large part to the importance given by the colleges to traditional cultural values and identity. These institutions are responding to community needs by providing such services as literacy and health education and economic development initiatives. Through them we are developing tools to rebuild our communities.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
With Reservations, Clinton Endorses Free-Trade Pact

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., Oct. 4

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton said today that he endorsed the North American Free Trade Agreement, but also said that as President he would not sign it in its current form.
The Democratic Presidential nominee said an acceptable trade agreement should include provisions that would toughen environmental and worker-safety standards in Mexico and allow the President to establish a commission to monitor the agreement's impact. 
 "I believe we can address these concerns without renegotiating the basic agreement," Mr. Clinton said.
 
Backers Could Be Upset
 On Wednesday, President Bush is scheduled to travel to San Antonio, where trade ministers from the United States, Canada and Mexico are scheduled to initial the agreement to eliminate most customs duties and other trade barriers among the United States, Mexico and Canada over the next 10 years. American law allows Mr. Bush to sign the agreement as early as Dec. 17, although he could choose not to do so if he loses the election.
Though expected, Mr. Clinton's endorsement of the agreement runs the risk of alienating some supporters in organized labor and Congress.
His speech today drew immediate criticism from Carla A. Hills, the United States Trade Representative, who said the "omissions" that Mr. Clinton identified had already been alleviated by the agreement, which is the product of more than a year of negotiation by Bush Administration officials.
Mr. Clinton said the agreement should be part of a "larger economic strategy" designed to raise the incomes of American workers. "If it is not done right, however, the benefits of the agreement are far less clear," he said in a speech at North Carolina State University here. "And the burdens will be significant. I'm convinced that I will do it right. I am equally convinced that Mr. Bush won't."
Mr. Clinton had been leaning toward endorsing the agreement for some weeks, his advisers said, even as he reviewed the 2,000-word pact to make his final assessment. But today for the first time, he formally outlined his objections to the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying that the United States must be forced to develop a more integrated economy with expanded trade as part of the formula.
He also chose a university campus to make his announcement rather than the towns of the industrial Midwest where he had frequently been greeted by union members with signs with slogans like "Fair Trade, not Free Trade."
"On balance, I believe N.A.F.T.A. can contribute to this effort, not undermine it, as long as we move aggressively to address the serious omissions from the agreement," he said. "I believe we have to do more for our own workers to protect the environment on both sides of the border both because it's good for the environment and because if they don't do it, it will further lower the costs of production."
Mr. Clinton said the criticism he had received for the delay in taking a stand on the trade agreement was symptomatic of the shallowness of American politics.
 
Eliminating Trade Barriers
 "One of the most difficult problems in modern politics and therefore in this Presidential election is the simplistic and superficial labeling of complex issues," he said.
The agreement, which was completed in August, is scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 1994, and would establish the largest trading bloc in the world with $6 trillion in output.
The effects of the agreement will be most pronounced on Mexico's trade with the United States and Canada because trade barriers between the United States and Canada are already being pulled down by a 1988 free-trade agreement between them.
Mr. Clinton said he would work to maintain a strong American manufacturing base that would prevent harm to American workers by the strong economies of competitors.
"I remain convinced that the North American Free Trade Agreement will generate jobs and growth on both sides of the border if, and only if, it's part of a broad-based strategy," he said.
"If we don't do those things, we can kill N.A.F.T.A.," he said. "But we'll still lose jobs."
 
Republican Rejoinders
 Ms. Hills objected to Mr. Clinton's description of the trade agreement. "I think that anyone who studies what we have accomplished has got to give it very high marks," she said. "And we would not have been able to achieve our agreements without support from Democrats. The qualifiers sound to me like he is being held back by the labor unions who are opposed to the agreement."
Mary Matalin, the President's deputy campaign manager, said: "Either Clinton supports this treaty or he does not. He can't be on both sides of the issue."
Clinton advisers said the protections the Administration had called for were weak and would not have the force of law. By contrast, they said, the commission they proposed would be headed by the Vice President and would have the power to assess damages for violations.
Mr. Clinton, however, said that the best way to insure fair trade would be to use the agreement as the basis for a global agreement with other nations.
"It will provide more jobs from exports," he said. "It will challenge us to become more competitive. It will certainly help Mexico to develop. But still, that is also in our interests. A wealthier Mexico will buy more American products. As incomes rise there that will reduce pressure for emigration across the border into the United States which depresses wages here."
Leaders of labor unions supporting Mr. Clinton have remained opposed to the trade agreement, but they have withheld criticism of Mr. Clinton's sympathy for it in favor of working for the election of a Democratic President.
But it remains unclear whether these leaders speak for their members, many of whom are suffering from job losses brought on by the closing or relocation of plants. Many of these men and women are also the traditional Democrats who strayed from the fold during the last decade to support Ronald Reagan and Mr. Bush.
"Although it is unpopular with some people and organizations I admire and represent, the very Americans I am fighting so hard for in this election," Mr. Clinton said, "I think we should go forward with it because it advances our interests, the interests of ordinary Americans, more than it undermines it."
Democratic members of Congress from two important states have expressed reservations about the agreement. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who is the House majority leader, says it should be renegotiated, and Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio has said the pact could cost 550,000 jobs over the next decade in this country.
Representative Don J. Pease, an Ohio Democrat who is a member of the Ways and Means subcommittee on trade, said Mr. Clinton, "probably didn't have much choice but to endorse the N.A.F.T.A. in general, otherwise he'd have been savaged by the press, among others."
Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat on the same subcommittee, said that by endorsing the pact, although with some qualifications, Mr. Clinton had prevented it from becoming controversial over the next month. "It really neutralizes it completely as an issue in the campaign.
Mr. Matsui and Mr. Pease both said that the endorsement improved the odds that some version of the pact would eventually be cleared by the Democratically controlled Congress. Mr. Matsui, for example, said he would not vote for legislation putting the agreement into law if Mr. Bush was re-elected because he did not believe that the current Administration would carry out pledges to protect workers and the environment.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 6, 1992, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Gov. Bill Clinton's endorsement of the North American Free Trade Agreement misstated its length in some copies. The treaty is some 2,000 pages long, not 2,000 words. The article also misstated the combined economic output of the trading partners in some copies. The output of the three nations, the United States, Mexico and Canada, would be $6 trillion.

Bill Clinton announced that he endorsed the North American Free Trade Agreement but that he would not sign it until provisions were added to toughen environmental standards in Mexico and a commission was established to monitor it.

DIAL 'M' FOR MOVIES
The nation's first video dialtone system, which will transmit cable television programming over telephone lines, is expected to go into service in three large apartment buildings in Manhattan early next year. The companies planning the yearlong test of the new system -- New York Telephone and Liberty Cable Television -- say it will let subscribers choose what they want to watch when they want to watch, rather than subjecting them to the rigid schedules of traditional broadcast channels, cable systems and pay-per-view movies. The companies say this would be possible with a device they call a "video jukebox," which will let viewers use a telephone line to dial an on-screen menu from which they can select programs. B3.
 
ACCOUNTS OF CROWN HEIGHTS
In two weeks of sometimes chilling testimony in Supreme Court in Brooklyn, seven police officers, one sergeant and two detectives have each described a slightly different moment during the chaotic night in Crown Heights when Yankel Rosenbaum, a visiting rabbinical scholar, was stabbed to death. But almost all of the witnesses said they heard Mr. Rosenbaum, who was lying bleeding on a car, identify the defendant, Lemrick Nelson Jr., as his assailant. Page B3.
 

SCHOOL OFFICIALS FAIL TO HALT BOYCOTT
Top school officials failed to persuade the leaders of a local P.T.A. to call off their plans for a boycott of Eastern District High School in Brooklyn to protest what parents say are overcrowded and dangerous conditions. Leaders of the Parent-Teacher Association emerged from a three-hour meeting with Deputy Chancellor Stanley Litow saying that the school board had not addressed their concerns and that they were making arrangements for a boycott.

The police called it a speeding accident, but the victim's family said he had been killed by police officers who chased and rammed him with a patrol car. The police said the victim, Rasheed Ali Sharif, riding alone in a stolen 1992 Buick Century, was killed instantly when the vehicle, traveling at what witnesses estimated was 75 miles an hour, missed the curve on Quitman Street near Clinton Avenue and crashed. The authorities said no other car was involved and they denied any involvement by the police. B5.
 
IT'S BOB AND AL, TIT FOR TAT
Forget recession, health care and the environment. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and State Attorney General Robert Abrams have managed to make the New York campaign for the Senate a contest of "Really, Bob!" vs. "Come on, Al!" -- a tit-for-tat war of television commercial tag lines, listing each other's supposed sins. That is just how Mr. D'Amato wants it, since he has been under fire for years over his personal ethics and now faces a tough fight for a third term. Mr. Abrams, adopting the prevailing political wisdom that an attack left unrebutted is an attack that might ring true, has responded in kind. Political Memo, B5.
 
HOUSANDS AT ANTI-KLAN RALLY
Religious and civic leaders and thousands of residents demonstrated in the heart of the old riverfront city of Newburgh, N.Y., to protest a nearby gathering of neo-Nazis and members and sympathizers of the Ku Klux Klan three weeks ago. "Hate and racism won't survive -- can't survive in a community that has finally come alive," the city's Mayor, Audrey Carey, a black woman, told a crowd the police estimated at 3,000 after a mile-long march up Broadway. "Let us make a definitive and strong statement to those hate mongers -- they will not, will not, will not be tolerated in this community." B5.

HEADLINE: 1,500 ARE LAID OFF IN JERSEY AGENCIES

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
The New Jersey Supreme Court opened the way today for the immediate layoff of about 1,500 unionized state workers and the transfer of as many as 5,000 others to new jobs starting Tuesday.
Union officials who had gone to court hoping to stop the layoffs predicted that state services would be thrown into chaos. 
 "The state is going to be faced with unstaffing in many offices," said Vincent Trivelli, a lobbyist for the Communications Workers of America, the state's largest public employees' union. "In some cases you are going to have people in jobs who are unfamiliar with the work and you are going to have some people who are being forced to take $20,000 cuts in salaries."
 
Human Services Hit Hardest
 The layoffs, representing slightly more than 2 percent of the work force, are the largest in New Jersey history and are expected to save the state about $55 million annually.
They involve every department of state government except agriculture and banking. Hardest hit is the Department of Human Services, which is the state's biggest department with about 20,000 employees. The loss of 585 jobs will mean an immediate end to programs like fingerprint checks for potential employees of the department and the testing of newborns for tuberculosis and other disorders.
The Office of the Public Advocate, one of the strongest agencies of its kind in the nation, suffered 29 layoffs. Among them were all the jobs in two of its most important and controversial sections: the Office of Citizen Complaints, which investigated other state agencies, and the Division of Public Interest Advocacy, which handled legal issues like public housing, beach access and fees environmental cases.
The partisan sniping that has long surrounded the question of layoffs continued today. "I feel deeply for every rank-and-file worker who stands to lose a job because of the Florio administration's unwillingness to get rid of patronage plums and needless middle managers," said the Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian. "I urge the administration to delay the layoffs voluntarily until this case is settled. The cost to the state would be minimal, and it is still possible for the plaintiffs to prevail."
The State Commissioner of Personnel, Anthony J. Cimino, gave the administration's response to the layoffs. "If the Legislature had worked with Governor Florio's no-layoff budget and explored more humane means of downsizing state government," he said, "this day of sadness and pain could have been avoided altogether."
 
Hearing on Oct. 13
 The Supreme Court's 5-to-2 vote today ended a brief reprieve for 1,510 state workers targeted for layoffs. The decision lifted an injunction that had protected their jobs for the last three days and allowed the state to proceed with the layoffs today.
But the justices also said that they would hold a hearing on Oct. 13 to consider two related questions: whether the Legislature's demand that the administration lay off only managers violated the separation-of-powers provisions in the constitution and whether the administration's decision to ignore that order was legal.
Coming four months after they were announced, two months after notices were issued and three days after a court-ordered respite, the layoffs were anticlimactic for most of those who lost their jobs today.
"It seems most of the farewells were last week," said Joe LaPlaca, owner of Joe's Mill Hill Saloon, one of Trenton's more popular nightspots. "We had a big number of laid-off state workers on Friday who were here bidding their farewells."
 
764 Jobs Said to Be Saved
 For the first time in weeks, there were no union protesters outside the State House today.
At midafternoon, Mr. Cimino distributed a three-paragraph memorandum to all departments, advising them of the court decision. "Accordingly," the memo said, "all layoffs and displacements which were scheduled to take effect at the close of business on Oct. 2, 1992, should be implemented at 5 P.M. today."
Mr. Cimino said the final layoff figure would be 1,510, including 113 nonunion employees who have been laid off in the last six weeks.
 
'Bumping' by Seniority
 In August, Mr. Cimino announced 2,376 anticipated layoffs, but he said today that 764 jobs had been saved by transfers to federally financed programs or to fee-supported jobs.
Mr. Trivelli said the impact of the layoffs will not match the disruption caused by "bumping," the Civil Service practice of allowing senior workers to displace junior colleagues within their departments.
Over the last two months, state personnel officials have held private interviews with all of the employees affected by the layoffs to determiine if they were able to bump and where.
Mr. Trivelli said that as many as 5,000 state workers who received layoff notices were able to stay on the payroll by bumping other workers. In many cases, he said, the senior workers will take drastic cuts in pay, will find themselves doing work they graduated from 20 years ago or will be faced with unfamiliar jobs.
"It is going to be a disaster," said Mr. Trivelli, whose union represents about 38,000 of the 70,000 state employees. "These layoffs are bad for everybody. It's bad for the economy, it's bad for the people who are losing service, and of course it's bad for the people who are being laid off."
A spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services, Winnie Comfort, said the level of disruption caused by bumping would depend on the jobs involved.
 
Little Changes, Big Changes
 "The process generally is that you can bump into the same title, and some titles are very specific and they define the role," she said, so some changes will have little impact.
She gave the example of a family-service specialist, the department's job title for a caseworker. "In that job title," she said, "some workers may have to take on new cases in new towns and may have to learn a new telephone system in a new office, but the job is the same kind of work."
At the other extreme, Ms. Comfort cited the position of quality-assurance specialist. Under that job title, she said, there are employees who oversee the siting and operation of group homes for the developmentally disabled. But the title also includes workers who survey heating systems in various government buildings.
"Conceivably, a quality-assurance specialist now working within the developmentally disabled system could wind up tomorrow inspecting heating systems," Ms. Comfort said.
 
Long, Partisan Debate
 The layoffs have been at the center of a long, frequently nasty partisan debate between Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, and the Republican-controlled Legislature.
Mr. Florio has charged that the layoffs result from a record $1.1 billion reduction in the state budget that the Republicans approved in June over his veto. The $14.6 billion budget included language that mandated layoffs, but it targeted 1,400 nonunion managers earning $50,000 or more annually. Later, the Republicans passed even stronger legislation to protect certain departments from layoffs and to demand that nonunion managers be laid off before any unionized workers were let go.
Mr. Florio, whose budget plan in January did not call for layoffs, said he found the Republican demands unworkable and unconstitutional.
The Communications Workers, joined last week by two freshman Republican legislators, Senator Richard LaRossa and Assemblyman John Hartmann, sued Mr. Florio to block layoffs among union workers.
Hours before the layoffs were to take effect on Friday, Judge Alan B. Handler of the State Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction barring the administration from proceeding until the full court had a chance to review the case today.

HEADLINE: CONGRESS REBUFFS BUSH IN OVERRIDE OF CABLE TV VETO

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Congress voted tonight to override President Bush's veto of legislation to regulate cable television companies, breaking his streak of 35 successful vetoes.
The bill itself, which would authorize regulation of minimum cable service and seek to encourage competition, was almost lost in the politics of the moment. Democrats, who have waited four years to defeat Mr. Bush on such a test of strength, exulted, and Republicans were split over what the vote meant. 
 Senator Bob Dole, the Republican minority leader, said of the vote, "This is politics" and an effort to embarrass Mr. Bush. But another Republican, Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, a sponsor of the bill, said it was only a "disagreement."
 
The President's Reasoning
 President Bush argued in his veto message that the bill would stifle the growing cable and telecommunciations industries, and that increased regulation would lead to higher, not lower, cable rates.
In the end, Republicans were critical to the 74-to-25 Senate margin, and to the 308-to-114 vote in the House, both well over the two-thirds majority required to override a veto.
Action on cable legislation was a theatrical high point for a typical, slogging pre-adjournment day of legislation. The long-awaited urban aid tax bill took hours and hours to finally emerge from conference. The House planned to stay in session all night to vote on the tax bill and other matters.
Filibuster threats killed handgun-control and fetal-tissue legislation in the Senate, and menaced both the energy bill and hopes of adjourning Tuesday. The oddest note of the day was that Senate action was delayed when 13 bills passed by the House were sent to a trash dump by mistake, and had to be reconstructed from notes and other copies.
As for Mr. Bush, his weekend efforts to win converts from his party on the cable issue were a failure. In the Senate, for example, 24 Republicans joined 50 Democrats in voting to override, with 18 Republicans and 7 Democrats voting to sustain.
The cable vote was both a setback for the President at a time when his struggling campaign for re-election hardly needs any reverses, and an apparent sign of his eroding political influence. And even though one overridden veto setback after a string of successes hardly proves his basic veto strategy a failure, it could undermine his campaign argument that legislative "gridlock" is caused by Democrats in Congress.
In this case, lawmakers -- who have their own elections to worry about -- were able to vote for legislation sure to please most cable television customers, regardless of how much the bill actually affects cable rates. And for the Democrats, this vote could be taken to show that for a moment at least, Mr. Bush was only an ineffective obstacle to doing something voters would like.
Mr. Bush's argument against the evils of regulation did not sway votes. Indeed, many lawmakers wondered privately why he had chosen to make a stand on this issue, concluding either that he felt strongly on the principle or had lost track of the likelihood of defeat.
When the Senate debate verged onto the merits of the bill, the arguments were familiar. Senator Joe Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, assailed the "highway robbery" of cable companies, which were deregulated in 1984. "In the absence of regulation," he said, "the cable industry has relentlessly raised rates on the American consumer, year after year."
 
Opposing Regulation
 Senator Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana, argued that it was a mistake to change the rules on the cable companies, which had been prospering and growing and creating employment. "We're starting down another path that is going to cost us jobs -- reregulation," he said.
Each side argued that the other's approach would be more costly to consumers, and each found ammunition in the many provisions of the bill. For besides allowing regulation of rates and seeking to encourage competition, the bill would also allow over-the-air broadcasters to seek payments from cable companies that carry their broadcasts. The movie industry bitterly opposed the bill because there was no provision for it to share in such payments.
The bill would also force big cable companies that produce programs like those on HBO to make their programs available to competing cable companies.
Several Republicans spoke out for overriding the veto. But the group that Mr. Bush had lobbied hard over the weekend, primarily Republicans not up for election this year, gave him no votes they had not cast when the Senate approved this bill on Sept. 22 by an identical tally of 74 to 25.
One of them, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, said: "Although I believe the cable industry needs some form of regulation, this was not an easy vote for me because I believe the whole legislative process on this matter has been manipulated by the Democrats to embarrass the President. However, in the final analysis, I think this bill is good for the consumers of America, and so I voted to override."
President Bush issued a statement saying, "We stood for lower cable bills for the consumer through increased competition."
As Congress met into the night, House and Senate negotiators worked on a compromise tax bill. The compromise had been approved in principle on Saturday night, but staff members and lawmakers had to iron out relatively minor disagreements before sending the bill forward for votes.
House Republicans caucused on the measure this afternoon, and some senior Republicans said there was considerable sentiment against it, if not enough to defeat it on the floor.
Assuming it is passed by both the House and Senate, the $27 billion measure, which includes both tax cuts and counterbalancing tax increases, faces the possibility of a Presidential veto.
President Bush was noncommittal when asked on the "Good Morning America" television program on ABC what he would do if the bill reached his desk. "I have some real reservations about part of it," he said, "but the problem is they always send me something that has some of the things I want, and then loaded up with, in this instance, taxes.
The tax bill includes billions of dollars in urban aid in the form of enterprise zones, housing incentives and the like. It also includes a $3 billion package of provisions meant to provide assistance to distressed families, for instance by providing money to states to pay social workers.
 
An Energy Bill Advances
 Before the cable issue came to the floor, the major legislative action of the day was the House's adoption of the House-Senate compromise on energy legislation. The measure, which passed by a comfortable margin of 363 to 60, would encourage the use of alternative fuels, efficient homes and appliances but do little directly to increase production of oil or reduce consumption of gasoline.
Even so, Representative Philip R. Sharp, Democrat of Indiana, the bill's floor manager, contended that the measure was a critical first step "to substantially reduce our dependency on foreign oil, reduce the risk to our economy of disruptions in price or supply, reduce the deficit, protect consumers and begin to control our own energy future."
"Unlike some of the major energy programs of the 1970's," he said, "we have done this in a way that relies on existing state and industrial programs and standards, rather than on developing Federal regulations and bureaucracy."
There indeed was a Congressional consensus behind the bill, from its acceleration of the licensing of nuclear power plants, to its attempts to enhance competition in electric power production, to lower mortgage rates for better-insulated homes and to promote energy-efficient light bulbs and shower heads.
But the bill was denied quick action in the Senate because Nevada's Senators opposed a provision that would accelerate the development of a nuclear waste storage project in their state. They threatened to hold up the Senate's planned Tuesday adjournment to fight the bill.
Before the energy bill came up, the House passed the last two spending bills of the year and sent them to the Senate. It adopted a $253 billion military spending bill on a voice vote, and a $13.9 billion foreign-aid bill that included $417 million for Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union, and an increase in spending, to $350 million, on population control programs internationally.
Before getting around to actually voting on any legislation, Senate Democrats took the floor to complain that President Bush was not helping them persuade Republicans to allow votes on two contentious bills. One would have made it easier to do research on the use of transplanted tissue from aborted fetuses to treat Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. The other would have imposed a seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, announced he would make the fetal-tissue legislation, which is part of a measure setting priorities for the National Institutes of Health, the first order of business when the Senate returns in January. He said he would keep the Senate in session until it is passed. The bill has only 12 opponents in the Senate, but in the waning hours of a Congress their filibuster threat was effective.
Senator Bob Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, said the bill would cost lives because "a mother somewhere may decide to have an abortion to donate tissue to a fetal-tissue bank." He said the bill would amount to "legalizing the harvest of fetal tissue from abortions."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, said Senator Smith was misrepresenting the legislation and its safeguards. He said this was further evidence of President Bush's subservience to "his extremist supporters in the anti-abortion movement."
"The issue of fetal tissue research should be decided by research doctors in their laboratories, not by spin doctors in the White House or Congress," he said.
The handgun legislation, known as the Brady bill for its chief outside sponsor, James Brady, the former White House press secretary, was also pushed by Mr. Mitchell. He cited the support for the bill from past Presidents and past Attorneys General, but under the parliamentary circumstances, he had to ask unanimous consent for its consideration.
Senator Larry Craig, Republican of Idaho, objected and the bill was dead. He said the bill would give the police too much power to deny handguns to people.
Senator Jocelyn Burdick, Democrat of North Dakota, said the bill was not a panacea for crime but "would give us a little more assurance that those who are not in control of their faculties" would not be armed.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Poll;
Poll Finds Hostility to Perot And No Basic Shift in Race

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
Ross Perot's return to the 1992 Presidential campaign has been greeted with overwhelming hostility by American voters, leaving the contest fundamentally unchanged, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. Gov. Bill Clinton holds a persistent lead over President Bush as the campaign enters its final month.
Mr. Perot, who briefly surged to the top of some polls last spring, has a remarkably negative image in the new survey, with 80 percent of the people who once supported him but no longer do saying they do not trust him. 
 While Mr. Perot has yet to begin his advertising campaign, only 7 percent of the registered voters said they planned to vote for him, about the same as John Anderson's support in October 1980 and well below George Wallace's in October 1968. Seventy-two percent said he should not have rejoined the campaign, which he bolted in July.
 
Grim Findings for Bush
 The new survey, based on telephone interviews with 1,252 adults, also has grim findings for the Bush campaign, which has high hopes that Mr. Perot can splinter the anti-Bush vote and help shake up the race. Even in a three-way contest, Mr. Clinton retains a lead, with 46 percent of the probable electorate, to 38 percent for Mr. Bush and 7 percent for Mr. Perot.
More ominously, several of Mr. Bush's most important ratings remain poor. Only 37 percent of all adults approve of the way Mr. Bush is doing his job, down from 42 percent last month. Economic issues continue to dominate the voters' agenda, and only 16 percent in the poll approve of Mr. Bush's economic stewardship.
More voters do view Mr. Clinton unfavorably than did so in September, a central goal for the Bush campaign. But Mr. Bush's unfavorable rating has also risen, and he remains burdened with a much more negative image than the Democratic nominee.
 
Make-or-Break Opportunity
 In general, the poll underscores what is widely accepted in political circles: the coming series of three Presidential debates is a make-or-break opportunity for Mr. Bush to revive his campaign. Sixty-seven percent of the registered voters said it was very likely that they would watch the first debate on Sunday and 54 percent said they expected to learn something from it.
The survey, conducted Friday through Sunday, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Mr. Perot's long tease over re-entering the race, which culminated in his announcement on Thursday, carried a clear price in public esteem. The survey shows that only 11 percent of the registered voters accept Mr. Perot's argument that he re-entered the race at the behest of his volunteers.
Just 7 percent of the registered voters voiced a favorable opinion of Mr. Perot, while 59 percent viewed him unfavorably, a marked decline from last spring, when the Texas billionaire first burst onto the political scene and also from a CBS poll in late September.
Fifty-six percent of the voters said Mr. Perot's presence in the race had been a distraction, while 32 percent said it had helped focus the campaign on real issues. Mr. Perot was given the edge in one area: 51 percent said he was "tough enough to make the hard decisions necessary to reduce the Federal budget deficit," while 42 percent said the same for Mr. Bush, and 46 percent for Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Perot was also seen by 40 percent of the voters as saying "what he really believes most of the time," while 45 percent said he was saying what he thought the voters wanted to hear.
But the poll, in general, shows an enormous loss of influence by Mr. Perot. Eighty-eight percent said it would make no difference if he endorsed Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton. Only 1 percent said they expected Mr. Perot to win.
 
Concern About Mistakes
 Mr. Perot was no longer regarded as a legitimate agent of change; only 16 percent agreed that electing him would "bring about the kind of change the country needs," while 69 percent said it would not. And only 12 percent said Mr. Perot could "be trusted to deal with all the problems a President has to deal with," while 75 percent said they were concerned that he "might make serious mistakes."
The survey, while conducted before Mr. Perot begins his advertising campaign and enters the debates, nevertheless tends to support predictions by many analysts that he will eventually fare much as independent or third party candidates have fared in the recent past. Mr. Anderson, who was at 9 percent in the polls in October 1980, eventually received 7 percent of the popular vote. Mr. Wallace, who was at 15 percent in the October 1968 polls, received 14 percent of the popular vote.
On a national level, Mr. Perot seems to be drawing fairly evenly from both Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton.
The overall race seems to have changed little from the last New York Times/CBS News Poll in mid-September; Mr. Clinton has an eight-point advantage among the probable electorate in the current poll, compared with a seven-point advantage in September. Mr. Perot was the choice of 13 percent then, and 7 percent now.
Results based on the probable electorate reflect each respondent's likelihood of voting. Among all registered voters, Mr. Clinton's lead in the latest poll was also eight points.
 
Symmetrical Toll
 The escalating attacks being exchanged by the Bush and Clinton campaigns have taken an eerily symmetrical toll: 33 percent said Mr. Clinton had not told the truth about his draft history, up from 25 percent last month, while 63 percent said Mr. Bush was hiding something that the public ought to know about the Iran-contra affair, up from 55 percent. But overwhelming majorities said those issues would not affect their votes.
In general, the public's attention remains riveted on the ailing economy, which may help explain why voters seem to be paying more attention to the Presidential campaign this year: 54 percent of the registered voters said they had been paying "a lot" of attention to this campaign, compared with 34 percent in October 1988.
The perception of the economy remains bleak, with 79 percent of all adults rating it bad or very bad. And they clearly hold the President accountable: 59 percent said the economy was "something that an effective President could do a lot about."
Mr. Bush retains some strengths. His approval rating for foreign policy is 54 percent, and he continues to hold a slight edge in trustworthiness to "handle all the problems a President has to deal with." Moreover, Mr. Clinton is considered by 35 percent of the voters as more likely to raise taxes, compared with 10 percent who said Mr. Bush was.
The poll indicates that expectations are high for Mr. Clinton in the coming debate: 41 percent said they expected Mr. Clinton to win it, while 24 percent predicted a victory for Mr. Bush, and 8 percent for Mr. Perot.
The survey shows an anti-incumbent mood among the voters about Congressional candidates, with 39 percent saying their representative deserved re-election and 51 percent saying it was time to give a new person a chance.
The Democrats have a slight edge in Congressional races; 44 percent of the probable electorate said they intended to vote for a Democrat for Congress, while 39 percent said they would back a Republican.
When asked to rate the parties, people gave the Democrats the edge on handling unemployment, the Republicans the edge on handling foreign economic competition and divided narrowly between the two over which was better at dealing with inflation.
The Times/CBS News poll was consistent with other new surveys. A Washington Post/ABC News poll released last night showed Mr. Clinton with 48 percent of likely voters, Mr. Bush with 35 percent and Mr. Perot with 9 percent, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. A USA Today/CNN/ Gallup Poll released yesterday showed Mr. Clinton with 47 percent, Mr. Bush with 35 percent and Mr. Perot with 10 percent, with a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Friday through Sunday with 1,252 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, of whom 994 said they were registered voters.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers.
Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
The findings related to voting are reported in terms of an overall "probable electorate" of 934 respondents, which uses responses to questions dealing with voter registration, past voting history, and the likelihood of voting in 1992 as a measure of the probability of particular respondents' voting in November.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adults in the country. The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for results based on registered men it is plus or minus five percentage points, while for registered women it is four percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. For example, differences in the wording and order of questions can lead to somewhat varying results.

HEADLINE: Learning if Infants Are Hurt When Mothers Go to Work

SERIES: The Good Mother: Minding the Children -- Third article of a series:

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
An infant girl squirms among the toys at a day-care center, saying "ahh, ahh" and reaching out. The teacher, who is holding another infant in her arms, smiles at the girl, says "Want to play ball?" and reaches over to push a beach ball into the infant's lap.
It hardly seems the stuff of high science, let alone Presidential politics. But these everyday actions of teacher and baby, scored by a watchful researcher in dozens of categories like "responds to child's vocalizations" and "positive physical contact," are yielding specks of data in a vast national study designed to answer some of the most emotionally charged questions in science and society today: Do working mothers imperil their children's inner security and future happiness? Does day care at an early age put children on a slow track for life?
 
Complicated Research
 
 One of the most complex research projects ever undertaken in the behavioral sciences, the federally sponsored study of more than 1,300 randomly selected babies is searching for both the patterns of early care that may help a child thrive and patterns that may hinder learning or emotional development.
The goal is as incontestably good as motherhood, but the researchers pursuing it at 10 universities around the country know they are poking into giant passions. The issues at the heart of the research have generated acid exchanges among scientists, sown fear and guilt among millions of parents, been fashioned into rhetorical clubs for bashing or defending feminism and even provided raw material for this year's Presidential campaign.
The inner conflict and public debate reflect a swift transformation of the American family. It is not just that more mothers work. Since the 1950's, the change has been most striking among mothers of the youngest children.
By 1976, the first year the Census Bureau asked the precise question, 31 percent of mothers with a child under the age of 1 were in the labor force. By 1990, driven by economic need and changing attitudes about personal fulfillment, 53 percent of such mothers were. The trend was most pronounced among college graduates with infants less than a year old: 68 percent worked.
With the increased reliance on day care and baby-sitting arrangements came the questions and the defiant, often self-justifying assertions. Gradually, too, has come the research, which scientists agree has not yet provided conclusive answers.
"Most of the research up to now has assumed that all day care is comparable," said Bettye Caldwell, an expert on child development at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and a leader of the new study. "But we know that's not true. There's excellent care and abysmal care, and care by the families differs dramatically, too."
In the late 1980's, Jay Belsky of Pennsylvania State University said accumulating evidence suggested that extensive, early nonmaternal care might be harming some children. His statement created a professional uproar, and the subject was hashed out on talk shows and in midnight discussions of countless working parents.
 
Some Broad Agreements
 While the debate continues today, there are also wide areas of agreement among the experts, including these items:
*The debate is largely over care in the first year of life. Even the minority of studies that raise alarms about extensive, early nonmaternal care find few differences in cognitive, social and behavioral traits when care begins after the age of 1, though of course the quality of care matters at any age.
*Any harm from early nonmaternal care itself is small, and most children of working mothers are unaffected in the traits that were measured.
*For children from poor families, early, high-quality day care often means improved scores.
*Even if early outside care does no harm, having a parent at home full-time for at least the first three or four months is an intrinsically good thing for both parents and children.
Whatever their views of the evidence, child-development experts lament the wearying stresses that afflict many two-earner families and are virtually unanimous in their calls for generous parental-leave policies, improved availability and quality of day care and greater flexibility in the workplace to allow, for example, more part-time work.
To some degree, a strident academic debate that came to be seen as a referendum on feminism and women's work has softened as experts acknowledged that most mothers are in the work force to stay. Attention has shifted to evidence that much of the day care provided in this country, both in centers and the private homes that provide most nonparental care, does not meet high standards in crucial areas like the number of children per adult, whether children see the same adults over time and whether children receive warm, responsive, individual attention.
"I'm very worried, not because so many women are working -- they are, and it's economic -- but because the quality of infant care in this country typically is not good." said Ellen Galinsky, co-president of the Families and Work Institute, a research group in New York.
 
Clarifying a Stand
 Dr. Belsky, an investigator in the new national study, clarified his assertions about possible risks of early maternal work in a recent interview. "I wasn't saying anything about the inevitable effects of day care," he said. "I was talking about care as we have it in this country."
Alison Clarke-Stewart, a psychologist at the University of California at Irvine, an investigator in the new study and a critic of Dr. Belsky, said: "I do think it is important for an infant to form a close attachment with a parent. I'm less convinced a mother can't still do that when she works.
"I think it's pretty hard to do if you are working long hours every day. In the best of all worlds, everybody would have access to part-time work."
Scholars in this field have mainly studied the role of mothers as primary care-givers, not out of sexist bias, they say, but because fathers who truly play this role remain so rare. Most say they believe that a father could take much the same place in an infant's life.
 
The Old Debate
A Study in 1986 Raised a Warning
 Much research on child care and development has focused on infant-mother attachment, a quality many psychologists consider a cornerstone of emotional and social development. This theory says children with a secure attachment, usually to the mother, in infancy are more likely to feel confident as they explore their surroundings, to have good relations with peers and teachers and to be more competent at solving problems, said Susan Spieker, a psychologist at the University of Washington. Scientists are unsure about how lasting and immutable the effects are.
Although researchers increasingly try to observe real-life interactions, the security of infant-mother attachment is usually measured in "strange situation" experiments. In such tests, babies at about 12 to 18 months are typically left alone in a room for a few minutes with a friendly stranger, then rejoined by their mothers, then left all alone before their mother returns again. Studying how the babies respond to the separations and especially the reunions, psychologists judge whether the child is securely or insecurely attached.
In 1986 Dr. Belsky created a furor when, citing data from several strange-situation studies and behavioral observations, he said that extensive nonmaternal care in the first year appeared to pose a degree of risk in development of insecure attachments in infancy and "heightened aggressiveness, noncompliance, and withdrawal in the preschool and early school years."
Many of his colleagues reacted sharply, asserting, among other things, that the differences he had found were small, that the study samples may have been biased, that the strange situation may be an inappropriate test for children accustomed to separations and, above all, that differing outcomes were almost certainly related to quality of care, rather than the fact of nonmaternal care.
At a "summit meeting" in 1987 the warring parties agreed with the proposition that when parents have access to "stable child-care arrangements featuring skilled, sensitive and motivated care-givers, there is every reason to believe that both children and families can thrive."
The gap was narrowed, but differences remain. Dr. Belsky, who believes he has been pilloried by ideologues, says he still believes it is possible that future evidence will show that early, extensive day care in and of itself is harmful to some infants.
"I think what we've got here is a cause for concern, nothing to call for alarm and hysteria," Dr. Belsky said. While most children are not harmed, he said, the small number who are would add up to a social problem. For example, it could be an extra disruptive child or two in a classroom.
But Deborah Phillips, a psychologist at the University of Virginia who is also participating in the Federal project, said: "There's a world of difference between saying that child care is harmful, and saying that when care falls below a threshold of quality it places a child at risk. Then you talk about quality, instead of who's providing the care. That's a very different issue. "
 
More Research
More Ambiguities, Fewer Certainties
 A new, more extensive analysis of 13 strange-situation studies, just published by Michael E. Lamb and others at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, also found a difference between babies whose mothers stayed home through the first year and those who received other care. But the difference was small: 71 percent of those with exclusive maternal care were judged to be securely attached, while 65 percent of those with regular nonmaternal care were. None of the studies measured the quality of care, and the families studied had above-average incomes and were almost all white.
A few other recent studies, looking at actual behavior and at cognitive tests in a large number of 3- and 4-year-olds, have also found small differences. But Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, a psychologist at Columbia University and an author of a study published in 1991, explained why the results should be received with caution. The detrimental impact of first-year maternal employment, while significant, accounted for only a minor part of the variations between the groups of children, the study found. Other factors like poverty, the mother's education and the number of adults in the household had greater effect, she said.
Numerous similar studies have suggested intriguing or surprising patterns. For example, some have found that children did better if the mother returned to work earlier rather than later in the first year, or that boys with nonmaternal care scored more poorly than girls. Some have found that infants raised by grandmothers or baby sitters in the home did as well as those raised by their mothers. But these results have sometimes been contradictory and were seldom presented with scientific confidence.
 
The New Project
Clear Answers Are Being Sought
 The new Federal study, sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, is intended through its large size, broad scope and intricate design to provide the clearest answers yet. Begun in 1991 and scheduled to last five years, it is registering not only the types of care that children receive but also evaluating the emotional texture of care, both from outsiders and from parents.
"We're trying to far more carefully identify the actual pattern of the child's experience than has been done in the past," said Robert Bradley, a psychologist at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. "We're looking at the place of care, we're looking at the same child at home with his mother, and we are also looking at the child's individual temperament and needs."
The children's development is being evaluated in several ways. At the age of 15 months, maternal attachment is measured in strange-situation experiments, but attachment will also be examined through direct observations in the home at the age of 2. Cognitive and language development, peer relations, self-control and compliance with parents and teachers will all be evaluated.
The newly detailed look at the home environment, for children of working as well as stay-at-home mothers, should provide far more subtle conclusions than ever before. "For example," Dr. Bradley asked, "if a child has problems, is it a function of the outside care, or is it because the mother is overworked and worried about money, and not enjoying child-rearing?"
Researchers may begin analyzing early data in about two years, said Sarah L. Friedman, project director at the national institute, but most results will not come until later. Despite the enthusiastic cooperation of academic foes and the unusual richness of data, experts warn that no study is apt to provide a simple blueprint.
"Both sides are excited about it for now," Dr. Belsky said. But "there will be different spin doctors" interpreting the data, and "to the extent people think they'll get a green light or a red light, they'll be disappointed," he added. For many mothers, work and child care are givens in any case, but better information may help them seek the care that is best for their child, and create the best home environment.
Whatever the study finds, none of the child-development experts are apt to advocate the kind of stressful return to work in as little as six weeks that some working women face today.
"I feel very strongly that mothers and infants need a certain period together after birth to learn the rhythms of each other's life," Dr. Caldwell said. "Once that happens and that attachment is there, we know it can survive."
She said there was ample reason to promote parental leave without assuming that early day care is harmful.
"The experience of being a mother of a young infant is a grand and glorious one," Dr. Caldwell said. "And the most precious thing in a relationship is time. I think there is a difference between saying that something is better to do, and saying something is wrong or harmful."

GRAPHIC: In "strange situation" experimients, psychologists evaluate the quality of infant-mother attachments. In these videotape scenes, an infant's active play in a new room, 1, suggests inner confidence. Later, left alone for a few minutes, 2, she is clearly distressed. As her mother returns, the infant reaches out for comfort. Still upset, the infant hugs her mother, 4, but is quickly reassured, 5. Individual behavior varies and many different patterns can reflect secure attachments. (pg. A21)

HEADLINE: Brazil Takes Turn to the Left; New Chief Makes Slow Start

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Only three days after Itamar Franco became Acting President, Brazil appears to be drifting toward left-wing nationalism, with the Workers' Party scoring strongly in mayoral elections and Mr. Franco attacking "foreign interests."
Slow to fill a power vacuum left by the impeachment of Fernando Collor de Mello last week, Mr. Franco is acting as Brazil's reluctant President. Although he denounced his predecessor's plans to maintain a "parallel government," Mr. Franco discussed his own Government today in terms of "however long it lasts." 
 "Second rate start," said the cover today of Veja, a major news weekly.
Reflecting the malaise, Sao Paulo's stock market index dropped 5 percent today, after an 8 percent drop Friday.
Results announced today from mayoral elections Saturday showed that candidates of the Workers' Party, a Socialist group that propelled the impeachment drive, reached runoff elections in four of Brazil's largest cities.
 
Party 'the Big Winner'
 "Post-impeachment Brazil has a left to center-left face," the newspaper, Folha de Sao Paulo, concluded today.
In Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, the Workers' Party candidate, Eduardo Suplicy, forced his rightist opponent, Paulo Maluf, into a runoff after volunteers papered the city with photographs of the rightist as best man at Mr. Collor's wedding in 1984.
Business disillusionment has spread with Mr. Franco's choice of a politician and lawyer from the impoverished northeast as Finance Minister of the nation with Latin America's highest inflation rate and the third world's largest foreign debt.
 
'Suffering People' Cited
 Responding to press criticism that his new Finance Minister does not speak English, Mr. Franco shot back that Brazil "needs to forget a little about New York, Manhattan, and think about its slums, its suffering people."
"What is modernity?" he asked, referring to a Collor slogan. "Is it defending foreign interests, or defending the interests of our country?"
Mr. Franco also charged that Mr. Collor planned to operate a "parallel government" out of "a bunker" during his trial on corruption charges. If Mr. Collor is acquitted, he will automatically reassume presidential powers.
On Saturday, Mr. Collor sent Mr. Franco a request for presidential privileges while out of power: offices, a professional staff of 20, a helicopter, official cars, free airline tickets, and the support of Brazilian embassies.
 
Prison Inquiry Urged
 While Mr. Franco grumbled about this list, Mr. Collor upstaged the acting President in his first crisis: the killing of more than 100 inmates in a Sao Paulo jail on Friday. While Mr. Franco has been mute on the scandal, Mr. Collor called the killings "horrifying" and urged an impartial inquiry.
The prisoners said 200 died in the police attack. Officials put the figure at 111.
Today, the Governor of Sao Paulo State, Luis Antonio Fleury, announced the dismissal of the prison director and five high-ranking police commanders involved in the violence.

HEADLINE: Storm Left Hard Future For Hawaii's Lush Island

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIHUE, Hawaii, Oct. 1

 BODY:
For the last dozen years, Will Squyres, a former helicopter gunship pilot in South Vietnam, has carried tourists up over the spectacular natural wonders of Kauai. But this day he somewhat reluctantly agreed to fly a visiting photographer and reporter to see what Hurricane Iniki had done to what many consider the most beautiful of the Hawaiian Islands.
His Jet Ranger lifted over Kawaikini, the 5,243-foot volcanic peak. Below, stands of Norfolk pines, koa and eucalyptus trees could be seen flattened like match sticks. The Alakai swamp hardly looked touched, but soon the famed remote Na Pali Coast came into view, its spectacular bluffs scoured by storm erosion and the trail that is the only land access washed out. 
 "This will all come back soon," insisted Mr. Squyres, as much public relations man as pilot. "We are already starting to get green."
Three weeks after the fierce hurricane swept in from the southwest with 160-mile-an-hour winds, the residents of the oldest and westernmost important island of this archipelago state have begun to face a tough future with a mix of grit, weariness and a caring family spirit known here as ohana.
 
Astonishing Destruction
 A two-day tour of the 30-mile-wide island found astonishing destruction. Great tangled masses of downed electric and phone wires line almost every street, along with piles of mattresses, washing machines and other ruined household items. The lush gardens that gave the island its sobriquet, The Garden Island, are mostly gone now, though leaves have already sprouted. In spots, the lush rain forest looks as though a giant weedwhacker had rushed through.
Naturalists worry that four plant species may have been wiped out by the hurricane, and the population of certain rare birds may be even more precarious. The tourism industry is almost as hard hit, and the damage forced the Pentagon to postpone tests of new missile systems from a base here intended to help develop "Star Wars" weapons.
But the everyday problems take center stage for most residents.
Crews from as far away as Southern California are restoring the electric system, but so far only a fifth of the 24,469 homes and businesses have power, and only about half have telephone service. Most people, including Mayor JoAnn A. Yukimura, are still living in damaged homes with candles, flashlights and cold showers, praying that heavy rains will not come before they repair their roofs. About 7,000 homes were destroyed or rendered unfit for habitation.
But with help from 5,000 soldiers from the United States Army and the Hawaii National Guard, the roads were all clear by today. Electric generators roared everywhere, and grocery stores had reopened. On Rice Street, the main thoroughfare of Lihue, City Liquor was selling cold beer, Kawamoto's Barber Shop was open mornings and Dani's Restaurant was doing a thriving business feeding the construction and demolition workers.
 
Blow to Tourist Industry
 And folks were trading stories, like the one about the teen-age boys who returned home the other day from Honolulu with food and other survival donations from family friends. The boys spurned bags of rice, thinking that rice could not be cooked without an electric rice maker.
But it was not as easy to chuckle over the island's future, either from the point of view of the tourist economy or the fragile natural environment.
On a typical day, the island's 51,177 residents would be joined by nearly 20,000 tourists, who form the backbone of the economy. About half the island's work force of 28,700 people appears to have lost their regular jobs, although many have been able to shift to reconstruction work.
Nearly all the 7,846 hotel rooms have been wrecked, and most hotels do not expect to reopen before early next year.
"The immediate crisis is over," Mayor Yukimura said. "We have water, and food distribution is going fairly well." But she said the more difficult problem was restoring the tourist industry. "All our services are not at optimum," she said. "We cannot welcome visitors back now." But she expressed optimism that the natural environment would recover quickly.
 
Endangered Species
 Naturalists were less sure about what would grow back. Though hurricanes are part of the natural cycle here, numerous birds and plants have been pushed to the brink of extinction in recent decades by human introduction of outside plants that crowd out native vegetation and eliminate important habitats. The introduced species include banana poka, a Central American vine that smothers trees.
Among the endangered species are water birds like the Hawaiian duck and the Hawaiian coot and forest birds like the Kauai Akialoa and the Kauai thrush.
"A lot of these species are on the edge -- this didn't help," said Ronald L. Walker, wildlife program manager at the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources.
Wildlife experts fanned out in recent days to assess the damage and are considering reseeding certain areas by air. There is also concern about fire, given all the dead trees.
Iniki has also raised questions about the Strategic Target System, a series of missile launchings the Army had planned to make from the western edge of the island as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars." The launchings, scheduled to start in November after years of protest and delay, are to send Polaris missiles southwest across the Pacific in a test to mimic intercontinental ballistic missiles to be shot down.
The program has been bitterly fought by some residents on the ground that a failed launching could damage the environment. The leader of this group, Elizabeth Freeman, a graphic designer in Hanaeli, traveled to Washington after the hurricane and lobbied for a moratorium. On Sept. 29, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, issued a vague announcement that the launchings had been postponed indefinitely until the island recovered from Iniki.
Still, the launchings have considerable local support. The military base, the Barking Sands Pacific Missile Range, employs nearly 700 people, and, with widespread unemployment after the storm, it has not gone unnoticed that the base was one of the few employers who retained all of its workers. The military's efficient and much appreciated relief efforts have not hurt either.

Clinton Pushes Hard in Florida, as Bush Support Slips

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., Oct. 5

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore declared today that the Democrats would win Florida because President Bush had abandoned the state, which has been won by the Republicans in all but two Presidential elections since 1952.
The Democratic nominees for President and Vice President touched base with all of the important groups of voters that the Democrats have identified as winnable this year, including students, blacks and the elderly. 
 Their campaign swing here, which was capped by a dusk rally attended by thousands of supporters at the Southeastern Livestock Pavilion, followed Mr. Bush's weekend visit to the state, a trip that apparently became necessary after the Democrats began to show signs of reviving their local fortunes.
Three polls conducted before Ross Perot's return to the campaign have shown the race as a virtual dead heat between Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton. Florida, which has 25 electoral votes, is considered a vital ingredient in Mr. Bush's re-election bid. In the 1988 general election, Mr. Bush won more than 60 percent of the Florida vote.
 
Message to Ticket-Splitters
 In an area of Florida that Mr. Clinton's aides said was home to some of the state's most independent ticket-splitting voters, the Arkansas Governor tailored his message to Republican and independent voters today, remarking at one roadside rally in Leesburg, "I do not seek a victory of party."
Mr. Bush was campaigning in Dover, Del., today, striving to chip away at Mr. Clinton's credibility.
Speaking of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the President said Mr. Clinton "won't let the facts get in the way" of a politically popular position. On Sunday, Mr. Clinton gave a long-delayed endorsement to the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, but he conditioned his support on changes that would appease its critics.
At the first stop of the Clinton-Gore bus tour today, in Daytona Beach, Mr. Clinton said the Republicans "have believed for years that they owned Florida in the general election," but he said that would soon end. "You can turn out the lights for trickle-down economics and open a new day for the United States of America," he said.
Mr. Clinton dismissed the possibility that the independent candidacy of Mr. Perot would have an impact on his vote-getting abilities here or elsewhere. A vote for Mr. Perot, he suggested, would be a vote for four more years of Mr. Bush.
"In the end, the American people are going to have to make up their minds whether they want to re-elect George Bush," by voting for Perot, he said. "They'll have to decide."
 
Bush Levels Attack
 Later this evening, Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton returned to the increasingly familiar political forum of a television talk show to criticize Mr. Bush for a tax plan that they said would cut Medicare benefits, an important issue for elderly voters in Florida.
"We said that since he promised not to fool with Social Security, the only way he could do would be to decimate the whole rest of the Federal domestic budget, including Medicare," Mr. Clinton said on the CNN program "Larry King Live."
In his weekend trip to Florida, Mr. Bush leveled his most personal attack of the campaign at Mr. Clinton, ridiculing the Democrat as a slippery character who has been untruthful about his military record and is seeking to scare the elderly by misrepresenting the President's position on Medicaid and Medicare spending.
 
Complaint About Bad-Mouthing
 Today, Mr. Clinton responded, telling the boisterous rally on the shorefront in Daytona Beach that the President was "bad-mouthing me in terms that wouldn't even be used in a race for local college student government."
With Bush-Quayle protesters chanting in the background, Mr. Clinton said the Republicans' campaign was made up of "the most cynical and manipulative bunch I have ever seen."
Mr. Clinton has begun appealing to the states that his strategists now thinks he can win by providing remote television interviews. On Saturday, he spoke to three television stations in Florida and others in Minnesota, Louisiana and North Carolina.
In each case, he has vowed to visit soon and described the Democratic ticket to local interviewers as progressive or conservative, whatever the locality seemed to call for.
In Delaware, Mr. Bush focused on Mr. Clinton's changing positions, with emphasis on the trade agreement. Mr. Bush told a crowd of about 4,000 at the State Capitol that he had fought for the trade pact "every step of the way because it's the right thing to do."
Of Mr. Clinton, he said: "Once upon a time, he said he was for Nafta, the free-trade agreement. Then the labor bosses told him that they were against it. So he said he wasn't sure if he was for it, or against it. Now he's looked at the polls, he's seen that the American people want Nafta, and just yesterday he said he's for it. And then again, maybe he's not.
"It doesn't matter what's right or what's wrong, he just tells people what he thinks they want to hear."
Trailing in public-opinion polls and driven to scramble for support even in tiny Delaware, which has but three of the 270 electoral votes he needs to win, Mr. Bush acknowledged in somber tones that these were "tough political times, and it's been about as ugly a political year as I've ever seen."
"The media has been rolling down the tracks in their own inimitable way," he said, "and it's not been very pleasant."

Quayle Encounters Hostility

 
 SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 5 (Special to The New York Times) -- Vice President Dan Quayle ran into an unfriendly crowd in San Francisco's Chinatown today. After an appearance at a school, Mr. Quayle decided to walk several blocks to a fund-raising event at a restaurant.
But as he strolled along the narrow streets, a crescendo of hostile shouts grew. Chants of "Four more weeks!" and "Shame! Shame! Shame!" along with obscenities, battered the Vice President. Police officers in riot gear and Secret Service agents closed ranks around Mr. Quayle, who appeared stunned by his reception, and hustled him into a car that sped away.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
What Worked in 1988 Is No Aid to Bush Now

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
If 1988 is remembered as the year they wrote the book on negative campaigning, 1992 may be the year the book was sent back for revision.
With just four weeks to go until Election Day, George Bush's campaign strategy is starting to look a lot like the one he used four years ago. He is attacking Bill Clinton's fitness to be Commander in Chief (shades of Michael S. Dukakis riding a tank), questioning the Arkansas Governor's patriotism (shades of the Pledge of Allegiance) and attacking his record on the environment (shades of Boston Harbor). 
 Just as they did in 1988, these attacks have a clearly defined goal: to load the opposition down with "negatives" until it eventually sinks under its weight. But unlike in 1988, the attacks do not seem to be having much effect.
In part, this is because of the country's circumstances: It is tough to turn the election into a referendum on your opponent when you have spent the last four years presiding over a recession.
In part, Mr. Bush may also be a victim of his own success. Having shown the country how a successful negative campaign is waged, the Bush campaign should not be surprised to find that the public and the press have become more discriminating.
"What you're seeing is a very self-protective electorate," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, who has written extensively on the effects of negative campaigning. "We may have the first set of conditions to lead to a backlash."
Putting together a successful negative campaign is a lot like putting together a winning movie promotion; the point is to put out the same message through the press, paid commercials and eventually word of mouth. This kind of coordination requires a lot of teamwork and a lot of luck.
Studies of the last election indicate that Mr. Bush's critiques of Mr. Dukakis were effective largely because they were picked up by the press and used to shape the story of the day. In fact, by September 1988 attacks had become the most reliable way for either candidate to get his message on the evening news.
According to the Center for Media and Public Affairs, in the two weeks after Labor Day, 55 percent of all the network news stories quoting Mr. Bush pictured the then-Vice President criticizing Mr. Dukakis. Almost 50 percent of the stories quoting Mr. Dukakis showed him attacking Mr. Bush.
After the 1988 campaign was over, there was even more than usual amount of post-election hand-wringing in newsrooms across the country. The consensus grew among both journalists and political scientists that the press had focused too much on the daily back and forth -- most of it unflattering and much of it irrelevant -- and too little on the long-range issues confronting the country. News executives vowed to use more vigilance against the effects of negative campaigning, and by many standards, at least, they have.
In the two weeks after Labor Day this year, only 25 percent of the stories quoting the President showed him attacking Mr. Clinton; for Mr. Clinton the figure was down to 19 percent.
"There's no doubt that the experience of 1988 has been a factor in the coverage this year," said Bill Wheatley, who directs political coverage at NBC.
Further complicating the President's efforts to get some negative synergy going between his campaign and the press coverage is the economy. Whenever the economy is in the news, which is often, it tends to work against the President's paid advertising and for his opponent.
"The national economic news is an ongoing anti-Bush ad," Ms. Jamieson said.
Finally, there is some evidence that voters, who always maintain they are not affected by negative advertising, are actually resisting it this year.
The Clinton campaign put together mock Bush ads attacking Mr. Clinton, even tougher than those on television now; focus groups exposed to the ads expressed more discomfiture with the commercials than doubts about the Governor. And Shanto Iyengar, a professor of political science at the University of California at Los Angeles , found that six out of the seven candidates in the recent California Senate primary hurt themselves with voters by using negative commercials. In a similar study conducted two years ago, Mr. Iyengar found voters more likely to embrace candidates who used negative ads.
"You're a lot better off giving people an affirmative reason to vote for you," he said.
Given all this, voters might expect the Presidential candidates to spend the next four weeks accentuating the positive. They would be mistaken. The Bush campaign is planning to put new "comparative" commercials on the air this week highlighting further deficiencies in Mr. Clinton's record. The Clinton campaign is planning new attack ads of its own.
Both camps do agree, though, that barring any major new revelations, these attack ads will not have much impact on the outcome of the election.
"The task is much more difficult this time," one Bush campaign aide acknowledged. The ads, he said, can't just raise "fears and doubts and concerns. It has to be something really debilitating."

HEADLINE: Free-Market Ideas Grow on Russian Farms

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GRIGOROPOLISSKAYA, Russia

 BODY:
Ask about the "free market" or "reform," and people out on these fertile South Russian plains still begin to snarl.
But ask about the price of wheat or the cost of fuel, and the animated patter tells a different story. A year after the Government began to wean agriculture from the hugely inefficient Soviet system, some tender new shoots of market are appearing in the hardened old collective farms, the kolkhozes. 
 Russian farmers have always had a capitalist streak of sorts. Even during the most Communist of times, peasants were allowed their private plots of land, which in some areas provided most of the meat and vegetables in local markets.
But rare was the farmer who felt any direct responsibility for the collective farm. This is what is changing.
The effect on production is hard to measure. Officials in Moscow say they expect 96 million tons of grain this year, short of the 115 million Russia needs, but 7 million tons above last year's harvest. While no one says the increase was a result of the fledgling market, it confounded the many skeptics who had warned that reforms would destroy agriculture.
The shortage, officials said, will be offset in part through purchases in Kazakhstan and Ukraine and in part through more imports from the West.
The key point, the change in attitude, has become evident over the past 12 months.
Last year, when the first decrees came down proclaiming the new era of the free market, virtually every member of the huge Rossiya collective here -- 1,900 workers on 55,500 rich, black acres in the wheat belt between Krasnodar and Stavropol -- signed a petition to the regional administration saying, in effect, "Leave us alone."
People still go on about "those cockroaches in Moscow" and complain, "What's this country coming to?" But these were some other recent remarks:
"We did a lot of barter last year, but now we can get up to 22 rubles at the exchange."
"We might sell our wheat in Russia and buy the cheaper stuff from Kazakhstan for feed."
"We'll put in less sugar beet next year. The plant is 1,000 kilometers away, and with new fuel costs ----"
"We're looking into our own sunflower press. We could easily pay it off in five years."
Despite all the doomsday warnings last year of collapse and famine after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Communist system, the wheat crop was respectable, the corn and sunflowers pulled through the drought and the accounts ended up in the black.
 
A Real Cooperative
 The debate is far from over, of course. Kolkhoz members still argue vehemently against parceling out collective land for private farms, and Parliament has not yet crossed the hurdle of private land ownership.
But what is already clear is that the Rossiya kolkhoz, much like the country it is named after, is learning to look to the bottom line.
For one thing, it has become a real cooperative, in which all the workers and pensioners have a formal share. Even the fields look better, because workers have been far more careful harvesting.
On the next rung of the food chain, the grain elevator in the regional center at Novo-Aleksandrovskaya, Raisa Makarenko's job as deputy director used to entail little more than receiving and dispensing state-owned grain. Now she slips naturally into bargaining.
 
Learning to Bargain
 Discussing the ruble price per kilogram of wheat, she said: "If we buy at 12, we have to sell at 21 or 22 to make ends meet. Break-even is 17, with the value-added tax. But here's the problem: I just talked to Yaroslavl and offered them 3,000 tons for 25. They just said no. On the exchanges they're offering 20 to 22, so I had to go for 20."
That meant a loaf of the best bread in Yaroslavl, a city north of Moscow, will sell for about 15 rubles, roughly what it costs today.
Aleksei P. Zalkin, the head of the regional administration at Novo-Aleksandrovskaya, remarked: "We're not used to all this yet, of course. All our life we worked on stern diktat from above," he added, flicking a glance at the unsmiling Lenin still hanging over his desk. "We answered with our head and our party card for every head of cattle.
"But our psychology has changed a lot in the past year. Nobody counted money before. Now a day doesn't pass without a check on the balance sheet. People understand that it will never be, that it can't be, as it was."
And Lenin? "Oh, we'll get to that when we have time."
 
It Was the Peasants' Fault
 Here in Russia's heartland, it is hard to blame people for not rushing to take down their Lenins. Reforms came and went with brutal regularity under the czars and under the Bolsheviks, who granted land, then took it away, always binding the muzhik, or peasant, to the land -- and always in the end blaming him for the resulting disaster.
So it is little consolation here that the latest reforms are intended essentially to undo decades of disastrous manipulation and to restore elemental links among farmer, land and market.
"This is a country where we create problems and then take great pride in overcoming them," said Mikhail G. Solovyev, the chief agronomist of the Rossiya kolkhoz. "Just look there."
Outside the window of his office, a grand Russian Orthodox Church was in the last stages of reconstruction. The original church, the pride of the prosperous Kuban Cossacks who lived on these lands before they were scattered by the Bolsheviks, was blown up twice, once after the Revolution and again after World War II.
Mr. Solovyev's concern, shared widely in the conservative brotherhood of agriculture, is that the reforms not become simply another twist in the cycle of restoration and destruction.
 
Spending Priorities
 He concedes that the kolkhoz is not in bad shape: It earned enough to meet expenses and then some, and there are plans for a new sunflower press. Mr. Solovyev's dream is that instead of "wasting" dollars on imported grain, the state would spend them on imported combines and processing plants.
But market forces, he argues, have had a dual effect. Many collective farms are withholding grain from the state (which still buys 35 percent of the crop at a fixed price), hoping that prices will rise.
This year, the entire Stavropol region did not produce a single pound of top-class wheat, because the amount of fertilizer needed was too expensive. At the same time, it has become more profitable to sell grain than to raise livestock.
"The arithmetic is simple," Mr. Solovyev said. "The feed for a pig costs 12,000 rubles, and the pig fetches 5,000. So of course it's better to slaughter the livestock. But if we do, what happens to all the people and the facilities in which we invested so much? So we resist killing off the animals, but I don't know how long we can do that."
The other problem is that like most state and collective farms, Rossiya was built as a paternalistic Soviet state in miniature, responsible not only for production of food but also for the lives of its people. The names of surrounding farms bear testimony to that heritage: Lenin, Karl Marx, Friendship, Gorky.
 
A True Company Town
 Here in Grigoropolisskaya, the 8,000 residents depend on Rossiya: it built the roads, the school and the hospital; it sends people to its own rest homes on the Black Sea; it supplied the private plots and the seeds to plant them.
Wages have always been decent. Today, kolkhoz workers can earn between 3,000 and 5,000 rubles a month, well above the 2,000-ruble poverty line, plus a share of the crop and of the profits.
The kolkhoz fed its dependents through the lean years and rewarded them in good ones. And whatever the kolkhoz did not supply, the kolkhozniks could always steal, in time-honored Soviet tradition, pilfering fertilizer and fuel to maintain the lucrative private plots.
Rossiya, moreover, was a showcase. It once carried the name of Stalin himself, something only the most privileged enterprises could do, and it was a place to which Nikita S. Khrushchev and Mikhail S. Gorbachev brought visitors. When there was an American combine to try out, Rossiya got it.
 
Big, It Seems, Is Better
 Moreover, Mr. Solovyev argued, the economies of scale developed over the decades on these black-earth plains could be destroyed if the land is parceled out. Under the current kolkhoz organization, each worker and pensioner can claim a share of land, about 17 acres, only a small fraction of an average cornfield.
"However we go about these reforms, we will return to large associations," Mr. Solovyev said. "So why waste time? What would be the use? How can small farmers ever provide the roads, the schools?"
To the architects of the reforms, such plaints are reminiscent of Leonid I. Brezhnev's celebrated frustration with farmers who never ceased complaining about the weather. "The experience of many years has shown that unfavorable weather occurs almost every other year," the longtime Communist chief grumbled 12 years ago. "It should therefore not be viewed as an exception, but as a natural aspect of our climate."
Agriculture Minister Viktor N. Khlystun might well agree. The main challenge, he said in an interview in Moscow, is to change the consciousness of the farmer, to break the fatalism, the suspiciousness of the market, the dependence on the kolkhoz.
 
A Beginning, Anyway
 Yes, he said, there are problems with livestock, with disparities in prices, with wheat withheld from the market. Parliament is still dragging its feet on land ownership. Private farmers are only starting up, and basic market structures -- banks, cooperatives, equipment supplies -- are still rudimentary.
Mr. Khlystun said private farmers were expected to account for 3 percent to 3.5 percent of this year's agricultural production.
Many of the problems, he said, are predictable, and many can be resolved through some transitional juggling of prices, subsidies, interest rates and fuel discounts.
"But the main change has to be a change in mentality," he argued, echoing a conclusion reformers in all aspects of the economy have reached after the first nine months. "That's why we cannot accelerate the pace of reform, because it's linked above all to changing the mentality."
 
The Long-Term Goals
 Mr. Khlystun said the Government's goal was not to kill all the state or collective farms, but to make them self-sufficient and profitable. At the end of the transition, he said, he envisions that half of Russia's farms will be large associations, 20 percent small cooperatives and 20 percent individual farms, with 10 percent remaining with the state. "But the time is over when the Government gives money to ineffective structures," he said.
The immediate challenge is to survive the transition.
"We are now in a crisis period, in a period of survival," Mr. Khlystun said. "If there is no further cataclysm, we should finish the privatization by next spring. But it will take another 10 to 12 years to set up the banks, the services, the infrastructure. All that depends on the state of the economy."

HEADLINE: China's Communists Prepare Party Congress

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 5

 BODY:
The Communist Party is preparing for a rare congress that will convene next week to shuffle the national leadership and establish a party line that is supposed to last for the next five years.
The party congress, the first to be held since 1987, is expected to confirm the rise of more pragmatic, change-minded officials within the leadership and to launch a new slogan: the building of a "socialist market economy." 
 No one knows just what a "socialist market economy" is, and that may be part of the attraction: the term is vague enough to be acceptable to all groups, while still sounding bold and reform-minded.
The authorities have given few details about the party congress, the 14th since the Chinese Communist Party was formed more than seven decades ago, except that it will begin on Monday. Still, they have hailed its importance, with Prime Minister Li Peng describing it last week as "a major event in our country's political life."
"We are sure that it will give a fresh impetus to reform, opening up and our economic development, and become an important milestone in the history of the Chinese Communist Party and China's socialist modernization," Mr. Li said.
The party congress will approve a work report that is supposed to set the tone for the next five years, and it will also choose a new Central Committee. The Central Committee, in turn, will choose a new Politburo.
In fact, all the crucial decisions have been made in advance by the handful of octogenarians who hold ultimate power in China, and the congress is less a forum for decisions than a platform for self-promotion -- a Chinese version of a national political convention in the United States. Among the key differences are that party congress speeches can last for hours, many of the proceedings are secret, and there is no election afterward to put it all in perspective.
The 14th party congress is expected to be important in that it will presumably anoint the team of leaders who will preside over the transition after the death of Deng Xiaoping, the ailing paramount leader. But the same was said of the 13th party congress in 1987.
 
Deng Not Expected to Appear
 Mr. Deng appeared at the 1987 congress but there is no sign that he will turn up this time. He is 88 years old and rarely appears in public now.
Since the beginning of this year, Mr. Deng has been pressing behind the scenes for more rapid economic growth and restructuring, to the point of borrowing some elements from capitalism. The congress may be his last hurrah, and it is expected to endorse his preferred combination of free markets and one-party rule.
"There seems no question that the congress is intended to be a strong reaffirmation of the Deng Xiaoping line of reform and openness," said a Western diplomat in Beijing. "We expect that the new Central Committee and the new Politburo in particular will basically reflect that, in the sense that there will be a strengthening of the reform and moderate forces."
While the personnel decisions have presumably already been made, the rumors about who will be promoted vary considerably. By almost all accounts, the Politburo will be expanded from its present membership of 14, and most of the likely candidates are relatively young and enthusiastic about markets -- for goods if not ideas.
The most powerful rulers of China, all octogenarians like Mr. Deng, are nominally retired and will not be shuffled. Among the younger leaders who hold formal positions, the two most important -- Prime Minister Li and General Secretary Jiang Zemin -- are generally expected to hold onto their posts, at least for now.
 
Small Role for Delegates
 The 1,991 delegates to the party congress, which will last about a week, will be entrusted with a minor role in addition to approving decisions already made. They will elect a Central Committee from a list of names that is a bit longer than the number of positions, so that a small percentage of candidates will lose the election.

HEADLINE: Chinese Agency Indicted in Jeans Import Scheme

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan yesterday accused a Chinese Government agency of conspiring with a subsidiary in New York to evade United States quotas on clothing imports by falsely labeling thousands of jogging suits and pairs of blue jeans.
Yesterday's indictments in Federal District Court charged the China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation, which prosecutors said was the agency in charge of textiles and clothing trade, with conspiring to defraud the United States. It was the second set of indictments in a broad 17-month investigation by the Customs Service into Chinese textile export practices. 
 Prosecutors said China National, situated in Beijing, reported directly to China's Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. Two officials of China National were also charged.
While they declined to accuse the Chinese Government directly, officials suggested that high-level officials must have been involved in the fraud.
"It would be very surprising for me to think that this doesn't come from a higher level than just freelancing officials," said Robert Van Etten, special agent in charge of the United States Customs Service. "This is widespread."
Although China National is controlled by the Chinese Government, it claims to be a private corporation and therefore can be indicted like any American corporation, said Milton L. Williams Jr., the assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who is in charge of the case.
Hundreds of customs agents have been investigating importers' efforts to evade quotas and duties by mislabeling textiles and clothing from China or by shipping them through other countries. Officials have estimated that such schemes may have involved $2 billion worth of goods last year.
In May, prosecutors charged officals from a provincial Chinese trade agency with conspiring with two American companies to defraud the United States of more than $100,000 in import duties.
 
Source of Friction
 Yesterday's indictments may provide a measure of political cover to the Bush Administration, which has been accused by critics of being too soft on China. Just last week, the President vetoed a Congressional bill to link China's trade status with improvement in its record on human rights, free trade and arms proliferation. Meanwhile, the Administration has set a deadline of Saturday for China to take further steps to open its markets to imports, but in the past it has let such deadlines slip, further angering Congressional critics.
Prosecutors said the principal victim in the scheme they described yesterday was the domestic textile industry, whose sales would be undercut by an uncontrolled flood of cheaper foreign goods. "The cost to the American textile industry in the loss of jobs doesn't have a dollar figure," said Mr. Van Etten of the Customs Service.
Despite the indictments, it is far from clear whether Federal prosecutors will be able to put China National on trial. "The question of whether or not they show up, that depends on them," he said. "We would have no jurisdiction over them if they decide not to show up."
The indictments outlined two schemes, running from September 1989 to February 1990, involving China National; Chinatex America Inc., a company on West 40th Street in Manhattan that prosecutors said is owned by China National, and the Oslo Trading Company, a defunct New Jersey trading concern.
In the first scheme, the indictments said Gu Shi Qiang, identified as an agent of Chinatex, arranged with an agent of China National identified as Tan Xiang Lin to submit paper work to the Customs Service that falsely declared 24,000 boys' acrylic jogging suits to be girls' suits, thereby dodging 1989 customs quotas on boys' suits.
The indictments charge that in the second scheme, another agent of Chinatex, who was identified as Bao Yu Ping, and Zhou Li of China National joined with Benny Chang of Oslo Trading in planning to have "Made in Egypt" labels stitched into 12,000 pairs of cotton denim blue jeans made in China. According to the indictments, they were planning to send the jeans to a company in Egypt, where they were to be repackaged. Unlike the jogging suits, the jeans were never imported, Mr. Williams said.
 
A Consulting Company
 An unnamed "American consulting company" was also mentioned in the indictments as participating in the second scheme. Mr. Williams declined to comment on whether the American company would be named or charged.
Reached by telephone at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, a man who identified himself as Gueng Liu, the commercial attache, declined to comment on the charges, as did a man who identified himself as a spokesman but declined to give his name.
A telephone message left at the office of Chinatex was not answered.
If convicted on all charges, China National and Chinatex each face up to $2 million in fines.
Yesterday morning, customs agents arrested Mr. Chang, who faces a maximum of 5 years in prison if convicted and $250,000 in fines, and Mr. Gu, who faces a maximum of 17 years in prison and $1 million in fines, surrendered voluntarily at Customs Service headquarters in New York.
Mr. Bao lives in Hong Kong, and officials have begun proceedings to have him arrested, Mr. Van Etten said. The other two men are in China, he said, and it had not been determined how or if they would be arrested. Mr. Bao and Mr. Zhou each face up to 5 years in prison and $250,000 in fines, while Mr. Tan faces up to 17 years and $1 million in fines.
Among those charged, Mr. Chang is the only American citizen, according to the United States Attorney's office.
 
Other Developments
 The office announced two other developments in the customs investigation yesterday.
In a case not previously disclosed, John Cheng and his company, China Silk Fabric House, on West 40th Street in Manhattan, pleaded guilty on Sept. 30 to charges of defrauding the Government of $82,909.70 in import duties on merchandise shipped from Hong Kong. Mr. Cheng also pleaded guilty to reporting his 1990 income as $2,173, when he actually earned $206,717. He faces up to 5 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
And charges were announced yesterday against Frank Vuong, former president of All American Apparel Inc., for obstruction of justice. Prosecutors accused Mr. Vuong of submitting false documentation in response to a Customs Service inquiry.

HEADLINE: Citicorp President Resigns

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Richard S. Braddock, president of Citicorp and the first in line to succeed John S. Reed as chairman, resigned unexpectedly yesterday, raising the possibility that he had been blamed for some of the bank's ills or had simply decided that he was not likely to move up to the chairmanship.
Bank officials said that Mr. Braddock's departure was a friendly one. "He is a very vigorous guy, and he is looked upon as having done a very good job here," said John M. Morris, a Citicorp spokesman. But if Citibank sought to put a friendly spin on the resignation, many others in the world of American banking said Mr. Braddock's departure came as a big surprise and even annoyed them. 
 "I am chagrined to see him him go," said J. Richard Frederick, a bank analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "He was a very good manager, and I think it is a loss to the company."
 
 
'Great Contribution'
 The bank's three-paragraph announcement, released in the late afternoon after the stock market closed, said Mr. Braddock's duties would be handled by Citicorp's senior management team. The announcement quoted Mr. Reed as saying: "Rick's great contribution was to the growth of our consumer business. He has been an important part of the senior team during this turnaround."
Citicorp also announced late yesterday that it would report third-quarter earnings in the range of $80 million to $100 million, or between 8 cents and 13 cents a share. That would be a big improvement over a loss of $885 million in last year's third quarter, but not as good a showing as this year's second quarter, which produced net income of $143 million.
The earnings estimate announcement suggested, among other things, that Citicorp's loan collection problems with Brazil and Mexico had eased in the third quarter. But it added that reserves were increased to protect against potential losses from defaulted consumer and commercial loans. The action was taken "in view of economic uncertainty and a patchy recovery in the United States and Europe," the bank said.
 
 
Senior Management Team
 Mr. Braddock, who is 50 years old, had been named president in January 1990, taking a job that had been vacant for six years, since shortly before Mr. Reed became chairman. Mr. Reed had chosen not to fill the position, preferring a less hierarchical management structure. Now, with Mr. Braddock gone, the presidency will remain vacant again, the bank said. A five-member senior management team will take over Mr. Braddock's duties.
Mr. Braddock, who had been at Citicorp for 19 years, brought to the bank a marketing background in consumer products. As president for the last two and a half years, he had concentrated mainly on cutting costs within the bank, which has shrunk its work force. Before becoming president, he had been a vice president in Citicorp's New York Banking Group, and then chief of the bank's credit card business and European consumer operations. From 1985 until he became president, he had been in charge of all individual banking activity, a major Citicorp division.
Although Wall Street bank analysts said Mr. Braddock's resignation had surprised them, there was some speculation that he might have left because he had concluded that his career had reached a dead end and he would not succeed Mr. Reed. With little experience in commercial lending, he was not viewed as bringing to management a strong background in solving Citicorp's loan problems.
"Rick's background has been on the consumer side, while some of Citicorp's announced problems have been in other areas of the bank," Mr. Frederick noted.
Mr. Reed is only two years older than Mr. Braddock, but with Citicorp in trouble over commercial real estate loans that have gone bad and, lately, a rising number of mortgage loans in default, Mr. Reed's own imminent departure from the bank has been widely rumored. Some analysts suggested, however, that Mr. Braddock's departure might ease the pressure on Mr. Reed.
Mr. Braddock's resignation was the second major one for Citicorp in recent months; the other was that of Michael A. Callen, a vice chairman.
The bank's brief announcement said that Mr. Braddock "chose to resign after concluding that his best contribution to the recovery of Citicorp's momentum has been realized and, accordingly, he wants to pursue new career opportunities."
Mr. Braddock could not be reached by telephone. Mr. Morris said that Mr. Braddock had submitted his resignation yesterday, effective immediately. Before the announcements, Citicorp's stock had closed down 25 cents, at $15.50 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
With Mr. Braddock gone, the bank's management team is now composed of Mr. Reed; Pei Wuan Chia, senior executive vice president in charge of consumer banking, and three vice chairmen: Paul Collins, William Rhodes and Onno Rudding.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
U.S.-Made Vehicle Sales Fell in Late September

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Sales of domestically produced vehicles dropped a scant seven-tenths of 1 percent in late September, but automotive demand on a seasonally adjusted basis seemed to perk up a bit after months of sluggishness.
Sales of domestically produced cars were off 1.2 percent, to 250,367, for the Sept. 21-30 period, while sales of light trucks rose one-tenth of 1 percent, to 169,307. However, the seasonally adjusted annual rate for car sales was 6.8 million, compared with 6.1 million for mid-September and 7.2 million in late September last year. 
 Over all, sales of cars and light trucks, which include mini-vans, sport-utility vehicles and pickups, totaled 419,674. The 10-day period marked the end of the industry's 1992 model year, "a difficult one for the entire automotive market," Robert L. Rewey, vice president of sales for the Ford Motor Company, said.
 
 
Reduced Production Schedules
 Because of generally sluggish sales, the Big Three have recently been paring car and light-truck production schedules for the fourth quarter, which will mean less factory output, more hours of layoffs and thinner corporate earnings.
Remarking on the uptick in late September sales, David Healy, automotive analyst for S. G. Warburg & Company in New York, said, "We'll just have to wait for a few more periods to see whether the increase in activity is a trend or not."
Retail automobile dealers continued to report spotty demand, marked by consumer uncertainty over economic conditions. "I don't think there's a real turnaround yet," said Tom Castriota, general manager of Castriota Chevrolet in Pittsburgh. "We don't have back-to-back 10-day periods that are strong."
Kenny Coiner, general manager of Bachman Chevrolet-Geo in Louisville, Ky., said, "It's harder than it was to convince people to buy because they are worried about their jobs."
For the month of September, sales of all vehicles, imported and domestic, reached 1,072,340, a drop of 1.2 percent from the month a year earlier. Car sales were off 3.6 percent, to 674,014, and light-truck sales rose 3.1 percent, to 398,326.
The General Motors Corporation sold 222,399 cars in September, down 8.3 percent from a year earlier; G.M. sold 135,619 light trucks, down four-tenths of 1 percent.
The Ford Motor Company sold 150,289 cars, up 7.8 percent, and 121,241 light trucks, down 7 percent.
 
 
Chrysler Sales
 The Chrysler Corporation sold 61,654 cars for the month, down 7.4 percent, and 83,692 light trucks, up 35 percent. Light-truck sales were influenced by big increases in the sale of mini-vans and Jeep sport-utility vehicles.
The Honda Motor Company posted a 5.9 percent decline in car sales to 68,347.
The Toyota Motor Corporation sold 60,568 cars, an increase of 8.2 percent, and 7,789 light trucks.
The Big Three continued a yearlong trend of gaining back market share at the expense of Japanese auto makers. The Big Three's sales constituted 70.5 percent of September's automotive market, up from 69.5 percent a year earlier. Sales of Japanese auto makers dropped to 24.8 percent of the market from 25 percent. Sales of European and South Korean imports dropped to 4.7 percent of the market from 5.5 percent.
