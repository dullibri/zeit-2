HEADLINE: What You Get for ... $3 Million

BYLINE: By MIKE POWELL

 BODY:
SARATOGA, CALIF.WHAT: A six-bedroom adobe with five and a half bathrooms
HOW MUCH: $2,950,000
SIZE: 7,532 square feet (total)
PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT: $391.66
SETTING: Like many people in California's Silicon Valley, Saratoga's residents tend to be high earners and well educated. Saratoga, however, has a more small-town feel than cities like San Jose and Palo Alto, which are closer to San Francisco Bay. Most of the lots surrounding this property are at least an acre, set along winding roads in a semirural part of town that was once farmland. Older houses have been torn down in recent years to make room for larger, newer ones. Saratoga and neighboring Los Gatos, both within a 10-minute drive, have plenty of places to shop and dine, including high-end boutiques and several Michelin-starred restaurants.
INSIDE: This sprawling single-level adobe was built in the early 1940s using mud bricks and around 17,000 ceramic tiles, many of them decorated. Its original owners, founders of a magazine called World Youth, built the house largely with their own hands, a process they documented in a book called ''How We Built an Adobe House for World Youth.'' 
By the early 1980s, the house had fallen into disrepair, but it was completely restored, and its kitchens and bathrooms were last updated in the late 1990s.
The house sits back from the road on a winding brick driveway, enclosed by an adobe wall and shrouded by lush gardens and trees. From above, its layout resembles a question mark: One section curls around a courtyard filled with plants and tiled benches; the other section forms a wing. The main entrance opens onto a spacious living-and-dining room with vaulted redwood-beam ceilings, skylights and large stretches of window, many made from car windshields. At one end of the room, there's a wood-burning stove; at the other is one of six working fireplaces. The floors throughout are tile, some glazed and some unglazed, some decorated, some unadorned. One step up are the kitchen and breakfast room, also with pitched ceilings, and a family room with a glazed tile fireplace.
The bedrooms are off a long, light-filled hallway. The master bedroom steps down into a library that has a fireplace with a tile chimney. Several of the other bedrooms also have fireplaces and vaulted wood-beamed ceilings.
OUTDOOR SPACE: There are 1.2 acres with gardens and unusual trees, including bitter orange, ginkgo and kiwi. The property also has a pool with a waterfall, a hot tub off the master suite and two fountains, one in the courtyard, the other on the front lawn.
TAXES: $36,875 (approximately)

BATON ROUGE, LA.
WHAT: A five-bedroom house with five and a half bathrooms
HOW MUCH: $2,995,000
SIZE: 5,919 square feet
PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT: $506
SETTING: This house is on a tree-shaded residential stretch of a road that runs through the southern side of Baton Rouge, ending near Louisiana State University, on the banks of the Mississippi. Most of its neighbors are on large lots and teardowns are common in the area. Still, there are several historic homes here and in neighboring University Acres, just up the road. Near L.S.U., less than two miles away, are shopping centers and restaurants; the central business district is about three miles away.
INSIDE: This two-story house was built in 1992 as one of the last projects of A. Hays Town, a Baton Rouge architect known for residential designs that blended modernist simplicity with elements of French, Spanish and American traditional styles, and made use of salvaged and recycled materials. For this house, heart pine floors and ceiling beams were taken from barns, houses and railroad yards, and some floors were made from reclaimed brick. The arched, glass-paneled front door opens to a foyer with a 22-foot ceiling and a cypress and pine staircase winding up to the second floor. Past the foyer is the living room, which has a fireplace. The living room gives way to a brick-floored sunroom with walls of windows on three sides.
Two of the five bedrooms, including the master bedroom, are downstairs. The master features a sitting area with walls of windows on three sides overlooking the pool and gardens. The house has a formal dining room, and the adjoining kitchen is outfitted with a granite island, a Sub-Zero fridge, a Gaggenau range and a butler's pantry. Upstairs, there are three bedrooms. There's also a room off the second-floor hallway that functions as a study.
OUTDOOR SPACE: The house sits on two acres with a pool, several landscaped gardens, a covered porch, an outdoor kitchen and dining area, and a large front yard. Shrubs, live oaks and flowering trees border the property.
TAXES: $15,000 (estimated)

SNOWMASS VILLAGE, COLO.
WHAT: A three-bedroom main house with two and a half bathrooms, and a guesthouse with one bedroom and one and a half baths
HOW MUCH: $2,995,000
SIZE: 4,800 square feet (total)
PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT: $623.96
SETTING: This house is set on a little more than two sloping acres between an equestrian facility and over 1,500 acres of parkland and trails in Snowmass Village, a small residential community outside Aspen. Most of the neighboring properties are also hilly two- and three-acre lots. Snowmass Village, which shares a name with the ski resort about five miles away, was developed as a resort town, characterized by its ski-in/ski-out houses, condominiums and hotels. The village's economy depends on Aspen, a famously expensive town whose downtown shopping area includes designer boutiques for Gucci, Fendi and Prada.
INSIDE: The two-story house, built in 1976 and remodeled in 2011, has a lodge-style interior characterized by exposed post-and-beam construction with stone accents. Its great room and master suite were placed upstairs to take advantage of views of the surrounding hillside and mountains. The great room features a 15-foot high pitched ceiling and a large stone fireplace. Sliding glass doors open to a deck. The owners, who run an interior design business, updated the kitchen with new appliances and marble counters, and remodeled the bathrooms in a combination of onyx, marble and limestone. In addition to a bedroom with a picture-window view of the mountains, the master suite has a walk-in closet and a bathroom with a steam shower. The two other bedrooms are on the entry level, along with a recreation room that has a stone fireplace.
In 2010, the owners built a two-story, 1,600-square-foot guesthouse on the property. It rents for around $2,200 a month.
There's also a one-room building with a wine cellar that is used as a studio.
OUTDOOR SPACE: The property has views of a creek, hills and mountains. There are landscaped gardens and an outdoor dining area with a fireplace.
TAXES: $7,486.64 plus quarterly subdivision dues of $280

HEADLINE: Signs of Revival, Slight but Sure, For Home Sales

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Analysts are hailing the beginnings of a recovery in the nation's housing market. But to beleaguered homeowners, it will not feel like much of one for many months to come.The number of existing homes sold rose 2.3 percent in July from the previous month, according to figures released Wednesday. Volume was up more than 10 percent from a year ago.
For several months, economic data and accounts from real estate agents across the country have calmed fears that the overall market could take another big step down, giving prospective home buyers some assurance that prices were stabilizing. 
Yet the nascent recovery is still a convalescent one, with the pace of activity uneven and far below the levels reached before the bubble burst. Home prices remain under pressure in many markets.
In fact, Wednesday's report from the National Association of Realtors showed that average sales prices actually dipped slightly from June to July. This seeming contradiction -- increasing demand but anemic growth in home values -- could represent a new normal in the housing market, experts said.
Real estate agents across the country cited the weak job market, stagnant wages and tight lending standards as continuing restraints on prices, despite pent-up demand and mortgage rates near record lows.
Even relatively optimistic observers like Michelle Meyer, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, foresaw only gradual improvements in home values. She expected home prices to rise 2 percent annually in 2012 and 2013, with momentum gradually increasing later in the decade. At that rate, the average home price would regain its 2006 peak in 2022.
''Inventory is lower and construction is incredibly depressed,'' she said. ''But it's bumpy. We could see prices weaken slightly in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013.''
Joe Abbruzzese, a retired farmer from upstate New York, was in southwest Florida this week bargain hunting for a second home. ''I wanted to get down here before the snowbirds arrive,'' he said. He was looking at five or six properties in the low- to mid-$100,000s before he left New York, but by the time he arrived in Florida only one was left.
Mr. Abbruzzese said that while prices had increased in recent months, he was betting that they would rise still more after the presidential election restored some certainty to the country's political course. ''I think people are really scared right now; they're not spending the money,'' he said.
While new buyers might take comfort in the fact that deep declines in home values seem to have passed, more than 11 million current homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. In July, home sales were running at an annual pace of 4.47 million, an improvement over a year ago, but well below the high of 7.25 million reached in September 2005.
New-home sales also were picking up, lifting share prices for many home builders. On Wednesday, Toll Brothers reported a sharp rebound in profits, lifting its stock 3.8 percent.
A number of factors have helped nudge prices higher, including shrinking inventory -- particularly on the more affordable end of the market. There is about a six-month supply of homes, according to the Realtors' group, down from more than nine months last summer.
In California, the supply of houses has become so slim that agents protested a bulk sale of 500 foreclosed houses by Fannie Mae, the mortgage giant, saying there was no need to sell the homes at a discount to investors when there were retail buyers willing to buy them. (Most of the properties would not have been sold individually because they were occupied by renters.)
Concerns that a flood of distressed properties will soon hit the market were also receding.
Banks have been taking more aggressive measures to avert foreclosures, which have been declining for almost two years, according to RealtyTrac. Short sales, the practice of allowing homeowners to sell their property for less than they owe before the home reaches the auction block, are on the rise. Some banks have recently introduced ''deed for lease'' initiatives to convert delinquent owners into renters instead of evicting them.
Sales of distressed properties, which act as a drag on prices, represented 24 percent of all activity, down from 29 percent a year ago.
''The broad opinion is that housing is definitely improving and on the upswing,'' said David Blitzer, the chairman of the index committee for S.& P.'s Dow Jones Indices, which produces the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. ''And that is a positive factor for the economy as well.''
In some areas, real estate brokers were skeptical that any improvement would be sustained.
Michael Parra, a real estate agent in Las Vegas, said investors who had been fueling the market with cash purchases were starting to get cold feet, fearing values would not appreciate further as long as incomes lag and jobs are scarce.
''You're going to have a catfish market,'' Mr. Parra said. ''You know, catfish stay on the bottom and they occasionally jump up to the surface.''
Economists like to caution that there is no such thing as a national real estate market. Results vary widely from place to place, and some of the biggest increases in prices have come in parts of the country hit the hardest when the housing boom turned to bust.
Home prices in Phoenix fell 55.9 percent from June 2006 through September 2011, when they bottomed, according to the Case-Shiller index. Since then, they have risen 8.8 percent. And in San Francisco, which had a 46.1 percent decline, prices have recovered 10.6 percent from the low in March 2009.
More typical is Chicago, which hit a low in March 2012. Prices there have risen 1.1 percent since then. Case-Shiller is still showing a slight decline nationally in average prices over the past year, but analysts will be closely watching data due out next week for signs of a turnaround.
Barbara Gargiulo, a real estate broker in northern New Jersey, said market conditions in her area varied widely. Montclair, she said, has only a two-month supply of houses on the market -- far less than some of its neighbors.
Still, she said, a house that sold last year for $620,000 sold again this year for $650,000, above its list price.
''I think we'll have some small little peaks, small little valleys, but in general we'll see an upward curve over the next few years,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A Mixed Day After Remarks From Fed

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed flat on Wednesday, erasing early losses after minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting indicated that the bank might be ready for another round of stimulus.Minutes from the Fed's July 31 and Aug. 1 meeting suggested that the agency was likely to deliver another round of monetary stimulus fairly soon unless the economy improved considerably. 
The only question for markets is whether the recent improvement in economic data, which came after that meeting, will convince the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that no action is necessary.
''He wants the economic data to translate into private-sector job creation,'' said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark. ''The initial reaction from the markets is that it is sooner rather than later that the Fed will come in.''
Stocks spent most of the day down after weak export data from Japan and caution over Greece's meetings this week with European Union officials gave investors reasons to pull back after the recent rally.
Among the most actively traded stocks was Dell, down 5.4 percent at $11.68 a day after it warned of a challenging second half and cut its full-year earnings outlook.
Hewlett-Packard closed at $19.20 and slipped as low as $18.30 in late trading after posting a quarterly loss.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.82 points, or 0.23 percent, to close at 13,172.76. The S.& P. 500 rose 0.32 point, or 0.02 percent, to 1,413.49. The Nasdaq composite index gained 6.41 points, or 0.21 percent, to 3,073.67.
Japan's exports slumped the most in six months in July as shipments to Europe and China tumbled, adding to concerns about global demand.
Uncertainty lingered over the effectiveness of attempts by the Prime Minister Antonis Samaras of Greece to persuade other European officials that his country should be given more time to meet targets for deficit cuts.
Toll Brothers, the luxury home builder, reported a higher quarterly profit and an increase in new orders and closed up 3.8 percent at $33.01. Continuing a string of bullish housing data, United States home resales rose in July.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 31/32, to 99 12/32, and the yield fell to 1.70 percent from 1.80 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Judge Overturns a State Tax Meant to Assist the M.T.A.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
A tariff meant to provide revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority by taxing businesses in the New York City region was struck down as unconstitutional on Wednesday by a State Supreme Court justice in Nassau County.The authority said that it would appeal the decision and that it was confident it would be overturned, citing the dismissal of four previous challenges to the law. 
The tariff, called the metropolitan commuter transportation mobility tax, was passed by the State Legislature in 2009. It required employers to set aside 34 cents for every $100 in payroll costs. The tax is projected to generate about $1.26 billion in revenue this year, said Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Government officials and business owners in the suburbs opposed the tax, arguing that they were being forced to bankroll an agency from which counties surrounding New York City received little benefit.
The governments of Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties, among others, filed the lawsuit that the justice ruled on, saying the tax was unconstitutional because it appropriated public funds for a local project. According to state law, they also argued, the agency should be self-sustaining.
The justice, R. Bruce Cozzens Jr., ruled that the tax did not ''serve a substantial state interest,'' and therefore violated the State Constitution.
Supporters of the tax, including public-transportation-advocacy groups, called on Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to cover any shortfall if the decision is not reversed, warning that the ruling could have far-reaching negative effects on the state economy.
''Public transportation is critical to the New York City metropolitan area -- an area which provides 45 percent of the state's tax revenue, paying for countless public services from Niagara Falls to Montauk,'' said Paul Steely White, the executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a mass-transit advocacy group.
Supporters also warned of possible service disruption and increased pricing if the ruling was left in place.
''If today's decision stands, Albany must take action,'' said Veronica Vanterpool, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. ''New revenues must be found, through congestion pricing, tolling or other means.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Oil and Mining Companies Must Disclose Payments to Foreign Governments

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Despite stiff industry lobbying against it, the Securities and Exchange Commission voted 2 to 1 on Wednesday to require American oil and mining companies to disclose taxes and other fees they pay to foreign governments. The disclosures are aimed at curbing corruption, which is common in some major oil-producing nations.Human rights and business transparency groups supported the rule, which fulfills a section of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. It will apply to about 1,100 companies and cover any payment they make that is over $100,000, including dividends and construction improvements, beginning in fiscal year 2014.
''Sunlight is the best disinfectant,'' said Luis A. Aguilar, a member of the commission, quoting the Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. 
Industry groups have complained that the rule would grant advantages to foreign companies that do not have to make such disclosures, and could potentially force American companies to curb operations in countries like China, Angola, Qatar and Cameroon that prohibit public disclosure of certain payments. The groups lobbied unsuccessfully for an exemption to the mandate in cases where foreign governments restricted disclosures.
In a separate 3-to-2 vote, the agency decided to require companies to disclose to shareholders and the agency when their manufactured goods contain minerals like tin, gold and tungsten mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Belligerent armies in that country have committed significant human rights violations and often finance themselves by selling ''conflict minerals,'' which frequently find their way into electronics parts and equipment.
Oil experts said it was difficult to know how onerous the payment disclosure rule would be since it was not yet known how the S.E.C. would define some of the requirements. Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners, said in a research note that the ruling could ''impose very real competitive challenges for U.S. companies,'' particularly if ''compliance leads to disclosure of previously secret terms of concessions, leases and production-sharing agreements.''
The energy rule comes at a time when American companies are looking to take advanced drilling technologies, initially used to develop domestic shale oil and gas fields, to untapped fields in places like China and Argentina. Business practices in those countries often diverge from those that are standard in the United States.
The American Petroleum Institute's chief economist, John Felmy, told reporters that the S.E.C. rule would force oil and gas companies to reveal secret, proprietary information about their expenditures and bidding strategies. ''With a few clicks of a mouse, state-owned foreign firms -- companies like China National Petroleum Company and Russia's Gazprom -- would plunder that information, which could help them determine their rivals' strategies and resource levels,'' he said.
The petroleum institute lobbied hard against the proposal, and has told the S.E.C. that it should conduct an economic analysis since American companies could potentially lose tens of billions of dollars of business. Oil company executives said they might consider a legal challenge after studying the final wording of the ruling.
In addition to Mr. Aguilar, Elisse B. Walter voted for the rule. Daniel M. Gallagher voted against it. The S.E.C. chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro, and Troy A. Paredes recused themselves to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
A research note by the Brookings Institution this week argued that increased transparency, accompanied by improved governance and accountability, could improve living standards in developing countries dependent on mineral extraction.
''There are two types of companies: those that focus on efficiency and innovation and can thrive in a competitive, level playing field, and those that derive gains from rent-seeking (and outright bribery), monopolistic behavior or tax avoidance,'' Brookings said.
It identified the Norwegian oil company Statoil and Newmont Mining as two companies that disclose payments voluntarily.
The rule on conflict minerals, which fulfills another section of the Dodd-Frank legislation, is aimed at cutting off funds for the brutal armies. In response to industry lobbying, the final version of the regulation adopted by the commission allows firms two to four years to establish the origins of minerals and also gives them more latitude for scrap or recycled minerals.
The agency also revised the original rule to exclude retailers from the disclosures for products they sell under their name but are manufactured by others.
Simon Taylor, director of Global Witness, a human rights group, said he was ''extremely disappointed'' with the rule revision because of the deferral of compliance. ''There is a humanitarian disaster going on right now,'' he said, ''and we see no purpose in further delay.''
Michael R. Littenberg, a securities lawyer who represents companies and industry groups that will be affected by the conflict minerals rule, said the final rule would still be onerous and affect thousands of electronics, automotive, aerospace, jewelry, lighting and industrial machinery companies. ''It will be expensive and time-consuming to comply with,'' he said.
The Dodd-Frank law set an April 2011 deadline for completion of the rules, but the S.E.C. has worked slowly. After proposing regulations in December 2010, the agency missed the deadline as commissioners met with companies, advocacy groups and institutional investors to sort out complexities.

HEADLINE: Budget Impasse Invites Recession Risk, Report Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday that the economic recovery would continue ''at a modest pace'' for the rest of the year, but that if Congress took no action to stave off tax increases and automatic budget cuts scheduled for Jan. 1, the economy could fall into a recession.The nonpartisan analysis predicted that, under current law, total economic output would shrink and the unemployment rate would rise to about 9 percent next year. That analysis echoes views expressed in other private and government forecasts.
In its semiannual report, the budget office said that the jobless rate would stay above 8 percent for the rest of this year and that the federal budget deficit would total $1.1 trillion in the current fiscal year. 
Budget and tax policy is one of the defining issues in the race for the White House. Profound disagreements between President Obama and Mitt Romney, the likely Republican presidential nominee, are mirrored in Congress. The election-year standoff has frustrated efforts to avert the combination of tax increases and spending cuts often described as a fiscal cliff.
Douglas W. Elmendorf, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the economy was somewhat weaker than his agency projected in January. Fears of tax increases and spending cuts -- what he referred to as the ''fiscal tightening'' -- and uncertainty about the future are depressing economic growth, he said.
In its report, the budget office sees the economy shrinking at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the first half of next year and then growing slowly, so that total output would decline by one-half of 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013.
Under ''an alternative fiscal scenario,'' which overrides many of the tax increases and spending cuts, ''there would be two million more jobs'' next year, Mr. Elmendorf said.
The budget office estimates that under current law federal spending will total $3.56 trillion in the current fiscal year, while the government will collect $2.44 trillion in revenue. The projected deficit is equivalent to 7.3 percent of the economy.
Pervasive effects of the recession and tax cuts can be seen in a remarkable statistic: total federal revenue will be lower this year than in 2007, when the government collected nearly $2.6 trillion. Federal revenue this year will be equivalent to 15.7 percent of the economy, down from 18.5 percent in 2007.
''We are a little surprised by how weak tax revenues are,'' Mr. Elmendorf said.
While revenue has declined, federal spending has surged, rising more than 30 percent since 2007, as more people have received help from the government. The budget office said that total federal spending would decline slightly this year, by $40 billion. In part, that reflects a reduction in spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, less spending on unemployment compensation and the winding down of programs to stimulate the economy.
''Defense outlays are expected to decrease by $30 billion (or 4 percent) in 2012, to $669 billion -- the first decline since 1998,'' the report said. ''In contrast, such outlays grew by 1.5 percent in 2011 and by an average of 9 percent annually from 2000 through 2010.''
The budget office said that 2012 would be ''the fourth year in a row with a deficit more than $1 trillion.''
''Federal debt held by the public will reach 73 percent of gross domestic product by the end of this fiscal year -- the highest level since 1950 and about twice the 36 percent of G.D.P. that it measured at the end of 2007,'' Mr. Elmendorf said.
The House speaker, John A. Boehner, said the report showed an urgent need for legislation to stop the impending tax increases and the looming cuts in military spending.
''Instead of threatening to drive us off the fiscal cliff and tank our economy in their quest for higher taxes, I would urge President Obama and Congressional Democrats to work with us,'' said Mr. Boehner, an Ohio Republican.
The White House said Republicans were blocking a solution.
''They're willing to hold the middle class hostage unless we also give massive new tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires,'' said Jay Carney, the president's press secretary.
If Congress cannot break the impasse on tax and fiscal policy and if current law remains in place, the budget office said, the federal deficit will plunge, to $641 billion in the fiscal year 2013 and to $387 billion in 2014. Revenues would shoot up 20 percent next year, to a total of $2.9 trillion, and then rise a further 10 percent, to $3.2 trillion in 2014, it said.
From the report, it is possible to compare the cost of tax policies favored by Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans.
Most Republican lawmakers want to extend tax cuts adopted in 2001 and 2003 for all taxpayers, while Mr. Obama would allow the tax cuts to expire for the portion of adjusted gross income exceeding $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples.
The budget office and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that, under the Republican policies, government tax collections would decline by $247 billion next year and a total of $4.5 trillion from 2013 to 2022.
By contrast, the analysts said, under the tax policies proposed by Mr. Obama, government tax collections would decline by $205 billion next year and a total of $3.7 trillion over 10 years.

HEADLINE: Romney Energy Plan Would Expand Oil Drilling on U.S. Land and Offshore

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and ASHLEY PARKER; Clifford Krauss reported from Houston, and Ashley Parker from Bettendorf, Iowa.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Mitt Romney plans to unveil an energy plan Thursday morning in Hobbs, N.M., that would allow states more control over the development of energy resources on federal lands within their borders, as well as aggressively expand offshore oil and gas drilling -- including along the coasts of Virginia and the Carolinas -- as part of a broader effort to reach energy independence.The plan is bound to be contentious after the disastrous BP well blowout in 2010, which leaked millions of barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico and left 11 workers dead. The proposal may win votes in Virginia, where drilling would bring jobs and state revenues, but would be controversial in Florida, where offshore drilling has long been viewed as a threat to tourism.
The Romney campaign released the proposal, complete with a 21-page white paper, Wednesday evening as part of an overall energy plan that includes granting states more regulatory power over drilling on federal lands, revitalizing the nuclear power industry, and approving the Keystone XL pipeline to carry more Canadian oil to refineries in the United States. 
Romney campaign officials emphasized the importance of opening more oil and gas drilling on federal lands, a theme that Mr. Romney is likely to trumpet Thursday on his visit to New Mexico, where the oil industry hopes to open more federal areas for exploration and production.
''What Governor Romney is proposing is that state governments, which already control the development of energy resources on their own and private lands within their borders, would also control the development of energy resources on federal lands within their borders,'' said Oren Cass, the campaign's domestic policy director, in a conference call with reporters Wednesday.
The proposal will surely be controversial among environmentalists hoping to preserve lands like desert stretches of New Mexico where threatened species roam. A campaign document, however, said the proposal would exclude ''lands specially designated off-limits,'' which presumably means national parks.
The Obama campaign released a statement from Federico Peña, a secretary of energy in the Clinton administration, criticizing Mr. Romney's emphasis on drilling: ''We will never reach energy independence by turning our backs on homegrown renewable energy and better auto mileage.''
Mr. Romney has raised considerable money from donors with ties to the oil industry. Over the past two days, he pulled in nearly $10 million in oil money: $6 million to $7 million Tuesday from two fund-raisers in Texas (in Houston and Midland), and $2 million at a fund-raiser Wednesday in Little Rock, Ark. Claiborne P. Deming, who introduced Mr. Romney at the Arkansas event and is a finance co-chairman in the state, is chairman of Murphy Oil, a global gas and oil company.
Nearly two-thirds of federal lands are currently off-limits to drilling and mining, and leasing has slowed in recent years. Oil production has been declining on federal lands, while booming on private lands as well as offshore.
The Obama administration has expanded offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska but barred development along the east and west coasts. The administration appears to be on the verge of giving final approval to Shell Oil to drill in the Alaskan Arctic for the first time in two decades, but its decision to enact a one-year moratorium on gulf drilling following the BP spill angered the oil industry.
Before the BP disaster, oil production in the gulf was 1.75 million barrels a day, and it is now down to roughly 1.5 million barrels a day, 700,000 barrels below what had been projected for 2012. Still, gulf production is rapidly ramping up again, and overall domestic oil production is up 10 percent this year in a continuation of a three-year trend.
Romney aides say the country could be doing much better.
''As a result of the president's policies, energy prices are higher, there are fewer jobs, our industries are less competitive, and family budgets are further strained,'' said Ed Gillespie, a campaign senior adviser, on the conference call. ''People who are living paycheck to paycheck are struggling as a result of this anti-energy policy, paying more for heating their homes and turning on their electricity, and turning on the lights, as well as gas prices being up.''
Mr. Romney has said his policies would lead to independence from oil imports from outside North America by 2021 Many energy experts say expanded offshore drilling could be an important step in that direction, but experts debate how much oil there is along the coasts.
Virginia politicians of both parties have strongly supported drilling off the coast of a state that is pivotal to the election. But in Florida, another swing state, politicians have generally opposed drilling to protect the state's beaches.

HEADLINE: In Defense of Big Banks

BYLINE: By WILLIAM B. HARRISON Jr.. 
William B. Harrison Jr. was an architect of the 2000 merger that created JPMorgan Chase and was the bank's chairman and chief executive. He retired in 2006.

 BODY:
BANKS aren't always popular even in the best of times, but the anger of recent years is unprecedented. The anger, while understandable, has fueled the misguided idea that we should break up the nation's largest banks.The argument is simple and sound-bite ready: In the years before the crisis, greedy bankers used their political muscle to grow from small, specialized banks into giant, all-purpose financial institutions. This transformation led to the financial crisis because banks became too big to manage and too big to fail. If we break them back up, we will eliminate the risk of future crises.
The problem is that every part of this argument is based on a fallacy. 
The first fallacy is that the emergence of large, universal banks -- combining commercial banking with investment banking -- was an artificial or unnatural development. In 1990, there were 15,000 banks in the United States; this fragmented market meant that banks could not achieve economies of scale or easily serve clients on a national or global level.
The consolidation that took place was driven by the market's needs and represented an evolution toward greater efficiency in banking, just as companies like Amazon, Starbucks and Home Depot brought efficiency to retail. Even now, the American financial services industry is far less consolidated than its peers across most of the developed world.
A second fallacy is that these large, universal institutions were primarily to blame for the financial crisis. As most serious observers acknowledge, a combination of bad lending and risk management by banks, poor regulation and ill-advised consumer behavior all played a role. None of the first institutions to fail during the crisis -- Countrywide, Bear Stearns, IndyMac, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, the American International Group -- were universal banks.
A third fallacy is that large financial institutions have become too complex to manage. A company of any size needs robust management and controls to manage complexity. Remember that smaller financial institutions -- look at MF Global, Bear Stearns, Knight Capital -- have had their share of risk-management failures too.
In fact, large global institutions have often proved more resilient than others because their diversified business model ensures that losses in one part of the enterprise can be cushioned by revenues in other parts. In some cases, complexity can be an antidote to risk, rather than a cause of it.
Other criticisms of big banks that are often aired similarly don't stand up to scrutiny. Commentators point to the inordinate influence large banks have on the political process. They fear that regulators are cowed by a large bank's position and power. These critics seem to believe that regulators are incapable of making independent judgments. In the real world, this is just false. That said, it is perfectly appropriate and indeed necessary for regulators and politicians to engage with experts and industry practitioners to learn more about the issues. Regulators are not cowed, but they generally do need more expertise and better collaboration with one another to carry out their responsibilities successfully.
Another criticism I often hear is that large banks receive huge, implicit subsidies from the government and can borrow more cheaply because they are seen as ''too big to fail.'' But the facts don't bear this out. An AA-rated bank deemed too big to fail by pundits cannot borrow any more cheaply than an AA-rated industrial company. One can see it every day in their bond spreads.
Finally, some critics have called for a revival of the Glass-Steagall Act (which separated commercial and investment banking) and a tougher version of the Volcker Rule (which would bar banks from using their money to make bets in their own trading account), without, it seems, having read either. The Glass-Steagall Act (repealed in 1999) prohibited commercial banks from underwriting debt and equity issues, a very safe activity; it did not prohibit banks from trading, engaging in derivatives, leveraging themselves or making bad loans. And while I agree with the spirit of the Volcker Rule, banks need to make markets for their customers and should be allowed to hedge their risks, as long as the hedging activity is specific to those risks.
Large banks invest billions of dollars to deliver the products and services consumers want -- investments that only a company that has achieved scale can make. Scale allows them to deliver, like big-box stores, more innovation, greater convenience and consistent, reliable service.
Breaking up some big banks would hurt their customers, clients and the broader economy. It would actually inject new risks into the financial system. If today's universal, multifunctional banks are forced back into being specialized lending institutions, they will need to find new ways to deliver returns to shareholders. That could easily lead to an increase in risky lending.
America's largest businesses operate around the world and simply have to work with international banks. If they can't work with a global bank based in America, then they will work with one based overseas. Losing that business to other countries would damage our national competitiveness, economic vitality, job creation and clients who want a choice of financial services. One of America's great strengths is that we are home to the broadest, deepest and most efficient capital markets in the world. It's a competitive advantage that we can't afford to lose.

HEADLINE: U.N. Visit Will Set Back a Push to Isolate Iran

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Jodi Rudoren contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and David E. Sanger from Washington.

 BODY:
Efforts led by the United States and Israel to isolate Iran suffered a setback on Wednesday when the United Nations announced that Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general, would join officials from 120 countries in Tehran next week for a summit meeting that Iran has trumpeted as a vindication of its defiance and enduring importance in world affairs.Mr. Ban's decision to attend the meeting of the Nonaligned Movement, announced by his spokesman, Martin Nesirky, came despite objections from both the Americans and Israelis, including a phone call from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. It was announced a few days after the new president of Egypt, a country that has long been estranged from Iran, said he would attend the summit meeting as well, a decision that had already unsettled the Israelis.
Taken together, the moves reinforced Iran's contention that a reordering of powers is under way in the Middle East, where Western influence is waning, and that the American-Israeli campaign to vilify Iran as a rogue state that exports terrorism and secretly covets nuclear weapons is not resonating in much of the world. 
The meeting of the Nonaligned Movement, a group formed during the cold war, includes a number of other countries that the United States has sought to marginalize, among them North Korea and Sudan, whose president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, is wanted under a war crimes indictment by the International Criminal Court. Although Iran's hosting of the meeting is strictly a coincidence of history -- under a rotating system, Iran presides over the group through 2014 -- Iranian leaders have portrayed it as a privilege that repudiates the American narrative.
''The extraordinary effort that the Iranian leaders have put into the summit is intended to showcase Iran's global role and offer concrete evidence that the U.S. policy of isolating Iran has failed,'' said Farideh Farhi, an independent Iranian scholar at the University of Hawaii.
''A case is being made that it is not the 'global community' that has problems with the Islamic republic, as repeatedly asserted by U.S. officials, but merely a U.S.-led-and-pressured coalition of countries,'' she said. ''And ironically the Obama administration is conceding the point by trying to pressure various leaders from attending the meeting.''
Mr. Ban's decision to participate, which might have gone nearly unnoticed in other years, was particularly fraught now because of the tensions surrounding the host country. Iran has defied United Nations Security Council resolutions to halt its uranium enrichment and has strongly supported the Syrian government's sharp repression of an armed uprising, a crackdown that Mr. Ban has repeatedly condemned.
Mr. Ban has also castigated the anti-Semitic statements and calls for Israel's destruction made recently by Iranian leaders, reminding them that the United Nations Charter prohibits one member from threatening the existence of another.
But many diplomats and others said it would have been extraordinarily difficult for Mr. Ban not to go. The 120 countries that are in the Nonaligned Movement represent the biggest single voting bloc in the 193-member General Assembly at the United Nations. It is customary for the secretary general to attend the movement's annual meetings regardless of political delicacies surrounding the host country.
''A sizable chunk if not a majority of the world's population are citizens of nonaligned nations,'' said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ''It's not something the United Nations secretary general can easily dismiss.''
Acknowledging that Mr. Ban has been under pressure not to attend, Mr. Nesirky, his spokesman, said Mr. Ban viewed the visit as a chance to raise the issues of Iran's nuclear program, its support for Syria and its campaign against Israel directly with his hosts.
''The secretary general is fully aware of the sensitivities of this visit,'' Mr. Nesirky told reporters at the United Nations. ''He's heard the views of some of those who said he should not go. At the same time, the secretary general has responsibilities that he is determined to carry out.''
Mr. Nesirky also said Mr. Ban expected to meet with senior Iranian leaders, including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. ''It is certainly the secretary general's expectation that he will have meaningful and fruitful discussions with the supreme leader,'' Mr. Nesirky said. To boycott the invitation from Iran, Mr. Nesirky said, ''would be a missed opportunity.''
There was no immediate reaction to Mr. Ban's decision from Israel. But according to Mr. Netanyahu's office, he had telephoned Mr. Ban on Aug. 10 and told him that such a trip, even if well intentioned, would be a mistake. ''Your visit will grant legitimacy to a regime that is the greatest threat to world peace and security,'' Mr. Netanyahu was quoted as saying.
Even before Mr. Ban made his decision known, the Israeli government was asserting that the sanctions effort against Iran was not working, a conclusion that was reinforced for the Israelis because of the decision to attend the summit meeting in Iran by President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt.
''If you're going there, if you're paying homage to the leaders of Iran, what kind of diplomatic isolation is that?'' Mark Regev, Mr. Netanyahu's spokesman, said of Mr. Morsi's decision.
The reaction to Mr. Ban's announcement was more muted from the Obama administration, which had engaged in a less public effort to dissuade him.
Some administration officials sought to put the best face on the situation, urging Mr. Ban to exploit the moment to convey his unhappiness with Iran's behavior.
''We think that Iran is going to try to use the event for propaganda purposes and to try to cover up the extreme isolation Iran is feeling politically and economically,'' said Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council. ''That said, if people choose to participate, we believe they should take the opportunity of any meetings that they have with Iran's leaders to press them to comply with their international obligations without further delay.''
The American Jewish Committee, among a number of pro-Israel voices in the United States that had exhorted Mr. Ban not to visit Iran, called the decision ''a grave mistake'' in a statement posted on its Web site.
''Tehran is not the place for the U.N. secretary general to visit, not at this time, not to meet with this Iranian regime,'' David Harris, the group's executive director, said in the statement. ''We are stunned that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon would honor a regime that consistently ignores both him and the world body he heads in ways that threaten regional and global security.''
Some said that Mr. Ban's three-day visit, which begins next Wednesday, could also turn out badly for Iranian leaders, particularly if he raises issues in an unfiltered way to the Iranian public about the government's human rights record.
Others said that Mr. Ban could surprise critics by confronting or embarrassing Ayatollah Khamenei and his subordinates over their anti-Semitic statements.
''The fact that he's going is going to be viewed as a victory for Iran,'' said Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group of Americans of Iranian descent. ''But if pressure leads Ban Ki-moon to express harsh criticism of their statements on Israel, then it could be viewed as a victory for those who had not wanted him to go.''

HEADLINE: Victory for Akin Seen as Difficult, But Still Possible

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON and MONICA DAVEY; Steven Yaccino contributed reporting from Chicago, Erik Eckholm from New York, and Rebecca Berg from Washington.

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- In the end, Representative Todd Akin's fate will depend not on what happens in Washington or Tampa, Fla., or on a talk radio show, but on the voters of Missouri.A number of voters and strategists here believe it is not a foregone conclusion that Mr. Akin faces the certain defeat predicted by establishment Republican leaders calling on him to abandon his Senate bid after he made controversial comments about rape and abortion.
A pile of factors, they say, could make the situation survivable: local backlash against all the national party meddling, an intensely grass-roots fund-raising effort (Mr. Akin, a six-term congressman, has sent e-mails seeking $3 contributions from supporters in recent days), an influx of aid from some Christian groups, and a state that has in recent years grown more conservative than the national bellwether it was once seen as.
Still, Mr. Akin, a conservative who had already shocked many establishment Republicans in Missouri this month by winning a primary against two other well-known candidates for a Senate seat that Republicans have seen as a prime pickup from the Democrats, faces far stiffer odds than he did even a few days ago. 
His campaign, which had raised $2.2 million as of late July, faces a serious financial crisis as promises from large donors of millions of dollars for a general election fight against Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent, have been withdrawn. His status has grown ever more precarious with moderate and independent voters who may be the keys to November. And some voters and political experts, as well as longtime Republican leaders like former Senator John C. Danforth, say Mr. Akin's political chances are fast vanishing, whether he grasps it yet or not.
''The damage is irreparable,'' said Dwight Vermette, a member of the state Republican committee. Already Mr. Akin's campaign apparatus is something of a homemade operation compared with Senator McCaskill's: Republicans said he had worked largely with a campaign team made up of his wife and a son, in addition to an outside consultant from Ohio who has put together his advertising. (Mr. Akin's campaign aides declined to respond to repeated requests for comment.)
Leaders of several conservative Christian and social-issues groups said they would step in with organizational, financial and news-media help. The Family Research Council said it now hoped to sponsor independent advertising and phone banks and solicit donations for Mr. Akin. And by Wednesday evening, those tiny donations requested by Mr. Akin's campaign several times this week were starting to add up. Mr. Akin's Twitter account reported that he had set a goal to raise $100,000 by midnight and had raised $88,000.
Carol Wessel Boyer, a member of the state Republican committee, said she was among those who had sent a contribution -- and that she intended to send more before the day was out.
''I'm very disappointed in the rest of the country,'' she said. ''They don't live here, and they don't really know the politics of the state of Missouri.''
For Democrats, Mr. Akin's troubles have come as a remarkable gift. On Wednesday afternoon, Ms. McCaskill, whose campaign has reported an influx of donations in the past few days (though it would not give numbers), carried on campaign events before audiences of veterans in the St. Louis area but largely steered clear of the controversy. The situation seemed certain to draw more financial help to Ms. McCaskill's cause, and some Democrats said they could only hope that Mr. Akin continued to ignore calls for him to quit the race.
That Mr. Akin even became the Republican nominee for one of the most coveted seats in the Senate that could decide the balance of power is surprising to some. Yet, his ascent -- and his prospects for survival -- is a reflection of the state's political shift to the right in recent years. Missouri, with its mix of rural and urban, Southern and Northern flavor, had over more than a century picked all but two of the nation's presidential winners.
In recent years, however, the state has had population growth in some of its more rural pockets in the southwest and in St. Charles County to the east, which Mr. Akin represents -- areas made up of people who tend to be more conservative and Christian. Most recently, the sluggish economy, slow job growth and teetering home values have led to the current climate, in which Mr. Romney holds deep advantages. Missouri is a state that President Obama lost by fewer than 4,000 votes in the last election but that has slipped away from the campaign's top targets.
Missourians still view Ms. McCaskill as closely aligned with President Obama, who has lost popularity in the state. She was one of Mr. Obama's early supporters in the last election, and she has supported some of his signature policies, including the national health care law and the economic stimulus package.
Still, political strategists say the state is far from becoming a right-wing bastion like some of its neighbors, in part because it has two industrialized, urban centers that tend to be liberal. The state, which naturally sits to the right of center politically, maintains strong Democratic influence -- the governor, for one, and Ms. McCaskill.
This, some analysts see, is at the heart of Mr. Akin's challenge.
''He is very, very right wing on everything from fiscal policy to social policy,'' said Kenneth F. Warren, a political science professor at St. Louis University, ''and I don't think Missourians are that conservative.''
Much of Mr. Akin's political strength throughout his career was drawn from his ability to connect with the rural, Christian voters who make up much of his district and who share his values. Missouri Republicans have long raised concern that he would have a more difficult time speaking to a broader audience across the state, especially the independent voters who could decide the election.
''It does hurt him with key voting blocs like single women, young people and suburban moderates,'' said Dave Robertson, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ''To get to 50 percent he's going to need, not only his base, but a good percentage of those people. He has made it much more difficult to put that coalition together on Election Day.''
Around the state by Wednesday, Mr. Akin's circumstances seemed to be generating dueling sentiments -- those who thought it was time to forgive and those who wished Mr. Akin would go away already.
Donna Oakley, the Republican chairwoman for Putnam County and president of a local chapter of the National Republican Women's Group, said she would go right on supporting Mr. Akin, as would lots of others. Ms. McCaskill, she said, had irked many more people than Mr. Akin had. ''The media is going to run us into the ground about this,'' she said of Mr. Akin's situation.
In Butler County, though, Republicans were asking Mr. Akin not to appear at a Reagan Days event set for Sept. 8 in Poplar Bluff.
''He should step aside,'' Eddy Justice, the chairman of that county's Republican committee, said, ''because the cause that we are championing is bigger than one person.''
Whatever happens, ''his presence on the ballot assures this major diversion for the next two and a half months,'' said former Senator Danforth, who said that the entire conversation had been turned away from what Missouri residents are most worried about, the debt and the economy.
''This is very toxic,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Luxury Home Builder Reports a Revenue Gain of 41%

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Toll Brothers, the largest luxury home builder in the United States, reported its highest revenue since the recession of 2008, underlining the recovery in the housing market and sending its shares to a five-year high.The company, which focuses on affluent customers who typically make at least $100,000 a year and have spotless credit records, reported an increase in orders and forecast higher revenue for the full year. 
''We are enjoying the most sustained demand we have experienced in over five years,'' Toll's chief executive, Douglas C. Yearley Jr., said in a statement. ''The housing recovery is being driven by pent-up demand, very low interest rates and attractively priced homes.''
The housing market, which fell into a deep rut six years ago prompting a recession, has been recovering this year. Home sales have risen, helped by higher rental rates and low inventory.
Home resales rose in July as low interest rates and a modest improvement in the labor market helped home buying conditions, the National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday.
Other home builders, such as D.R. Horton and the PulteGroup have reported strong results.
''Housing is on the mend,'' Toll's executive chairman, Robert I. Toll, said.
The company said it was gaining market share as small and midsize private builders, its primary rivals, are strained for capital.
Toll is the only publicly traded luxury home builder.
''The pace of our contract growth has far exceeded the national housing data as we are gaining market share,'' Mr. Yearley said.
Toll's net signed contracts rose 57 percent to 1,119 units during May-July. Backlog jumped 59 percent to $1.62 billion.
Mr. Yearley said Toll's nonbinding reservation deposits, an indication of future contracts, increased 59 percent in the first three weeks of the fourth quarter.
The company forecast home-sale revenue of $1.71 billion to $1.84 billion for 2012. It raised the lower end of its full-year home delivery outlook range by 300 units to 3,000. It expects to deliver up to 3,200 units.
Toll's profit rose to $61.6 million, or 36 cents a share, from $42.1 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue in the period, which ended July 31 and was the third quarter of Toll Brothers' fiscal year, increased 41 percent, to $554.3 million from $394.3 million.
Stock in Toll, which is based in Horsham, Pa., rose $1.20, or 3.8 percent, to $33.01 a share.

HEADLINE: Baker Who Rebuffed Biden Gives Ryan Warm Welcome

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
ROANOKE, Va. - Joe the Plumber, meet Chris the Baker.The Republican ticket has embraced a new small-business hero. On Wednesday, the owner of a bakery who last week turned away Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. introduced Representative Paul D. Ryan at a rally in this city where President Obama uttered his "You didn't build that" remark. 
Chris McMurray, the owner of Crumb and Get It Cookie Company with his wife, told a crowd at another small business, a hardware store, "We are gathered here today to send a message to the Obama-Biden team that we did build it.''
Mr. McMurray said the Biden campaign approached him to ask if the vice president could drop by his cookie shop while campaigning, and he replied, "Nothing personal, but I just happened to disagree with the president and the vice president on a few things."
The story vaulted from local news to the Drudge Report and conservative blogs, and voilà, Mr. McMurray became the latest small-business owner spotlighted by the Romney-Ryan campaign in a monthlong hammering of Mr. Obama for supposed anti-business attitudes and policies.
Fact-checkers and the Obama campaign complain that Republicans are willfully twisting the president's remark - he was referring to government investment in infrastructure, not denying entrepreneurs credit for their companies - but the line become just one of many yanked from context in an intensely heated political season.
Mr. Ryan's account of Mr. Obama's remarks continued the misrepresentation of what the president said on July 13 in front of a Roanoke firehouse. "He did say if you have a small business, you did not build that, someone else did," Mr. Ryan said, after thanking Mr. McMurray for his spirited introduction, which had the crowd chanting "We built it! We built it!"
"He just gave my speech,'' Mr. Ryan said. "I'm voting for that guy, for Chris.''
It's clear that Mr. Obama's literal meaning is no longer the issue; the line has grown long political legs because for the Romney-Ryan team it is emblematic of the broad choice in November: between Mr. Romney's business success and Mr. Obama's desire to raise taxes on the highest earners, which Republicans say will hamper "job creators.''
"The president makes these comments that kind of reveals his mindset, his philosophy of government,'' Mr. Ryan said. "It tells us that he believes in a government-centered society with a government-driven economy. That doesn't work. It never has worked. That's what Europe has, and look at what it's doing to Europe.''
It was Mr. Ryan's fourth day of campaigning in Virginia, a state Mr. Obama won in 2008, since Mitt Romney announced his selection as his running mate.
"You deliver Virginia, you save the American idea,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Romney Strategists Say They'll Stay the Course Amid Focus on Abortion

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney's campaign advisers have concluded that they do not need any major adjustments in strategy to respond to the new focus on abortion and reproductive rights caused by Representative Todd Akin, betting that their candidate's economic message will still resonate with female voters after the controversy over Mr. Akin's remarks about ''legitimate rape'' subsides.
The advisers conceded that Mr. Akin's comments last weekend had wreaked havoc on the campaign's message heading into the convention in Tampa next week, and that the situation was made worse by the Republican Party's decision this week to endorse an anti-abortion plank at its convention -- without an exception for rape or incest.
But they expressed confidence that Mr. Romney and Republican Congressional candidates would weather the week of bad press, in part because the quick and thunderous denunciation of Mr. Akin by the party's leadership has minimized the potential impact of being tied to his comments. 
''Every moment between now and November should be spent talking about the No. 1 issue for women and men, and that's the economy,'' said Kerry Healey, who was Mr. Romney's lieutenant governor in Massachusetts and advises the presidential campaign. ''Anything that distracts from that is not what we should be talking about.''
The outcome of the campaign's bet could be decisive for Mr. Romney, whose Democratic rivals are eagerly seizing on Mr. Akin's comments as evidence of a cultural disconnect between Republicans and women who find Mr. Akin's remarks repugnant. But the advisers expressed confidence Wednesday that the media focus would not divert them from the campaign's central theme.
''Having a discussion like the one surrounding Akin is not helpful; that goes without saying,'' said one Republican strategist with close ties to Mr. Romney's campaign who spoke anonymously about the campaign's plans. ''But the campaign's not going to change our macro strategy because of Todd Akin.''
Another senior adviser, who also spoke on background to discuss strategy, said the focus on abortion this week was ''eating up a couple of days,'' adding, ''It is a couple of days where we are not talking about Medicare or jobs or welfare.''
But the adviser said women in most of the country were not focused on the headlines about Mr. Akin. Women ''are paying attention to how the hell they pay for gas in the tank, school clothes for the kids,'' the adviser said. ''We can't get sidetracked by this.''
Democrats have seized on the remarks by Mr. Akin, a Senate candidate in Missouri, in much the way they did when the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh called Sandra Fluke, a Congressional witness, ''a slut.'' Democrats announced on Wednesday that Ms. Fluke would speak at the Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C., next month.
President Obama, speaking at a fund-raiser in New York Wednesday, said: ''The interesting thing here is that this, this is an individual who sits on the House Committee on Science and Technology but somehow missed science class. And it's representative of the desire to go backwards instead of forwards and fight fights that we thought were settled 20 or 30 years ago.''
Emily's List, a campaign group that promotes Democratic women, sought to link a host of House Republicans to Mr. Akin's views. The group singled out 13 House Republicans -- including one freshman woman, Vicky Hartzler of Missouri -- who are all being challenged by a Democratic woman who favors abortion rights.
In the past, similar efforts by Democrats to drive a wedge between women and Republican candidates have gone on for days, forcing Republicans to play catch-up. This time, they jumped quickly. Senator Scott P. Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, called for Mr. Akin to leave the race within hours after his comments on ''legitimate rape'' became public. Similar calls came from Mr. Romney and other Republican leaders.
''Please show me the candidate in this country who says he agrees with Todd Akin,'' said Paul Lindsay, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.
In fact, there have been a few off-message House Republicans. Representative Joe Walsh, a Tea Party-backed freshman from Illinois, appeared to back up Mr. Akin Wednesday when he dismissed the Missouri lawmaker's comments as ''idiotic'' but questioned the media campaign against him.
''I am bothered by this rush and silence from members in our own party to stand up for him,'' Mr. Walsh said.
Tom Davis, a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that the Akin controversy might have knocked Republicans off their economic message, but that it also temporarily diverted Democrats from the issue he believes is most important to their chances in November, Medicare.
''By moving to abortion, Democrats lost the opportunity to define Paul Ryan before he gives his speech next week'' at the convention, Mr. Davis said, referring to Mr. Romney's vice-presidential running mate.
Mr. Ryan, who co-sponsored a bill with Mr. Akin that aimed to restrict the definition of rape, was pressed in a television interview Wednesday morning about Mr. Akin's comments. Mr. Ryan said that ''rape is rape, and there's no splitting hairs over rape.'' He defended his record on abortion, but said Mr. Romney would set policy as president.
The issue of how to narrow the persistent gender gap between Republicans and Democrats was always going to be difficult for Mr. Romney, who passed up an opportunity to put a woman on his ticket by picking Mr. Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, as his running mate. In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday, President Obama leads Mr. Romney among women by 10 percentage points, 51 percent to 41 percent.
Republican convention planners are hoping to present a series of leading women as speakers when the convention starts in Tampa, Fla., on Monday. Chief among them is Ann Romney, whose popularity easily exceeds her husband's.
Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and the party's 2008 vice-presidential nominee, will not speak. But in an indication of how little support Mr. Akin has, even among conservatives, on Tuesday Ms. Palin called on him to step aside.
Still, Mr. Romney's choice of Mr. Ryan has also complicated his campaign's outreach to women by adding Mr. Ryan's record in Congress to the list of positions that Mr. Romney must explain and defend.
In addition to the bill he co-sponsored with Mr. Akin on the definition of rape, Mr. Ryan also voted for dozens of bills that sought to oppose or restrict abortion rights.
CHARTS: Abortion Votes in the House: Notable votes since 2011 in the House of Representatives on legislation seeking to restrict the availability of abortion. Representative Paul D. Ryan voted in favor of all the legislation, and Representative Todd Akin voted in favor in all but the most recent vote, when he was not present. (Source: House of Representatives)

HEADLINE: Who Counts as Middle Class?

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Whether Americans call themselves middle class doesn't necessarily have a lot to do with whether they earn close to the median income, a survey finds. 

 BODY:
As I've writtenbefore, Americans don't have a great sense of where they fall in the income distribution, or even what the income distribution actually looks like. Now, in a new report, the Pew Research Center has given us an update on the types of Americans most likely to call themselves middle class, and the answer doesn't necessarily have a lot to do whether respondents earn close to the median income.
As you can see, about half of adults surveyed said they were middle class. That includes almost half of respondents who had family incomes above $100,000, which is technically at about the 82nd percentile in the income distribution.
There were other signs of cognitive dissonance about this topic.
Survey respondents who called themselves middle class were asked how much they believed a family of four needed to earn to maintain a "middle-class lifestyle." The median response they named was $70,000, though the response varied based on how much money the respondent himself or herself made.
Self-proclaimed members of the middle class who had family incomes below $30,000, for example, said that a family needed to earn at least $40,000 to lead a middle-class lifestyle -- even though that would disqualify themselves. Likewise, "middle-class" respondents who earned from $30,000 to $49,999 said the lifestyle required an annual income of at least $60,000.
People with family incomes of $50,000 to $99,999 gave a median response of $75,000 -- so, pretty close to what they currently make.
The richest people to call themselves middle class, those earning at least $100,000, dictated that a middle-class lifestyle requires bringing in at least $100,000 a year.
At least they're consistent about what they define as middle class, even if the threshold they name is actually much higher in the income distribution than the word "middle" would imply.
People with more education also had higher expectations of how much money a family would need to maintain a middle-class lifestyle, probably reflecting the fact that college graduates generally earn more money than their counterparts without degrees.
As you can see in the table to the right, responses to this question varied by location as well.
Respondents in the East said that a family would need $85,000 to maintain a middle-class lifestyle, for example, perhaps reflecting the fact that the cost of living in some of the states in the East is higher than that elsewhere in the country.
: The survey was conducted from July 16 to 26 by telephone with a nationally representative sample of 2,508 adults living in the United States. The statistical results were weighted to correct known demographic discrepancies. The margin of sampling error for the final, weighted numbers is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

HEADLINE: State Agency Web Sites May Work Business Hours

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: Be it to rest their algorithms or maybe just to ponder their purpose, some New York State government Web sites are available to the public less than 24/7. 

 BODY:
In this day and age, when routine chores like paying bills and ordering groceries can be done online at anytime, day or night, some New York State agencies have Web sites that have yet to join the 24/7 world.
The state's new electronic filing system for corporate forms known as biennial statements goes offline at 7:30 p.m. weekdays and stays off until 6 a.m. It does not work on weekends, either.
Unemployment Benefits Online, on the State Labor Department's site, also has limited hours. The site says unemployment insurance claims cannot be filed before 7:30 a.m. on weekdays or after 7:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday. On Fridays, the cutoff is 5 p.m. On weekends, the site is open for 31 hours without interruption, from 12:01 a.m. Saturday to 7 p.m. Sunday.
Stephen J. Dubner, writing on the blog Freakonomics, took note of the down time on the site for biennial statements collected by the State Department. "I can't recall the last time (or even the first time) I saw a Web site that was only open during business hours," he wrote on Monday. "I guess it is a mark of how the Web has changed our daily lives that we are disappointed to find a virtual office that isn't open 24/7."
Edison Alban, a spokesman for the State Department, said online filing of biennial statements - a corporate document that must be submitted every two years, along with a $9 filing fee - began in May.
"So far, more than 30,000 entities have filed their statements using this new feature," he said. A biennial statement contains contact information on a corporation, including the name and address of its top official, among other information. Corporations that use the Web site can pay the filing fee with a credit card.
Mr. Alban said the system that processed the data "was developed years ago, at a time when businesses primarily submitted their filings in paper form."
"The current system, which is utilized by a number of state agencies," he continued, "requires some time in the late evenings for multiple maintenance to be performed regularly."
He said the state was working on upgrading the system "so that service will truly be available 24/7."
At the Labor Department, a spokesman, Leo Rosales, said the down time was unavoidable. "During overnight hours," he said by e-mail, "the computerized system updates the large volume of daily transactions and performs routine maintenance checks." The updates, he added, ensure that claims are processed accurately and in a timely and confidential manner.
The State University at Albany has a registration site, MyUAlbany, that says it is open seven days a week, but only 20 1/2 hours a day. The site says it is closed 2:30 to 6 a.m. For many college students, that is prime time.
The hours are wrong, said Karl Luntta, a spokesman for the school. MyUAlbany "is in fact open 24/7." He said the information on the site - where students can register for classes, pay bills, check their grades, add or drop classes - would be changed. He said MyUAlbany had 6.1 million visits last year, second only to the school's home page.
"Years ago, when we first started the Web site and technology was different," he said, "we would reserve that time for maintenance, backups, updates and so on. The technology has been improved. We rarely find it necessary to deny access and shut MyUAlbany down."

HIGHLIGHT: Another reason, besides the housing bust, that those nearing retirement age may have suffered most from the financial crisis: a nearly 10 percent decline in household income in three years. 

 BODY:
7:24 p.m. | Updated 
Americans nearing retirement age have suffered disproportionately after the financial crisis: along with the declining value of their homes, which were intended to cushion their final years, their incomes have fallen sharply.
The typical household income for people age 55 to 64 years old is almost 10 percent less in today's dollars than it was when the recovery officially began three years ago, according to a new report from Sentier Research, a data analysis company that specializes in demographic and income data.
Across the country, in almost every demographic, Americans earn less today than they did in June 2009, when the recovery technically started. As of June, the median household income for all Americans was $50,964, or 4.8 percent lower than its level three years earlier, when the inflation-adjusted median income was $53,508.
The decline looks even worse when comparing today's incomes to those when the recession began in December 2007. Then, the median household income was $54,916, meaning that incomes have fallen 7.2 percent since the economy last peaked.
Income drops vary significantly by age, though. Households led by people between the ages of 55 and 64 have taken the biggest hit; their household incomes have fallen to $55,748 from $61,716 over the last three years, a decline of 9.7 percent. 
Sustained unemployment among older workers may be at least partly to blame for this decline. Unemployment rates for that age group are relatively low, but once older workers lose their jobs, they have an unusually hard time finding re-employment. And even when they do find new work, they usually take a pay cut. 
 "I was laid off in '08, and I never really managed to get back into the job market," said Jan Thomas, 62, who lives in Sarasota, Fla. She decided to apply for Social Security early, even though that means her benefits are lower than they would be if she had waited until 66. "I've pretty much gone through my savings at this point. You know, taking money out of one account, then the other. Then it all just kind of went poof." 
Younger Americans have also felt income declines in the three years since the recovery began. The inflation-adjusted median household income for those 25 to 34 fell 8.9 percent, while that for people under age 25 fell 6.1 percent.
Incomes for the oldest Americans, on the other hand, have risen steadily since the recovery began. Among those 65 to 74, the inflation-adjusted median household income rose 6.5 percent (to $42,113 from $39,548), and among those age 75 and older, the increase was 2.8 percent (to $26,991 from $26,244).
It's not clear why incomes rose for older people when as they fell for everyone else.
This may be because older Americans are working longer, taking in more income at more advanced ages. Perhaps they are working longer partly to compensate for the decline in the value of their homes. Rising employment rates among older people predate the housing bust, however.
The share of people over 65 who have jobs has been rising since the early 1990s; in 2011, 16.7 of people over 65 worked, compared with 11.1 percent two decades earlier. 
The chart below -- which is based on a different Census Bureau survey that goes through 2010 only, unfortunately -- shows that almost all age groups have actually seen their income rise over most of the last 50 years, although incomes for non-seniors have been much more volatile. (Remember, though, that during recessions older people have at least some steady income from Social Security.)
Income losses since the recovery began also varied depending on educational attainment, Sentier Research found.
People with the least education and people with the most education had smaller income losses, supporting the idea that the job market in the United States is "hollowing out," as the M.I.T. economist David Autor has proposed, meaning that high-skilled and low-skilled jobs are growing while midskilled jobs are thinning out.
The median household income of high school dropouts has fallen 5.3 percent (to $24,495 from $25,860), while that for college graduates has fallen 5.9 percent (to $83,378 from $88,570).
Meanwhile, incomes for those with midlevel educational attainment -- a high school diploma, some college but no degree, or an associate's degree -- slid much further.
As you can see in the chart above, the biggest percentage decline was for people who took some college courses but never got a degree. Their median income has fallen 9.3 percent over the course of the recovery so far, to $46,200 from $50,948. That must especially sting, given that these income losses are probably accompanied by student loan debt.
Black Americans appear to have suffered the most, according to the Sentier report.
The real median annual household income for blacks fell 11.1 percent from June 2009 to June 2012, landing at $32,498 from $36,567. That compares with 5.2 percent for whites, 3.6 percent for other race combinations (including Asians) and 4.1 percent for Hispanics -- all of whom started with higher incomes than blacks.

HEADLINE: Staten Island Gets Lift With Talk of a Mall and a Ferris Wheel

BYLINE: VIVIAN YEE


HIGHLIGHT: If the discussions lead to development, visitors to the island might be lured beyond the ferry terminal. 

 BODY:
They come by the thousands, crowding onto the Staten Island Ferry with their cameras, eager for the ferry's perfect views of New York Harbor, where the Statue of Liberty and Lower Manhattan gleam. But once on Staten Island, few make it out of the terminal, where a deck attached to the terminal offers a sweeping view of a parking lot caked with goose droppings, the small ballpark of the minor-league Staten Island Yankees and beyond, another parking lot.
All summer, however, the borough has been buzzing with reports that, if true, could finally propel Staten Island into the big leagues: the city is in talks with developers to build a half-million-square-foot outlet mall on one of the parking lots and a 600-foot-high observation wheelsimilar to the London Eye on the other.
That would give Staten Island, New York's most overlooked borough, an improbable distinction: the world's tallest Ferris wheel. (Currently the tallest, at 541 feet, is in Singapore, though the London Eye, which is 443-feet tall, is probably the most famous.) 
"We're all excited about the Ferris wheel," said Pat Wilks, the spokeswoman for the Staten Island borough president, James. P. Molinaro, when a reporter asked her about its possibility. Though a Ferris wheel is what people on Staten Island kept mentioning, wheels such as the London Eye and the proposed Staten Island wheel, which carry passengers in external cars or gondolas instead of suspended seats, are technically known as "observation wheels."
Neither Mr. Molinaro nor the city's Economic Development Corporation would confirm that the observation wheel and outlet mall projects had pulled ahead of other proposals for the site, which New York City has been trying to develop for several years. But a person familiar with the development project said that the city was in advanced discussions with a developer, Plaza Capital Group Management, to build the wheel. The project would be called the New York Wheel and would offer dining and event spaces, the person said.
Along the pleasant greenway that runs between the water and the parking lots, reactions to Staten Island's potential upgrade to Home of the World's Tallest Ferris Wheel ranged from the dubious to the delighted.
"We've got to start bringing things out here, put Staten Island on the map," said Tyrone Williams, 45, who was enjoying the breeze off the water on Wednesday. His friends who live elsewhere in the city agree to go to Staten Island only because he lives near the ferry terminal, he said. "It's the forgotten borough."
David Reading, 33, a fire alarm installation technician who has assignments in the borough a few times a month, said that growing up in New Jersey, "I always knew Staten Island was the dump." Told that the world's largest Ferris wheel might be coming, he laughed, and then conceded it might be a good idea.
Staten Island, it seems, is always having to justify its existence. A sign by the waterfront explains that it became a borough of New York City "despite geographically being much closer to New Jersey." 
With its expansive views of Lower Manhattan and the harbor, the waterfront, known as the North Shore Greenway, is dotted with patches of flowers and birch trees. Residents and workers in the nearby neighborhood of St. George come to spend their lunch breaks lying on the wooden benches. But few tourists venture beyond the terminal deck.
"Tourists, we see them, but there's nothing for them," said Nicole Michelson, 36, who lives on the southern shore of the island and works in St. George. Without restaurants or attractions beyond the Sept. 11 memorial on the greenway and a small historical museum in St. George, Ms. Michelson said, there is no reason for them to stay.
A friend, Michelle Butindari, 35, said: "We see them walk in. Two seconds later they're walking out." 
Besides, Ms. Michelson said, she wouldn't mind a few store outlets herself. "I might go broke at lunchtime," she said.
An outlet mall - there is no such thing in New York City, though there is a proposal for one in the Bronx - might even attract Manhattan and Brooklyn dwellers to Staten Island, albeit perhaps only a few yards beyond the terminal. But State Senator Diane J. Savino, a Democrat from Staten Island, disputed reports that the city was in serious talks with Plaza Capital Group Management about a Ferris wheel and BFC Partners, which proposed the mall, insisting that the city was only at the beginning of the process.
"The Economic Development Corporation seems to have gotten a response from two to three people who presented ideas for what would be a viable development there, including but not limited to a retail outlet mall," Ms. Savino said. "That's about as far as we've gotten." 
Officials at BFC Partners and Plaza Capital did not return messages seeking comment.
Last August, the city put out a request for ideas to develop the two parking lots, which total more than 14 acres, a spokesman for the Economic Development Corporation said. Mr. Molinaro, the borough president, said he expected the city to announce a deal on the sites by the end of September.
The sooner, the better, say Staten Islanders who work and live nearby.
At the United Livery Cars stand near the parking lot that is being discussed for the outlet mall, Arnold O'Brien, 42, who has worked at the stand for more than two years, said he had already seen surveyors take measurements for a multilevel parking garage. He said tourists fresh off the ferry often stop to ask him what else they could see on Staten Island. He tells them not to waste their time.
"If you really want to see something, go back to Manhattan," Mr. O'Brien said he tells them. 
The projects could help the area "get big, like Downtown Brooklyn," he said. "But it's got a lot of changing to do."

HEADLINE: G.M. Readies a Retooling of Lordstown Plant for Next Chevy Cruze

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: The next generation of the compact model will continue to be produced at the factory, where more than 500,000 Cruzes have been built. 

 BODY:
On Thursday, General Motors announced that it would spend $220 million equipping plants in Lordstown and Parma, Ohio, to build the next generation of the Chevrolet Cruze. The automaker said the redesigned compact car would offer revised exterior and interior styling, along with improved fuel economy, but provided no further details.
General Motors has built more than 1.6 million Cruzes since the model was introduced internationally in 2009, with more than 500,000 of those coming from Lordstown. The plant, once a flash point for G.M.'s corporate managers and leaders of the United Automobile Workers, with a notoriously spotty record for build quality, has become one of the automaker's most productive and efficient.
The Cruze was introduced to the United States market for the 2011 model year and performed extremely well, leading the compact segment for much of the year.
But the Cruze has not sustained its momentum. Sales declined 20.3 percent in June and 39.3 percent in July from their levels a year ago. Donald Johnson, vice president for Chevrolet United States sales, told The Detroit Free Press that much of the drop-off could be attributed to fleet sales, which made up 26 percent of July 2011 sales. In contrast, figures for July 2012 included just 70 fleet vehicles. He added that the Cruze's transaction price was $2,000 higher than that of its competitors.
A number of other factors have conspired to weaken demand for the Cruze. In 2011, the inventory of some Japanese brands was constrained after the earthquake in northeast Japan, which led to production slowdowns and outright shutdowns. That led to short supplies of popular models like the Toyota Prius and the Honda Fit. The Cruze benefited from the Japanese manufacturers' misfortune, filling a need for buyers looking to replace their cars immediately.
Demand may have been further diminished by a recall in June of 475,000 Cruzes in the United States and Canada. General Motors said 30 fires reported in 2011 and 2012 models were traced to oil spilling on a plastic engine shield. The affected cars were built at the Lordstown plant. A second recall affecting 61,000 of those cars was conducted to repair problematic welds in the vehicles' rear.
Whether recalls have a lasting effect on sales is not so clear. Honda recalled millions of vehicles in 2011 for a variety of problems, but according to a report by Automobile, Honda sales in the first half of 2012 were the strongest for that period since 2008.
The Cruze has been offered in only a sedan body style in the United States, but a hatchback and station wagon are sold in other markets. Though rumors persist that a Cruze coupe may be offered to American buyers in 2013, Chevrolet has stated that the wagon would not be marketed in the United States. A diesel version of the Cruze sedan is expected in American showrooms next year.
G.M. said production and sales timetables for the next-generation Cruze would be released at a later date.

HEADLINE: Labor Talks Will Start Again Tuesday in New York

BYLINE: JEFF Z. KLEIN


HIGHLIGHT: The sides remain far apart as they try to reach terms on a new N.H.L. collective bargaining agreement ahead of Commissioner Gary Bettman's Sept. 15 lockout deadline. 

 BODY:
Negotiations for a new N.H.L. collective bargaining agreement will reconvene in New York on Tuesday with both sides still far apart ahead of Commissioner Gary Bettman's Sept. 15 lockout deadline.
"We recovered last time because we have the world's greatest fans," Bettman said when asked about the potential damage of another lockout. After the last lockout in 2004-5, the N.H.L.'s revenue grew, but it endured at least three years of sharply reduced news media attention before finally rebounding. 
"We think we're paying too much in salaries," Bettman said after a 90-minute negotiating session with the N.H.L. Players' Association in Toronto on Thursday. The owners have asked for a 24 percent cut in players' salaries, a reduction greater than those agreed to by N.F.L. and N.B.A. players in 2011 after lockouts in those leagues. 
The players' offer concentrated on enhanced revenue sharing among N.H.L. clubs instead of pay cuts. Bettman said the two sides were not far apart on that issue, but added that it was not central to what the owners want. 
"It's difficult to make progress when you don't know what the fundamentals are," Bettman said.
Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, said: "I'm not sure there's any employer that wouldn't like a reduction in what it pays people. That's not a surprise."
Fehr said Thursday's negotiations focused on free agency and other issues pertaining to players' contracts. 
On Tuesday, Bettman and the deputy commissioner, Bill Daly, will meet with Fehr and Fehr's brother Steve, also an N.H.L.P.A. executive, in a small group session that will focus on the core economic issues dividing the two sides.

HEADLINE: Why Does Wall Street Always Win?

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: A new book by a Washington insider sheds light on the might of Wall Street and its ability to thwart all attempts to contain its power and alter its practices, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
After a long summer of high-profile scandals - JPMorgan Chase trading, Barclays rate-fixing, HSBC money laundering and more - the debate about the financial sector is becoming livelier. 
Why has it become so excessively dominated by relatively few very large companies? What damage can it do to the rest of us? What reasonable policy changes could bring global megabanks more nearly under control? And why is this unlikely to happen? 
If any of these questions interest you - or keep you awake at night - you should take another look at the last time we had this debate at the national level, and reflect on the work of Ted Kaufman, the former Democratic senator from Delaware, who was far ahead of almost everyone in recognizing the problem and thinking about what to do. 
Senator Kaufman represented Delaware in 2009 and 2010, and Jeff Connaughton - his chief of staff then - has a new book that puts you in the room. In "The Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins," we see Senator Kaufman as chairman of oversight hearings on the Justice Department and F.B.I.'s pursuit of financial fraud, pushing the Securities and Exchange Commission on the dangerous rise of computerized trading and working with Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, on the legislative fight to impose a hard cap on the size and debts of our largest banks. (I wrote many pieces supporting the work of Senator Kaufman at the time, including in this space, but I never worked for him.)
Mr. Kaufman was unique in ways that should give us pause. He was appointed to his seat (after Joseph Biden became vice president) and immediately said he would not run in the next election. So he never had to raise any money to reach the Senate or stay there longer. His experience gives us a glimpse of what we would get if we could really remove the money from politics.
Mr. Connaughton is a fascinating witness and raconteur because he has been through the revolving door several times: in between work in the Senate and the Clinton White House, he spent 12 years in one of Washington's top lobbying firms. This author has really lived in and understood the Wall Street-Washington corridor. The book is partly about his education - and ultimate disappointment, most of all with the Obama administration but definitely with both parties. 
The system is rotten, to be sure, but this president came to office promising change - and that is exactly what we did not get on most crucial dimensions related to the financial sector. The failure depicted on this front is political and ultimately about money - and all the power that Wall Street can buy, one way or another.
The book is also about the details - the legislative and bureaucratic regulatory process through which your future prosperity is sold down the river. If you don't follow the details, you'll never really understand what happened to this country. Mr. Connaughton has done us a great service in laying all bare. 
But be warned: while fascinating, much of what is in this book will turn your stomach. Mr. Connaughton is now out of politics, and I very much doubt that he will ever return. Hence the complete honesty missing in most political memoirs; no bridge is left unburned.
The Justice Department declines to prosecute financial fraud, the S.E.C. fails to protect average investors, and the Senate refuses to stand up to the Treasury and Federal Reserve technocrats aiming to keep too-big-to-fail in place. 
Wall Street is manifestly too powerful and showers too much money on former and future public servants in Washington. Our political system could not respond meaningfully even to a devastating financial crisis that brought the country to its knees. While this book is about the past, the implications for the future are clear.
The apathy on the part of public officials during this administration is pervasive and frequently appalling. As Mr. Connaughton puts it, 
For me, what is deplorable is not the Justice Department's failure to bring charges, but its failure to be adequately dedicated and organized either to make the cases or reach a fully informed judgment that no case could be made.
The administration apparently thought that any kind of legal action against major players in the financial sector would slow the recovery; this point of view seems to have come from the very top, in the White House and at the Treasury. As a result, then and now, Mr. Connaughton writes, "Too-big-to-fail banks continue to act lawlessly, teeter on the brink and destabilize the global economy."
In the legislative debate on the Dodd-Frank financial reform in early 2010, "the Treasury Department was taking a tougher line in negotiations than the Republican senators whose votes were in play," the author tells us, meaning that Treasury was more on the side of big banks.
And, in case you previously did not get the memo about how all this really works,
The Blob (it's really called that) refers to the government entities that regulate the finance industry - like the banking committee, Treasury Department and S.E.C. - and the army of Wall Street representatives and lobbyists that continuously surrounds and permeates them. The Blob moves together. Its members are in constant contact by e-mail and phone. They dine, drink and take vacations together. Not surprisingly, they frequently intermarry.
Could we change all of this in the world's greatest democracy? Mr. Connaughton exhorts us: "Every voter who wants to break Wall Street's hold on Washington should put Congressional and presidential candidates to the test," demanding that they shun lobbyists' contributions and asking, "Will you agree not to take campaign contributions from too-big-to-fail banks and nonbanks?"
Will it happen? This seems unlikely within our existing party system. It would take a broader citizens' movement, a groundswell of educated opinion focused on breaking the political power of Wall Street and ending the enormous, nontransparent and dangerous subsidies currently received by very large financial institutions.
Intellectually, the right and the left can unite on this issue. But where are the political leadership and organization needed? We had a huge crisis and elected a president who promised change - and that didn't make much difference. The biggest Wall Street firms are larger and probably now more powerful than they were in the run-up to 2008.
Read Mr. Connaughton's account and think about what real change would involve.

HEADLINE: Ban Ki-moon's Tehran Trip: Damned if He Does ...

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Ban Ki-moon has sometimes appeared more "secretary" than "general" in his leadership of the United Nations. Does his decision to travel to a conference in Tehran mark a new-found independence or is it just a gesture to the U.N.'s nonaligned members? And can he use the opportunity to scale back the tension over Iran's nuclear policy? 

 BODY:
LONDON - The role of Secretary General of the United Nations must sometimes seem like the ultimate no-win job.
Or, as two distinguished U.N. civil servants once expressed it: "The Secretary General is all too often damned if he takes initiative, and damned if he doesn't."
Ban Ki-moon must have shared that sentiment as he scanned the daily press review on Thursday morning - the former South Korean diplomat likes an early start - and read the international response to his decision to travel to Iran for a summit of the nonaligned nations.
"U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon defies the U.S. and Israel by confirming trip to Tehran," said The Independent, in a representative headline from the Western media. "Ban snubs Obama, embraces Iran," Commentary magazine wrote on its Web site.
My colleague Rick Gladstone writes that Mr. Ban's decision to attend the 16th summit of the Nonaligned Movement that begins at the weekend is a setback to U.S. and Israeli efforts to isolate Iran.
But did the U.N. chief have a choice?
"When faced with a choice of offending the Nonaligned Movement and its Iranian host or President Obama and Israel, Secretary General Ban picked the lesser of two evils from his point of view," Jonathan S. Tobin wrote in the Commentary article.
More than half the U.N. General Assembly's 193 members belong to the Nonaligned Movement, and Rick quoted diplomats and others as saying it would have been extraordinarily difficult for Mr. Ban not to go to Tehran.
"It is customary for the secretary general to attend the movement's annual meetings regardless of political delicacies surrounding the host country," he writes.
In his Commentary article, Mr. Tobin was writing from the perspective of those who believe Western sanctions against Iran have failed and that time is running out "before Iran's nuclear progress renders a [military] strike impossible."
"Iran isn't isolated. Nor has it been brought to its knees by sanctions," Mr. Tobin wrote, in a judgment that matched the prevailing view in Iran itself.
Iran, of course, will be delighted that Mr. Ban is attending a conference that Ezzatollah Zarghami, the country's broadcasting chief, has said would highlight the country's stand against "world arrogant powers."
 Mohammad-Hassan Asfari, a member of Iran's parliamentary foreign policy committee, said: "If Ban Ki-moon is seeking to settle disputes and manage the global situation, he has to make the most of the opportunity offered."
In Israel, it was argued that Mr. Ban's decision could shorten the path to war. 
Writing in a Haaretz blog just before Wednesday's announcement, Chemi Shalev argued that the visit would "bolster Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's contention that sanctions and diplomacy have failed, and that the time for harsher measures has arrived."
Mr. Ban is, however, almost by definition, in the business of jaw-jaw rather than war-war. And Martin Nesirky, his spokesman, said on Wednesday that in Tehran "the Secretary-General can speak on behalf of the entire international community to make clear directly to the Iranian leadership what the world expects from Tehran."
But is Mr. Ban being used as a pawn by the Iranian government and media, as one questioner at Mr. Nesirky's press briefing asked? Or is he displaying his independence of the U.N.'s dominant powers, as Shirin Sadeghi, a Middle Eastern broadcaster and journalist, suggested in a Twitter post?
A sad day in civilized history when we're impressed that the United Nations leader made a decision on his own: mobile.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/wor#Iran
- Shirin Sadeghi (@ShirinSadeghi) August 23, 2012
Mr. Ban has suffered taunts that he has been too disposed to toe the Washington line on a number of global issues since he succeeded Kofi Annan as secretary general in 2007. (His predecessor once joked that "S.G." stood not just for secretary general, but also for "scapegoat.")
As the two distinguished U.N. civil servants - Brian Urquhart and Erskine Childers - wrote in 1996: "It is impossible to escape the impression that many governments, including some of the most powerful, do not in fact want a strong, independent leader as Secretary General."
Has Mr. Ban made the right choice? Will his visit contribute to a diplomatic settlement or increase the likelihood of an early strike on Iran's nuclear facilities? Should the U.N. chief be more "secretary" than "general" when it comes to tackling threats to world peace?
As Mr. Ban packs his bag for Tehran, let us know what you think.

Citigroup Assails Nasdaq Over Flawed Facebook I.P.O. | Citigroup is not happy with Nasdaq's response to Facebook's ill-fated initial public offering.
In a 17-page letter sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, the bank sharply criticized Nasdaq's handling of the I.P.O. and its subsequent compensation offer, saying Nasdaq's $62 million proposal would only cover "fraction of its total losses."
"Nasdaq was grossly negligent in its handling of the Facebook I.P.O., and as such, Citi should be entitled to recover all of its losses attributable to Nasdaq's gross negligence, not just a very small fraction as is currently the case," the firm said in its letter.
Nasdaq adamantly disagrees with Citigroup's contention, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Nasdaq's customers are required to sign a contract agreeing to the exchange's rules before they begin trading on the exchange, these people said.
A representative of Nasdaq declined to comment on Wednesday. DealBook »
A Quick End to TARP Means a Smaller Payoff for Taxpayers | Quietly, the Treasury Department is engaged in another bailout of the banks. This time, it's America's small banks that are the lucky duckies, Jesse Eisinger writes in his column, The Trade.
The federal government still holds investments in hundreds of small banks around the country in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, otherwise known as the bailout. In an effort to wind down TARP, the government is trying to sell off its holdings of preferred stock of the remaining smaller banks.
The problem is that the Treasury Department is not getting great bids on some of the bank paper, even on the shares of banks with strong profits and strong capital. When the government sold its holdings in MetroCorp Bancshares of Houston this month, the bank itself bought back most of it - at 98 cents on the dollar. Wilshire Bancorp of Los Angeles bought back its paper at 94 cents on the dollar. The Treasury Department sold preferred shares of Ohio-based First Defiance at 96 cents, and Peoples Bancorp of North Carolina at 93 cents. All of these are regarded as healthy. The Trade »

HEADLINE: Clinton Appeals to Voters in New Obama Ad

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: A new Obama campaign ad features former President Bill Clinton speaking directly to the camera. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney has repeatedly sought to contrast President Obama with former President Bill Clinton, arguing that Mr. Obama has abandoned his Democratic predecessor's focus on moderate politics and middle-class voters.
In recent ads, Mr. Romney has highlighted the success of Mr. Clinton's welfare overhaul and has argued - falsely, according to most independent fact-checkers - that Mr. Obama is trying to gut those reforms.
Now, Mr. Obama's campaign has released a new television ad featuring Mr. Clinton speaking directly to the camera and challenging Mr. Romney's assertions.
"President Obama has a plan to rebuild America from the ground up, investing in innovation, education and job training. It only works if there is a strong middle class," Mr. Clinton says in the ad. "That's what happened when I was president. We need to keep going with his plan."
Few political ads are more powerful than ones in which the politician talks directly to the camera - and to voters - without the distraction of video effects or fast-paced scenes.
Mr. Obama's campaign has already produced several ads like that, hoping to make use of what polls suggest is the president's personal appeal to many voters.
In the new ad, Mr. Clinton argues that the coming presidential contest is a "clear choice" between the two candidates.
"This election to me is about which candidate is more likely to return us to full employment," Mr. Clinton says. "The Republican plan is to cut more taxes on upper income people and go back to deregulation. That's what got us in trouble in the first place."
Mr. Obama's campaign said the ad would be broadcast in eight battleground states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia.
A spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, Amanda Henneberg, said in an e-mail that Mr. Romney's private-sector experience and his plan to strengthen the middle class "offer a new direction."
"He will jump-start economic growth, creating 12 million jobs and bringing hope to the middle class," Ms. Henneberg said.

HEADLINE: Celebrities Join to Oppose Upstate Gas Drilling

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: More than 140 artists and celebrities are trying to persuade Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to bar hydraulic fracturing in parts of New York State. 

 BODY:
More than 140 artists and celebrities, including Lady Gaga and Paul McCartney, have signed on to a coalition to try to persuade Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to ban the use of hydraulic fracturing - also known as hydrofracking or fracking - to extract natural gas in parts of New York State.
Yoko Ono and her son, Sean Lennon, plan to host an event on Wednesday in New York City to introduce the coalition, called Artists Against Fracking. The Beatles family is well represented: the coalition also includes Ringo Starr and Julian Lennon. 
 "Our aim is for the world to embrace sustainable living and develop renewable energies through economic viable alternatives to fossil fuel," the group says on its Web site. 
Ms. Ono and Mr. Lennon discussed their intention to form the coalition on the NBC program "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon" in July. Mr. Fallon is listed as a member on the Web site, as are the author Salman Rushdie, the restaurateur Mario Batali and some big show-business names, like Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman, Julianne Moore and Gwyneth Paltrow. 
Some in the group have homes near the upstate areas where the new drilling could take place. 
The group lists an eclectic mix, among them: Fred Armisen, Alec Baldwin, Jackson Browne, David Byrne, Deepak Chopra, Zooey Deschanel, Carrie Fisher, Roberta Flack, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jeff Koons, John Cameron Mitchell, Bonnie Raitt, Todd Rundgren, Amy Ryan, Cindy Sherman, Patti Smith, Uma Thurman, Liv Tyler and Rufus Wainwright, as well as bands like the B-52s, Kronos Quartet, My Morning Jacket, Scissor Sisters, Wilco and Yo La Tengo. 
Such star power represents a coup for an antifracking movement in New York that has counted on only a few celebrities, led by the actor Mark Ruffalo, who is also listed as part of the coalition, to burnish its image. Coordinators of the press event said Ms. Ono and Sean Lennon would not be available for interviews until next week.
The artists' involvement comes amid increasingly visible opposition to Mr. Cuomo's consideration of regulations that would allow hydrofracking in some parts of the state. Polls show New Yorkers to be deeply divided over the technology, which involves blasting shale with millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals to release natural gas.
On their Web site, the artists warn of the dangers of accidental contamination of aquifers with drilling chemicals, and the wastewater that would be produced by drilling operations.
But mostly, the celebrities take direct aim at the governor, a Democrat. Their Web site's home page gives out his office's contact information and urges people to "Contact Governor Cuomo to voice your opinion!" 
It is uncertain how much weight the artists' opinions will have. But they are likely to further energize the environmental movement, which includes advocacy groups, scientists and politicians, in the debate against the oil and gas industry, landowners and officials in communities that see the drilling as a source of new investment and jobs.
Brad Gill, executive director of the industry group Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York, responded to the coalition's emergence with a terse statement saying that he trusted that Mr. Cuomo would rely on science to make a decision, as the governor has pledged to do. "The people elected Governor Cuomo, not celebrities, to lead New York and to make decisions that are in the best interest" of the state, Mr. Gill said.
The industry association had previously dismissed antifracking celebrities n a postcard delivered to lawmakers in Albany that said: "Welcome to Hollywood, N.Y., where the line between fact and fiction is blurred."
A spokesman for the governor, Josh Vlasto, said Mr. Cuomo had not heard from the artists directly, though Ms. Onoposted a letter to the governor in July on her personal Web site. (It was unclear whether she sent the letter.) 
Asked by a reporter about hydrofracking on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo said that he understood the passion on both sides of the argument, but that he would "let the science dictate the conclusion; and that's just what we're doing."

HEADLINE: Half of Homeowners Under 40 Are Still Underwater

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The less time you've been in your home, the more likely you've accumulated little equity and seen the value of your property fall since 2005. 

 BODY:
The country's underwater homes are slowly resurfacing as thehousing market improves. But younger borrowers are still more likely to be submerged, a new report from real estate site Zillow.com finds.
Overall levels of negative equity improved in the second quarter of the year compared with the first quarter, as home values continue to rise. But about half of borrowers under 40 still owe more than their homes are worth, the analysis found.
Younger borrowers are more likely to be affected by negative equity in part because they generally have been in their home for shorter periods of time and had less time to build equity before the housing debacle. But on the bright side, younger borrowers tend to be in relatively "shallow" water compared to older borrowers and are less likely to be delinquent on payments, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow.com.
The disproportionate impact on younger borrowers may actually have a helpful effect on home values, by creating tight inventory of homes for sale. Younger borrowers trapped by negative equity tend to be reluctant to sell, even though their homes are often the most attractive to first-time buyers who might be ready to plunge into the market. "Sellers don't want to sell, even if buyers want to buy," he said.
When they do sell, prices are higher - which helps push values up. The process is actually moving the market toward recovery, but it's a gradual process, he said. "Over all, the second-quarter report is positive," said Mr. Humphries. "The housing market is healing, albeit slowly."
These results come from the second edition of the new Zillow Negative Equity Report, which looks at current, outstanding loan amounts for individual, owner-occupied homes, and compares them to those homes' current estimated values.
Of the 30 largest markets tracked by Zillow, negative equity fell the most from the first to the second quarter in the Phoenix metropolitan area (from nearly 56 percent to about 52 percent) and the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area (from 46 percent to roughly 44 percent). The Las Vegas market continues to have the highest rate of negative equity, with nearly 69 percent of borrowers underwater (down from 71 percent in the first quarter.)
Are you an under-fortysomething with negative equity in your home? What will it take to get you to sell?

HEADLINE: Sonia Gandhi Ranked Sixth Most Powerful Woman in the World

BYLINE: PAMPOSH RAINA


HIGHLIGHT: Despite rising criticism at home, Mrs. Gandhi's rank rises in Forbes' annual list. 

 BODY:
Sonia Gandhi, the Congress party president and chairwoman of the coalition government running the country, is India's most powerful woman and the sixth most powerful woman in the world, according to Forbes magazine.
This is the ninth year in a row Forbes has listed the 100 women "who impact the world." Mrs. Gandhi, 65, made it to the list for the fourth time, and moved up one notch from the list last year. She was also named the 11th most powerful person in the world last year, out of 70 people who were chosen by the magazine.
(The list, some noted, may be geared more toward those outside India than those inside. After all, Mamata Banerjee, the West Bengal chief minister who has practically held the central government hostage at certain times in the past year, didn't make the cut on the list of powerful women.)
Mrs. Gandhi, who underwent surgery for a mysterious illness last year, reported by many Indian media outlets to be a form of cancer, is "back in fighting spirit," Forbes said, citing her public reprimand of "a fellow parliamentarian during session who had criticized her party's handling of this summer's rioting in Assam."
The magazine added: "Lauded for overseeing heavy economic growth, she is also criticized for tolerating political corruption and failing to forge connections with India's fastest-growing demographic - younger voters."
Despite the criticism, Mrs. Gandhi was ranked one spot ahead of the U.S. first lady, Michelle Obama (and just behind Jill Abramson, executive editor of The New York Times).
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany once again ranked first, followed by Hillary Rodham Clinton, the U.S. secretary of state. President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil was third on the power list and Melinda Gates of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was fourth.
Indra Nooyi, the chairwoman and chief executive of PepsiCo, was the next Indian woman on the list after Mrs. Gandhi, at No. 12, right behind the television host Oprah Winfrey. Ms. Nooyi, 56, has been in the Forbes list's top 10 for the past six years. "This superstar CEO last year returned $5.6 billion to shareholders, when PepsiCo net revenue grew 14% to $66 billion," Forbes said. The magazine added that she is "in the hot seat" because of "languishing stock at the snack-and-soda giant and diminishing market share."
Padmasree Warrior, the chief technology and strategy officer of Cisco, the world's largest computer networking equipment maker, was the third Indian woman on the list at No. 58. Ms. Warrior, 51, "is responsible for all deals activity as one of the most acquisitive firms in technology reconfigures its business strategy," and is being "groomed for the top spot," Forbes wrote. The publication also pointed to her 1.4 million followers on Twitter, who receive company updates and "cute pictures of her family."
Right behind Ms. Warrior at No. 59 was Chanda Kochhar, 50, the managing director and chief executive of ICICI Bank, one of India's largest lenders. Ms. Kochhar "oversees assets of $93 billion, more than 2,750 branches in India and the bank's presence in 19 countries," Forbes wrote. Ms. Kochhar, who became the company's youngest chief executive in 2009, is "pursuing a new strategy, prioritizing day-to-day banking business through its branches rather than big-ticket deals," the magazine wrote.
The last Indian woman to appear on the 2012 list was Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, 59, the founder and chairwoman of Biocon, a biotechnology company, who came in at No. 80. Forbes described Ms. Mazumdar-Shaw as "India's first biotech entrepreneur."

HEADLINE: Self-Deportation

BYLINE: LAWRENCE DOWNES


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican Party thinks it's possible, and desirable, to force 11 million undocumented immigrants to leave the country by making them miserable. 

 BODY:
The Republican platform drafting committee has adopted the "self-deportation" immigration "solution" that Mitt Romney embraced during the primaries. This is the idea that it is not only possible to force 11 million undocumented immigrants to leave the country by making them miserable, but also desirable--presumably because Americans are itching to get back to farm labor, domestic and restaurant work, small-scale entrepreneurship and other backbreaking, minimal-wage jobs that illegal immigrants have stolen from them.
"If you really want to create a job tomorrow, you can remove an illegal alien today," said the delegate Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state who wrote Arizona's "self-deportation" immigration law and carbon copies in other states, and successfully offered several amendments to the platform.
This view does not allow for the complexity of the immigration mess, it does not accept the value of assimilating workers whom the economy and country need, or the possibility of turning anyone, ever, into future Americans. It simply says: Get out. And take your American kids with you.

The platform calls for the federal government to force businesses in every state to use the E-Verify electronic database to check the immigration status of new hires. It calls for a double-walled fence along the Mexican border, and an end to federal lawsuits challenging state immigration laws. (Despite rampant concerns about racial profiling and other civil-rights abuses in states such as Arizona and Alabama, the Department of Justice would be told to stay out; nothing to see there.)
It's all standard-issue, short-sighted dogma. (Who's paying for that 2,000-mile fence, Mr. Kobach?)
But at least there was some dissent before the drafting committee adopted the plank. Kip Kempton, a delegate from Arizona, opposed Mr. Kobach's E-Verify amendment, clearly laying out the dissonance between the G.O.P.'s gospel of limited government and its resurgent nativism.
Making E-Verify mandatory, Mr. Kempton said, "Increases the size, scope and reach of government; it's an additional cost to business, it's a hidden tax, as we've been presented here; and it submits us to a bloated government and it hinders business success, and it puts the onus of law enforcement squarely on the shoulders of small-businessmen. It's just an additional weight that I don't want to deal with."
If his party gets its way, he'll just have to deal with it.
Here's the debate on C-SPAN. See Day 2, Part 3. Mr. Kobach talks about E-Verify starting at about minute 57.

HEADLINE: New York Fed Sells Off Last A.I.G.-Related Holdings

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Thursday that it had wound down the final remnant of its rescue of the American International Group, generating a multibillion-dollar profit in the process. 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Thursday that it had wound down the final remnant of its rescue of the American International Group, generating a multibillion-dollar profit in the process.
The New York Fed said it had sold the remaining securities held in Maiden Lane III, one of two financial entities created to house the most financially shaky parts of A.I.G.'s portfolio. Over all, it generated a $6.6 billion gain from the unwinding of the portfolio.
Ties between A.I.G. and the government remain, however. The Treasury Department still owns a 53 percent stake in the insurer, but it has sold off a portion of its holdings over time, including some through a 2010 "re-I.P.O." of the company. A.I.G. plans to continue buying back shares held by the Treasury Department to speed along the process.
Over the last several years, the New York Fed has been working to close the books on its portion of A.I.G.'s rescue, disentangling itself from a bailout that once threatened to swell to $182 billion. It closed out another vehicle related to the insurer's rescue, Maiden Lane II, in February, earning about $2.8 billion for taxpayers.
And two months ago, the New York Fed said that it had been paid back for loans that it had extended to Maiden Lane III. All that remained was to sell off the underlying securities, a task left to the regulator's advisers at BlackRock.
A number of companies, including A.I.G. itself, regularly bought some of the complex mortgage bonds that comprised Maiden Lane III. The buyers of the final batch of securities were Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Morgan Stanley.
"The completion of the sale of the Maiden Lane III portfolio marks the end of an important chapter - our assistance to A.I.G. - that was undertaken to stabilize the financial system in the midst of the financial crisis," William C. Dudley, the New York Fed's president, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Ryan Blames Obama for Looming Defense Cuts

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Paul D. Ryan backed a deal that could result in defense cuts, but he turns his fire on President Obama over the reductions. 

 BODY:
5:51 p.m. | Updated FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. -- Campaigning a few miles from Fort Bragg, where patriotism runs deep and the local economy depends on military spending, Representative Paul D. Ryan pinned responsibility for a looming chop to the defense budget on President Obama.
Mr. Ryan blamed Mr. Obama for an 8 percent cut in Pentagon spending that is scheduled for January that results from Congress's failure to compromise on a debt plan, even though Mr. Ryan voted for a 2011 deal requiring the automatic cuts as a way to force both parties to the negotiating table.
Mr. Ryan vowed that if he and Mitt Romney are elected, they will roll back the planned defense cuts of about $600 billion over 10 years.
"We will reverse these reckless, devastating defense cuts the president is bringing us toward,'' Mr. Ryan said. "We will recognize the primary responsibility of the federal government first and foremost is strong national defense.''
"It's not just policy," he added. "It's personal."
The impending automatic cuts, or sequestration, are the result of the failure of a bipartisan "super committee'' to compromise on spending and revenue, as required by the 2011 deal raising the nation's debt ceiling.
The deal included a Sword of Damocles provision that if no agreement were reached, $1.2 trillion in cuts would automatically kick in, half from the military and half from social programs. It is a deal Republicans now desperately want to unwind.
Mr. Ryan said here that despite agreeing to the deal-ceiling law, he had never approved its details.
"It was the president who insisted on this makeup, this formula,'' he said. "Defense spending is not half of all federal spending, but it's half of the cuts approximately in the sequester. We disagreed with that then, disagree with it now.''
A bill Mr. Ryan wrote that passed the House in May would replenish military spending with deeper cuts to social safety-net programs for the poor, including food stamps, school-lunch subsidies and children's health insurance.
Senate Democrats and President Obama insisted that any deal include raising taxes on top earners.
"If Congressman Ryan were serious about avoiding the automatic defense cuts he decried in North Carolina today, he'd tell Mitt Romney and his fellow Republicans in Congress to work with the president to achieve balanced deficit reduction that includes asking millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share - as the plan President Obama has put forward does,'' Danny Kanner, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said in a statement.
It is a deadlock that both parties now are counting on the November election to resolve. In the meantime, there is no shortage of spin and image-management.
Mr. Ryan, who did not serve in the military, sought to burnish his defense credentials, mentioning that "one of my buddies just got out of Green Beret school here.'' He showed a laminated card he carries with the names of soldiers from his Wisconsin district killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Speaking on a stage that included retired generals and a mother and a wife of soldiers who have died, he spoke of the economic impact of the sequester on North Carolina, a state Mr. Obama carried in 2008 by a tissue-thin margin.
"Right here in North Carolina it will cost 55,000 jobs,'' Mr. Ryan said. "The president's demanding a massive tax increase on small businesses, which will cost us jobs, in exchange for these defense sequesters. We don't want to trade small business jobs for military jobs. We want more jobs across the board.''
The Obama campaign accused Mr. Ryan of rejecting a deal to reduce the deficit last year out of political considerations.
"Congressman Ryan voted for the agreement he criticized today, and he walked away from a balanced deficit reduction plan last summer because he thought it would help the president's re-election prospects,'' Mr. Kanner said.
Taking questions from audience members, Mr. Ryan declined to respond to a woman seeking his views about a group of former Special Operations and C.I.A. officers who last week began a $1 million campaign criticizing the administration for leaking details about the killing of Osama bin Laden. 
A Web video, "Dishonorable Disclosures," from the group, Special Operations Opsec Education Fund, has been compared by the Obama campaign to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth attack on Senator John Kerry's military record in 2004.
Mr. Ryan was asked about criticism of the group from General Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who on Wednesday scolded any veteran who "uses the uniform, whatever uniform it is, for partisan politics.''
Mr. Ryan at first seemed confused by the question. "I'm not familiar with that,'' he said 
Representative Renee Ellmers, a House colleague from North Carolina who was on stage with him, responded to the audience member, "I think, if I'm not mistaken, are you referring to the recent release or statements by some of the former Special Forces?''
"Oh, on the Bin Laden raid,'' Mr. Ryan said. "On the Bid Laden raid. O.K, yeah. I didn't. Yeah.''
He offered no further comments. 
Ms. Ellmers defended the former officers. "I think I understand where General Dempsey was coming from,'' she said. "However, I think that this is a very important issue and certainly a First Amendment right, and they have every right to speak out if they feel they need to.''

HIGHLIGHT: The dean of the Columbia Business School, a top economic adviser to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, has joined the economic blogosphere. 

 BODY:
R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of the Columbia Business School and a top economic adviser to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, has joined the economics blogosphere. 
Along with Tim Kane of the Hudson Institute, he will be blogging on stagnation, imbalance and decline. The two are planning on writing a book on the subject, due out next year. 
Here is a passage from the introductory post: 
Our core theory is the economics is at the heart of great power growth and decline, and secondly that political stagnation leads to economic imbalance. Imbalance happened to Rome. Imbalance happened to Ming China. It is happening to Europe, to Argentina, to Japan, to California, and may be coming to a superpower near you.
Coincidentally, one of Mr. Romney's other top economic advisers, N. Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist, is also a prolific blogger.

HEADLINE: Mayor Cites Better Shelters and Slow Economy for Need for More Beds

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg responded to a question about a sharp rise in the number of homeless people in the city's shelter system. 

 BODY:
Asked about a sharp rise in the number of homeless people in New York City's shelter system, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg suggested Thursday that people were staying in shelters longer in part because the shelters were "much more pleasurable" than they used to be, making people less eager to leave.
"We have made our shelter system so much better that, unfortunately, when people are in it - or fortunately, depending on what your objective is - it is a much more pleasurable experience than they ever had before," he said.
"When we came into office, the shelter system was an abomination. People were driven around all night. The kids slept on benches. None of that happens again, so there's less pressure on people to move out today."
Mr. Bloomberg noted that the sluggish economy also meant that people did not have the money to leave.
The number of people seeking shelter in the city is at a record high. Two weeks ago, more than 43,000 people, including more than 18,000 children, were staying in city shelters, up 18 percent from a year earlier. The increase has led the city to open nine new shelters in two months.
One likely cause of the increase is the phasing out of a signature Bloomberg administration program called Advantage, which gave employed homeless people rent subsidies for up to two years, part of an effort to help them transition toward self-sufficiency. 
The state withdrew its financial support last year, leading to the loss of federal funding, as well. The city, which had previously provided only a third of the financing, said it could not continue the program with only its own money. 
Some advocates have called on the city to give homeless people priority in receiving public housing or federal Section 8 vouchers, with which people pay no more than 30 percent of their income for privately rented apartments. The Bloomberg administration has said that this would be too costly.
"The question you've got to ask yourself is, do you want to reach into your pocket and have your taxes go up and start paying for more permanent housing for everybody?" Mr. Bloomberg said on Thursday. "That's the issue before the public."
Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate and an expected candidate for mayor next year, immediately pounced on the mayor's comments.
"When it comes to families facing crisis, our mayor seems to be living in a fantasy world," Mr. de Blasio said in a statement. "Families are staying in shelters longer because the city has absolutely no exit strategy for them. Mayor Bloomberg needs to own up to the magnitude of this policy failure."

HEADLINE: Should We Cancel the Election? (A Socratic Dialog)

BYLINE: GARY GUTTING


HIGHLIGHT: Socrates pays a visit to the author to argues that presidential elections are no better than a coin toss. 

 BODY:
SOCRATES: I'm against it.
GUTTING: I see what you mean. It's going to be nasty, brutish, and long - not to say immensely expensive - but of course if we want a democracy, there's no alternative.
S: I disagree. You shouldn't hold the election at all. You should flip a coin instead.
G: You don't see any difference between Obama and Romney?
S: Oh, I do. I'm very impressed with Obama, no question. He's intelligent, courageous, self-controlled and has a good sense of justice. Just the sort of person I had in mind for my philosopher-rulers. But none of that's going to make a difference to the American voters. The election's likely to be close, and in any case the outcome will turn on the October unemployment report, the price of gas, an Israeli attack on Iran, who has the most money for attack ads in the last two weeks or some other rationally irrelevant factor that you don't yet have any hint about.
G: But surely you'd prefer to let Obama make his case to the American people rather than let blind chance decide the outcome?

S: I think letting the American people decide is no different from leaving it to chance. The vast majority of you don't know enough about the issues or the candidates to make anything like a reliable decision. (It was the same in Athens in my day.) Take the economic issues all your commentators say will be decisive. I think Paul Krugman makes a decisive case that, for all its flaws, Obama's approach to the economy is likely to be far more effective than anything Romney and Ryan have in mind. But there are prominent economists who reject Krugman's argument. If Krugman's right, you can't trust the experts who disagree with him. So why should you trust the judgment of the non-experts whose votes will decide the election?
G: Well, aren't we voters at least pretty good judges of character and competence?
S: I see nothing in the history of your elections to suggest anything of the sort. Is there any reason to think that over, say, the last 50 years, you've elected the "better man" at least half the time?
G: You may be right about this or any other particular election. But it would be crazy to give up the general idea of having elections. At a minimum, the people can tell if a government is grossly incompetent, deeply corrupt or even imposing tyranny. The fact that we have elections that can "throw the rascals out" is our only defense against the worst sorts of government.
S: You may have a point there. I always said tyranny is the one form of government worse than democracy. Let me modify my proposal. Once the parties have chosen their candidates - maybe through some tobacco-free version of the old smoke-filled room - you should immediately have a national referendum on whether to have an election. If things are appallingly bad, people will vote to have one. Otherwise, I'm sure they'll choose to save money and aggravation, and flip the coin.
G: I'm not so sure. People are used to elections and, for all their complaining, they like the sense that they're making big decisions - and they find the presidential horse race entertaining.
S: Well, of course, I realize that what I'm proposing goes against present inclinations and prejudices, and it might take some time for people to learn that elections aren't usually worth the trouble. As you know, I've always had a utopian streak. But, details of implementation aside, the point is that what I'm proposing illustrates the only real value of democracy. It's the best way to avoid tyranny, but it's not a good way (no better than chance) of choosing policies and leaders. We Greeks, you know, did all right choosing leaders by lot.
G: But don't presidential elections serve other purposes? Even if we could get just as good leaders and policies from a coin flip, doesn't the extended discussion and debate of an election produce better formulations of the issues and of the opposing policies for dealing with them?
S: Just the opposite. Under your system, public policy debates are almost entirely political in the worst sense. Politicians are concerned only with making cheap rhetorical points that will arouse popular passions (remember "socialism" and "death panels" from the health care debate). Once you remove the need to gear policies to popular ignorance and fears, politicians will have to propose policies that they can successfully defend in debates among themselves.
G: So you trust the politicians more than you trust the people?
S: Yes, I do. For all their failings, most politicians are reasonably sincere, honest, and much more intelligent and educated on the issues than their constituents. Very few of them come up to the standards I set, but once freed from the necessity of courting uninformed public opinion, most of them could do a creditable job of making decisions in the public interest. And remember, without elections, politicians would no longer need the vast amount of money that gives big donors so much influence.
G: O.K., maybe you're on to something. But - who's going to flip the coin?
S: Hmm, I hadn't thought about that. I suppose the Chief Justice of the United States.
G: Ah ha! There's the fatal flaw!

HEADLINE: Abortion and Akin Were Off Limits During Romney Interview, Reporter Says

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: A television reporter in Denver said she was told she could not ask questions about abortion or Representative Todd Akin's comments about rape and abortion during an interview with Mitt Romney. 

 BODY:
It's the sort of statement that leaves journalists slack-jawed: "The one stipulation to the interview was that I not ask him about abortion or Todd Akin."
That's what Mitt Romney's campaign demanded, said Shaun Boyd, a reporter for the CBS-owned television station in Denver, when she interviewed the Republican presidential candidate on Thursday. Ms. Boyd was one of four Denver reporters to be granted five minutes with the candidate via satellite, and the only reporter to tell viewers about any preset restrictions. 
In response to Ms. Boyd's claim, the Romney campaign suggested that it does not demand that reporters swerve around certain topics during interviews. "This is not how we operate," a campaign spokeswoman said. "The matter is being addressed." 
But she did not elaborate.
After her interview with Mr. Romney on Thursday, Ms. Boyd told Talking Points Memo that she "said to them, 'Look, everybody's talking about this. It's going to seem awkward if I don't ask about it. And they said, 'Well, he's said all he's going to say about it. He doesn't have anything more to say. You won't be getting any new information, so we don't want to talk about that.'"

She said she ultimately agreed: "I wanted to get the interview with him because I have other issues I want to talk to him about."
Campaigns routinely try to steer news media coverage by consenting to certain interviews (and interviewers) and rejecting other ones. Interviews are sometimes granted on a specific topic, like the economy or foreign affairs. But in those cases, reporters are still free to ask about whatever they want. Outright restrictions on an interview ("you may ask about X, but you may not ask about Y") are rarely heard of. The candidate, after all, can simply choose not to answer a reporter's questions about a certain topic.
When Ms. Boyd's interview was broadcast on Thursday afternoon, the Obama campaign quickly sent the video and a statement to reporters with the subject line "Romney: No Questions on Akin or Abortion."
(The headline on the CBS station's Web site on Thursday afternoon was similar: "Romney Speaks With CBS4, but Not About Akin.")
This week, Mr. Romney did speak with another news media outlet, a television station in New Hampshire, about Mr. Akin, the Missouri Senate candidate whose views on abortion have been denounced by many politicians. Mr. Romney said then, "He should understand that his words with regards to rape are not words that I can defend, that we can defend, or that we can defend him."
The Obama campaign said in its e-mail blast, "Mitt Romney's campaign might be able to muzzle reporters from asking tough questions, but women across America deserve to know the truth about Romney-Ryan's extreme agenda."
The Obama campaign has come under scrutiny lately for guiding the direction of interviews with President Obama, though not the same degree of guidance as Ms. Boyd reported on Thursday.
This week, when Mr. Obama granted a round of satellite interviews with local television stations on the topic of sequestration, automatic budget cuts that are scheduled to take effect next year, one reporter was quoted as saying to him, "I know we were asked to talk about sequestration today," before asking about another topic. The video clip was circulated on YouTube and was cited as evidence of Mr. Obama's effort to control the news media.
Campaigns, of course, have an increasing number of ways to bypass the news media entirely. A study released on Thursday by the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism found that journalists are playing a smaller role in shaping campaign narratives than they once did. 
"More of what the public hears about candidates also now comes from the campaigns themselves and less from journalists acting as independent reporters or interpreters of who the candidates are," the study concluded.

HEADLINE: On Ryan's Campaign Plane, Kind Gestures but Few Questions Answered

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: On Representative Paul D. Ryan's campaign plane, the impression, indeed, is that the candidate and the traveling press are the closest of strangers. 

 BODY:
ON BOARD REPRESENTATIVE PAUL D. RYAN'S CAMPAIGN PLANE - Paul Ryan really wants to be friends. He comes bearing white-chocolate macadamia nut cookies, and offering to buy you a hot dog on your birthday. If he hears you will soon be leaving his back-of-the-plane entourage, he walks down to shake your hand. 
Mr. Ryan has made repeated small overtures to his traveling press corps, often involving food, clearly seeking good relations with the journalists who cover him everyday - and to avoid the mistake the Romney-Ryan campaign acknowledges that Mitt Romney made on his recent European trip, when a freeze-out of the foot soldiers of the media resulted in some edgy coverage of a series of verbal slip-ups.
But because the media strategy of both Mr. Romney and now Mr. Ryan is to avoid free-wheeling press conferences at all costs, aggressively managing their message, the small gestures are often fraught encounters. 
When Mr. Ryan walked to the back of his plane Thursday night, on a flight between Missouri and Michigan, he was set upon by reporters so hungry for access that video cameras and tape recorders were thrust in his face. 
"Every time I come back here, are you guys going to always do that?'' he said in exasperation. "Does it have to be so formal?''
You need to talk to us more often, someone said. 
"You're always here,'' Mr. Ryan said. "It's kind of weird not talking.''
The impression, indeed, is that the candidate and the traveling press are the closest of strangers. Reporters might make an ice cream run with members of Mr. Ryan's staff, or glimpse him in workout gear in the gym of the same Marriott Courtyard where everyone stays. But as soon as a reporter springs a question about, say, Representative Todd Akin's recent comments about rape and abortion, the portcullis gate slams down. 
At an intimate forum in North Carolina on Thursday, when the local host invited questions from the audience as well as the news media, campaign aides quickly put the kibosh on the idea and said no media questions would be taken.
So the relationship is one of mismatched expectations, the kind a Miss Lonely Hearts might be able to help with. 
On the campaign plane Thursday morning, the day after Mr. Ryan passed around the plate of cookies, a television reporter rolled an orange down the aisle with the message "Hey Congressman, thanks for the visit. Don't be a stranger.''
It rolled back with a message from Mr. Ryan's traveling press secretary, Michael Steel: "Eat your fruits and veggies if you want more cookies.''
On Thursday evening, Mr. Ryan tried again. The pretext was to shake the hand of a reporter who would be moving on to cover Vice President Joseph R. Biden.
But questions were fired fast and furious at Mr. Ryan: On welfare reform. On his difference with Mr. Romney over exceptions to anti-abortion laws. On what he talked about in his policy briefing that day with staff. 
"I want to get the C.B.O. baseline,'' Mr. Ryan responded to this last query, referring to a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office on projections for economic growth. "That's the kind of thing I like to do,'' he said.
Most of Mr. Ryan's interviews are with local television stations, in an effort to woo voters in key battleground states. Some are hard-hitting, like a Pittsburgh station that asked him to clarify what a bill he co-sponsored meant by including the language "forcible rape.''
Most are less probing, like a zany interview conducted by a Roanoke, Va., station that aired Thursday, in which the reporter asked Mr. Ryan to play a game of word association. Chick-fil-A? "Good chicken,'' Mr. Ryan offered. "Free people exercising their free speech rights.''
He also revealed that "having a piece of cake is just like having asparagus as far as I'm concerned,'' adding, "So I'm like, well, eat the asparagus then.''
Mr. Ryan and his traveling press corps shared a laugh about the interview. "That was weird. I've never had an interview like that,'' Mr. Ryan said. 
And what, he was asked, was his position on asparagus? "I love asparagus, it's my favorite vegetable,'' Ryan said, implying that in a Romney-Ryan administration, one Obama legacy that won't be uprooted is the White House vegetable garden. 
An aide to Mr. Ryan said dinner was served at the front of the plane. And it included asparagus. "I'm going to eat my dinner,'' Mr. Ryan said, backing away. "Nice to see all you guys.''

HEADLINE: New York Fed Sells Last Of Its A.I.G. Bailout Bonds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
8:31 p.m. | Updated The government is one step closer to shedding its burden from the financial crisis.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Thursday sold the last of the risky bonds that were acquired as part of the 2008 bailout of the American International Group. In all, such sales generated $9.4 billion for taxpayers.
The deal "marks the end of an important chapter - our assistance to A.I.G. - that was undertaken to stabilize the financial system in the midst of the financial crisis," William C. Dudley, the New York Fed's president, said in a statement. 
While the government has reached another milestone in its efforts to unwind the bailouts, taxpayers are still responsible for the crisis-era programs. The Treasury Department owns a roughly 53 percent stake in A.I.G., which it is hoping to whittle down through a succession of stock sales. The government also owns big stakes in General Motors and Ally Financial.
"It's mostly symbolic," Henry T. C. Hu, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said of Thursday's announcement. "It harkens back to this extraordinary intervention."
Nearly four years later, A.I.G. remains one of the most visible reminders of the crisis.
In 2008, the insurer nearly collapsed, prompting the government to provide a $182 billion lifeline. As part of that contentious effort, the government financed two vehicles, Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III, named after the street that runs behind the New York Fed's headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Together, the entities acquired the mortgage investments that threatened A.I.G. at the time.
The insurer has since recovered, having refashioned itself into a smaller company that largely shies away from the complex investments that nearly led to its demise. Its shares are up 9.6 percent since the first major sale of the Treasury Department's stock holdings in May of 2011.
As A.I.G. healed, the New York Fed started to exit the bailout. With the economy recovering, appetite for the risky bonds returned, making it easier for the government to sell the assets at a good price.
Even A.I.G. wanted them. In March 2011, the insurer bid $15.7 billion for the entire Maiden Lane II portfolio. The New York Fed rejected the offer. But in February, the company disclosed that it had bought about $2 billion of the bonds from a third party. That month, the regulator said that it had entirely wound down Maiden Lane II, generating $2.8 billion for taxpayers.
Since then, the New York Fed has moved swiftly. In June, it announced that it had been paid back for loans that supported Maiden Lane III. With its latest announcement, the regulator said that it had disposed of the remaining securities in the vehicle, which in total made $6.6 billion for taxpayers.
The buyers of the final batch of securities held in the investment pool were Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Morgan Stanley. A.I.G., which is entitled to about one-third of the proceeds from the sale of Maiden Lane III securities, plans to use that money to continue buying back some of the government's stake.
The government's ties now lie principally in the Treasury Department's holdings of A.I.G. shares, which the Obama administration has whittled to its current level, down from 92 percent, through a series of stock sales. The holdings, too, could prove profitable. The stock is currently trading at about $34, ahead of the government's break-even price of $29.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Ice Center With 9 Rinks Is Proposed for Bronx Armory

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
The long-empty Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx would be converted into a national ice center with nine ice rinks and extensive youth hockey and skating programs under a proposal that a group of Bronx elected officials and labor leaders endorsed on Thursday.
Led by the borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., the group rallied behind the ice center, which they estimated would cost $275 million. They called it the best of six proposals that had been submitted to the city for the redevelopment of the armory, a cavernous fortress that looms over a borough troubled by poverty and unemployment. 
The New York City Economic Development Corporation, which is reviewing the proposals, is expected to select a winner by the end of the year. A competing proposal that has received local support calls for creating a $100-million development styled like the Chelsea Market, with weekend stalls for artists and entrepreneurs to sell goods, as well as a six-screen theater and a rock-climbing wall.
Mr. Diaz said a crucial reason for his support for the ice center was that the developer had voluntarily pledged that every job created by the project would pay at least $10 an hour with benefits, or $11.50 an hour without benefits, in line with wage standards set by the city's recently passed ''living wage'' legislation. The development group estimated the center would create about 200 permanent and 1,800 temporary construction positions.
''This development will allow our borough to realize the potential of the Kingsbridge Armory and to do so in a way that will offer the people of the Bronx a chance to earn a decent living,'' Mr. Diaz said at a news conference in front of the armory, flanked by Mark Messier, the former New York Rangers star, and the Olympic gold-medal figure skater Sarah Hughes, who are members of the development group making the ice center proposal.
In 2009, Mr. Diaz and other Bronx officials blocked a proposal to build a shopping mall at the armory, in part because the developer, the Related Companies, balked at their demands that mall workers be paid a living wage, and in part over concerns that it would compete with local stores.
The collapse of that proposal soured Mr. Diaz's relationship with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and helped set off a citywide campaign for living-wage legislation that was adopted by the City Council this spring over the mayor's veto.
Youngwoo & Associates, the developer for the marketplace proposal, released a statement that said it was ''very surprised and obviously disappointed'' by Mr. Diaz's endorsement of the ice center. The Youngwoo & Associates proposal, which it estimated would create 800 permanent and 700 construction jobs, called for at least as many jobs paying a living wage as the ice center, the developer said.
The ice center proposal comes as the Bronx's first public skating rink will open this fall in Van Cortlandt Park. Several Bronx residents walking by the armory on Thursday said that they did not see a need for more ice rinks.
Rafael Rodriguez, 18, said that while he enjoyed ice skating, the community would benefit more from having a mixed-use sports complex that also included basketball courts and tennis courts. ''It's too limited,'' he said. ''You really don't need that many ice rinks.''

Museums
â[#x2dc]... American Folk Art Museum: 'Jubilation | Rumination: Life, Real and Imagined' (through Sept. 2) Having escaped the ugly, West 53rd Street tomb of a building it inhabited from 2001 to 2011, the American Folk Art Museum has reoccupied its old space on Lincoln Square. This wonderful show of about 100 works from the permanent collection samples all the varieties of artistic expression under the museum's purview, from portraits and quilts by anonymous craftspeople to otherworldly fantasies envisioned by so-called Outsiders like Henry Darger and Martin RamÃrez. The revival of this irreplaceable institution is cause for rejoicing. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue, at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
â[#x2dc]... Guggenheim Museum: 'Art of Another Kind: International Abstraction and the Guggenheim, 1949-1960' (through Sept. 12) The excellent collection show ''Art of Another Kind'' finds the Guggenheim tunneling back in time to the 1950s. It's a great-looking period piece, with confident, dynamic examples of postwar abstraction (many by lesser-known artists) that look very much at home in architecture of the same vintage. But it's also living history. The 1950s was the time of the rise of a global avant-garde and the resurgence of abstract painting, two phenomena that define the art world of right this minute. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
â[#x2dc]... Guggenheim Museum: 'Rineke Dijkstra: A Retrospective' (through Oct. 8) More mid-career survey than retrospective, a selection of some 70 large color photographs and five videos reflect this 53-year-old Dutch artist's faith in the power of two things: youth and the camera. Her ability to coax out the emotional subtleties and raw energy that are special to children, adolescents and young adults, with grave, revelatory and sometimes ecstatic results, is reflected in works that at their best effortlessly balance the formality of traditional portrait painting with the immediacy of real life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)
International Center of Photography: 'Christer StrÃ¶mholm: Les Amies de Place Blanche' (through Sept. 2) In Paris in the mid-1950s the Swedish photographer Christer Stromholm (1918--2002) gravitated to the red-light district around the Place Blanche, where he was drawn to a subculture of cross-dressing young men, many of whom worked as prostitutes to earn enough money for sex-change operations. He hung out with them for more than a decade and photographed them on the street at night and in bars and hotel rooms with a coolly affectionate eye. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
â[#x2dc]... International Center of Photography: 'Weegee: Murder Is My Business' (through Sept. 2) From the home of Weegee's voluminous archive, the latest exhibition about this great documentary photographer (1899-1968) revisits his frenetic, formative first decade of work, starting in 1935, when his often sensational images of murder and mayhem appeared in New York's daily newspapers. His penchant for self-promotion, the work of his competitors and peers, the evolution of tabloid journalism and the great city that was both his subject and his audience are emphasized, with fresh curatorial precision and deftly used touch screens. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith)
Jewish Museum: 'Ã[0/00]douard Vuillard: A Painter and His Muses, 1890-1940' (through Sept. 23) In the 1890s, Vuillard made some of the most beguiling paintings of fin de siÃ¨cle Paris: intimate, compact, brushy pictures of his mother and sister in the apartment he shared with them and the dressmaking shop they worked in. Then he reverted to a more traditionally realistic style and produced many portraits of his wealthy friends and benefactors until he died in 1940. This incisive show, sampling works from his more than four-decade career, invites reassessment of the later, heretofore less appreciated paintings. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Bellini, Titian, and Lotto: North Italian Paintings From the Accademia Carrara, Bergamo' (through Sept. 3) The title of this selection of 15 paintings on loan from an Italian museum is misleading: only one of the paintings is a Bellini -- a pieta -- and the attribution to a young Titian of a weird small landscape illustrating the story of Orpheus and Eurydice remains uncertain. What is interesting over all is the trend from Christian metaphysics to empirical realism, from Vincenzo Foppa's nearly surrealistic Crucifixion scene from the mid-15th century to Giovanni Battista Moroni's amazingly sensitive, almost photographic portrait of a little girl from 1570. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
â[#x2dc]... Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Ellsworth Kelly Plant Drawings' (through Sept. 3) This is the first museum show to focus on Ellsworth Kelly's plant drawings, which he has called ''a kind of bridge to a way of seeing that was the basis of the very first abstract paintings.'' These works are, for the most part, contour drawings of leaves, stems and flowers done in clean strokes of pencil or pen and centered on the page. They reveal an almost mystical appreciation of abstraction in the natural world, one shared by other American artists like Georgia O'Keeffe and Charles Burchfield. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
â[#x2dc]... Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Naked Before the Camera' (through Sept. 9) This resonant, illuminating if sometimes fraught exhibition traces the progress of the naked, mostly female body through photography from its early years nearly to the present with some 90 images, all owned by the Met. In works variously artistic, erotic, scientific, ethnographic, forensic and experimental, we see a medium stretched by human use and imagination. The male gaze is often relentless, but as time passes, individual faces, personalities and relationships come into focus on all sides; consciousness rises and oppressiveness decreases, which is a relief. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
â[#x2dc]... Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'TomÃ¡s Saraceno on the Roof: Cloud City' (through Nov. 4) This climbable 28-foot-high aggregate of 16 interconnected polyhedrons made of reflective steel and clear plexiglass creates a kind of Piranesian, walk-in Cubism that is briefly disorienting, but ultimately decorative. The none-too-high standards of participatory fun-house formalism are met; those of conventional plop art are barely exceeded. In the fusion of architecture, art and science, art is the loser, but the views of Central Park's ocean of greenness thrill, providing an immense and calming relief to the work's forced and busy artifice.

â[#x2dc]... Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Gardens: Pavilions, Studios, Retreats' (through Jan. 6) To anyone strolling through the Chinese painting galleries at the Met this summer, the whole world will look like a garden of infinite expansion. That's the impression given by the 80 paintings and objects that make up this fragrant exhibition, drawn entirely from the museum's deep holdings, about paradises lost and found; about nature blooming and fading; about cosmological events transpiring in backyard bamboo groves. Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
â[#x2dc]... Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'DÃ¼rer and Beyond: Central European Drawings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1400 -- 1700' (through Sept. 3) How do we get beyond Albrecht DÃ¼rer (1471-1528), the ne plus ultra draftsman and all-around Northern Renaissance master, an artist so secure in his greatness that he painted himself as Jesus? We don't, at least not often in this show, which surveys the Met's holdings of drawings made before 1700 by artists working in the Holy Roman Empire. But the offerings should nevertheless entice viewers to look more closely at the art of Central Europe, which absorbed diverse religious and stylistic influences from Italian, Dutch and Flemish art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
MoMA PS1: 'Lara Favaretto: Just Knocked Out' (through Sept. 10) Ms. Favaretto lives in Turin and has been included in the 53rd Venice Biennale and in this summer's Documenta 13. This show of sculptures and installations from the past 15 years reveals her trying with uneven success to rejuvenate the once-fertile acreage of international Conceptualism and Postminimalist formalism and, closer to home, that of Italian Arte Povera. Her work is smart, sometimes funny but emotionally stifled and calculated to the point of lifelessness. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
â[#x2dc]... Morgan Library & Museum: 'Renaissance Venice: Drawings From the Morgan' (through Sept. 23) As in Venice, getting lost is inevitable in this show of Venetian works from the Morgan's sizable Italian drawings collection. All roads lead to Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese, but detours to lesser-known figures (like Palma Giovane and Giulio Campagnola) are to be expected. Along with drawings, the show includes rare maps and books that reflect Venice's status as Europe's printing and shipping capital. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
â[#x2dc]... Morgan Library & Museum: 'Josef Albers in America: Painting on Paper' (through Oct. 14) Yoga was probably far from Josef Albers's mind when he was working on the series of color-saturated paintings he called ''Homage to the Square.'' But deep meditation, in the form of hard work, was built into the project, which went on for a quarter century. And the bliss of hard work is the subject of this beautiful show about an artist's hands-on research and learning-as-you go experimentation. Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
â[#x2dc]... Museum of Biblical Arts: 'The Adoration of the Magi by Bartolo di Fredi: A Masterpiece Reconstructed' (through Sept. 9) An astonishing 14th-century Italian painting has, if by miracle, left its home in Siena for the first time and landed at the Museum of Biblical Art in Manhattan as the main attraction of this tiny, perfect exhibition, where it is reunited with two other small paintings. All three were once part of a large multi-panel altarpiece, of which the show has three other exquisite examples. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500, mobia.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Alighiero Boetti: Game Plan' (through Oct. 1) The Italian artist Alighiero Boetti (1940-1994) was associated with the sculptural movement known as Arte Povera, but soon went his own political-mystical, time-obsessed way. An early Conceptualist, a precursor of today's global-minded nomad-artist, and a practitioner of relational aesthetics before the fact, he made art from cake doilies and cement and opened an artists' hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, where he also commissioned local women to weave brilliantly colored, no-two-alike tapestries depicting maps of the changing world. This magical retrospective stretches from MoMA's sixth floor, to its atrium, and into its Sculpture Garden. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
â[#x2dc]... Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born ''of'' or ''out of'' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
â[#x2dc]... Museum of Modern Art: 'Quay Brothers: On Deciphering the Pharmacist's Prescription for Lip-Reading Puppets' (through Jan. 7) The first major museum retrospective devoted to the strange puppet-haunted universe unleashed in the Quay Brothers' stop-action film animations includes their magical miniature stage sets, a sizable sampling of drawings, prints, collages and early illustration designs as well as works by artists who influenced them. More than 30 years of animated and live-action shorts, television commercials, music videos and imaginative documentaries in particular allow devotees and neophytes alike to grasp the essence of Timothy and Stephen Quay's achievement and its evolution, strengths and weaknesses all. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Century of the Child: Growing by Design, 1900 -- 2000' (through Nov. 5) This big, wonderful show at the Museum of Modern Art examines the intersection of modern design and modern thinking about children. A richly thought-provoking study of a great subject, it is loaded with intriguing things to look at -- some 500 items, including furniture, toys, games, posters, books and much more. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of the City of New York: 'London Street Photography' (through Dec. 2) Arriving from the Museum of London, which presented it in 2010 and owns the more than 150 works on view, this exhibition affords those of us watching the Olympics on TV a glimpse of an older, more eccentric city. It covers the Victorian era to the present, and is particularly rich in images from the mid-20th century. A smaller companion exhibition, ''City Scenes: Highlights of New York Street Photography,'' provides an opportunity to compare and contrast two very different modern cities as they grappled with war, the postindustrial era and various forms of social tension. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)
New Museum: 'The Parade: Nathalie Djurberg with Music by Hans Berg' (through Sept. 2) Working with colored clay and all kinds of other sculptural materials, Ms. Djurberg confects short, stop-action movies involving sexual weirdness and grotesque violence. They are funny and disturbing. The 80 bird sculptures made of fabric, paint and other materials filling the gallery's floor space add more color than substance. 231 Bowery, (212) 219-1222, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
â[#x2dc]... New Museum: 'Ghosts in the Machine (through Sept. 30) This ambitious, multitasking if over-thought exhibition delves into our relationship with machines through eclectic groupings of often unfamiliar art, quasi-art and non-art from the last half-century or so. Op Art, Kinetic Art and computer-made films and drawings are revisited as are the efforts of machine-obsessed outsider artists. Fascinating environmental works by Stan VanDerBeek, Richard Hamilton and Gianni Colombo are resurrected. Some things are merely period pieces, but generally the theme-show format takes on a new sense of poetry, psychological depth and history. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
â[#x2dc]... Queens Museum of Art: 'Her Stories: Fifteen Years of the South Asian Women's Creative Collective' (through Oct. 7) The South Asian Women's Creative Collective was founded by the artist Jaishri Abichandani in New York City in 1997, when identity politics had been in the air for a while, but artists from much of the Asian diaspora were still being given the cold shoulder by the mainstream art world. By providing strength-in-numbers support and access to resources, the collective helped move a generation of artists ahead, as this tightly packed power generator of an anniversary survey demonstrates. Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Rubin Museum of Art: 'Modernist Art From India: Approaching Abstraction' (through Oct. 16) This show, the second in a series of three more or less consecutive exhibitions on Indian modernism of the postcolonial period, finds Indian painters gradually and selectively moving away from the figure -- both on canvas and, sometimes, in experiments with film. ''Abstraction,'' here, isn't always formal; it can mean breaking with narrative, as in Tyeb Mehta's film ''Koodal,'' which combines images of cows headed for slaughter, crowds massing at Gandhi's funeral, and the gyrations of a self-flagellating dancer. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Rosenberg)
â[#x2dc]... South Street Seaport Museum: 'Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions' (through Oct. 7) The American Folk Art Museum presents some 200 works from its unparalleled collection in this beautifully orchestrated exhibition. Paintings, sculpture, textiles, scrimshaw, painted furniture and much, much more are arrayed along themes that reflect the history of Lower Manhattan -- seafaring, commerce, social life and that all-important factor, the weather -- but not too tightly. Poetic license is taken, yielding an intricate constellation of connected artworks, histories and concerns that highlights one of the city's great treasures. 12 Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8600, southstreetseaportmuseum.org. (Smith)
â[#x2dc]... Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Caribbean: Crossroads of the World' (through Oct. 21) In size, cultural scope and freshness of material, the three-museum exhibition ''Caribbean: Crossroads of the World'' is the big art event of the summer season in New York City, itself one of the largest Caribbean cities in the world. Be warned: the thematically arranged show throws you into history at the deep end. Almost all the information is strictly visual; there are very few explanatory labels anywhere. But the visuals are so rich, and interact so provocatively, that you may well be inspired to go out and do some homework and come back for a second look. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. Also on display: through Jan. 6 at El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; and through Jan. 6 at Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
â[#x2dc]... Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Primary Sources: Artists in Residence 2011-2012' (through Oct. 21) The accent is on Africa in the Studio Museum's latest artist-in-residence showcase. Two of the three participants were born there -- Njideka Akunyili in Nigeria in 1983, Meleko Mokgosi in Botswana in 1981 -- and their experience of it is a wellspring for very different and accomplished kinds of painting. The show's third artist, Xaviera Simmons, born in New York City in 1974, plays audacious photographic games with the African in African-American, and proves herself once again, as she has in the past, a thinker's artist. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
â[#x2dc]... Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Sharon Hayes: There's so much I want to say to you' (through Sept. 9) In her performances and sound installations, Sharon Hayes -- the subject of this mid-career Whitney solo -- mashes up soapbox rants and romantic monologues, diatribes and cris de coeur, all delivered in her own bell-clear, strident voice. That voice, and the sophisticated rhetorical ear that supplies it with material, are Ms. Hayes's strongest assets. When she uses them, she is entrancing and original. But when she veers into conceptual photography and installation -- a grid of fliers tacked to the wall, for instance -- she is at risk of losing her audience. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)
â[#x2dc]... Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Yayoi Kusama: Fireflies on the Water' (through Oct. 28) Although it was during a decade-plus stay in the United States in the 1960s that the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, now 83, produced her best-known work -- eyelet-patterned abstract paintings, furniture bristling with soft-sculpture phalluses, and polka-dot designs suitable to any and every surface -- some of her most complex and personal art appeared before she left Japan and immediately after she returned there permanently in the early 1970s. The Whitney gives a synoptic, transcultural look at her career in a retrospective that originated at the Tate Modern in London. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
â[#x2dc]... Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Oskar Fischinger: Space Light Art -- A Film Environment' (through Oct. 28) Projected on three adjoining screens, ''Light Space Art'' floods your retinas with intensely colorful, pulsating circles, flowing lines and blinking rectangles. A found film clip shows a spinning globe and the momentary, cartoon apparition of a young girl in a hooded, fur-trimmed coat. Oskar Fischinger created the original film footage in Weimar-era Germany. Newly restored and digitized, it still generates an exhilarating phantasmagoria of abstraction and metaphor. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Johnson)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Signs & Symbols' (through Oct. 28) In the 1950s, Americans were running out of ways to keep their works new and responsive to a world shaken to the core by World War II. For some the solution was passive-aggressive withdrawal into archaic myth, oracular symbolism and private language. Sampling this trend with works from the Whitney's permanent collection, this show presents lugubriously portentous paintings by hall of famers like Rothko and Pollock and by many journeyman players like Mark Tobey and Forrest Bess. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Johnson)
Galleries: Uptown
Frank Stella: 'New Work' (through Sept. 27) Around 50 years ago, this erstwhile Minimalist changed the history of art, but kept on moving, to the dismay of many. Whatever you think of his latest polychrome reliefs -- which seem overly refined and a bit mechanical -- they continue a line of reasoning that began with his influential stripe paintings, bespeak a fervent faith in abstraction as a vibrant life force and suggest that the main basis for artistic development lies in the evolution of some kind of form. FreedmanArt, 25 East 73rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 249-2040, freedmanart.com. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
Alex Gingrow: 'All the money IS in the label' (through Sept. 1) With deadpan wit, Ms. Gingrow nips the hands that feed her. Each of her paintings copies a different provenance label from familiar Chelsea dealers. All identify Ms. Gingrow herself as the artist. The twist comes in the improbable titles, many of which seem to be quoting inane, gossipy conversations overheard at exhibition openings. One referring to a well-known dealer and his successful artist reads, ''Betcha Zach Pays Dana on Time.'' Mike Weiss, 520 West 24th Street, (212) 691-6899, mikeweissgallery.com. (Johnson)
Julika Rudelius: 'Rituals of Capitalism' (through Sept. 8) Julika Rudelius shows young adults in moments of self-consciousness and vulnerability that are less personal than they are symptomatic of larger cultural growing pains. Her latest solo show centers on ''Rituals'' (2012), a beguiling but intermittently troubling video shot in Guangzhou, China. In it pixieish young men preen for the camera in the middle of bustling streets and loll around on rolls of fabric in busy market stalls. Sex and commerce intertwine in ways that are sometimes familiar to Western viewers and sometimes totally alien. Leo Koenig, 541 and 545 West 23rd Street, (212) 334-9255, leokoenig.com. (Rosenberg)
Galleries: Other
'Graphic Design -- Now in Production' (through Sept. 3) This exhibition of posters, books, magazines, typography, branding, and film and television graphics created since 2000, and organized by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, vacillates between design made for industry and design that critiques it. The catalog was inspired by ''The Last Whole Earth Catalog'' and includes essays riffing on Walter Benjamin and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's post-Marxist anti-globalization epic, ''Empire'' (2000). Avant-garde practices inform posters by the Amsterdam design firm Experimental Jetset, David Pearson and Angus Hyland's book designs, and a series of eco-conscious Green Patriot Posters that dovetail with the concerns of the Occupy movement -- which, oddly, has barely tapped the radical power of graphic design. Building 110 on Governors Island, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Martha Schwendener)
'Inside the Banana' (through Sept. 22) The meaning of this curiously diverse group show's title is anyone's guess, but the exhibition's most attention-grabbing thing is a different species of fruit: a giant bunch of green grapes hanging from the ceiling. Conceived by Adriana Lara, it is made of inflated balloons attached to a found tree branch. Also, Tabor Robak's five-minute video ''Vatican Vibes,'' a sci-fi joy ride resembling an elaborate commercial for a video game revolving around mysteries of the Roman Catholic Church, is a knockout. Algus Greenspon, 71 Morton Street, (212) 255-7872, algusgreenspon.com. (Johnson)
'Monet's Garden' (through Oct. 21) From 1883 to the end of his life in 1926, Claude Monet presided over his estate in Giverny, working at flower gardening with as much industry and creativity as he did on his paintings. The main attraction here is a living abbreviated approximation of the two major gardens that he designed and planted: one in traditional, orderly French style, the other a Japanese-inspired fantasia of water, blooming water lilies and weeping willows. It is far from the real thing, but there are moments of astounding beauty. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway (Exit 7W) and Fordham Road, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700, nybg.org. (Johnson)
'The Murder of Crows' (through Sept. 9) With its violent dream sequences, dark symbolism and references to fascism, this 29-minute sound installation from 2008 explores the nightmarish repercussions of Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller's spatial-aural illusionism. Visitors hear the chanting of Tibetan nuns, an aria, a lullaby and a Russian war anthem commissioned by Stalin, as well as Ms. Cardiff's murmuring voice (which emanates from a gramophone). Though the piece has an excellent setting in the armory's enormous darkened Drill Hall, it's not quite the ''requiem for our age'' that the artists envisioned. Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 616-3930, armoryonpark.org. (Rosenberg)
â[#x2dc]... Bruce Nauman: 'One Hundred Fish Fountain' (through next Friday) The single room-filling work here is an actual working fountain. Bronze casts of real fish -- catfish, bass, whitefish and other species -- are suspended by wires from the ceiling at different heights. Each is a hollow container from which water spurts in slender streams through multiple little perforations, falling like rain into a broad, shallow basin below. Gagosian, 980 Madison Avenue, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com. (Johnson)
â[#x2dc]... 'A Poet's Circle' and 'Bettissima: Treasures From the Elizabeth Kray Archive' (through Oct. 9) Poets House, a quarter-century old this year, is celebrating with small shows dedicated to its founders, the poet Stanley Kunitz (1905-2006) and the arts administrator Elizabeth Kray (1916-87). Many of Mr. Kunitz's friends were artists, and his exhibition, organized by Jason Andrew, consists of work by several of them, including Jack Tworkov, Saul Steinberg and Philip Guston, who works Kunitz words into his art. Poets House, 10 River Terrace, at Murray Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 431-7920, poetshouse.org. (Cotter)
Les Rogers: 'Summer Swells' (through Sept. 2) The stylistic promiscuity and subtle self-mockery characteristic of this painter become more substantial when deployed on small wood panels, the outer borders of which have been stained to resemble frames. The all-in-one economy, radiant colors, vivacious brushwork and assured self-consciousness result in works that insouciantly run the gamut from ersatz thrift-store art to painters' painting to postmodern facsimile, and back. Half Gallery, 208 Forsyth Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, halfgallery.com. (Smith)
â[#x2dc]... Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
Public Art
'Common Ground' (through Nov. 30) Located on a site known in the 17th century as the Commons -- which also served as the site of Bloombergville, the precursor to Occupy Wall Street one year ago -- this show offers some incendiary critiques. Ian Hamilton Finlay's group of stone slabs arranged on a patch of grass includes inscriptions from the writings of Louis de Saint-Just (1767-94), a French Revolutionary leader. Paul McCarthy's ''Daddies Ketchup'' (2001), a huge inflatable bottle of ketchup makes a Neo-Pop-psychoanalytic connection between patriarchy and power, and Elmgreen & Dragset's aluminum bullhorn housed in a slick, industrial vitrine evokes protesters in Zuccotti Park, who were forbidden from using any amplification devices, developed a signature form of analogue augmentation, the ''people's microphone.'' City Hall Park, Public Art Fund, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Out of Town
'Anti-Establishment' (through Dec. 21) Contrary to this muddled exhibition's title, the artists it presents are not uncompromising rebels. The show's curator, Johanna Burton, avers that they imagine ''novel collective relationships and emergent models of engaged citizenship,'' but much of the work is more self-reflexively preoccupied with art than with worldly affairs. Best of all is a room full of Abstract Expressionist-style paintings made with Day-Glo paints by Jacqueline Humphries displayed under ultra violet light. It is a lushly visual trip. Hessel Museum of Art, Bard College Center for Curatorial Studies, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
Bowdoin College Museum of Art: William Wegman: 'Hello Nature' (through Oct. 21) As its title implies, this beguiling show surveys the erstwhile Conceptual pioneer's lifelong attachment to nature, especially as evidenced in his characteristically witty, offhand works of the past two decades. Included are drawings, collages, photographs and altered photographs, as well as photographs and a 25-minute movie featuring his signature, endlessly cooperative Weimaraners. Also on hand are numerous examples of his efforts in painting, which he took up again in 1985, made with and without postcards. Bowdoin College Museum of Art, 9400 College Station, Brunswick, Me., (207) 725-3275, bowdoin.edu/art-museum. (Smith)
'Creature From the Blue Lagoon' (through Sept. 3) The campy-but-relaxed vibe of the Martos Gallery's annual summer group show, now in its third edition, hasn't changed much from one summer to the next. Nor has the artist list, which includes Davina Semo, Darren Bader, Virginia Overton and Ryan Foerster among the repeat participants. But this version (organized, as in previous years, by the independent curator and critic Bob Nickas) is the most ambitious, with large-scale installations in the attic and pool house joining the usual smattering of smaller, site-specific works. Martos Gallery Summer Location, 112 Sagaponack Road, Bridgehampton, N.Y., (631) 613-6698, martosgallery.com. (Rosenberg)
'From 199A to 199B: Liam Gillick' (through Dec. 21) Mr. Gillick is a nearly ubiquitous figure on the international art scene as a conceptual artist, speaker, writer and collaborator with other luminaries like Rirkrit Tiravanija and Pierre Huyghe. He designs shiny, quasi-architectural sculptures for sale in commercial galleries, but here the focus is on politically motivated conceptual projects from the 1990s. If sociology and ideology are your things, this show is for you. Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
Mike Kelley: '1954 -- 2012' (through Sept. 16) During the last decade of his life, Mike Kelley was working on an ambitious project revolving around Kandor, a city on Krypton that was miniaturized and bottled by the evil Brainiac and recovered by Superman, who kept it in his Fortress of Solitude. This illuminating exhibition includes videos and sculptures from that series as well as a selection of exuberantly anarchic videos that Mr. Kelley made early in his career in collaboration with Paul McCarthy, Tony Oursler and other artists. Watermill Center, 39 Watermill Towd Road, Water Mill, N.Y., (631) 726-4628, watermillcenter.org. (Johnson)
National Gallery of Art: 'Elegance and Refinement: The Still-Life Paintings of Willem van Aelst' (through Oct. 14) Still-life painting bloomed like never before in the Netherlands in the 17th century, and among its most coveted blossoms were those of Willem van Aelst (1627-83), the subject of this small, intense exhibition of 28 paintings. Van Aelst painted the sorts of objects customary among his fellow still-life producers -- flowers in ornate, precious vases; ripe fruit; dead game animals; and hunting gear -- achieving at best a nearly hallucinatory realism. Constitution Avenue NW, between Third and Ninth Streets, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)
Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Gauguin, CÃ©zanne, Matisse: Visions of Arcadia' (through Sept. 3) At the center of this otherwise disappointing exhibition a lively conversation about pastoral bliss is going on between three major works by the titular artists: Gauguin's ''Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?''; CÃ©zanne's ''Large Bathers''; and Matisse's ''Bathers by a River.'' Henri Rousseau's ''Dream'' has a say, too. But the show as a whole is a qualitatively mixed bag of 60 works by 25 artists, including Poussin, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, AndrÃ© Derain and some second and third rank Pointillists. Benjamin Franklin Parkway at 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Johnson)
Last Chance
'DÃ©tournement: Signs of the Times' (closes on Saturday) Organized by the critic and curator Carlo McCormick, this invigorating show presents satirical signs by about 20 artists. Fictional grocery store posters by Ron English offer products like ''Dead Fish'' and ''Human Flesh.'' Billboards by Mike Osterhout proclaim ''God Loves Dykes'' and ''God Loves Fags.'' An artist identified as Posterboy combines the Facebook logo -- the lowercase ''f'' in a blue square -- with an apparently real surveillance camera; it is aptly titled ''Self Snitch.'' Jonathan LeVine, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-3822, jonathanlevinegallery.com. (Johnson)
'Idea Is the Object' (closes on Friday) Taking its title from the 17th-century empiricist philosopher John Locke, this exhibition of reality-based work by 14 artists from the United States and Europe veers between routine and impressive, and centers on various forms of recycling or deconstruction involving existing images, objects, material or situations. The selection is bracketed by two outstanding videos, Candice Breitz's inspiring ''Factum Tremblay,'' which centers on two lesbians who are also identical twins, and Guy Ben-Ner's wry ''Stealing Beauty,'' which restages family life among the furniture displays of a functioning Ikea. D'Amelio Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-0325, dameliogallery.com. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Spies in the House of Art: Photography, Film, and Video' (closes on Sunday) This exhibition of 17 contemporary works inspired by museums doesn't mention Theodor Adorno by name, but it nods toward his ideas in a wall text, which jokes that artists often see museums as ''mausoleums, places where art goes to die.'' Andrea Fraser's video ''Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk'' (1989) leans toward the anti-museum view, while a 16-millimeter film by Nashashibi/Skaer, the duo of British artists Rosalind Nashashibi and Lucy Skaer, made by gliding through the Met in the dark with a camera and a flash strobe, treats the museum like a darkened crypt. Lutz Bacher's video offers another museum tour, while the museum appears in poetically distorted form in photographs by John Pilson, Tim Davis and Lothar Baumgarten. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
â[#x2dc]... Museum of Modern Art: 'Ecstatic Alphabets/Heaps of Language' (closes on Monday) In a drawing from 1966, ''Heaps of Language,'' Robert Smithson assembled a pyramid of words about words: ''Language'' at the apex, supported by ''phraseology speech,'' ''tongue lingo vernacular'' and on down through a base of synonyms. This playful exhibition borrows Smithson's title and runs wild with his vision of words as materials.

Neue Galerie: 'Gustav Klimt: 150th Anniversary Celebration' (closes on Monday) Full-orchestra salutes to Klimt's birthday -- he was born in Vienna in 1862 -- are happening in Europe, but with seven paintings, 40 drawings, a couple of posters and some photographs, this New York tribute is on a chamber-music scale. All the work is from the Neue Galerie collection, and inevitably Klimt's portrait of the young society matron Adele Bloch-Bauer, with her droopy eyes, lavender skin, and body all but engulfed in gold, is the centerpiece. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org.

Neue Galerie: 'Henrich Kuehn and His American Circle: Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen' (closes on Monday) Despite its title and the fraternal bonding on display in a pair of pictures from a 1907 meeting of the three photographers, this survey doesn't quite put Kuehn on a level with Steichen and Stieglitz. Kuehn's ambitions were regional in scope, his contributions to the field more technical than artistic. He held fast to fin de siÃ¨cle Pictorialism and the idyllic Tyrolean landscape long after many of his peers had moved on to urbane modernism. But within the tightly drawn parameters of this exhibition (roughly 1900-20), Kuehn is a curious and deeply counterintuitive figure, a photographer who felt threatened by the snapshot aesthetic. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org.

'Terracotta Warriors: Defenders of China's First Emperor' (closes on Sunday) Since being exhumed from an imperial cemetery in the 1970s, China's terra-cotta army has been on a global Long March, moving from one sellout museum appearance to the next and serving as emblems of China's neo-imperial clout in the here and now. That army, or a small piece of it, has arrived in New York City. Only 9 of an estimated 8,000 soldiers made the trip. But they're in great shape and, fitted out with weapons, armor, cash and a portable kitchen, they're a sight to see. Discovery Times Square, 226 West 44th Street, (866) 987-9692, discoverytsx.com.

HEADLINE: Export Powerhouse Feels Pangs of Labor Strife

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
ISHWARDI, Bangladesh -- The air thickened with tear gas as police and paramilitary officers jogged into the Ishwardi Export Processing Zone firing rubber bullets and swinging cane poles. Panicked factory workers tried to flee. A seamstress crumpled to the ground, knocked unconscious by a shot in the head.
Dozens of people were bloodied and hospitalized. The officers were cracking down on protests at two garment factories inside this industrial area in western Bangladesh. But they were also protecting two ingredients of a manufacturing formula that has quietly made Bangladesh a leading apparel exporter to the United States and Europe: cheap labor and foreign investment.
Both were at stake on that March morning. Workers earning as little as $50 a month, less than the cost of one of the knit sweaters they stitched for European stores, were furious over a cut in wages. Their anger was directed at the Hong Kong and Chinese bosses of the two factories, turning a labor dispute into something potentially much larger.
''If any foreigner got injured or killed, it would damage the country's image around the globe,'' said a police supervisor, Akbar Hossein, who participated in the crackdown. ''We all know the importance of these factories and this industry for Bangladesh.'' 
Bangladesh, once poor and irrelevant to the global economy, is now an export powerhouse, second only to China in global apparel exports, as factories churn out clothing for brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Gap, Calvin Klein and H&M. Global retailers like Target and Walmart now operate sourcing offices in Dhaka, the capital. Garments are critical to Bangladesh's economy, accounting for 80 percent of manufacturing exports and more than three million jobs.
But with ''Made in Bangladesh'' labels now commonplace in American stores, Bangladesh's manufacturing formula depends on its having the lowest labor costs in the world, with the minimum wage for garment workers set at roughly $37 a month. During the past two years, as workers have seen their meager earnings eroded by double-digit inflation, protests and violent clashes with the police have become increasingly common.
In response, Bangladeshi leaders have deployed the security tools of the state to keep factories humming. A high-level government committee monitors the garment sector and includes ranking officers from the military, the police and intelligence agencies. A new special police force patrols many industrial areas. Domestic intelligence agencies keep an eye on some labor organizers. One organizer who had been closely watched, Aminul Islam, was found tortured and killed in April in a case that is unsolved.
''The garment industry is No. 1 for exports and dollars for the country,'' said Alonzo Suson, who runs the Solidarity Center in Dhaka, an A.F.L.-C.I.O.-affiliated labor rights group. ''Any slowdown of that development is a national security issue.''
For the Obama administration, which has cultivated Bangladesh as a regional ally in southern Asia, labor unrest has become a matter of growing concern. In a May visit to Dhaka, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton raised labor issues and the Islam murder case. In June, Ambassador Dan W. Mozena warned Bangladeshi garment factory owners that any perception of a rollback on labor rights could scare off multinational brands and damage the garment industry. ''These developments could coalesce into a perfect storm that could threaten the Bangladesh brand in America,'' he said.
For global brands, which are forever chasing the cheapest labor costs from country to country, Bangladesh has been a hot spot, especially as wages have risen in China. McKinsey, the consulting giant, has called Bangladesh the ''next China'' and predicted that Bangladeshi garment exports, now about $18 billion a year, could triple by 2020.
But in late July, representatives from 12 major brands and retailers, alarmed by the rising labor unrest, prodded the Bangladeshi government to address wage demands, a suggestion rejected by the labor minister. ''No reason to be worried,'' Khandker Mosharraf Hossain, the minister, told reporters, noting that brands were not canceling orders.
Bangladesh was born in bloodshed during a 1971 war of independence from Pakistan and has since gyrated between military rule and fragile democracy. It has about 150 million people and is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Derided by Henry A. Kissinger as the world's ''basket case,'' Bangladesh has since made considerable progress on fronts like women's literacy, juvenile and maternal mortality, per capita income, and life expectancy.
This upward arc is often credited to Bangladesh's vibrant civil society, but the garment sector, in which about 80 percent of the workers are women, has also played a critical role, providing socially acceptable jobs to women in a conservative Muslim country. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in lobbying the United States for favorable trade preferences, has argued that such policies would improve the lives of millions of poor women.
Bangladesh's Home Ministry, in a written response to questions, said the government does not favor factory owners over workers but acts as a ''referee/umpire'' while maintaining an ''investment friendly'' environment for foreign and domestic investors.
Yet Ms. Hasina's government has resisted expanding labor rights in a country where the owners of about 5,000 garment factories wield enormous influence. Factory owners are major political donors and have moved into news media, buying newspapers and television stations. In Parliament, roughly two-thirds of the members belong to the country's three biggest business associations. At least 30 factory owners or their family members hold seats in Parliament, about 10 percent of the total.
''Politics and business is so enmeshed that one is kin to the other,'' said Iftekharuzzaman, director of Transparency International Bangladesh.''There is a coalition between the sector and people in positions of power. The negotiating position of the workers is very, very limited.''
A Country Within a Country
Mohammad Helal Uddin joined Rosita Knitwear in May 2010 and was thrilled to have the job. Rosita was inside the new Ishwardi Export Processing Zone, not far from his home village, meaning he could live with his wife and two young daughters and not have to toil in the fields. ''I feel I have a kind of dignity in this job,'' he said.
Mr. Uddin, 28, worked in the knitting department and after six months was promoted, with a base salary of $55 a month. He soon began to notice irregularities. Workers were not getting promised annual raises, monthly attendance bonuses or the 17 paid holidays a year, beyond their usual one day off a week. Employees also said they worked four hours of overtime a day but were paid for only two.
Three decades ago, Bangladesh created a network of export zones to attract foreign investment with tax incentives and other benefits. Today, a large majority of Bangladesh's garment factories lie outside these zones, but the zones are favored by foreign investors. Rosita and its sister factory, Megatex, both owned by the Hong Kong conglomerate South Ocean, were the first plants in the Ishwardi zone. Zones like Ishwardi operate like countries within a country. They are governed by a separate agency, the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority, and by separate laws. By tradition, the authority has been run by a military officer, active duty or retired, and many factories have hired retired soldiers to oversee security.
For workers, wages were higher in the zones and conditions were better. But unions were initially banned, and workers had no right to organize until 2004 when Parliament, facing international pressure, approved worker associations at individual factories.
At the Rosita factory, workers elected a 15-member association last December, with Mr. Uddin as president. In January, a female employee complained that a Bangladeshi middle manager was pressuring her to have sex with one of the Chinese bosses. Enraged, workers demanded that the management address her complaint as well as the discrepancies over annual raises and earned leave. Six weeks of confrontation and chaos followed. In February, equipment in the Rosita factory was damaged during a rampage. Nearly 300 workers were accused of vandalism and fired, with their names posted on a blacklist at the gate of the Ishwardi zone. Mr. Uddin, who denied any wrongdoing, was fired and temporarily jailed.
When he tried to return to work on Feb. 20, Mr. Uddin said two black-clad officers hustled him into the tiny guardhouse. The officers were members of the Rapid Action Battalion, a government paramilitary force infamous for vigilante attacks known as ''cross fire'' killings. He said one of the officers ordered him to sign a resignation letter.
''I didn't do anything wrong,'' Mr. Uddin said he told them.
He said one of the officers pushed a gun against his shoulder. ''If you don't sign,'' the officer told him, according to Mr. Uddin, ''we will take you in the car and you will have to face the cross-fire.''
Mr. Uddin signed. Inside the factories, according to several workers, police and paramilitary officers walked through the workrooms, holding termination letters. The message was clear: work or leave.
By March, an American labor rights group, the Institute for Global Labor and Human Rights, was advocating for the workers. A South Ocean executive arrived at Ishwardi and promised to address worker complaints over wages and unpaid leave. Then on March 20, workers discovered that managers had cut the piece rate, a type of production bonus, meaning a loss of wages. Another standoff ensued as managers closed the factories. But when workers returned March 25, the wage cut had not been fully restored.
Hundreds of workers gathered outside the front door of the factory in an impromptu sit-down strike. Eight workers, interviewed in June, said all the managers had left the factories. A small contingent of police officers soon arrived and ordered everyone back to work. A seamstress said a police officer knocked her to the ground, beating her unconscious with a stick and shredding her clothes. ''I kept asking them to stop,'' said the seamstress, who asked not to be identified, fearing reprisals. ''But even after I fell to the ground, they kept beating me and pulled my hair.''
Workers began throwing stones and chanting slogans against the police, who fled. Hours later, after officials in Dhaka were notified, officers from the Rapid Action Battalion as well as surrounding police stations arrived. Officer Hossein, the police supervisor, denied that the police were aggressors, saying officers were told that foreign managers were trapped inside the factories and that angry workers were vandalizing equipment. ''They attacked the police,'' Officer Hossein said. ''They started the violence.''
Cellphone videos show police officers firing rubber bullets and pummeling workers with cane poles. ''They treated workers as if they were not human beings,'' one worker said.
The Power Equation
Bangladesh's two major political parties, the governing Awami League and the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, often seem engaged in a blood feud. Yet, many analysts say, the two parties agree on one thing: safeguarding the garment industry.
Three months after the clash at Ishwardi, tens of thousands of angry workers protested near Dhaka, demanding higher wages and crippling one of the country's most important industrial zones for more than a week. Riot police officers dispersed the protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets, as scores of people were injured.
Following huge protests in 2010, Ms. Hasina raised the minimum wage for garment workers to $37 a month from about $20. But her government has resisted the renewed worker demands, even as executives at some leading brands have voiced support for adjusting wages and expressed concerns about labor unrest.
In June, top executives at the Swedish retailer H&M fretted that recurring labor protests were disrupting production and called on Bangladeshi factories to rectify the situation.
Major brands have been stung by bad publicity. This year, War on Want, a nonprofit group, found that workers in five factories making products for Nike, Puma and Adidas were paid less than the minimum wage and complained of workplace abuse and sexual harassment. In March, the parent company of the Tommy Hilfiger brand, PVH Corp., hurriedly donated $1 million toward a factory safety initiative as ABC News was preparing to broadcast a report on a fire that killed 29 workers in a Bangladeshi factory making clothes for Tommy Hilfiger.
''They want to see better standards and conditions in factories in Bangladesh,'' said Julia K. Hughes, president of the United States Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel, a trade group in Washington. ''No company is arguing that wages should not rise in Bangladesh. They are not saying what the wage should be, but absolutely wages should go up.''
But many factory owners are skeptical that buyers are truly willing to pay higher prices. One owner, Shawkat Ali Bhuiyan, said he had stopped working with companies like Walmart and Target because his profit margin was almost nonexistent, while some Bangladeshi labor leaders blame the foreign brands for exploiting workers.
''We need to clean up the whole supply chain,'' said Roy Ramesh Chandra, a powerful public sector union leader. ''The brands need to fulfill their responsibility. The manufacturers need to fulfill their responsibility. And the government should comply with international obligations and respect international labor standards.''
Bangladesh has responded to international pressure in the past, sharply curtailing child labor and improving safety conditions in the 1990s. Now, though, the pressure points are the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain for wages, issues that require action by a political system dominated by business interests, including the garment sector.
A. K. Azad, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, played down the garment sector's political clout. ''We are not powerful,'' he said, adding: ''Power lies with the politicians. Power lies with the media.''
But many apparel tycoons have also gone into politics or begun media careers, purchasing newspapers or starting independent news channels. Mr. Azad, who owns one of the country's biggest garment factories, also owns a Bengali-language newspaper and a television station. Several Western diplomats privately noted that news coverage often emphasizes the disruptions caused by protests above the concerns of workers.
At the Rosita and Megatex factories, South Ocean management hired a labor oversight firm, Verité, which detailed a host of problems, including humiliation of workers, summary firings and deliberate interference with the ability of workers to organize. New management teams are now running the factories, and Verité is helping put in place changes to increase wages and protect worker rights. ''South Ocean have taken labor issues at the two factories extremely seriously and have taken swift actions to address those issues,'' the company's law firm, Winston & Strawn of Hong Kong, said in a statement.
Many of the workers involved in the March 25 clash are back on the job, despite their anger over how they have been treated. The seamstress who was knocked unconscious, her clothes shredded, said she had little choice, since she was the family's sole breadwinner. ''I am helpless,'' she said. ''We have to get food.''
South Ocean dropped charges against Mr. Uddin but the police are still pursuing separate charges. Meanwhile, officials at the export zone authority have blacklisted him from being hired at factories inside the zones. ''We spoke up,'' he said. ''And we became criminals in the eyes of all authorities.''

HEADLINE: Excitement Over Proposed Attraction on Staten Island

BYLINE: By VIVIAN YEE

 BODY:
They come by the thousands, crowding onto the Staten Island Ferry with their cameras, eager for the ferry's perfect views of New York Harbor, where the Statue of Liberty and Lower Manhattan gleam. But once on Staten Island, few make it out of the terminal, where a deck attached to the terminal offers a sweeping view of a parking lot caked with goose droppings, the small ballpark of the minor-league Staten Island Yankees and beyond, another parking lot.
All summer, however, the borough has been buzzing with reports that, if true, could finally propel Staten Island into the big leagues: the city is in talks with developers to build a half-million-square-foot outlet mall on one of the parking lots and a 600-foot-high observation wheel similar to the London Eye on the other. 
That would give Staten Island, New York's most overlooked borough, an improbable distinction: the world's tallest Ferris wheel. (Currently the tallest, at 541 feet, is in Singapore, though the London Eye, which is 443-feet tall, is probably the most famous.)
"We're all excited about the Ferris wheel," said Pat Wilks, the spokeswoman for the Staten Island borough president, James. P. Molinaro, when a reporter asked her about its possibility. Though a Ferris wheel is what people on Staten Island kept mentioning, wheels such as the London Eye and the proposed Staten Island wheel, which carry passengers in external cars or gondolas instead of suspended seats, are technically known as "observation wheels."
Neither Mr. Molinaro nor the city's Economic Development Corporation would confirm that the observation wheel and outlet mall projects had pulled ahead of other proposals for the site, which New York City has been trying to develop for several years. But a person familiar with the development project said that the city was in advanced discussions with a developer, Plaza Capital Group Management, to build the wheel. The project would be called the New York Wheel and would offer dining and event spaces, the person said.
Along the pleasant greenway that runs between the water and the parking lots, reactions to Staten Island's potential upgrade to Home of the World's Tallest Ferris Wheel ranged from the dubious to the delighted.
"We've got to start bringing things out here, put Staten Island on the map," said Tyrone Williams, 45, who was enjoying the breeze off the water on Wednesday. His friends who live elsewhere in the city agree to go to Staten Island only because he lives near the ferry terminal, he said. "It's the forgotten borough."
David Reading, 33, a fire alarm installation technician who has assignments in the borough a few times a month, said that growing up in New Jersey, "I always knew Staten Island was the dump." Told that the world's largest Ferris wheel might be coming, he laughed, and then conceded it might be a good idea.
Staten Island, it seems, is always having to justify its existence. A sign by the waterfront explains that it became a borough of New York City "despite geographically being much closer to New Jersey."
With its expansive views of Lower Manhattan and the harbor, the waterfront, known as the North Shore Greenway, is dotted with patches of flowers and birch trees. Residents and workers in the nearby neighborhood of St. George come to spend their lunch breaks lying on the wooden benches. But few tourists venture beyond the terminal deck.
"Tourists, we see them, but there's nothing for them," said Nicole Michelson, 36, who lives on the southern shore of the island and works in St. George. Without restaurants or attractions beyond the Sept. 11 memorial on the greenway and a small historical museum in St. George, Ms. Michelson said, there is no reason for them to stay.
A friend, Michelle Butindari, 35, said: "We see them walk in. Two seconds later they're walking out."
Besides, Ms. Michelson said, she wouldn't mind a few store outlets herself. "I might go broke at lunchtime," she said.
An outlet mall - there is no such thing in New York City, though there is a proposal for one in the Bronx - might even attract Manhattan and Brooklyn dwellers to Staten Island, albeit perhaps only a few yards beyond the terminal. But State Senator Diane J. Savino, a Democrat from Staten Island, disputed reports that the city was in serious talks with Plaza Capital Group Management about a Ferris wheel and BFC Partners, which proposed the mall, insisting that the city was only at the beginning of the process.
"The Economic Development Corporation seems to have gotten a response from two to three people who presented ideas for what would be a viable development there, including but not limited to a retail outlet mall," Ms. Savino said. "That's about as far as we've gotten."
Officials at BFC Partners and Plaza Capital did not return messages seeking comment.
Last August, the city put out a request for ideas to develop the two parking lots, which total more than 14 acres, a spokesman for the Economic Development Corporation said. Mr. Molinaro, the borough president, said he expected the city to announce a deal on the sites by the end of September.
The sooner, the better, say Staten Islanders who work and live nearby.
At the United Livery Cars stand near the parking lot that is being discussed for the outlet mall, Arnold O'Brien, 42, who has worked at the stand for more than two years, said he had already seen surveyors take measurements for a multilevel parking garage. He said tourists fresh off the ferry often stop to ask him what else they could see on Staten Island. He tells them not to waste their time.
"If you really want to see something, go back to Manhattan," Mr. O'Brien said he tells them.
The projects could help the area "get big, like Downtown Brooklyn," he said. "But it's got a lot of changing to do."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Improved 3.6% in July

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of new homes rose 3.6 percent in July to match a two-year high reached in May, the latest sign of a recovery in the housing market. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that sales of new homes reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 372,000.
The report is ''the latest in a series of data points suggesting a durable housing recovery is under way,'' Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at the brokerage firm BTIG, said in a note to clients.
In the last 12 months, sales of new homes have jumped 25 percent. Still, the increase is from a historically low level. Sales remain well below the annual pace of 700,000 that economists consider healthy.
The sluggish economy continues to weigh on the housing market, as unemployment remains high at 8.3 percent. On Thursday, the government reported a slight increase in the number of people applying for first-time unemployment benefits.
The housing market has still made a modest recovery in part because homes are more affordable. Mortgage rates have fallen to near-record lows. Housing prices are about a third lower than at the peak of the housing bubble in 2006. Those trends have helped lift sales of new and previously occupied homes.
Sales of previously occupied homes increased 2.3 percent in July from June, the National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday. Sales have jumped 10 percent in the last year.
The median price of a new home, however, slipped 2.1 percent in July from June.
Though new homes represent only a small portion of the housing market, they have a disproportionate impact on the economy. Each home built creates an average of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in tax revenue, according to statistics compiled by the National Association of Home Builders.
The housing market has a long way to go to reach full health. Some economists have forecast that sales of previously occupied homes will rise 8 percent this year to about 4.6 million. That would still be well below the 5.5 million annual sales pace that is considered healthy.
One trend restraining sales is that many people are still having difficulty qualifying for home loans. Banks have tightened credit standards for mortgages, according to a report by the Federal Reserve. Another factor holding back sales is that fewer new homes are available.
The Labor Department said that the number of people seeking first-time jobless benefits rose a slight 4,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 372,000, evidence that the recovery in the job market remained modest. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, increased 3,750 to 368,000, the Labor Department said.
With applications for jobless benefits rising for two weeks, some economists say that hiring in August might slow from the solid gain of 163,000 jobs in July.

HEADLINE: Somewhere Between

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
Shining a relentlessly rosy light on international adoption and the policies that enable it, ''Somewhere Between'' presents an effortlessly moving but superficial profile of four bright Chinese girls and their adoptive American families. 
Inspired by her own adoption of a Chinese infant, the director, Linda Goldstein Knowlton, chooses a soft-focus approach that never digs very deeply into each teenager's situation. All four appear to have loving surrogate families, but we barely hear from them, and their motives for the adoption remain veiled. Similarly, though China's one-child policy is blamed for the surge in availability of baby girls after 1979, the truth is more complicated and would have made for a more nuanced and enlightening narrative.
Instead the film relies on upbeat interviews with its articulate and impressively well-adjusted subjects, whose identification with their homeland varies according to personality and how they have been reared. Feelings of abandonment are discussed at length but not the grinding poverty and social pressures behind many a birthparent's painful decision. And in the rare instances when sharp edges do appear -- as when we briefly hear from a man representing an organization uneasy with transnational adoption -- the film slides past instead of grabbing on.
Nowhere is this flaw more obvious than in the emotional reunion of 13-year-old Haley and her extended birth family. ''Who actually abandoned her?'' Haley's adoptive mother asks, the question falling like a bomb in the crowded, happy gathering. In that moment our attention isn't on Haley but on the stricken face of her birth father, whose agonized eyes remind us to be grateful that we live in a country where fathering only girls typically does not spell economic ruin.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing in China Slows Further

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Chinese economy, it seems, is stuck in a nasty rut.
A closely watched barometer of China's economic performance -- a monthly survey that measures the conditions in the giant manufacturing sector -- slumped sharply in August, offering one of the earliest glimpses of how the month has been progressing. The prognosis, judging by a preliminary reading of the survey published Thursday, was poor.
The purchasing managers' index, released by HSBC, sagged to 47.8 from 49.3 in July, the lowest level since late last year. That dashed hopes that conditions in the sector would stabilize, or even edge up slightly, during August. Analysts described the reading as ''disappointing,'' ''alarming'' and ''just awful.'' A reading below 50 indicates contraction; above 50 indicates growth. 
''The unexpectedly big drop more than reversed the gain seen in July,'' Yao Wei, a China economist at Société Générale in Hong Kong, said in a research note. ''A drop of this magnitude and a level significantly below 50 unambiguously spells trouble.''
The Chinese economy has been languishing for months, its domestic performance undermined by weakness in the important property sector and its export sector hit by sagging demand from overseas.
Growth in the United States remains anemic, while the festering debt crisis in Europe has weighed heavily on a part of the world that is a key destination for Chinese goods. Data from Europe released Thursday underlined the retrenchment there: A business survey reinforced expectations that the euro zone was already in recession and that the economic powerhouse of Germany was less and less able to prop up the rest of the region.
The drawn-out woes have gradually rippled around the globe, undermining the growth momentum of once-buoyant economies like China. Exports have been slowing for months, and in July they edged up a mere 1 percent, official statistics this month showed.
And although the economy has by no means come to a complete standstill, slowing growth is showing through in the form of disappointing earnings.
On Thursday, Li Ning, one of China's best-known sportswear retailers, and Ajisen, a restaurant chain, reported steep slides in sales and earnings during the first half of this year. And in the financial sector, Bank of China reported net income for the April-June quarter of 34.8 billion renminbi, or $5.48 billion. Although that was a 5.3 percent increase from a year earlier, the pace of growth was the slowest since 2009.
At the same time, the waning momentum in China is eroding the country's ability to drive growth in the rest of the world.
Qantas, the Australian airline, canceled a major plane order Thursday after reporting a loss for the year that ended in June. Its chief executive, Alan Joyce, cited the ''uncertain global context'' for the decision not to go ahead with the purchase of 35 Boeing Dreamliner jets.
Similarly, slowing demand for raw materials from China prompted the Australian mining giant BHP Billiton to delay major investment projects on Wednesday.
''That's two Australian economic icons making retrenchments in the space of two days,'' said Glenn Maguire, senior economist at Asia Sentry Advisory, a research consulting firm in Sydney. ''The slowdown in China appears to be much broader and durable than people had expected even just a few weeks ago.''
What is more worrying, analysts said, is that the poor global backdrop heralds more pain to come for China, which despite its slowing growth remains a major growth engine for the global economy.
The slump in the purchasing managers' reading Thursday ''confirmed that China's slowdown has yet to abate, with a growing risk of further intensification,'' Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC, said in a research note.
New export orders, which are also captured in HSBC's survey, declined sharply, indicating that Chinese exports were likely to languish for some time. Moreover, Mr. Qu noted, domestic demand failed to show a meaningful improvement in August.
Analysts said the Chinese economy appeared to have largely shrugged off the mounting doses of economic medicine injected by the authorities.
Banks have been instructed to lend more since last year; infrastructure projects have been stepped up markedly; and the central bank lowered interest rates in June and July. The central bank has also been injecting more money into the interbank market in an effort to stimulate lending.
Many economists have been puzzled that the authorities have not stepped up their stimulus efforts more aggressively in recent weeks, as the extent of the slowdown has become more apparent.
Many expect the central bank soon to announce another cut in the so-called reserve requirement ratio for banks -- a step that would free up more money for them to lend -- while some expect a cut in interest rates.
''A lack of swiftness in policy response to China's fast deteriorating employment situation could cost the economy heavily, in the way of consumer consumption and social stability,'' Mr. Qu of HSBC said.
Some analysts, however, are now beginning to believe that Beijing may hold off on any such steps for the time being; they caution that China may not start to reaccelerate until late 2012 or even early 2013.
''The central bank seems to be very concerned about excess capacity and the potential for reigniting a rise in property prices -- that is something they really want to avoid,'' said Mr. Maguire of Asia Sentry Advisory. ''The path of least regret at this stage could well be for them to do nothing and wait for the structural reforms to the economy to filter through, but that is a process that has to be measured in years rather than months.''

HEADLINE: Big Income Losses Hit Those Near Retirement

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
7:24 p.m. | Updated with additional details.
Americans nearing retirement age have suffered disproportionately after the financial crisis: along with the declining value of their homes, which were intended to cushion their final years, their incomes have fallen sharply.
The typical household income for people age 55 to 64 years old is almost 10 percent less in today's dollars than it was when the recovery officially began three years ago, according to a new report from Sentier Research, a data analysis company that specializes in demographic and income data. 
Across the country, in almost every demographic, Americans earn less today than they did in June 2009, when the recovery technically started. As of June, the median household income for all Americans was $50,964, or 4.8 percent lower than its level three years earlier, when the inflation-adjusted median income was $53,508.
The decline looks even worse when comparing today's incomes to those when the recession began in December 2007. Then, the median household income was $54,916, meaning that incomes have fallen 7.2 percent since the economy last peaked.
Income drops vary significantly by age, though. Households led by people between the ages of 55 and 64 have taken the biggest hit; their household incomes have fallen to $55,748 from $61,716 over the last three years, a decline of 9.7 percent.
Sustained unemployment among older workers may be at least partly to blame for this decline. Unemployment rates for that age group are relatively low, but once older workers lose their jobs, they have an unusually hard time finding re-employment. And even when they do find new work, they usually take a pay cut.
"I was laid off in '08, and I never really managed to get back into the job market," said Jan Thomas, 62, who lives in Sarasota, Fla. She decided to apply for Social Security early, even though that means her benefits are lower than they would be if she had waited until 66. "I've pretty much gone through my savings at this point. You know, taking money out of one account, then the other. Then it all just kind of went poof."
Younger Americans have also felt income declines in the three years since the recovery began. The inflation-adjusted median household income for those 25 to 34 fell 8.9 percent, while that for people under age 25 fell 6.1 percent.
Incomes for the oldest Americans, on the other hand, have risen steadily since the recovery began. Among those 65 to 74, the inflation-adjusted median household income rose 6.5 percent (to $42,113 from $39,548), and among those age 75 and older, the increase was 2.8 percent (to $26,991 from $26,244).
It's not clear why incomes rose for older people when as they fell for everyone else.
This may be because older Americans are working longer, taking in more income at more advanced ages. Perhaps they are working longer partly to compensate for the decline in the value of their homes. Rising employment rates among older people predate the housing bust, however.
The share of people over 65 who have jobs has been rising since the early 1990s; in 2011, 16.7 of people over 65 worked, compared with 11.1 percent two decades earlier.
The chart below -- which is based on a different Census Bureau survey that goes through 2010 only, unfortunately -- shows that almost all age groups have actually seen their income rise over most of the last 50 years, although incomes for non-seniors have been much more volatile. (Remember, though, that during recessions older people have at least some steady income from Social Security.)
Income losses since the recovery began also varied depending on educational attainment, Sentier Research found.
People with the least education and people with the most education had smaller income losses, supporting the idea that the job market in the United States is "hollowing out," as the M.I.T. economist David Autor has proposed, meaning that high-skilled and low-skilled jobs are growing while midskilled jobs are thinning out.
The median household income of high school dropouts has fallen 5.3 percent (to $24,495 from $25,860), while that for college graduates has fallen 5.9 percent (to $83,378 from $88,570).
Meanwhile, incomes for those with a midlevel education -- a high school diploma, some college but no degree, or an associate's degree -- slid much further.
As you can see in the chart above, the biggest percentage decline was for people who took some college courses but never got a degree. Their median income has fallen 9.3 percent over the course of the recovery so far, to $46,200 from $50,948. That must especially sting, given that these income losses are probably accompanied by student loan debt.
Black Americans appear to have suffered the most, according to the Sentier report.
The real median annual household income for blacks fell 11.1 percent from June 2009 to June 2012, landing at $32,498 from $36,567. That compares with 5.2 percent for whites, 3.6 percent for other race combinations (including Asians) and 4.1 percent for Hispanics -- all of whom started with higher incomes than blacks.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: China Confronts Mounting Piles Of Unsold Goods

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
GUANGZHOU, China -- After three decades of torrid growth, China is encountering an unfamiliar problem with its newly struggling economy: a huge buildup of unsold goods that is cluttering shop floors, clogging car dealerships and filling factory warehouses.
The glut of everything from steel and household appliances to cars and apartments is hampering China's efforts to emerge from a sharp economic slowdown. It has also produced a series of price wars and has led manufacturers to redouble efforts to export what they cannot sell at home.
The severity of China's inventory overhang has been carefully masked by the blocking or adjusting of economic data by the Chinese government -- all part of an effort to prop up confidence in the economy among business managers and investors.
But the main nongovernment survey of manufacturers in China showed on Thursday that inventories of finished goods rose much faster in August than in any month since the survey began in April 2004. The previous record for rising inventories, according to the HSBC/Markit survey, had been set in June. May and July also showed increases. 
''Across the manufacturing industries we look at, people were expecting more sales over the summer, and it just didn't happen,'' said Anne Stevenson-Yang, the research director for J Capital Research, an economic analysis firm in Hong Kong. With inventories extremely high and factories now cutting production, she added, ''Things are kind of crawling to a halt.''
Problems in China give some economists nightmares in which, in the worst case, the United States and much of the world slip back into recession as the Chinese economy sputters, the European currency zone collapses and political gridlock paralyzes the United States.
China is the world's second-largest economy and has been the largest engine of economic growth since the global financial crisis began in 2008. Economic weakness means that China is likely to buy fewer goods and services from abroad when the sovereign debt crisis in Europe is already hurting demand, raising the prospect of a global glut of goods and falling prices and weak production around the world.
Corporate hiring has slowed, and jobs are becoming less plentiful. Chinese exports, a mainstay of the economy for the last three decades, have almost stopped growing. Imports have also stalled, particularly for raw materials like iron ore for steel making, as industrialists have lost confidence that they will be able to sell if they keep factories running. Real estate prices have slid, although there have been hints that they might have bottomed out in July, and money has been leaving the country through legal and illegal channels.
Interviews with business owners and managers across a wide range of Chinese industries presented a picture of mounting stockpiles of unsold goods.
Business owners who manufacture or distribute products as varied as dehumidifiers, plastic tubing for ventilation systems, solar panels, bedsheets and steel beams for false ceilings said that sales had fallen over the last year and showed little sign of recovering.
''Sales are down 50 percent from last year, and inventory is piled high,'' said To Liangjian, the owner of a wholesale company distributing picture frames and cups, as he paused while playing online poker in his deserted storefront here in southeastern China.
Wu Weiqing, the manager of a faucet and sink wholesaler, said that his sales dropped 30 percent in the last year and he has piled up extra merchandise. Yet the factory supplying him is still cranking out shiny kitchen fixtures at a fast pace.
''My supplier's inventory is huge because he cannot cut production -- he doesn't want to miss out on sales when the demand comes back,'' he said.
Part of the issue is that the Chinese government's leaders have decided to put quality-of-life concerns ahead of maximizing economic growth when it comes to two of the country's largest industries: housing and autos.
Premier Wen Jiabao has imposed a strict ban on purchases of second and subsequent homes, in the hope that discouraging real estate speculation will improve the affordability of homes. The ban has resulted in a steep decline in residential real estate prices, a sharp fall in housing construction and widespread job losses among construction workers.
At the same time, the municipal government in Guangzhou, one of China's largest cities, has sharply reduced this summer the number of new car registrations it allows so as to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.
Municipal officials from all over China have been flocking to Guangzhou to ask for details. Xi'an, the metropolis of northwestern China, has already announced this month that it will limit car registrations, although it has not settled on the details.
The Chinese auto industry has grown tenfold in the last decade to become the world's largest, looking like a formidable challenger to Detroit. But now, the Chinese industry is starting to look more like Detroit in its dark days in the 1980s.
Inventories of unsold cars are soaring at dealerships across the nation, and the Chinese industry's problems show every sign of growing worse, not better. So many auto factories have opened in China in the last two years that the industry is operating at only about 65 percent of capacity -- far below the 80 percent usually needed for profitability.
Yet so many new factories are being built that, according to the Chinese government's National Development and Reform Commission, the country's auto manufacturing capacity is on track to increase again in the next three years by an amount equal to all the auto factories in Japan, or nearly all the auto factories in the United States.
''I worry that we're going down the same road the U.S. went down, and it takes quite some time to fix that,'' said Geoff Broderick, the general manager of Asian operations at J. D. Power & Associates, the global consulting firm.
Automakers in China have reported that the number of cars they sold at wholesale to dealers rose by nearly 600,000 units, or 9 percent, in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year.
Yet dealerships' inventories of new cars rose 900,000 units, to 2.2 million, from the end of December to the end of June. While part of the increase is seasonal, auto analysts say that the data shows that retail sales are flat at best and most likely declining -- a sharp reversal for an industry accustomed to double-digit annual growth.
''Inventory levels for us now are very, very high,'' said Huang Yi, the chairman of Zhongsheng Group, China's fifth-largest dealership chain. ''If I hadn't done special offers in the first half of this year, my inventory would be even higher.''
Manufacturers have largely refused to cut production, and are putting heavy pressure on dealers to accept delivery of cars under their franchise agreements even though many dealers are struggling to find places to park them or ways to finance their swelling inventories. This prompted the government-controlled China Automobile Dealers Association to issue a rare appeal to automakers earlier this month.
''We call on manufacturers to be highly concerned about dealer inventories, and to take timely and effective measures to actively digest inventory, especially taking into account the financial strain on distributors, as manufacturers have to provide the necessary financing support to help dealers ride out the storm,'' the association said.
Officially, though, most of the inventory problems are a nonissue for the government.
The Public Security Bureau, for example, has halted the release of data about slumping car registrations. Data on the steel sector has been repeatedly revised this year after a new method showed a steeper downturn than the government had acknowledged. And while rows of empty apartment buildings line highways outside major cities all over China, the government has not released information about the number of empty apartments since 2008.
Yet businesspeople in a wide range of industries have little doubt that the Chinese economy is in trouble.
''Inventory used to flow in and out,'' said Mr. Wu, the faucet and sink sales manager. ''Now, it just sits there, and there's more of it.''

HEADLINE: With Fed Help in Doubt, Shares Dip

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market fell on Thursday after some doubts emerged over whether the Federal Reserve was ready to take further steps to stimulate the economy.
Signs of economic weakness in China and the continuing European debt crisis also weighed on the market.
On Wednesday, the Fed released minutes of its last policy-making meeting that appeared to suggest it was closer to taking action. But the prospect of Fed help for the economy seemed less certain on Thursday, and stocks fell. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 115.30 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 13,057.46 -- the biggest loss in more than a month and the Dow's fourth straight down day. 
James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told CNBC that the minutes from the July 31-Aug. 1 meeting were ''stale'' because the economy had picked up since then. If it becomes ''a bit stronger,'' he said, the Fed will hold off.
''He poured some water on the fire of the QE3 talk,'' said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research, using market slang for quantitative easing, a Fed bond-buying program meant to help the economy.
But another Fed regional official, Charles L. Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, told reporters in Beijing that he supports further action by the central bank, an apparent affirmation of the Fed minutes.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.41 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,402.08. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 20.27 points, or 0.7 percent, to 3,053.40.
Investors in the bond market, however, appeared more confident that the Fed would act soon. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 6/32, to 99 12/32, while its yield fell to 1.67 percent from 1.70 percent Wednesday.
Manufacturing activity fell to a nine-month low in China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States. Some investors expect that the government there may have to step in more decisively to try to help the economy.
''It's just a harsh reminder that the worldwide economy continues to disappoint,'' Mr. Detrick said.
But over all, news was slow, which is typical for the market's August lull. Big events that could move the market lie ahead: the Fed chairman Ben S. Bernanke's speech in Wyoming this month and a German court's ruling next month on whether the country can participate in a European bailout.
German leaders, on the eve of a critical meeting with their Greek counterparts to discuss Greece's continuing bailout, showed signs of the strain between the two countries.
Greece has asked for more time to put in place the spending reforms that Germany is requiring, but the German finance minister said Thursday that more time would not solve Greece's problems.
''It's really more of the same,'' said Mike Gibbs, co-head of the equity advisory group at Raymond James. ''What Europe has done is told us they're going to do something. They haven't really told us what.''
Among individual stocks, Big Lots fared worst among S.& P. 500 companies. It fell nearly 21 percent, losing $8.08 and closing Thursday at $30.76, after reporting a sharp drop in its quarterly profit and slashing its forecast for the rest of the year.

HEADLINE: State Agency Web Sites May Work Business Hours

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
In this day and age, when routine chores like paying bills and ordering groceries can be done online at anytime, day or night, some New York State agencies have Web sites that have yet to join the 24/7 world.
The state's new electronic filing system for corporate forms known as biennial statements goes offline at 7:30 p.m. weekdays and stays off until 6 a.m. It does not work on weekends, either. 
Unemployment Benefits Online, on the State Labor Department's site, also has limited hours. The site says unemployment insurance claims cannot be filed before 7:30 a.m. on weekdays or after 7:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday. On Fridays, the cutoff is 5 p.m. On weekends, the site is open for 31 hours without interruption, from 12:01 a.m. Saturday to 7 p.m. Sunday.
Stephen J. Dubner, writing on the blog Freakonomics, took note of the down time on the site for biennial statements collected by the State Department. "I can't recall the last time (or even the first time) I saw a Web site that was only open during business hours," he wrote on Monday. "I guess it is a mark of how the Web has changed our daily lives that we are disappointed to find a virtual office that isn't open 24/7."
Edison Alban, a spokesman for the State Department, said online filing of biennial statements - a corporate document that must be submitted every two years, along with a $9 filing fee - began in May.
"So far, more than 30,000 entities have filed their statements using this new feature," he said. A biennial statement contains contact information on a corporation, including the name and address of its top official, among other information. Corporations that use the Web site can pay the filing fee with a credit card.
Mr. Alban said the system that processed the data "was developed years ago, at a time when businesses primarily submitted their filings in paper form."
"The current system, which is utilized by a number of state agencies," he continued, "requires some time in the late evenings for multiple maintenance to be performed regularly."
He said the state was working on upgrading the system "so that service will truly be available 24/7."
At the Labor Department, a spokesman, Leo Rosales, said the down time was unavoidable. "During overnight hours," he said by e-mail, "the computerized system updates the large volume of daily transactions and performs routine maintenance checks." The updates, he added, ensure that claims are processed accurately and in a timely and confidential manner.
The State University at Albany has a registration site, MyUAlbany, that says it is open seven days a week, but only 20 1/2 hours a day. The site says it is closed 2:30 to 6 a.m. For many college students, that is prime time.
The hours are wrong, said Karl Luntta, a spokesman for the school. MyUAlbany "is in fact open 24/7." He said the information on the site - where students can register for classes, pay bills, check their grades, add or drop classes - would be changed. He said MyUAlbany had 6.1 million visits last year, second only to the school's home page.
"Years ago, when we first started the Web site and technology was different," he said, "we would reserve that time for maintenance, backups, updates and so on. The technology has been improved. We rarely find it necessary to deny access and shut MyUAlbany down."

HEADLINE: Call to Stiffen Laws Worries Town Built by Guns

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ILION, N.Y. -- This is the town that Remington built.
Almost 200 years ago, a young man named Eliphalet Remington Jr. forged his first rifle barrel at his father's ironworks here in the Mohawk Valley. These days, the Remington Arms factory in this village, midway between Albany and Syracuse, is one of the few large manufacturers still prospering in a part of upstate New York that was once filled with them.
But now residents of Ilion, a community whose history and economy are indelibly linked to one of America's more celebrated gunmakers, are starting to worry about Remington's future. The recent mass shootings at a screening of ''The Dark Knight Rises'' in Colorado and at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin have galvanized advocates of tougher gun laws in Albany, and Remington has made it clear that such laws could prompt it to leave New York for a more sympathetic state.
While elsewhere the debate over gun control includes talk of balancing constitutional rights with public safety, here residents are most concerned with a little-discussed element of the gun industry: economics. 
Diana Bower, who owns a small engineering business with her husband, a onetime engineer at the Remington plant, said politicians pressing for new gun laws -- many of them from New York City -- did not realize what was at stake upstate. For example, company officials have said one proposal under consideration would require costly plant retooling.
''If you don't live here and work here,'' Ms. Bower said, ''you really don't know what it means to say, 'Pass this,' or, 'Pass that.' ''
And Rusty Brown, a furnace technician in the powdered-metal products division at the plant and a former president of its union, spells it out bluntly: ''In my eyes, Remington goes away, Ilion goes away.''
Remington, which has its headquarters in North Carolina, employs more than a thousand people at its Ilion plant, a complex of four-story brick buildings, some still with creaky wood floors, that are connected by passageways. The plant looks like a relic of the Industrial Revolution; from the outside, at least, little has changed since close to a century ago, when Remington expanded to meet the demand for firearms during World War I.
Ilion, which now has about 8,000 residents, developed around the plant, and the Remington name is ubiquitous here. Students at Remington Elementary School can see the factory from their playground; even the doormat on the front steps at the Ilion police station notes, ''Home of Remington.'' (Free gun locks are available inside.)
The company is a rare economic bright spot in this part of the Mohawk Valley. The area has lost over 11,000 of its manufacturing jobs since 1990, or more than half, according to the State Labor Department. But Remington has added positions in recent years as its parent company consolidated production of other gun brands, like Bushmaster and Marlin, in Ilion.
''Not only have they stayed, but they've grown,'' said John Scarano, the executive director of the Herkimer County Chamber of Commerce. He added that the jobs at the plant were ''not minimum-wage jobs -- they're good jobs,'' and, indeed, many of the job postings on Remington's Web site recently were for skilled engineering positions.
Yet the talk of new gun laws, in a state that already has some of the most restrictive in the nation, has some people on edge.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said last week that he felt a new urgency to tackle legislation relating to gun violence and planned to make it one of his top priorities when lawmakers returned to Albany for the legislative session next year.
''There's been current events that have really shaped the psyche of this state, and I think there is a receptivity, as we stand here today, by the Legislature for additional measures,'' Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said, adding, ''I think there's an appetite for reform, and I think that's a good thing.''
Lawmakers are proposing, among other things, to limit firearm sales to one per person per month; to require background checks for anyone purchasing ammunition; and, most controversially, to require microstamping, a form of ballistics identification, for all semiautomatic pistols sold in New York State.
Microstamping has been an anathema to gunmakers. Colt has suggested that it might leave Connecticut if legislators there approved microstamping legislation, and, for years, Remington has strenuously opposed the measure in New York State.
A Remington executive, Stephen P. Jackson Jr., wrote to Mr. Cuomo earlier this year and said that the enactment of microstamping could force Remington ''to reconsider its commitment to the New York market altogether, rather than spend the astronomical sums of money needed to completely reconfigure our manufacturing and assembly processes.''
In Ilion, Mr. Jackson's threat was not taken lightly.
''If they have to spend a million bucks on that, they'll move out where they don't have to spend a million dollars,'' said Steve Maley, who owns a custom jewelry and repair shop across the street from the Remington plant. As it is, he said, ''New York State taxes are killing everybody.''
Another gunmaker, Kimber, which has a manufacturing plant in Yonkers, is also threatening to cut jobs at its factory if the Legislature approves microstamping. The company has said that passing such a law would create ''little more than a false sense of achievement for our elected officials'' while costing the state jobs and tax revenues.
And Remington and its competitors are not lacking suitors: in recent years, a number of states, including Alabama, Montana and South Dakota, have sought to persuade gunmakers in the Northeast and Midwest to move their plants to parts of the country with less restrictive gun laws, and, in many cases, a culture that is friendlier toward guns.
State Senator James L. Seward, a Republican whose district includes Ilion, said that passing new gun laws in Albany ''would send a bad signal to this gun manufacturer that they're in a state that's hostile to gun ownership and gun manufacturing,'' and that it could prompt the company to ''go to a more hospitable state, no question.''
''It may make people feel good to think they've done something,'' Mr. Seward added, ''but at the end of the day, the criminal element and those that go out and do these horrible things, they're going to get their weapons. And the cost could be great for a community like Ilion.''
Advocates of tighter gun laws are unsympathetic, accusing Remington and others of using the threat of layoffs to give themselves leverage against state lawmakers. The proposed microstamping law would require that the technology be used only on semiautomatic pistols sold to consumers in New York State, not all of the guns they make in the state.
''I think it's ridiculous for them to argue that they would leave New York,'' said Jackie Hilly, the executive director of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, a group that wants microstamping. ''Look, frankly, if we really want to keep jobs in New York, let's invest more money in yogurt,'' she added, referring to one of the state's growing industries.
To residents, Ilion without Remington would be unimaginable. The Arms, as it is known, is the family business for many; both of Mr. Brown's parents worked at the plant, and his wife works there, too.
''Three-quarters of the town probably worked there at one point,'' said Tim Daly, who manages a bank branch in town and is a co-owner of a liquor store next to the plant. ''You think of Ilion and Herkimer County, you think of Remington Arms.''

HEADLINE: Why China Resents Japan, and Us

BYLINE: By PETER HAYS GRIES. 
Peter Hays Gries is a professor of international and area studies at the University of Oklahoma and the director of its Institute for U.S.-China Issues.

 BODY:
Norman, Okla.
LAST week, anti-Japanese protests swept nearly a dozen Chinese cities. Angry demonstrators overturned Toyotas while Japanese restaurants and businesses were vandalized. In the central Chinese city of Chengdu, where thousands protested, some banners declared, ''Even if China is covered with graves, we must kill all Japanese!''
The immediate cause for the demonstrations was a flare-up over a few disputed, uninhabited islands controlled by Japan. (China calls them the Diaoyus; Japan calls them the Senkakus). On Aug. 15, Chinese nationalists landed and planted flags on the islands before being deported. Japanese nationalists retaliated by swimming ashore from nearby boats, further inflaming Chinese passions. 
The rage of China's crowds is genuine, and its roots lie in China's nationalist ideology. The Chinese Communist Party uses its educational and propaganda systems to socialize citizens into a particular understanding of history. Maoist triumphalism has been eclipsed since the mid-1990s by a new ''victim narrative'' about Chinese suffering.
To most Chinese, the Japanese are ''devils,'' and the hatred reaches far into the past -- from China's humiliating loss in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-5 to World War II-era atrocities like the Rape of Nanking. Anti-Japanese anger has both ethical and visceral dimensions, sustaining it unlike other more fleeting forms of nationalism.
And although Chinese nationalist rage is primarily aimed at Japan, it is also directed toward the United States. As Chinese nationalists see it, America is the cause of China's continuing problems with both Taiwan and Japan. If it were not for the ''American imperialists'' inserting the United States Seventh Fleet in the Taiwan Strait during the Korean War, they say, Taiwan would long ago have been reunified with mainland China, erasing that ''national humiliation.'' And Japan's continuing impertinence is also America's fault: the United States' alliance with Japan gives Japanese nationalists the gumption to defy a rising China.
The statements of American politicians further stoke Chinese anger at the United States. Speaking in Ohio late last week, the presumptive Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul D. Ryan, accused China of stealing intellectual property, blocking access to its markets and manipulating the exchange rate. ''President Obama promised he would stop these practices,'' Mr. Ryan declared. ''He said he'd go to the mat with China. Instead, they're treating him like a doormat. We're not going to let that happen.''
Mr. Ryan's views echo those of Mitt Romney, who has promised if elected to declare China a ''currency manipulator.'' This could lead to punitive tariffs on Chinese imports and a possible trade war.
There is a long history of challengers using China to attack incumbents during presidential elections. Most famously, in 1992, Bill Clinton accused President George Bush of coddling the ''butchers of Beijing'' following the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.
While there is some antipathy toward China in the Democratic Party, particularly among labor unions and human rights activists, anti-Chinese sentiment these days comes mostly from the right. Economic conservatives don't like the income redistribution and government regulation they associate with socialism; the Christian right fears the atheism of ''Godless'' Communism; and libertarians don't like any government at all, let alone the authoritarian government of China.
China-bashing will therefore be good election year politics for the Romney-Ryan ticket. But it will be bad for America's relations with China and could undermine our national security. Many Chinese are already suspicious of American intentions, and ideologically driven rhetoric from across the Pacific will only confirm their worst fears.
Worse, the Communist Party is currently undergoing its own leadership transition, and it is happening at a time when popular nationalism is bringing people into the streets. Because the party bases its legitimacy in large part on its nationalist credentials, no party leader is likely to quiet the nationalists until the new leadership is finalized.
Lacking a secure foundation of mutual trust, American-Chinese relations today remain susceptible to the random accidents of history that have plagued them in the past. In 1999, the mistaken NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Serbia, killed three and led to huge anti-American protests across China. And in 2001, the collision between a Chinese jet and an American surveillance plane led to a Chinese pilot's death and an American crew's being detained for two weeks.
If comparable accidents occur during this fall's leadership transitions in both countries, popular pressure for more confrontational policies in both China and the United States will be more difficult to contain -- and will increase the likelihood of conflict in Asia.

HEADLINE: Ryan's Biggest Mistake

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
A few years ago, President Obama established a debt commission that was led by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles and had a group of eminences, including Representative Paul Ryan.
When that commission came up with its proposal, some conservative Republicans, like Tom Coburn and Judd Gregg, voted yes, but Ryan voted no. This was a devastating blow. If Ryan and the other House Republicans had voted for the Simpson-Bowles proposal, it would have gone to Congress for up-or-down votes, regardless of how President Obama reacted. We would have had national action on debt reduction.
The Simpson-Bowles plan would have simplified the tax code and lowered rates. It would have capped the size of government. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, it would have brought the federal debt down from 73 percent of the nation's gross domestic product today, to 67 percent of G.D.P. in 2022. 
Ryan voted no for intellectually coherent reasons. He argued that the single biggest contributing factor to public debt is the unsustainable growth of Medicare. Yet the Simpson-Bowles plan did nothing to restructure Medicare, and it sidestepped health care issues generally. Ryan said that it was silly to come up with a debt-reduction proposal that didn't fix the single biggest driver of the nation's debt.
This is the sort of argument that makes a lot of sense in a think-tank auditorium. The problem was there were almost no Democrats who endorsed Ryan's Medicare reform ideas. If Ryan was going to pinion debt reduction to Medicare reform, that meant there would be no debt reduction.
But Ryan had another way forward, noting: We're going to have an election in 2012; the country will choose between two different visions; if we Republicans win, we'll be able to reform Medicare our way and reduce the debt our way.
In other words, Ryan was willing to sacrifice the good for the sake of the ultimate.
In order to get this ultimate solution, though, Ryan was betting that three things would happen. First, he was betting that Republicans would beat President Obama. Second, he was betting that Republicans would win such overwhelming Congressional majorities that they would be able to push through measures Democrats hate. Third, he was betting that a group of Republican politicians would unilaterally slash one of the country's most popular programs and that they would be able to sustain these cuts through the ensuing elections, in the face of ferocious and highly popular Democratic opposition.
To put it another way, Ryan was giving up significant debt progress for a political fantasy.
Ryan's fantasy happens to be the No. 1 political fantasy in America today, which has inebriated both parties. It is the fantasy that the other party will not exist. It is the fantasy that you are about to win a 1932-style victory that will render your opponents powerless.
Every single speech in this election campaign is based on this fantasy. There hasn't been a speech this year that grapples with the real world -- that we live in a highly polarized, evenly divided nation and the next president is going to have to try to pass laws in that context.
It's obvious why candidates talk about the glorious programs they'll create if elected. It fires up crowds and defines values. But we shouldn't forget that it's almost entirely make-believe.
In the real world, there are almost never ultimate victories, and it is almost never the case (even if you control the White House and Congress) that you get to do what you want.
The real world looks a lot like the Simpson-Bowles commission, where you get a diverse group of people who try to make progress in the areas where that is possible and try to sidestep the areas where it is not.
The real world looks like the budget talks between Obama and John Boehner last summer, in which two party leaders get together and work out a budget deal between themselves (which is easy) and also try to write a deal they can sell to their party bases (which is hard).
In the real world, leaders have a dual consciousness. They have a campaign consciousness in which they argue for the policies they think are best for the country. But then they have a governing consciousness, a mind-set they put on between elections. It says: O.K., this is the team the voters have sent to Washington. How can we navigate our divides to come up with something suboptimal but productive?
Paul Ryan has a great campaign consciousness, and, when it comes to things like Medicare reform, I agree with him. But when he voted no on the Simpson-Bowles plan he missed the chance to show that he also has a governing consciousness. He missed the chance to do something good for the country, even if it wasn't the best he or I would wish for.

HEADLINE: It's the President's Message, With President Clinton

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Former President Bill Clinton is not only campaigning for President Obama in his re-election bid. In a new 30-second commercial released on Thursday by the Obama campaign, he is practically channeling him.
''This is a clear choice,'' Mr. Clinton says of the race between Mr. Obama and his challenger, Mitt Romney. Describing the Republican economic blueprint as deregulation and tax cuts for the rich, Mr. Clinton says, ''That's what got us in trouble in the first place.''
His words could have been lifted from a recent commercial by Mr. Obama, called ''The Choice,'' in which the president presents himself as a defender of the middle class against predatory Republicans. Even the settings are similar: both men, seated in well-appointed rooms and wearing conservative suits, speaking straight to the camera. 
It is the most visible effort yet by the last Democratic president in support of the current one -- and it marks the beginning of a period of intensified engagement by Mr. Clinton, whose relationship with Mr. Obama has traveled from bitter antagonism to chilly distance to a cautious embrace. In two weeks, he will have the coveted role of placing Mr. Obama's name into nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.
For the Obama campaign, Mr. Clinton has obvious appeal: he is a popular former president with a strong economic record and a reputation as a defender of the middle class. But Mr. Clinton may be most valuable because of his credibility with a voting constituency that Mr. Obama has struggled with, working-class whites.
''There is no Democrat who is more trusted than President Clinton by white working-class voters for having their interests at heart and being on their side,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who is working with Priorities USA Action, a ''super PAC'' that supports Mr. Obama. ''When it comes to what it takes to make the economy work for the middle class, Bill Clinton is a virtual Good Housekeeping seal of approval.''
Mr. Clinton could help blunt what Obama campaign officials say is a calculated effort by Mr. Romney to peel working-class whites away from the president by suggesting, in recent ads, that Mr. Obama dismantled a central plank of Mr. Clinton's welfare reform law that requires welfare recipients to work in return for benefits.
Although in the Obama ad, Mr. Clinton does not address that claim, which has been discredited by fact-checkers, he makes it clear that he believes Mr. Obama, not Mr. Romney, is the right choice to ''rebuild America from the ground up.'' Mr. Clinton's words are intercut with images of a construction worker heaving a lunchbox out of a pickup truck and Mr. Obama talking to voters over a kitchen table (the same image appears in Mr. Obama's ad).
Mr. Obama has struggled with working-class white voters since the 2008 campaign when he declared during a fund-raiser that people in economically depressed small towns cling to ''guns, or religion, or antipathy toward people who aren't like them,'' a comment that was seized on by his Democratic opponent at the time, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a last-ditch effort to deny him the nomination.
The Obama campaign has hoped to hold on to more of those voters this year by portraying Mr. Obama as their defender against the favor-the-rich policies of Mr. Romney.
Campaign officials said they would use Mr. Clinton as much as he will let them, and he seems game for it. But they will have to compete for his time. The two other members of the Clinton family -- Mrs. Clinton, the secretary of state, and Chelsea Clinton, a correspondent for NBC News -- are both barred from politics. That means for any Democratic candidate seeking the Clinton imprimatur, Mr. Clinton is the only choice.

HEADLINE: Giving Reins To the States Over Drilling

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Ashley Parker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
By proposing to end a century of federal control over oil and gas drilling and coal mining on government lands, Mitt Romney is making a bid for anti-Washington voters in key Western states while dangling the promise of a big reward to major campaign supporters from the energy industry.
Mr. Romney's plan, which would turn over decision-making on drilling and mining to the states, echoes the ''Drill, baby, drill'' strategy that another Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, used to great effect in the 2008 campaign.
The federal government owns vast portions of states like New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Colorado and Alaska. Under President Obama, officials in Washington have played a bigger role in drilling and mining decisions on federal lands in the states, and such involvement rankles many residents and energy executives, who prefer the usually lighter touch of local officials. 
With gasoline prices again approaching $4 a gallon, Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, is also trying to merge energy and economic policy in a way that will make voters see increased energy production as a pocketbook issue. He said that his overall energy plan, which includes speedy approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada and new drilling off the coast of Virginia and the Carolinas, would help the country achieve energy independence and create three million drilling and manufacturing jobs.
''I'm going to change the regulatory and permitting process,'' Mr. Romney said Thursday at a rally in Hobbs, N.M., in the giant Permian Basin oil fields, where companies are eager to begin drilling on millions of acres of federal lands. ''Sometimes I have the impression that the whole regulatory attitude of the administration is trying to stop oil and gas and coal -- that they don't want those sources, that instead they want to get those things so expensive and so rare that wind and solar become highly cost-effective and efficient.''
Giving states control over the energy resources on millions of acres of federal lands would be a radical shift from decades of policies under both Democratic and Republican presidents, dating all the way to Theodore Roosevelt, who first set aside vast tracts of territory to preserve wildlife. Since then, the federal government has tried to balance exploitation of mineral resources with other uses like recreation and environmental protection.
''This step would be a change in national policy direction going back at least 50 years, giving control over national assets to localities,'' said Michael E. Webber, associate director of the Center for International Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Texas at Austin. ''Local decision makers could inhibit production that could be against the national interest or could encourage production that could pollute waters or air in another state.''
Mr. Romney said that states like North Dakota and Colorado grant drilling permits on state-owned lands in days or weeks, compared with the nearly a year that it takes the federal government to grant approval. ''They found a way to do a job in a more efficient way,'' he said. ''On federal lands, the permitting process to actually drill and get oil or gas is extraordinarily slow.''
The Romney campaign acknowledged that such a significant policy change would require the approval of Congress. Getting such legislation passed, even if Republicans controlled the House and the Senate, would be very difficult, given certain opposition by Democrats and perhaps even some Republicans.
But even if it never passes, the proposal is liable to generate enthusiasm among voters who favor smaller government, especially in Western swing states like Nevada, which is about 80 percent federal land.
''We love it,'' said Ally Isom, a deputy chief of staff to Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah, a Republican. ''We understand better than Washington how to better manage our lands. We actually live here.''
An individual close to the Romney campaign said that Mr. Romney's staff drafted the proposal in consultation with industry executives, including Harold Hamm, an Oklahoma billionaire who is the chairman of the campaign's energy advisory committee and chief executive of Continental Resources, an oil and gas driller.
Just this week, the oil and gas industry gave nearly $10 million toward the Romney election effort in two fund-raisers.
The Romney aide, who said she was not authorized to speak on the record about the plan, said that any consultation with industry officials was simply to tap their expertise and did not mean the proposal was being shaped to serve their interests.
Mr. Romney's proposal drew immediate praise from the industry, which has complained that gas production on public lands has slowed under President Obama, even while it has surged on private lands.
''Empowering states, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all federal government approach, is the right way to increase American energy,'' said Kathleen Sgamma, a vice president at Western Energy Alliance, a group of oil and gas producers.
But environmentalists and former Interior Department officials called the proposal an irresponsible break from traditional federal protection of wildlife.
''It is a preposterously bad idea -- we are talking about federal trust lands that belong to the whole nation,'' said Bobby McEnaney, a senior aide at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
Federico Peña, secretary of energy in the Clinton administration and now a co-chairman of Mr. Obama's re-election campaign, said Mr. Romney's plan would cause more problems for the oil and gas industry. ''I cannot imagine a world in where there are 50 different kinds of rules and regulations for industry,'' Mr. Peña said. ''To see Balkanization of rules and regulation I think would drive the industry crazy.''
The federal government owns about 28 percent of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the United States. But as of March 2012, only about 37 million acres were under lease for oil and gas operations, of which about 16.3 million acres have active oil and gas production or exploration, according to the Interior Department.
Under Mr. Romney's proposal, the federal government would still be able to set national standards for air and water pollution, which equally apply to drilling on federal and private lands, an aide said. But states would be authorized to conduct their own environmental reviews and issue drilling permits as quickly as they would like, as long as the drilling was not in protected wildlife areas or national parks.
Elected officials in states like Utah have called for federal officials to transfer or sell federal lands to the states, echoing the Sagebrush Rebellion of the 1970s, when politicians and landowners in the West advocated a similar move.
The George W. Bush administration allowed individual drilling permits to be issued without a detailed environmental review, resulting in a surge of oil and gas production.
But never before has the federal government offered simply to cede control over how federal land is developed to state officials, said John Leshy, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law and an Interior Department lawyer in the Clinton administration.
''It is pretty revolutionary to say we are going to keep title but turn it over to the states,'' he said. ''It is a Sagebrush Rebellion with a twist.''

HEADLINE: Celebrities Join to Oppose Upstate Gas Drilling

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
More than 140 artists and celebrities, including Lady Gaga and Paul McCartney, have signed on to a coalition to try to persuade Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to ban the use of hydraulic fracturing - also known as hydrofracking or fracking - to extract natural gas in parts of New York State.
Yoko Ono and her son, Sean Lennon, plan to host an event on Wednesday in New York City to introduce the coalition, called Artists Against Fracking. The Beatles family is well represented: the coalition also includes Ringo Starr and Julian Lennon. 
"Our aim is for the world to embrace sustainable living and develop renewable energies through economic viable alternatives to fossil fuel," the group says on its Web site.
Ms. Ono and Mr. Lennon discussed their intention to form the coalition on the NBC program "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon" in July. Mr. Fallon is listed as a member on the Web site, as are the author Salman Rushdie, the restaurateur Mario Batali and some big show-business names, like Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman, Julianne Moore and Gwyneth Paltrow.
Some in the group have homes near the upstate areas where the new drilling could take place.
The group lists an eclectic mix, among them: Fred Armisen, Alec Baldwin, Jackson Browne, David Byrne, Deepak Chopra, Zooey Deschanel, Carrie Fisher, Roberta Flack, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jeff Koons, John Cameron Mitchell, Bonnie Raitt, Todd Rundgren, Amy Ryan, Cindy Sherman, Patti Smith, Uma Thurman, Liv Tyler and Rufus Wainwright, as well as bands like the B-52s, Kronos Quartet, My Morning Jacket, Scissor Sisters, Wilco and Yo La Tengo.
Such star power represents a coup for an antifracking movement in New York that has counted on only a few celebrities, led by the actor Mark Ruffalo, who is also listed as part of the coalition, to burnish its image. Coordinators of the press event said Ms. Ono and Sean Lennon would not be available for interviews until next week.
The artists' involvement comes amid increasingly visible opposition to Mr. Cuomo's consideration of regulations that would allow hydrofracking in some parts of the state. Polls show New Yorkers to be deeply divided over the technology, which involves blasting shale with millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals to release natural gas.
On their Web site, the artists warn of the dangers of accidental contamination of aquifers with drilling chemicals, and the wastewater that would be produced by drilling operations.
But mostly, the celebrities take direct aim at the governor, a Democrat. Their Web site's home page gives out his office's contact information and urges people to "Contact Governor Cuomo to voice your opinion!"
It is uncertain how much weight the artists' opinions will have. But they are likely to further energize the environmental movement, which includes advocacy groups, scientists and politicians, in the debate against the oil and gas industry, landowners and officials in communities that see the drilling as a source of new investment and jobs.
Brad Gill, executive director of the industry group Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York, responded to the coalition's emergence with a terse statement saying that he trusted that Mr. Cuomo would rely on science to make a decision, as the governor has pledged to do. "The people elected Governor Cuomo, not celebrities, to lead New York and to make decisions that are in the best interest" of the state, Mr. Gill said.
The industry association had previously dismissed antifracking celebrities n a postcard delivered to lawmakers in Albany that said: "Welcome to Hollywood, N.Y., where the line between fact and fiction is blurred."
A spokesman for the governor, Josh Vlasto, said Mr. Cuomo had not heard from the artists directly, though Ms. Ono posted a letter to the governor in July on her personal Web site. (It was unclear whether she sent the letter.)
Asked by a reporter about hydrofracking on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo said that he understood the passion on both sides of the argument, but that he would "let the science dictate the conclusion; and that's just what we're doing."
Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 2 Parties, Divided by Simple Math

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- If you aren't American, the possibility that this election could hinge on abortion rights may seem absurd. Surely the stagnant world economy, the relative decline of U.S. power and climate change, just to name three, all trump reproductive freedom as issues that should be at the top of the national agenda.
But up close the focus on abortion is less bewildering. If, like Todd Akin, the Missouri congressman whose comments about rape focused the United States' attention on the subject of abortion this week, you believe embryos are full-fledged human beings, no issue is as important as what you view as the continuing and legal murder of these innocents. If, on the other hand, you are a woman of child-bearing age who happens not to share Mr. Akin's beliefs, no issue is as important as the right to control your own body, which the congressman's view threatens. 
Having said all of that, the spotlight on abortion rights is also the product of a family feud inside the Republican Party. Republican grass-roots activists are desperate to propel the issue to the top of the national agenda, while the party's elders -- and their presidential nominee -- are equally desperate to stop us all from talking about it.
If Mitt Romney has his way, the focus will eventually swing back to the issue that most voters spend the most time thinking about -- the economy. And if that happens, a man worth talking to is R. Glenn Hubbard, a top Romney adviser who served as the chairman of George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and is now the dean of Columbia Business School in New York.
Mr. Hubbard sees this election as one that offers Americans a sharp choice about the kind of country they want to live in. ''The real issue for the public is to figure out which narrative do we want,'' Mr. Hubbard said in a conversation in his office on the Columbia campus this week. ''We can have a bigger government, if that's the public's choice. It'll just require higher taxes on every American.''
''Do you want that,'' he asked, ''or do you want smaller government, smaller taxes?''
Mr. Hubbard is right that the ideological choice U.S. voters face when it comes to the economy and, indeed, the nature of their country more broadly, is clear and significant. There's a reason the political debate is so polarized right now: the United States is at a very real crossroads.
While both parties are happy to describe this contrast in broad terms, when it comes to explaining their visions in more than a single sentence each side is unwilling to trust voters to understand the full implications of their position.
The Republican hypocrisy is to promise lower taxes, a balanced budget and spending cuts that avoid curtailing the essential government services Americans cherish. Eliminating waste and making the state more efficient only goes so far, and Republicans are reluctant to spell out just how much the state would have to shrink to allow a President Romney to both enact his promised tax cuts and balance the budget.
There is, of course, another way to square Mr. Romney's fiscal circle: to adopt the credo of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who argued that Ronald Reagan proved that deficits don't matter. Under this approach, a Republican administration would focus on cutting taxes first and leave balancing the budget for a little later.
The point of hypocrisy is to say one thing and to do something rather different. But even in these pre-election days of talking points, Mr. Hubbard makes very clear that the ticket shared by Mr. Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan has absolutely no interest in British-style shock therapy.
''Definitely not,'' Mr. Hubbard said, when I asked him whether Mr. Romney was proposing a British scenario. ''Part of the problem in Europe and in Britain is that austerity has the impression that we have to make every change today. That's not true in Europe and it's especially not true in the United States. What we need is a glide path to fiscal sustainability. It doesn't have to happen today.''
Call it closet Keynesianism, with a 2013 stealth stimulus disguised as deep tax cuts. That is what many of Mr. Romney's moneyed Wall Street supporters are hoping for -- with a further, Nixon-goes-to-China expectation that a tax-cutting President Romney would have the best chance of taming the die-hard Republican deficit hawks in Congress.
The Democratic hypocrisy also involves squaring pledges about taxes with promises of fiscal prudence. President Barack Obama vows to maintain a supportive state -- and to extend health care coverage -- while not raising taxes for the middle class, and eventually balancing the budget.
This math, as Mr. Hubbard pointed out, doesn't work either. The state programs that many Americans depend on today cost more than what they pay in taxes. Increasing taxes on the rich will help, but that is not enough. Yet, just as the Republicans won't admit that they can't balance the budget and cut taxes without shriveling the state to levels many Americans would not tolerate, the Democrats won't tell you that the more generous state they believe in will only be sustainable if quite a few Americans pay more for it.
You get what you pay for -- there's a message I think American voters are smart enough to understand.

HEADLINE: Galt, Gold And God

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
So far, most of the discussion of Paul Ryan, the presumptive Republican nominee for vice president, has focused on his budget proposals. But Mr. Ryan is a man of many ideas, which would ordinarily be a good thing.
In his case, however, most of those ideas appear to come from works of fiction, specifically Ayn Rand's novel ''Atlas Shrugged.''
For those who somehow missed it when growing up, ''Atlas Shrugged'' is a fantasy in which the world's productive people -- the ''job creators,'' if you like -- withdraw their services from an ungrateful society. The novel's centerpiece is a 64-page speech by John Galt, the angry elite's ringleader; even Friedrich Hayek admitted that he never made it through that part. Yet the book is a perennial favorite among adolescent boys. Most boys eventually outgrow it. Some, however, remain devotees for life. 
And Mr. Ryan is one of those devotees. True, in recent years, he has tried to downplay his Randism, calling it an ''urban legend.'' It's not hard to see why: Rand's fervent atheism -- not to mention her declaration that ''abortion is a moral right'' -- isn't what the G.O.P. base wants to hear.
But Mr. Ryan is being disingenuous. In 2005, he told the Atlas Society, which is devoted to promoting Rand's ideas, that she inspired his political career: ''If I had to credit one thinker, one person, it would be Ayn Rand.'' He also declared that Rand's work was required reading for his staff and interns.
And the Ryan fiscal program clearly reflects Randian notions. As I documented in my last column, Mr. Ryan's reputation for being serious about the budget deficit is completely undeserved; his policies would actually increase the deficit. But he is deadly serious about cutting taxes on the rich and slashing aid to the poor, very much in line with Rand's worship of the successful and contempt for ''moochers.''
This last point is important. In pushing for draconian cuts in Medicaid, food stamps and other programs that aid the needy, Mr. Ryan isn't just looking for ways to save money. He's also, quite explicitly, trying to make life harder for the poor -- for their own good. In March, explaining his cuts in aid for the unfortunate, he declared, ''We don't want to turn the safety net into a hammock that lulls able-bodied people into lives of dependency and complacency, that drains them of their will and their incentive to make the most of their lives.''
Somehow, I doubt that Americans forced to rely on unemployment benefits and food stamps in a depressed economy feel that they're living in a comfortable hammock.
But wait, there's more: ''Atlas Shrugged'' apparently shaped Mr. Ryan's views on monetary policy, views that he clings to despite having been repeatedly, completely wrong in his predictions.
In early 2011, Mr. Ryan, newly installed as the chairman of the House Budget Committee, gave Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, a hard time over his expansionary policies. Rising commodity prices and long-term interest rates, he asserted, were harbingers of high inflation to come; ''There is nothing more insidious that a country can do to its citizens,'' he intoned, ''than debase its currency.''
Since then, inflation has remained quiescent while long-term rates have plunged -- and the U.S. economy would surely be in much worse shape than it is if Mr. Bernanke had allowed himself to be bullied into monetary tightening. But Mr. Ryan seems undaunted in his monetary views. Why?
Well, it's right there in that 2005 speech to the Atlas Society, in which he declared that he always goes back to ''Francisco d'Anconia's speech on money'' when thinking about monetary policy. Who? Never mind. That speech (which clocks in at a mere 23 paragraphs) is a case of hard-money obsession gone ballistic. Not only does the character in question, a Galt sidekick, call for a return to the gold standard, he denounces the notion of paper money and demands a return to gold coins.
For the record, the U.S. currency supply has consisted overwhelmingly of paper money, not gold and silver coins, since the early 1800s. So if Mr. Ryan really thinks that Francisco d'Anconia had it right, he wants to turn the clock back not one but two centuries.
Does any of this matter? Well, if the Republican ticket wins, Mr. Ryan will surely be an influential force in the next administration -- and bear in mind, too, that he would, as the cliché goes, be a heartbeat away from the presidency. So it should worry us that Mr. Ryan holds monetary views that would, if put into practice, go a long way toward recreating the Great Depression.
And, beyond that, consider the fact that Mr. Ryan is considered the modern G.O.P.'s big thinker. What does it say about the party when its intellectual leader evidently gets his ideas largely from deeply unrealistic fantasy novels?

HEADLINE: City Sets Up a Corporation To Oversee Its Tech Projects

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
Scalded by scandal, cost overruns and embarrassments in some of its most ambitious computerization efforts, the Bloomberg administration has hit upon on a new remedy: outsourcing such projects to a new quasi-governmental entity that will operate free of the usual city procurement rules, salary limits and legislative oversight.
The new entity, its proponents argue, will provide a bureaucratically powerful, highly skilled, centralized overseer for the kind of technology projects that have bedeviled this administration for years, and that have raised questions about one of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's perceived strengths as a billionaire who made his money through technological innovation. 
Deputy Mayor Caswell F. Holloway, who spearheaded a review of the city's technology woes, said the new entity could save taxpayers millions of dollars by reducing the city's reliance on highly paid outside contractors for project conception, development and execution. ''There is no reason why every agency in the City of New York should be going out and getting that from consultants,'' he said. ''The city should have an ability to do this.''
But veteran city technology managers and consultants expressed doubts, and veterans of city government pointed to a possible political motive.
Harvey Robins, who was operations chief for Mayor David N. Dinkins and who reorganized several city agencies, said the immediate effect would be to distance Mayor Bloomberg from future technology problems. ''It's a headache,'' Mr. Robins said, ''and he doesn't want the headache anymore.''
The new entity's main goal, according to a confidential document obtained by The New York Times as well as interviews with Mr. Holloway and other officials, is to solve one of the most vexing riddles of Mr. Bloomberg's tenure: how to grant those responsible for tech projects enough authority so they can compel agency commissioners to cooperate, make timely decisions and accept compromises that might require them to change the way they do business.
Interagency tension hurt the development of the new 911 emergency dispatching system, as police and fire officials warred with one another, preserving fiefs and incompatible systems. It was a problem with CityTime, the city's new timekeeping system, which involved scores of agencies. And it was a constant headache in developing a new personnel system, Nycaps, as agencies sparred and consultants clamored for mayoral intervention. In each case, the results were confusion, years of delays, and hundreds of millions of dollars in cost overruns.
Under the new plan, control is decided by a simple test: if a project will cost more than $25 million, or more than $5 million and involves more than one agency, then a new ''NYC Technology Development Corporation'' will control the project from start to finish. The corporation will oversee design, vendors, installation and training.
The new entity, which was set up as a nonprofit in July, is modeled after the city's Economic Development Corporation, which operates under contract with the city to make deals with businesses, landowners and vendors on the city's behalf without being subject to the same level of contracting rules and City Council oversight that apply to city agencies.
Because the new entity will be able to bypass competitive bidding at times, the city hopes it will choose vendors more quickly.
But several city technology experts, including a senior agency technology officer and an outside consultant, pointed to possible problems, including a potential brain drain if the new entity offered higher salaries to tech managers from city agencies.
Interviewed on the condition of anonymity to preserve their ties to the administration, these experts said that the new entity was the latest in a series of attempts by the Bloomberg administration to address technology design and contracting. Previous efforts by a Technology Steering Committee and a Technology Governance Board did not succeed.
The new entity would not replace the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, but rather take on some of its portfolio. ''In some ways, it's introducing another party to the already complex governance structure,'' one expert said. ''Perhaps a more competent party -- but that's a best-case scenario.''
This expert also expressed concern that entrusting oversight to a corporation one step removed from City Hall could increase the risk of a runaway project, noting that the CityTime project was hurt by corruption that took root in the absence of ''much visibility into what was being spent.''
Peter Thorne, a spokesman for the city comptroller's office, said that it was ''always open to exploring ways to save city taxpayers money,'' but that it greeted the idea with ''a tremendous amount of skepticism'' given the administration's track record on CityTime and the 911 system.
He said that problems at the Economic Development Corporation, which has been faulted by city auditors for hoarding tens of millions of dollars in city money and for failing to oversee its own contractors adequately, ''call into question the entire operating model of using independent entities to conduct crucial city functions.''
Mr. Holloway said the new entity would be fully transparent, and would help prevent talented technology workers from leaving government.
Rahul N. Merchant, the city's new top technology officer, who conceived of the new entity with Mr. Holloway, said he hoped it would be able to deliver, with no more than 20 employees, 6 to 10 projects before Mr. Bloomberg leaves office on Jan. 1, 2014.
But experts questioned whether so much could be achieved in a short time. ''Creating a new agency is not easy to do, and all the effort for that time will be spent painting the walls,'' one said.

HEADLINE: South Korea and Japan: Old Rivalry, New Expectations

BYLINE: JOHN DUERDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The latest soccer game between South Korea and Japan ended in a diplomatic row after midfielder Park Jong-woo held up a banner referring to a group of islands that are claimed by both countries located in a body of water whose name they also argue over. But besides that incident, the stature of the two Asian rivals is rising in world soccer. 

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- The most recent soccer game between South Korea and Japan ended in a diplomatic row after midfielder Park Jong-woo held up a banner referring to a group of islands that are claimed by both countries located in a body of water whose name they also argue over.
There is something, however, that even South Korea and Japan can agree on. The time when they were just Asian powerhouses is coming to an end. These two continental rivals are slowly becoming genuine global forces.
This has been a summer that has seen the old soccer order shaken up, at least a little. On a sunny London afternoon in August, Mexico defeated the mighty Brazil to take Olympic gold medal. The celebrations lasted exactly a week until the United States rained on that parade by winning in the Azteca Stadium for the first time.
And then there were two Asian teams in the semifinals of a major soccer tournament. These were no lucky runs to the last four; the youngsters were matching the best in the world. Japan outclassed the highly favored Spanish in the opening game to win, 1-0, while South Korea knocked out host Britain in the quarterfinal.
The under-23 teams were not only suggesting a bright future but continuing the good work performed by the seniors in recent years. Both the Taeguk Warriors and the Blue Samurai have made the knockout stages in two of the last three World Cups, have an increasing number of young players in the big European leagues and are continuing to produce more talent.
South Korea Coach Hong Myong-bo, captain of the 2002 team that made the semifinals, predicted good things ahead after his team defeated Japan, 2-0, to take the bronze medal.""The players on the Olympic team have gained so much experience on the international stage, and they will be huge asset for the future of the Korean football, especially during the Brazil World Cup," he said.
Japan may have returned to Tokyo empty-handed but there will be more chances for success. From the 2011 Asian Cup triumph to the 2014 World Cup and beyond, Alberto Zaccheroni has a settled team with stars such as Shinji Kagawa -- now a Manchester United player -- and Keisuke Honda with a host of youngsters bubbling under the surface ready to challenge for their starting spots.
There is a similar stability in the J-League, as well-organized a competition as you will find anywhere. Japan is now seeing the benefits of a top-class youth development system that was put into place in the early '90s. As with their K-League counterparts, Japanese clubs are hardly poor but there are no lavish contracts for well-known foreign players. 
This is the preserve of United Arab Emirates, Qatar and China -- all three are desperate simply to qualify for the World Cup. Here in Seoul and in Tokyo that is no longer the question. Now they talk of how far they can go and when an Asian team will be in the last four of a World Cup.
Even after recent years, many around the world would not agree with that statement but it is no longer laughable -- things have changed. Ahead of the 2010 edition, then-Japan coach Takashi Okada publicly targeted a semifinal finish. The reaction was one of incredulity abroad and at home. The sneer of the Tokyo news media, never a fan of the man, grew with every warm-up defeat and even the players were uncomfortable.
Yet Japan was only denied a place in the quarterfinal by a penalty shootout. South Korea also made it out of the group to be eliminated by a talented Uruguay team in a game that could have gone either way.
Since then, young players such as Honda and Kagawa have become household names. Yuto Nagatomo is now with Inter Milan and Atusto Uchida is at Schalke. Young stars of the Olympic team such as Hiroki Sakai, Takashi Usami, Yuki Otsu and Hiroshi Kiyotake are not yet regulars in the senior teams but all will play next season in the Bundesliga.
South Korea has not been quite as busy but the Olympic team had six players already in the big leagues of Europe and five well-established in the senior team. Park Ji-sung may have left Manchester United for Queens Park Rangers but Ki Sung-yeung, already with 45 appearances for the senior team at age 23, has just joined Premier League team Swansea City for a fee of $10 million. About half that amount took Kim Bo-kyoung to Cardiff City while young defender Yoon Suk-young has been linked to Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur.
There is a debate about whether some of these players are heading overseas too early but the exodus leaves gaps for even younger players to test themselves at a good level and the cycle continues. If China can actually get its act together then East Asia -- helped by its economic might and population base -- is going to become a powerful bloc in the world of soccer.
Work must still be done. Neither South Korea nor Japan has been able to produce the kind of top class goalscorers that enables teams to kill games when they are dominating or to steal undeserved victories when they are not. This will come and already going is the overestimation of European and South American opposition.
These Asian rivals now know they belong on the world stage in soccer terms and maybe the day when they meet in the semifinal of the World Cup is not that far away. That really would be a proud moment for the whole of Asia. Even Japan and South Korea would agree with that.

HEADLINE: At Canlis, Dinner With a Side of Camaraderie

BYLINE: HOWIE KAHN


HIGHLIGHT: The Seattle restaurant's annual board meeting is as much about bonding as it is business. 

 BODY:
Last summer, Mark and Brian Canlis - the co-owners of the Seattle restaurant Canlis - mounted two horses near Pryor, Mont., and proceeded, on Day 1 of their annual board meeting, to chase off a couple of bears. They rode out of the barn on the 200,000-acre S Ranch, an hour south of Billings, with their board members, all close confidants of the family, including a tech entrepreneur (and childhood neighbor), a restaurant owner and hotelier (a college classmate), and a finance executive who introduced Mark to his wife and insisted on only being called "Big Steve."
The land rolled out in front of the pack. Five thousand heads of Black Angus and American Wagyu made slow, nutritional use of the property. One hundred fifty prize-winning quarter horses charged around between the buttes as if rehearsing for a truck commercial. And, after a difficult and trying year in the business, this pair of restaurant-owning brothers - third-generation proprietors of a six-decade-old fine dining establishment that's currently in the midst of a renaissance - had just sent recession's spirit animal sprinting off and up a tree.
When not chasing bears, or running a board meeting in a style somewhere between a TED Talk and group therapy, Mark, 37, and Brian, 34, spend a lot of their time asking the question "Is that Canlis?" They've been asking it with greater frequency since becoming their restaurant's majority shareholders in 2010, relieving their parents, Chris and Alice, at the helm after 33 years of service. "Is that Canlis?" starts as a question about their restaurant, then becomes a question about their identity and then it becomes a question about their restaurant again. There's really no separation between the two things. The family is the restaurant; the restaurant is the family. It's one continuous loop. "Is that Canlis?" speaks deeply to the braided matter of hospitality and relationships. It can be applied to the time it takes to dry age a duck breast (14 to 21 days, they've decided, is very Canlis) or to coat-check theory (no tickets; people are not numbers) or to empathy (there's never enough) or to what to do when diners who ate at the restaurant in, say, 1963 want the an item from the 1963 menu instead of any of the current offerings. (No doubt, you give it to them.)
But the question was most significantly applied in 2008 when the family hired Jason Franey - then 31 and Daniel Humm's executive sous chef at Eleven Madison Park in New York - to run their kitchen. For the Canlises, Franey's presence inevitably and intentionally indicated a departure from the traditional steaks, chops and sauced fish filets that made their restaurant a Seattle institution, and it signified a shift toward the kinds of elegantly composed, modernist dishes (pork loin with pine ash, diver scallops with preserved lemon) that would continue to lure locals while courting destination diners from all over the world. Canlis was already the place in Seattle where you went to get engaged, blew out birthday candles and clinked Champagne flutes on an anniversary. Dave Matthews and Jeff Bezos ate there; the restaurant catered Ichiro Suzuki's birthday. It hardly seemed like a formula to mess with. But ultimately, the brothers decided it was just more Canlis to be progressive. "We had a choice," Brian said. "We could have become the Commander's Palace of Seattle. We chose instead to become relevant."
"When the restaurant opened," said Brian, peering out from beneath his cowboy hat, "our grandfather, who founded it, didn't serve a menu of classics. He brought in ingredients no one had seen before. He stretched boundaries." Mark, riding beside him, holding his reins in one hand, added, "All our history prompted people to say we were ruining Canlis when we brought in Jason and changed the food. We called it 'The Great Experiment' because it disconnected the restaurant from some of its relationships. But we thought by staying innovative, we were bringing it back to the way it began, back to its roots." And it's paying off. Last year Franey was named one of Food & Wine's Best New Chefs and the dining room is perpetually packed, in part by those who also innovate for a living. When I visited, one table was booked, I was told, by a man who invented the computer program Excel, had traveled to outer space twice and dated Martha Stewart.
The restaurant itself was built by Peter Canlis, Mark and Brian's paternal grandfather, in 1950. But it was Peter's father, Nicholas, who set the family business into motion. "He swam from Greece to Turkey," Brian said, "and eventually walked and hitchhiked to Cairo. He worked at a famous hotel there and met Teddy Roosevelt in 1909. Since Nicholas could cook, Roosevelt took him out on safari for almost a year." Later, Nicholas Canlis opened a diner in Stockton, Calif, but Peter, his son, had his eye on finer fare. Peter moved to Hawaii with plans to open a proper restaurant, but the bombing of Pearl Harbor left him running food operations for the U.S.O. instead. He'd eventually open the Broiler (Joan Didion mentioned it in an essay about Hawaii in The Saturday Evening Post that's now on Page 191 of "Slouching Towards Bethlehem") in Waikiki in 1947.
Back on the mainland, Peter Canlis, with the architect Roland Terry, built a Modernist structure in Seattle surrounded by deodar cedars and scots pines overlooking Lake Union. The Cascade range was visible in the distance and the building's generously sized windows and its prowlike position high above the water gave it a sense of elegance, transparency and distinction. Its stone hearth made it inviting. Peter Canlis lived on the building's second floor, treating guests on the first as if they had entered his home.
Peter capitalized on his relationship with Pan Am airlines, whose executives all knew him from frequent fights, to bring species of Hawaiian fish back to Canlis in Seattle. "They'd never seen mahi-mahi," Mark said. "He would put it between the jump seats on the plane and bribe the pilots with $20 bills." Canlis was the first dining room in the city known for its open kitchen, the first to serve fresh oysters and, according to the family, the first with a liquor license, allowing it to serve liquor by the drink. John Wayne, who'd visit Seattle on his yacht, the Wild Goose, was a regular. On his way out of the restaurant, he'd always happily curse at the cooks. "Everyone would cheer," Brian said.
When a third Canlis restaurant was installed on the top floor of the Portland Hilton, things took a turn right out of "Mad Men." "Peter and Conrad Hilton were pals," Brian said, "and there was deal in place to put Canlis restaurants in new Hiltons across the world. London, Paris, that kind of thing." But Peter balked at the idea of partnership. "He couldn't run a restaurant with somebody else even though it was so lucrative and such a big deal." To get out of the agreement, Peter flew down to Beverly Hills, got drunk, crashed a Hilton board meeting and cussed everybody out. "The board," Brian said, "refused on the spot to do business with a guy that crazy."
Flash forward to the Montana board meeting presided over by Mark and Brian Canlis, which was decidedly more sane. We had a gun, but limited booze. Big Steve handed out cigars with labels bearing his own picture. All the food, with the exception of 12 pounds of S Ranch T-bone, came from the restaurant in Seattle. We picked it up at Edwards Jet Center in Billings after catching a ride into town on a Cessna CJ3 belonging to a Canlis family friend. Coho salmon filets as long and as wide as the blades of canoe paddles, lumps of Dungeness crab, lobster tails and various vac-packed cooking and dipping liquids waited for us in a meticulously organized box. Fresh baked cookies had been set out for our arrival. Brian Canlis, who ran the lounge for Air Force One while enlisted in the military, identified them with one quick sniff: "I used to make those for George W. Bush," he said. "Otis Spunkmeyer. Bush loved them."
Before dinner, Mark and Brian were asked to help move a few hundred steaks-in-training from one gated pasture to another. They yelled out "Ya! Ya!" at the cows while the cows called out for their calves and their calves loudly lowed back. The range filled up with sound: families doing all they could to talk it out, move together, stay close.
Later, the board drank wine out of metal mugs (Côte-Rôtie, cabernet, riesling and a Rhone). They cooked their meal and talked about their feelings - openly, critically and questioningly - around the campfire because real talk is critical to the restaurant's existence. The Canlises hold dear the notion that their relationships with one another, and with their closest confidants, will be reflected and honored in the relationships they build with their staff and with their customers. It is every bit a restaurateur's version of psychotherapeutic transference.
"This is one of the most important things I'll do all year," said Mark, while Brian set a grate the length of a door over the fire. The coals burned low and hot, charring the steaks and the lobster tails, which Mark doused with vermouth from one of the vacuum-sealed bags. Potatoes wrapped in foil softened in the ashes beneath. Black truffle was shaved over everything and the sky choked up quickly with stars. "We're not making decisions out here," said Mark, knifing cold butter over the lobsters. "We're forming relationships. That's gold when you're running a business. All business is about relationships, unless you work in a lighthouse, and all relationships are about trust."

HEADLINE: The Stranded Unemployed

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A new report finds that people who lost work between 2009 and 2011 often aren't finding re-employment -- and even when they do find new work, many are taking major pay cuts. 

 BODY:
On Thursday I wrote about how incomes have declined sharply in the last few years, particularly for people approaching retirement age. A new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics sheds some light on why: People who lost work, especially if they're older, often aren't finding re-employment; even when they do find new work, they're taking major pay cuts.
The bureau's report looked at workers who were laid off from 2009 to 2011, and where they ended up as of January 2012. Of all these workers, just 56.9 percent had jobs as of January. Another 27.5 percent were still unemployed, and 15.7 percent had dropped out of the labor force altogether.
Older workers were much less likely to find re-employment, and more likely to drop out of the labor force.
Among workers near retirement -- ages 55 to 64 -- less than half found re-employment. And nearly a quarter just dropped out of the labor force.
Those 65 or older were even more likely to drop out of the labor force; about half (50.5 percent) did so. Remember, though, that people in that demographic have a relatively easier time getting by without a job because they can receive their full Social Security benefits.
Men were also more likely than women to find re-employment, with 60.5 percent of men and just 51.7 percent of women taking new jobs.
Women were much more likely to drop out of the labor force than remain unemployed if they did not find work. Many of these women have probably dropped out to become full-time parents, a career change that is still more socially acceptable for women than for men.
Re-employment rates varied greatly by race. Whites were most likely to find new work once laid off, while blacks were least likely. Of all black workers who were displaced between 2009 and 2011, just 47.3 percent had found new work of any kind by this January. More than a fifth just stopped looking.
The report also looked specifically at full-time workers who had had "longer tenures" before being laid off -- that is, workers displaced from jobs they had held for at least three years.
Like the overall pool of the displaced, just over half of these once "long-tenured" workers found new jobs by January. Of the members of this group who did find new jobs, nearly four out of five (79 percent) found full-time work. The rest sorted into part-time jobs or some form of self-employment.
Even those lucky enough to find new full-time jobs often took pay cuts, though.
As the pie chart below shows, 26.6 percent of those who found new full-time jobs accepted wages that were at least 20 percent less than their old jobs paid. Another 17.2 percent also accepted wages that were less than those for their previous jobs, but the pay demotions were not quite as severe.

HEADLINE: Regulatory SWAT Team May Have to Move Slowly on Money Funds

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Does the Financial Stability Oversight Council have the resolve to go down untrodden paths and officially designate money funds as a risk, especially in the few months before the presidential election? 

 BODY:
A SWAT team of top regulators was formed after the financial crisis to swoop in and stamp out big risks lurking in the financial system. Should the mutual fund industry fear this team as it tries to protect one of its biggest products from further reform?
The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday that it would have to drop its proposed overhaul of the money market mutual fund industry after it was a clear that a majority of its commissioners would not support the reforms. Investors use money market funds like banks accounts, a theoretically safe place to park cash for short periods. But many investors fled the funds during the financial crisis in 2008. Regulators have therefore wanted to impose changes they think would prevent such runs.
After the S.E.C. defeat, regulators are contemplating pursuing money fund overhaul through the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a body composed mostly of the heads of essentially a supercommittee of financial regulators. It was set up by the Dodd-Frank legislation to identify systemic risks that individual regulators may not have a grip on -- and then set in motion moves to remove those risks. The council, which is led by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, has said that money funds are a concern, and backed the reforms scuttled at the S.E.C.
On paper, the council certainly has the freedom and power to take up money market funds, and then identify them as an area of risk.
"F.S.O.C. exists for this very circumstance," said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a lobbying group that has pushed for stronger financial regulation.
But the big question is whether the council has the resolve to go down untrodden paths and officially designate money funds as a risk, especially in the few months before the presidential election.
In some ways the council has to act. The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve have both supported money fund reform, saying they remain vulnerable. Therefore, failure to use the council would mean they were resigned to letting a systemic risk remain.
Conversely, they may balk when they think through what they have to do.
One concern in Washington may be that if the council takes up money funds, it would damage the standing of the funds' primary regulator, the S.E.C. Darrell Duffie, a professor of finance at Stanford University, says the council should act on money funds, but he adds, "there would be a weakening of the S.E.C."
Even though the council has freedom to label money funds a risk, its two main options present serious challenges. One is to designate the whole money fund industry as a risk. But the Dodd-Frank legislation effectively says that if the council recommended money fund reforms, the S.E.C., as the funds' primary regulator, would also have to sign off on them. The S.E.C.'s current commissioners might not vote for the recommendations. But another set might.
Another option: The council might designate individual money funds, or the companies that manage them, as systemically important. Those funds would then end up regulated by the Fed, which could decide to impose new rules.
But the council's members might worry that picking only some funds could create instability in the sector and create an unlevel playing field.
That would be something that the mutual fund companies would most likely emphasize.
"Designating one money market fund as a significantly important financial institution won't accomplish much except destroy that one money market fund," said Jay G. Baris, a lawyer at Morrison & Foerster, which has represented fund companies.
But Mr. Kelleher, who favors reforms, said the council could simply designate, say, the 100 largest funds as systemically important, which would mean regulation of most of the industry.
The opponents of the reforms acknowledge that the council has a lot of authority, but they say it will still need to present a thorough analysis of the costs and benefits of the reforms. The council "would not be able to operate arbitrarily without standards," said Robert M. Kurucza, a partner at the law firm Goodwin Procter.
As a result, the council will most likely move slowly and carefully. Not only will it need to build a detailed case for designating money funds as a risky sector, it will also want to make doubly sure that it properly fulfills its own procedures.
In other words, don't expect to see this SWAT team bursting into the money fund sector anytime soon - even if President Obama wins re-election.
An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the law firm Goodwin Procter as Godwin Procter.

HEADLINE: Will Emissions Disclosure Mean Investor Pressure on Polluters?

BYLINE: DYLAN WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: A new financial tool is aimed at encouraging greater disclosure about greenhouse gas emissions from companies while, hopefully, also pushing investors to build more responsible portfolios. 

 BODY:
A new financial tool developed by the investment firm South Pole Carbon, in partnership with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, provides greenhouse gas emissions profiles of more than 40,000 publicly listed companies. This index is aimed at encouraging greater disclosure from companies while, hopefully, also pushing investors to build more responsible portfolios.
The Agenda: Planet
The lagging United States response to climate change.
"Investors have long been aware that the greenhouse gas profile, especially of major emitters like electric utilities, is a potential liability," said Paul Bledsoe, a senior adviser on energy issues at the Bipartisan Policy Center.
The natural gas industry, for example, has cited the possibility of regulation of greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency to help explain its market rise next to coal's loss of market share. And a recent open letter to the Bank of England that included signatories from Oxford University and the London School of Economics admonished the bank to "investigate how the U.K.'s exposure to high-carbon investments might pose a systemic risk to our financial system."
Nonetheless, in the absence of strong greenhouse gas regulation, it is unclear how significantly emission patterns contribute to investor decision-making, Mr. Bledsoe said. Over the last three decades, many investors have focused increasingly on short-term returns. For those who do, the shifting winds of policy debate or the comparatively glacial process of policy development are largely irrelevant. That means such considerations tend not to surface in share value.
"Most investing is done very quickly," said Brad Gentry, a professor at Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies who specializes in the connection between private investment and environmental performance. "This is a huge problem in terms of reflecting" the potential risk contained in a company's greenhouse gas emissions.
And yet, in not-so-subtle irony, one of the direct effects of these emissions has unequivocal influence over many investments: A recent survey by the nonprofit research group Ceres found that 77 percent of asset managers view climate change as a material risk or opportunity.
An investment firm might forgo investment in a beachside resort in light of the risk from rising seas, but that same firm would have little problem investing in Exxon Mobil, even if its emissions are contributing to rising seas.
Beyond its debated usefulness to investors, Mr. Gentry indicated that companies were using this data in surprising and often sophisticated ways, scrutinizing, for example, the potential for high emissions to tarnish a brand. "This kind of information is used widely by companies, and it's their behavior you ultimately want to affect," he said.
These emissions profiles can also feed information into the growing area of legally mandated disclosure initiatives, like the

HEADLINE: In South Dakota, Only the Farm Trumps Conservatism

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: With no major city, few minorities and few union members, South Dakota is rough terrain for Democratic presidential candidates. The last Democrat to carry the state was Lyndon Johnson in 1964. 

 BODY:
South Dakota has always been a Republican state. Even with a missing finger, you could count on one hand the times the state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate. The last Democrat to carry the state was Lyndon Johnson in 1964.
Gallup, measuring the percentage of residents in each state who identify with either the Democratic Party or Republican Party, ranked South Dakota as the ninth most Republican. It is one of the least diverse states and one of the top gun-owning states. Barring the unforeseen, Mitt Romney will win South Dakota's three electoral votes.
Yet, South Dakota has several characteristics that allow Democrats - though rarely Democratic presidential candidates - to win statewide elections. First and foremost is the state's agrarian roots. The state's political culture has been described as "agrarian conservatism," and when the latter conflicts with the former, agrarian interests almost always take precedence.
In addition, South Dakota's small population - less than 825,000 residents according to the Census Bureau's 2011 estimate - enables charismatic campaigners, even Democrats, to compensate for ideological discrepancies between the candidate and the electorate.
Generally speaking, South Dakota goes from conservative in the east to more conservative in the west, Ms. Fouberg said.
In 2008, when President Obama lost the state by 8.5 percentage points, most of his strongest counties were in the east, in the Sioux Falls area, in Clay County where the University of South Dakota is based, and around Aberdeen. The only counties Mr. Obama won west of the James River were sparsely populated with large American Indian populations.
But eastern South Dakota is not liberal by any means. Mr. Obama carried Sioux Falls's Minnehaha County by only 587 votes. There is more latent support for Democrats in the east partly because that is where the state's populist movement was strongest, Mr. Card said. In 1890, South Dakota reformers founded the nation's first populist party, the Independent Party, partly to help protect the family farm. Since then, when Republicans have lost at the ballot box, it's often been to a populist, or populist-tinged, candidate campaigning on farming issues.
The easternmost slice of the state, where most South Dakotans live, is essentially an extension of the Corn Belt. Agriculture, including soybeans, corn, cattle and hogs, is still a major industry in South Dakota, but the state's economy is more diversified than it once was, with substantial health care, manufacturing and financial services sectors. Tourism is also a major economic driver in South Dakota, largely because of Mount Rushmore, and the state's unemployment rate has been well below the national average for some time.
Sioux Falls is a major hub for the credit card and banking industries, including Citibank, which was lured to South Dakota after the state eliminated usury caps in the early 1980s. Without usury limits, the financial services sector ballooned. More than 18,000 people in South Dakota now work in financial services.
Traveling west the land becomes more arid and much less populated. Central and western South Dakota are part of the Great Plains, and - outside the counties with Democratic-leaning American Indian reservations - uniformly Republican. Native Americans, particularly Sioux tribes, are the only substantial minority group in South Dakota, making up 9 percent of the population. The far western edge of the state, around Rapid City in the Black Hills, also has a strong libertarian streak, Mr. Card said.
Considering how conservative the state is, Democratic candidates for House and Senate have done surprisingly well. During the last half-century, South Dakota has always had at least one Democratic senator or representative, a confusing tendency given the state's consistent preference for Republicans in elections of presidents and governors.
But South Dakota is heavily reliant on the federal government, to support both farms and roads and infrastructure to connect such an expansive state. That fact has led many to conclude, Mr. Card said, "that we send our Democrats to bring home the bacon."
The Bellwether: Codington County
Anchored by Watertown, Codington County was just one percentage point more Democratic than the statewide vote in 2008, just one point more Republican in 2004, and spot on in 2000.
"Codington County is a good mixture of farming, ranching, industry and service sectors," Ms. Fouberg said, "Economically, it is a microcosm of the state. 
The Bottom Line
With no major city, few minorities and few union members, there is barely an organized left in South Dakota, Mr. Miller said. "Even the university people aren't that liberal," he said.
In order to overcome South Dakota's conservatism, Democratic candidates usually need an opening on agrarian issues. A good example is the 1986 election of Tom Daschle, the former majority leader in the Senate. The farm crisis of the 1980s was still haunting South Dakota, and Ronald Reagan's farm policies were deeply unpopular in the state.
Mr. Daschle also took advantage of South Dakota's small population, reportedly knocking on 40,000 doors during the campaign. During his time in office, Mr. Daschle would tour almost all of South Dakota's 66 counties each August.
It is hard to imagine those circumstances applying to a Democratic presidential candidate. Neither major party has a clear advantage on farm issues, and a Democratic candidate would be loath to spend much time kissing South Dakotan babies for three electoral votes. The FiveThirtyEight model currently has Mr. Romney as a 98 percent favorite to carry the state, and - unless something unforeseen occurs - it is not likely South Dakota will favor a Democratic presidential candidate any time soon.

HEADLINE: GOP Intellectual Decline, Monetary Edition

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Gold buggism triumphant. 

 BODY:
There was a time, not long ago, when Republicans -- whatever you might think of their other ideas -- were part of the mainstream consensus on monetary policy. Here's the Economic Report of the President from 2004 (pdf), presumably written by Greg Mankiw:
Aggressive monetary policy can reduce the depth of a recession. 
But now we have Mitt Romney declaring his intention to replace Ben Bernanke for, um, pursuing aggressive monetary policy to fight a recession (not aggressive enough, but that's another issue). Romney:
I want to make sure the Federal Reserve focuses on maintaining the monetary stability that leads to a strong dollar and confidence that America is not going to go down the road that other nations have gone down, to their peril.
And the GOP platform will reportedly include a call for steps toward a return to the gold standard.
The really strange thing about all this is that this turn toward hard-money mysticism is taking place even as events have demonstrated that the advantages of being on a gold standard, of having a fiat currency that can be printed freely in emergencies, are even greater than standard analysis had supposed.
Mark Thoma links to an old piece of mine that I think does a pretty good job of laying out that standard case; but we now know that there's a major additional concern, the ability of the central bank to act as lender of last resort to the government as well as private banks. Consider, as Paul De Grauwe has in one of the most important analyses (pdf) to come out of the crisis, the contrast between Spain and the UK. Their medium-term fiscal outlooks are comparable, at least according to the IMF:
Source: IMF
But borrowing costs have soared in Spain, while falling in Britain:
Source: Eurostat
So the GOP has decided that we must reject the evils of fiat money and go for the gold standard at precisely the moment when events have demonstrated that fiat money is a really useful thing and the loss of flexibility that comes from ending fiat currencies can be utterly disastrous. What's going on?
I think Yglesias has this right: 
Commodity-backed money is basically a solution to a non-problem. Or at least it's not a problem you have if you don't accept a Randian deeply moralized view of market outcomes. The existince of fiat money is embarassing to that kind of ideology, so it inspires quests for alternatives to modern central banking even when the alternatives don't make sense.
In this sense fiat money is like, oh, Social Security. The problem it creates for conservatives is not that it doesn't work, but that it does -- which is a challenge to their philosophy. And so it must die.

HEADLINE: A National Champion Trucker, With a Record Nearly as Spotless as His Trophy

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: Don Logan, with just one accident in over 2.1 million miles of travel as a commercial trucker, won the American Trucking Association's 2012 National Truck Driving Championships. 

 BODY:
Over the 2.1 million miles Don Logan has driven a commercial truck, he has been involved in only one road accident; a drunken driver collided with his rig in 1996.
The record of the 44-year-old FedEx Freight trucker is otherwise spotless, according to his employer. And a safety-first approach to his craft led Mr. Logan of Eskridge, Kan., to a first-place finish in the American Trucking Association's 2012 National Truck Driving Championships.
The event, held Aug. 7-11 in Minneapolis, featured nine classes and three skills components, including a written test covering the trucking industry's extensive rules and regulations; a visual inspection in which drivers have to find defects deliberately introduced on test trucks; and an obstacle course that simulates occupational hazards like parking at loading docks, stopping on scales, parallel parking and driving with low clearance. An alignment text required drivers to position their tires next to a strip of red tape.
Mr. Logan, who also won the individual flatbed competition and vehicle condition award this year, is a six-time winner at the state level. Not all of his behind-the-wheel skills translate to driving passenger cars, but many of them do, and he has useful advice.
"The easiest thing for people to do is increase their following distances," he said in a telephone interview. "Everybody thinks you'll get to your destination quicker if you tailgate, but in fact maintaining enough space so you have time to react won't add much time to your commute." A second piece of advice: "Be aware of what's around you all the time, and don't text and drive because you don't want to be guilty of distracted driving."
Commercial truck drivers certainly have financial incentives to heed Mr. Logan's word. Fines for distracted driving are significantly higher, up to $11,000, than they are for drivers of passenger cars. He also said the popular image of truck drivers popping amphetamines to stay awake was long out of date. "Commercial drivers are held to a high standard," he said.
Mr. Logan was on the road to exemplary performance at a young age. "I started driving trucks at age 14 at our family's farm 35 miles from Topeka," he said. "I got my commercial driver's license at 18 and drove for my father in his silage business, which turned corn plants into animal feed."
In 1991, Mr. Logan tired of being removed from home for long stretches, so he began making shorter regional hauls for Arkansas Freightways, which later operated as American Freightways before its acquisition by FedEx. For the parcel service, he makes a night run of 508 miles round trip, driving a 2011 Volvo daycab -- a rig without a sleeper compartment -- with a 400-horsepower diesel engine and automatic transmission, pulling twin trailers.
Winning the competition will not bring about much change in Mr. Logan's life; first prize was $1,000. Regardless, he derives his sense of achievement from the job, not the award.
"I believe I am moving a little part of America," Mr. Logan said. "The food you ate this morning, the clothes you wear, the computer you're typing on, at some point all of them moved by truck. What we do is very important to the nation's economy."

HEADLINE: Evidence vs. Ideology in the Medicare Debate

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: If Republican leaders were serious about strengthening Medicare, they would find a way to lower costs, rather than passing on the risk of higher premiums to the elderly, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
When formulating public policy, evidence should be accorded more weight than ideology, and facts should matter more than shibboleths. The Romney-Ryan plan for Medicare reform depends on assertions that are ideologically consistent. But the Republicans plan is not supported by the evidence and does not survive serious scrutiny.
Perhaps that's why the Romney campaign has been deliberately misrepresenting President Obama's Medicare record.
Mitt Romney characterizes the $716 billion of Medicare savings over the next 10 years, contained in the Affordable Care Act, as President Obama's "raid" on the Medicare program to pay for his health care program. This fear-mongering is simply untrue. These savings result from reforms to slow the growth of Medicare spending per enrollee - there are no cuts in Medicare benefits.
The reforms include both voluntary and mandatory changes in how providers deliver health care to promote better care coordination at lower cost, reward the quality and outcomes of services rather than their volume and reduce fraud and abuse.
For example, the law fosters the creation of accountable-care organizations, i.e., groups of providers willing to accept a flat fee for the integrated care provided to their Medicare patients. Accountable-care organizations represent a major step away from the unsustainable fee-for-service model that rewards the number of procedures rather than the quality of care.
Health experts believe that these organizations will significantly improve care and lower costs not just in Medicare but throughout the health care system. This belief is based on evidence, not ideology.
Medicare beneficiaries will also benefit from reforms that penalize hospitals for preventable re-admissions reflecting complications from previous procedures and that require hospitals to post their rates of medical errors, with penalties for those with the highest rates.
Both Governor Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan have promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act and with it the reforms behind the $716 billion in Medicare savings (although Mr. Ryan duplicitously counts the savings from these reforms in his deficit-reduction plan). Medicare beneficiaries would be the losers. They would lose the benefits of better care at lower cost. They would lose the plan's expanded Medicare coverage for prevention benefits and prescription drugs, and they would be forced to pay higher premiums and co-pays as a result of faster growth in Medicare costs.
President Obama's health care plan is not a raid on Medicare; it is . If the Affordable Care Act had not met this standard, the AARP would not have endorsed it.
The plan adds eight years to the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund while reducing the federal deficit by more than $100 billion over the next 10 years and by about a half of 1 percent of gross domestic product, or about $1 trillion from 2023 through 2032. This is according to the Congressional Budget Office, a trusted nonpartisan arbiter in federal budgetary matters.
In contrast, the last major health legislation, the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill, added about $400 billion to the 10-year deficit. Mr. Ryan, the self-described deficit firebrand, supported this bill, without a single dollar in savings or additional revenue to offset its costs.
Now Mr. Ryan has espoused - and Governor Romney has embraced -- a proposal to transform Medicare into a premium support system. This is part of the Romney-Ryan plan to reduce the federal deficit while cutting taxes, especially for high-income earners, and slashing spending on Medicare and other government programs.
Among commentators, fiscal responsibility is often equated with imposing some of the burden of deficit reduction on Medicare beneficiaries. This is a meretricious gauge of fiscal "seriousness."
Representative Ryan has won praise from many deficit hawks for his advocacy of premium support, but this praise is unwarranted. There is no evidence that such a system would control Medicare spending more effectively than the current Medicare program strengthened by Affordable Care Act reforms. Indeed, the evidence points decisively in the opposite direction.
In Mr. Ryan's latest premium-support proposal, the government would provide a subsidy to Medicare beneficiaries to choose among competing insurance plans, including the traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan. Starting for 65-year-olds in 2022, insurance plans would take part in an annual bidding process to compete for Medicare beneficiaries. The bids would reflect the actual growth of health-care costs and would determine the size of the federal subsidy.
Advocates of premium support argue that competition would encourage more cost-sensitive behavior by beneficiaries, providers and insurers. The facts do not support this.
Just consider that despite competition and choice, private insurance premiums per enrollee for comparable coverage have increased more rapidly than Medicare spending per enrollee for more than 30 years. Medicare's superior performance is all the more remarkable since its elderly beneficiaries include a sizable share of the sickest individuals who are the largest consumers of health care services. And Medicare's cost advantage is likely to continue into the future.
According to a recent study, with implementation of the Affordable Care Act reforms, Medicare spending per enrollee is likely to grow by 3.1 percent a year during the next 10 years, about the same as the projected annual growth rate for G.D.P. per capita, while private insurance per enrollee is likely to grow by 5 percent a year.
What explains Medicare's sustained cost advantage over private insurance? Medicare has much lower administrative costs than private insurance. And Medicare has considerable negotiating leverage with providers as a result of its huge enrollment. The new law strengthens this leverage. Private insurance plans have been unwilling or unable to drive reforms to reduce provider costs, preferring instead to pass rising costs on to consumers through higher premiums, relying on Medicare to spearhead efficiency-enhancing reforms.
As I explained in a previous Economix post, this is why the C.B.O. has consistently refused to recognize large potential savings in health care costs from reforms that merely increase competition among private insurance plans.
Indeed, the C.B.O. has concluded that replacing traditional Medicare with competition among such plans would drive up total health-care spending per Medicare beneficiary. Which is why Representative Ryan was compelled to place an arbitrary growth cap on the size of the subsidy in his premium support proposal.
That was the only way he could secure C.B.O.-scored budgetary savings. But imposing such a cap separates the growth of the subsidy from the growth of health care costs and transforms the premium-support system into a voucher system.
A voucher system would do little to control the growth of health care costs, but it would shift their burden onto Medicare beneficiaries in the form of higher premiums and reduced care. Cost-shifting should not be confused with cost containment.
Mr. Ryan asserts that the 1998 bipartisan Medicare Commission proposed premium support as a solution to Medicare's financing challenges. But he fails to mention that all of the commission members appointed by President Clinton, including me, voted against this idea.
Since then, the evidence has confirmed that competition among private insurance plans would not yield Medicare savings without harming beneficiaries. To achieve this goal, enforceable payment and cost-containment reforms like those in the Affordable Care Act are necessary.
A "serious" deficit hawk committed to saving and strengthening Medicare, not one whose primary goals are repealing health-care reform and cutting taxes for the wealthy, would base his Medicare plan on the evidence. Mr. Ryan and his running mate can't be serious.

HEADLINE: Aug. 23: Seven Ways to Evaluate a Poll

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: State polls released Thursday were strong for Mr. Obama, especially when you consider some of the factors in a survey beyond the headline numbers. 

 BODY:
Each night before I run our presidential forecast model, I make a guess at what it will say based on my impressionistic take on the data from that day.
I figured that Thursday would be something of a push. Barack Obama held the lead in a number of state polls. But the numbers were not necessarily better for him than the prior renditions of the same surveys. Also, Mitt Romney got a strong number in the Fox News national survey -- and the stock market declined fairly significantly, which lowered the model's economic index.
The conclusion of the model was less equivocal. It evaluated the state polls as being quite strong for Mr. Obama, and they outweighed the other factors. His chances of winning the Electoral College rose to 68.6 percent in the forecast from 66.7 percent on Wednesday.
Mr. Obama saw the most improvement to his forecast in Ohio, where his winning chances improved to 70 percent from 64 percent. In that state, there was a new survey from Quinnipiac, which was conducted in conjunction with the New York Times and CBS News. It gave Mr. Obama a 6-point lead there. There was also a survey from the University of Cincinnati, which put him ahead by three points.
Let's focus on that Quinnipiac poll, however. It showed Mr. Obama with a six-point lead. But Mr. Obama had a lead by the same margin in its July poll. So why does the model evaluate it as a significant positive for him?
The reason is that looking at changes in poll numbers is a useful habit, but hardly the only comparison you should be making. 
Instead, there are at least seven ways that you might evaluate a poll as being strong or weak for a candidate. In the case of the Ohio poll, the comparison to the July survey showed no net change toward either candidate -- but the poll was nevertheless strong for Mr. Obama by several of these measures.
1. How does the poll compare to other recent surveys of the state? This is a simple one, and in the Quinnipiac poll, this comparison was favorable for Mr. Obama. He led by six points, better than his average lead of one point in the other Ohio surveys conducted so far in August. 
2. How does the poll compare to the polling firm's previous surveys in the state? Note my usage of the plural, surveys. You should be looking at how a new poll compares to the prior one that a survey firm released in a state -- but also in comparison to its entire body of work there.
For example, suppose that a polling firm conducts a survey of Virginia every month. In February, March, April, May and June, the survey shows a small but consistent lead for Mr. Romney of between one and three percentage points.
Then, suddenly, Mr. Romney's lead increases to 10 points in the July poll. 
What would qualify as a good number for Mr. Romney when the firm releases its August survey?
If the August poll put Mr. Romney eight points ahead, that would still count as a very strong number for him. It's down a bit from the July poll, but much better than he'd gotten in the other months of the year. 
When a poll initially appears to be an outlier, you should expect there to be some reversion to the mean the next time the firm takes the temperature of the state. In these cases, just holding steady in a poll can count as a big "win" for a candidate, since what once looked like an outlier now looks like more of a trend. Even falling by a point or two can be a pretty decent result under some circumstances.
The July Quinnipiac poll in Ohio, which gave Mr. Obama a six-point lead, was not quite an outlier; Mr. Obama has periodically gotten numbers like that in Ohio throughout the campaign. Still, it was better for Mr. Obama than the surveys that Quinnipiac had conducted in Ohio prior to July, which put him up by an average of three points. (Moreover, the polls Quinnipiac conducted prior to July had been conducted among registered voters rather than likely voters. Usually, the shift to likely voters harms the Democratic candidate - but in this poll Mr. Obama's numbers have improved instead.) 
3. How does the survey compare with the polling firm's surveys in states? A related question is whether the polling has a strong "house effect." That is, does it consistently show greater numbers for a particular candidate, no matter where it polls? If so, then it's not really a big deal when it ventures into a new state and prints another one.
Or, does it show strong numbers for a candidate in some states, but not others? This is more of the case with Quinnipiac. It has had good numbers for Mr. Obama in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania recently - but not as much in the other swing states that it polls, or in noncompetitive states like New York or in its national surveys. In fact, the model calculates Quinnipiac's house effect as being just a tiny bit Republican-leaning on balance. That makes its poll showing a solid lead for Mr. Obama in Ohio more meaningful.
4. How does the poll compare with the national trend? This is the trickiest of the seven concepts, but one of the more important ones. When comparing a poll with prior surveys of the state, it's important to look at exactly when each survey was conducted, and what the national environment looked like at the time.
Say a polling firm comes out with a new survey in Michigan, showing Mr. Obama seven points ahead there. The firm's lone prior poll of the state had been in February, when it also had Mr. Obama seven points up. 
This would count as a favorable development for Mr. Obama. Why? Because February was a very strong month for Mr. Obama in the polls. (At the time, Mr. Romney's numbers were really suffering because of his problems in the Republican primaries.) You'd have anticipated some decline for Mr. Obama since then; if his numbers held steady instead, that would defy your expectations and would be a constitute a positive sign for him.
Likewise, the last couple weeks have shown stronger numbers for Mr. Romney than he got in July. (Perhaps this was because of a small bounce for Mr. Romney following the selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan as his running mate.) That is priced into the model at this point. When a new survey comes out, its expectation is that the numbers will be a point or so stronger for Mr. Romney than they were a month ago -- and it will be disappointed in Mr. Romney if he does not match them.
The state polls that Mr. Romney got on Thursday were not terrible by any means. But they looked more like the numbers we were seeing in June and July - when Mr. Obama led in the vast majority of swing state polls - and less like what we were seeing over the past few weeks, when Mr. Romney was leading in almost half of the polls in states like these.
A side note: Be careful of making comparisons to polls conducted immediately after the party conventions, when the candidates can experience significant (but short-lived) bounces. Say that Mr. Romney holds a seven-point lead in a North Carolina poll conducted in the immediate aftermath of next week's Republican National Convention, a time when Mr. Romney might be enjoying a significant bounce in the polls. The polling firm surveys the state again in late September, and Mr. Romney's lead is down to one point.
When something like this happens, you'll see blogs with headlines like "Romney Collapsing in North Carolina!" You should avoid taking these very seriously. All that happened is that you are comparing a poll conducted in the midst of Mr. Romney's convention bounce to one that wasn't. It is unlikely that the change tells you anything about North Carolina in particular.
5. How does the poll compare with the historical trend in a state? A state poll can be used to make an inference about where the national race stands. Ohio, for example, is typically very slightly Republican-leaning relative to the country as a whole. So when Mr. Obama gets a poll showing him 6 points ahead there, that speaks favorably to his position in the national race.
A related point is that the states often revert to the mean over the course of an election cycle. If a candidate seems to be overperforming in a particular state - as Mr. Obama has been in Ohio - there can be downward pressure on his numbers as the state's partisan gravity kicks in. 
Our forecast model accounts for this property. It is designed to be a little skeptical that, for instance, Mr. Obama is actually leading by a larger margin in Ohio (by about three points in the polls) than in the national numbers (where he leads by about two points). However, the longer a candidate is able to defy gravity, the more confidence we might have that there is something different about the state this year.
6. How does the poll relate to the electoral calendar? Any time that a candidate is leading in a state, and he simply maintains that lead, that counts as a modest positive for him because time is running off his opponent's clock. A three-point deficit in April is very easy to overcome. In August? Still plenty of time, but there's room for a touch of concern. On election eve? Oops - it's probably too late. 
There's no need for Mr. Romney to panic yet, especially since he has gotten his share of decent state polls recently. But if Mr. Obama still holds a three-point lead in Ohio after the party conventions, it's going to qualify as a negative for Mr. Romney every time that he fails to reduce the gap.
7. How does the number of undecided voters compare with prior renditions of the survey? In general, I focus on the margin between the candidates ("Mr. Obama's up by three points") rather than their absolute numbers ("Mr. Obama 47 percent, Mr. Romney 44 percent"), or the number of undecided voters in the state.
This is partly because there are a lot of myths about how undecided voters behave, and I don't want to encourage those. 
But the main reason is that, just as there are house effects related to whether a polling firm leans Republican or Democratic, different polling firms also consistently show more or fewer undecided voters, depending on how much the survey questions "push" voters toward a candidate choice. Our model actually adjusts for this, but it's something that can escape your attention unless you're being super detail-oriented.
Nevertheless, there is some useful information in the number of undecided voters in a race - especially when you are making comparisons to the prior editions of the same survey. 
As a rule, the fewer undecided voters in a state, the less uncertainty there is about the eventual outcome. Thus, the candidate who is leading in a state should be pleased when the number of undecided voters falls, as this can make a small lead more robust. A 49-47 deficit is harder to overcome than 45-43, even though the margin between the candidates is two points in each instance.
***
Isn't this an awful lot to keep track of? It certainly is, and that's why a computer program can come in handy. The model can and does evaluate all this context when it considers a poll, and sometimes it concludes that a set of survey results are stronger or weaker for a candidate than they might appear on the surface.
Then again, the story of Thursday's polls wasn't all that complicated: Mr. Obama held leads in all six of the polls released of voters in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan - and Mr. Romney will need to win at least two of those states, and possibly three, to have much of a chance in the Electoral College. Mr. Romney has had some strong polling days recently, but this was not one of his better ones.

HEADLINE: Starving the Future

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
America is in trouble.
Emerging economic powers China and India are heavily investing in educating the world's future workers while we squabble about punishing teachers and coddling children.
This week, the Center for American Progress and the Center for the Next Generation released a report entitled ''The Race That Really Matters: Comparing U.S., Chinese and Indian Investments in the Next Generation Workforce.'' The findings were breathtaking:
Half of U.S. children get no early childhood education, and we have no national strategy to increase enrollment. 
More than a quarter of U.S. children have a chronic health condition, such as obesity or asthma, threatening their capacity to learn.
More than 22 percent of U.S. children lived in poverty in 2010, up from about 17 percent in 2007.
More than half of U.S. postsecondary students drop out without receiving a degree.
Now compare that with the report's findings on China. It estimates that ''by 2030, China will have 200 million college graduates -- more than the entire U.S. work force,'' and points out that by 2020 China plans to:
Enroll 40 million children in preschool, a 50 percent increase from today.
Provide 70 percent of children in China with three years of preschool.
Graduate 95 percent of Chinese youths through nine years of compulsory education (that's 165 million students, more than the U.S. labor force).
Ensure that no child drops out of school for financial reasons.
More than double enrollment in higher education.
And the report also points out that ''by 2017, India will graduate 20 million people from high school -- or five times as many as in the United States.''
As I have mentioned before, a book written last year by Jim Clifton, the chairman of Gallup, called ''The Coming Jobs War,'' pointed out that of the world's five billion people over 15 years old, three billion said they worked or wanted to work, but there are only 1.2 billion full-time, formal jobs.
This should make it crystal clear to every American that we don't have any time -- or students -- to waste. Every child in this country must be equipped to perform. The country's future financial stability depends on it.
As if to underscore that point, the Center for American Progress pointed out that ''between 2000 and 2008, China graduated 1.14 million people in the STEM, or Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, subjects; the United States graduated 496,000.''
But instead of dramatically upping our investment in our children's education so that they'll be able to compete in a future that has more educated foreign job seekers, we seem to be moving in the opposite direction. A White House report issued last Saturday noted that:
''Since the end of the recession in June 2009, the economy lost over 300,000 local education jobs. The loss of education jobs stands in stark contrast to every other recovery in recent years, under Republican and Democratic administrations.''
Not only is our education system being starved of investment, but many of our children are literally too hungry to learn.
A survey of kindergarten through eighth-grade teachers released this week by Share Our Strength, a nonprofit that seeks to end child hunger, found that 6 in 10 of those teachers say ''students regularly come to school hungry because they are not getting enough to eat at home,'' and ''a majority of teachers who see hunger as a problem believe that the problem is growing.''
The report quotes a teacher in the Midwest as saying, ''The saddest are the children who cry when we get out early for a snow day because they won't get lunch.''
It is in this environment that Representative Paul Ryan proposes huge cuts to food assistance programs. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities points out, Ryan's plan ''includes cuts in SNAP (formerly known as the food stamp program) of $133.5 billion -- more than 17 percent -- over the next 10 years (2013-22), which would necessitate ending assistance for millions of low-income families, cutting benefits for millions of such households, or some combination of the two.''
Representative Todd Akin, he of ''legitimate rape'' infamy, even said earlier this month that the federal government should stop financing the National School Lunch Program altogether. That man is just a font of humanity.
We will need to make choices as we seek to balance the nation's budget and reduce the deficit, but cutting investments in our children is horribly shortsighted.
And, as we pursue educational reforms, beating up on teachers -- who are underpaid, overworked and always blamed -- is a distraction from the real problem: We're being outpaced in producing the employees of the future.
We're cutting back, while our children's future competitors are plowing ahead.

HEADLINE: Under 40 and Underwater

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
The country's underwater homes are slowly resurfacing as the housing market improves. But younger borrowers are still more likely to be submerged, a new report from real estate site Zillow.com finds. 
Overall levels of negative equity improved in the second quarter of the year compared with the first quarter, as home values continue to rise. But about half of borrowers under 40 still owe more than their homes are worth, the analysis found.
Younger borrowers are more likely to be affected by negative equity in part because they generally have been in their home for shorter periods of time and had less time to build equity before the housing debacle. But on the bright side, younger borrowers tend to be in relatively "shallow" water compared to older borrowers and are less likely to be delinquent on payments, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow.com.
The disproportionate impact on younger borrowers may actually have a helpful effect on home values, by creating tight inventory of homes for sale. Younger borrowers trapped by negative equity tend to be reluctant to sell, even though their homes are often the most attractive to first-time buyers who might be ready to plunge into the market. "Sellers don't want to sell, even if buyers want to buy," he said.
When they do sell, prices are higher - which helps push values up. The process is actually moving the market toward recovery, but it's a gradual process, he said. "Over all, the second-quarter report is positive," said Mr. Humphries. "The housing market is healing, albeit slowly."
These results come from the second edition of the new Zillow Negative Equity Report, which looks at current, outstanding loan amounts for individual, owner-occupied homes, and compares them to those homes' current estimated values.
Of the 30 largest markets tracked by Zillow, negative equity fell the most from the first to the second quarter in the Phoenix metropolitan area (from nearly 56 percent to about 52 percent) and the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area (from 46 percent to roughly 44 percent). The Las Vegas market continues to have the highest rate of negative equity, with nearly 69 percent of borrowers underwater (down from 71 percent in the first quarter.)
Are you an under-fortysomething with negative equity in your home? What will it take to get you to sell?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Stock Market Leads Most Others In Recovery

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THE American stock market has returned to record territory -- at least when dividends are included -- but few other stock markets have done so. A survey of the major markets of the world indicates that North America was the best place to be for investors who chose to ride out the credit crisis, while the euro zone was clearly the worst.
The emerging markets that aroused the most envy during the boom -- the so-called BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China -- have done poorly. 
The accompanying chart shows the performance of 30 stock markets around the world from Oct. 31, 2007, when the world stock market peaked, through March 9, 2009, when it hit bottom during the worst part of the financial crisis, and shows how each of the markets has done from the peak through early this week.
The chart is based on MSCI indexes, which include the major stocks of each country and are calculated in the same fashion. The figures reflect performance in dollars rather than in local currencies. Included are the 23 countries that MSCI classified as developed when the market peaked in 2007, as well as seven prominent emerging markets. They reflect total returns, assuming the reinvestment of dividends.
The countries farthest to the right on the chart suffered less than others during the 2007-9 bear market, while those higher on the chart have performed the best over all since the 2007 peak.
Excluding dividends, no major market is above its 2007 peak.
Over all, the MSCI All Country index fell 58 percent during the decline. It remains 13 percent below the 2007 peak, even assuming reinvestment of dividends.
The worldwide nature of the 2007-9 plunge is illustrated by the fact that each of the 30 markets lost at least half of its value by the time markets bottomed. In only two of the countries -- Japan and Switzerland -- did the market decline less than the United States market, which fell by 55 percent.
The United States index was 2 percent higher this week than it had been at the peak more than four years ago. That is hardly the type of performance that would have seemed attractive then, but only Mexico and Singapore have done better over the stretch. The Swedish market is also up a bit from the 2007 peak.
At the other end of the spectrum is Greece, the only market that is now lower than it was at the 2009 low. Recessions ended in most other countries, but the Greek depression continues and shows no signs of ending. The country is getting by with international assistance, but its membership in the euro zone means that it has been unable to stimulate its economy through currency devaluation.
It comes as no surprise that the other troubled euro countries are also near the bottom of the performance list, but even the euro countries that have done relatively well have suffered. The 11 euro zone countries that are included are all among the bottom 14 countries in performance since the 2007 peak. The other three are the BRIC countries other than Brazil.
Why has the United States done so (relatively) well? Part of the answer may be the belief that dollar-denominated assets are a safe haven at a time of currency instability. In addition, the American economy, while hardly soaring, has performed better than most, with corporate profits especially strong. There are indications that those profits are beginning to come under pressure, however, which may make further gains more difficult to achieve.
It was, of course, the excesses of the American financial system that led to the crisis, so it must rankle many in Europe and Asia that the American stock market appears to have done one of the best jobs of weathering the subsequent storm.
CHARTS: Few Have Recovered: Only three countries other than the United States -- Mexico, Singapore and Sweden -- have regained all the ground they lost when world stock markets plunged during the financial crisis of 2007-9. The chart shows the performance of 30 markets as measured by MSCI indexes, and of the MSCI All Country World Index, which includes all markets MSCI classifies as developed or emerging.

HEADLINE: China Said to Bolster Missile Capabilities

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Adam Century contributed reporting from Beijing, and Thom Shanker from Washington. Mia Li contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China is moving ahead with the development of a new and more capable generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched missiles, increasing its existing ability to deliver nuclear warheads to the United States and to overwhelm missile defense systems, military analysts said this week.
Over all, China's steady strengthening of its military capabilities for conventional and nuclear warfare has long caused concern in Congress and among American allies in East Asia, particularly lately as China has taken a more assertive position regarding territorial claims in the East China and South China Seas. 
The Global Times, a newspaper directly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, reported Wednesday that China was developing the capability to put multiple warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. But the newspaper disputed a report in Jane's Defense Weekly that the latest Chinese ICBM, the Dongfeng-41, had been tested last month.
A Pentagon spokesman asked to comment did not directly address the potential new Chinese missile capability, but said the United States ''remains committed to maintaining healthy, stable, reliable and continuous military-to-military relations with China and regularly discusses ways to reduce tensions and build trust in the region.''
The spokesman, Lt. Col. Damien Pickart, said the United States carefully monitored China's military developments and urged China ''to exhibit greater transparency regarding its capabilities and intentions.''
Larry M. Wortzel, of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a panel created by Congress, said that China was developing the capability to put as many as 10 nuclear warheads on an ICBM, although dummy warheads could be substituted for some of the nuclear warheads. The dummy warheads would have heat and electromagnetic devices designed to trick missile defense systems, he said.
''The bigger implication of this is that as they begin to field a force of missiles with multiple warheads, it means everything we assume about the size of their nuclear arsenal becomes wrong,'' said Mr. Wortzel, who is a former military intelligence officer and retired Army colonel.
China has separately tested submarine-launched missiles in recent weeks, which it could use to outflank American missile detection systems, Mr. Wortzel said. Most of the radar arrays that the United States has deployed against ballistic missiles were built during the cold war to detect attacks over polar routes.
Sun Zhe, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said that China was developing its military forces only in response to continued efforts by other countries, particularly the United States, to improve their own forces.
''We have again and again said that we will not be the first country to use nuclear force,'' he said. ''We need to be able to defend ourselves, and our main threat, I'm afraid, comes from the United States.''
China's development of long-range missiles is part of a much broader military expansion made possible by rapid budget growth in tandem with the Chinese economy, which had an output of $7.5 trillion last year, compared with $1.2 trillion in 2000.
China began sea trials last year for its first aircraft carrier, a retrofitted version of a Soviet vessel, and has begun talking this summer about the eventual construction of up to five aircraft carriers. China also began conducting fairly public flight tests in January last year for the J-20, its new stealth fighter jet.
The scale of China's strategic missile program is much more secret. The Pentagon estimates that China currently has 55 to 65 ICBMs. China is also preparing two submarines for deployment, each with 12 missiles aboard, Mr. Wortzel said.
Those forces are dwarfed by those of the United States, which is cutting its inventory to 1,550 strategic nuclear weapons by 2018 under the latest arms control agreement with Russia.
Western forecasts vary on how many of the new Dongfeng-41 missiles China will produce, with 20 to 32 mobile launching systems planned. The mobile launchers make it harder to find and destroy a missile before it is launched. If each missile has 10 nuclear warheads, that could result in a few hundred to several hundred nuclear weapons.
But Tom Z. Collina, the research director of the Arms Control Association, said that China might not actually deploy multiple warheads without first developing and testing smaller warheads. And China signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, agreeing not to conduct further nuclear tests.
The United States has tried to reassure Russia and China that its limited ballistic missile defenses are designed only to shoot down one or a few missiles launched by a rogue state. But missile defense advocates in the United States favor more ambitious, and also far costlier, systems, a spirited debate that has been followed with nervousness in Moscow and Beijing.
The United States has been considering where it can best place additional high-tech radar systems designed to track ballistic missiles. American forces currently have one in northern Japan and others that are deployed from time to time at sea. The Wall Street Journal reported this week on discussions of whether to put two more on land, in southern Japan and in Southeast Asia.
American officials have repeatedly said that their main concern is North Korea, which has been testing long-range missiles and developing nuclear weapons. But Chinese officials and experts have been suspicious that American defense systems are aimed at their country's forces as well.
''I have no doubt that one of the goals of the missile defenses is to contain threats from North Korea, but objectively speaking, a high-tech expansion of U.S. military biceps impacts China, too,'' said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. He added that discussions had taken place in China on whether to develop missile defense systems as well.

HEADLINE: Capitol Dome Is Imperiled By 1,300 Cracks And Partisan Rift

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- To the myriad indignities suffered by Congress, including stagnant legislation, partisan warfare and popularity on a par with petty criminals, add this: the Capitol's roof is leaking, and there is no money to fix it.
The Capitol dome, the nation's grandest symbol of federal authority, has been dinged by years of inclement weather, and its exterior is in need of repair. 
The dome has 1,300 known cracks and breaks. Water that has seeped in over the years has caused rusting on the ornamentation and staining on the interior of the Rotunda, just feet below the fresco ''The Apotheosis of Washington,'' which is painted on the Rotunda's canopy.
Like most of what the federal government is on the hook to fix -- highways, bridges and airports -- the dome is imperiled both by tough economic times and by a politically polarized Congress. While Senate appropriators have voted to repair the dome, which has not undergone major renovations for 50 years, their House counterparts say there is not money right now. In that way, the dome is a metaphor for the nation's decaying infrastructure.
''The dome needs comprehensive rehabilitation,'' said Stephen T. Ayers, the architect of the Capitol, whose office oversees the building's physical state. ''It's a public safety issue.''
The skirt of the dome -- the section around the base of the original sandstone foundation -- was fixed up recently at a cost of about $20 million, but an additional $61 million is needed to repair and restore the rest of the structure's exterior.
The Senate Appropriations Committee voted just before Congress left for its August recess to provide the money.
''I support funding the Capitol dome,'' said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, who voted against an appropriations bill because it did not include money for the dome. (The money was included moments later in an amendment, which passed with Mr. Hoeven's vote.)
The appropriators in the Republican-controlled House are starting with a smaller overall budget for the 2013 fiscal year than the Democratic-controlled Senate, and they want to finance much of the government's operations at lower levels.
Senate leaders have decided that it would be too difficult to reconcile the two appropriations bills, as is normally done, until after the election.
That means Congress will have to pass a short-term spending bill -- the sort that set off the fight that almost shut down the government last year -- and it most likely will not include more money for repairs.
''This is not a 'bridge to nowhere' we're talking about here,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the leader of the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees the architect's office. ''This is basic upkeep to the United States Capitol building. There is a time and place to debate spending levels and the proper role of the federal government, but when your house has a leaky roof, you pay to fix the roof.''
The history of the dome has been marked by cost overruns and construction problems.
The Capitol's first dome, made of copper-covered wood, was completed in 1824 but by the 1850s was deemed too small. It was also seen as a fire hazard in a place where oil lamps, British attacks and other events had caused blazes. A cast-iron replacement was envisioned, and lawmakers, thrilled with the idea, appropriated $100,000 to begin construction, with the acquiescence of President Franklin Pierce.
Construction on the cast-iron dome began in 1856 and progressed through various architects, disputes over the design and the Civil War, when the project was continued in part by workers who were afraid that the military would take the metals and repurpose them for war use, said Donald A. Ritchie, the Senate historian.
The Statue of Freedom, which sits triumphantly atop the nine million pounds of ironwork that makes up the dome, was completed in December 1863, topping the project. The interior was finished in 1866, its famous fresco revealed. Total cost: $1,047,291, or more than $15 million in today's dollars.
The dome was completely restored in 1960 during the construction of the Capitol's East Front extension. Weather remains its biggest enemy: precipitation pelts the exterior, and the statue endures the occasional strike of lightning. At least 100 pieces of the dome have fallen off or been removed, including a 40-pound cast-iron decorative acorn.
Viewed from a (sort of scary) balcony between the fresco above and a frieze depicting American history that lines the Rotunda's interior, tourists with iPhones and fanny packs can be seen lingering in awe hundreds of feet below, unaware of the water damage and chipping paint above.
''When you have those conditions on the outside,'' said Mr. Ayers, the Capitol's architect, ''it really accelerates deterioration on the inside,'' including possible damage to the fresco, which is painted on plaster.
In other words, just as it is best to fix a bathroom leak before it causes damage to the rest of the house, the dome repairs could prove much more expensive over time.
The project will involve taking apart many pieces of the dome, one at a time, and then putting them back together once repaired, much like a puzzle, Mr. Ayers said.
In many ways, the process reflects the history of the Capitol and the nation, said Mr. Ritchie, the historian. ''The Capitol building is an interesting conglomeration,'' he said. ''It is a whole series of buildings put together at different times, and in that way it is a nice reflection of American democracy, which was put together piecemeal from a lot of different materials. It reflects one motto of our nation, 'E pluribus unum,' Latin for 'Out of many, one.' ''
It is a project, however, that may be delayed until the country's fiscal condition improves.
''The Capitol is a wonderful story of the history of our nation,'' Mr. Ritchie said. ''And as a result it is preserved very carefully to maintain the story, not to mention to keep it from leaking into the Rotunda.''

HEADLINE: No Change In Forecast For Increase In Food Costs

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Agriculture Department said Friday that consumers could still expect higher food prices next year, but the expected 3 percent to 4 percent increase was unchanged from last month, even as extreme heat in the Farm Belt continued to reduce the grain harvest and increase feed prices for livestock. 
''The data out this morning shows that nothing much has changed,'' said Ephraim Leibtag, deputy director of research at the department's Economic Research Service.
The prices of beef and veal will go up the most next year, the report said, almost entirely because of higher costs for feed, which is made from corn and other grains. Beef and veal prices are expected to increase 4 percent to 5 percent.
The most immediate impact of the drought will be seen this year in poultry prices, the government predicted.
Government forecasters reiterated their projection of a 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent jump in chicken and turkey prices this year. The prices are expected to rise a bit less next year, in the range of 3 percent to 4 percent, the government said.
The increase in feed prices has caused many cattle producers to sell off or cull their herds. Cattle sales are up nearly 30 percent over last year, said Sara Baker, a spokeswoman for Sageworks, a financial information company based in New York that tracks the sales.
The Agriculture Department said the reduction in the number of cows could result in a temporary decline in beef prices this year as a surplus of cattle is sold and more meat enters the market.
Cheese and milk products are expected to rise 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in price next year, unchanged from last month's forecast. Egg prices will also be affected, with prices forecast to rise 3 percent to 4 percent next year.
About 40 percent of the corn crop is used to feed livestock. Feed costs account for 50 percent to 70 percent of livestock and poultry production, according to the American Feed Industry Association, a trade group.
A government estimate released this month said that because of worsening drought conditions, farmers would produce about 10.6 billion bushels of corn this year, down from what had been projected at the beginning of the year to be a record 15 billion bushels. The reduction in corn and soybean supplies has pushed up their prices to record levels.
The Agriculture Department said this week that 85 percent of this year's corn crop was in drought-affected areas, as was 83 percent of the soybean crop.
As of Monday, just 23 percent of the corn crop was rated in good or excellent condition, while 31 percent of soybeans were rated good or excellent.

1912 Air Race in Saint Malo
SAINT-MALO -- Four out of the nine machines that started in the first hydro-aeroplane race here met mishaps, although -- and this is a striking demonstration of the comparative safety of hydro-aeroplanes -- no personal injury resulted. The chapter of accidents was begun by M. Barra, piloting the Paulhan-Curtisa machine. Leaving the Mare aux Canards, he skimmed through the water toward the starting line, between the lighthouse and the city fort. But when he arrived in the creek of the Bas Sablons, he encountered a side wind. M. Barra's marine experience is perhaps insufficient. He was evidently helpless, and eventually the machine capsized. 
1937 Jobless Parade in Washington
WASHINGTON -- Twenty five hundred unemployed members of the Workers Alliance of America staged another parade in Washington today [Aug.24], got thoroughly soaked in a downpour of rain, failed to see President Roosevelt and disbanded. Most of the demonstrators had converged on Washington within the last several days from large cities in the east to demand that the Works Progress Administration curtail its program of cutting down enrollees and rehire those who have been dropped from its rolls. Tramping through a cold rainstorm, the protesters carried banners and placards past the offices of the Works Progress Administrator, Harry Hopkins, then wound up at the White House where they hoped to be received by President Roosevelt.
1962 Modeling in Paris is No Fun
LONDON -- A pretty red-haired Welsh girl today shattered the illusion held by many women -- that being a model in a top French fashion house is all fun and glamour. In fact, Maggie Griffiths said, she found it tiring, boring and not particularly well paid work. The 23-year-old Miss Griffiths said in an interview that she has walked out of the House of Dior. ''I should have been with them until December at least,'' she said, ''but I could not stand it a moment longer. I flew back to London for the week end -- and made a decision to stay here.''

HEADLINE: No More Bluffing

BYLINE: By JAMES McMANUS. 
James McManus is the author, most recently, of ''Cowboys Full: The Story of Poker.''

 BODY:
Chicago
POKER is America's card game, some say its national pastime. It is certainly the game most like the free-market system. It is increasingly viewed as the quintessential American mind sport. Its popularity has always had to do with the pleasures of bluffing, as well as with the fact that money is its language, its leverage, its means of keeping score. It is deeply ingrained in the fabric of our culture, our language, our economy. And soon, it now seems, it will even be legal.
Last Monday, in a case involving a Staten Island poker parlor, a federal judge in Brooklyn, Jack B. Weinstein, ruled that poker is predominantly a game of skill and not a game of chance -- the legal definition of gambling -- and that game operators should not be prosecuted under a federal law that bars running an illegal gambling business. 
Judge Weinstein's decision was only the latest round in more than 160 years of legal wrangling over poker's legitimacy. Last December, the Justice Department concluded that the Wire Act of 1962 applied only to sports betting, not poker. Together, the two decisions are likely to be a game-changing combination in favor of on-land and online poker and a severe setback for the nanny-state conservatives who've tried to ban them by lumping poker together with such obviously skill-free games of chance as craps, lotteries and bingo.
Judge Weinstein was persuaded by a mountain of statistical evidence, much of it supplied by Randal D. Heeb, an economist and statistician who had analyzed 415 million hands of no-limit hold 'em played online and concluded that a player's skill ''had a statistically significant effect on the amount of money won or lost.''
The judge quoted Mr. Heeb as saying that ''many people make a living playing poker and win consistently over time,'' whereas ''it is impossible to make a living and to win consistently playing casino games such as roulette,'' where chance predominates. He also emphasized poker's distinguished heritage as a game that presidents, Supreme Court justices and other honorable citizens had played.
Poker is illegal in much of the country, but is permitted on Indian reservations, riverboats, casinos and in some cities. Americans play in friendly home games and high-stakes tournaments. This year's World Series of Poker alone offered a prize pool exceeding $222 million, not counting the seven events to be contested next month in France.
Gambling parlors aren't the only places where the poker wars are being fought. Over the last decade, the Web has become the latest front in the conflict. In the spring of 2011, the Justice Department effectively shut down online poker, and charged operators of three of the most popular poker sites with fraud and money laundering. At the time, more than two million Americans were playing online poker, with about $20.2 billion at stake.
The game's numerous variants all evolved from poque, an 18th-century parlor game played by French aristocrats that merged with English brag and began to flourish as pokah aboard Mississippi steamboats in the early years of the 19th century. After the Civil War, it rapidly spread across the country. But why did so many of our ancestors prefer a risky, money-based game like poker rather than safer and fussier games like piquet or cribbage or whist?
It has to do with two contrasting strands of what might be called the American DNA: the risk-averse Puritan work ethic and the entrepreneur's urge to seize the chance. The two approaches have made us who we are as a country. Nearly all of us are descended from immigrants, a self-selecting group that is disproportionally inclined to take chances. As Emily Bazelon wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 2005: ''It's not about where you come from, it's that you came at all.''
Alexis de Tocqueville witnessed our allegiance to risk, initiative and democratic opportunity while traveling in 1831 aboard the steamboat Louisville along the Mississippi River at the very moment that poker was coming of age. ''Those living in the instability of a democracy have the constant image of chance before them, and, in the end, they come to like all those projects in which chance plays a part,'' he wrote. This was true, he deduced, ''not only because of the promise of profit but because they like the emotions evoked.''
Mark Twain, a poker aficionado, followed in his footsteps. ''There are few things that are so unpardonably neglected in our country as poker,'' he once wrote. ''Why, I have known clergymen, good men, kind-hearted, liberal, sincere, and all that, who did not know the meaning of a 'flush.' It is enough to make one ashamed of one's species.''
Now that Judge Weinstein has ruled, maybe a bit less ashamed.

HEADLINE: Seeing and Battling a 'Cartel' in the Hiring of Rabbis

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
E-mail: sgf1@columbia.edu

 BODY:
DURHAM, N.C. -- Four years ago, when the longtime rabbi of Beth El Synagogue here retired, a member named Barak D. Richman joined the committee searching for a successor. Everything went smoothly enough until the congregation reached outside Conservative Judaism, its formal affiliation, to consider candidates from the Reform and Reconstructionist branches, and to place a few online advertisements.
Several months into the process, one of Mr. Richman's colleagues on the search committee delivered some unexpected information. Under the rules of the Conservative movement, Beth El had two choices: either look at Conservative rabbis put forward by the movement's placement office, and do not so much as whistle at anybody else; or, look outside the movement and be denied access to any of its rabbis. 
Being a law professor at Duke University with an expertise in antitrust, Mr. Richman responded in a unique way. He recalled a 1975 Supreme Court case, Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, which successfully challenged the controlled market for lawyers doing real estate title searches. And he thought of the word ''cartel.''
Long after Beth El reached a compromise with the Conservative movement that allowed it to interview one outside candidate, long after it hired a Conservative rabbi who had been the search committee's top choice, Mr. Richman has kept on speaking and writing that same word. From academic conferences to Supreme Court briefs, from law-review articles to op-ed columns in Jewish periodicals, he has continued his assault on the placement system as a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and a betrayal of the First Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom.
''Professional cartels are in some ways even more pernicious than a cartel of manufacturers,'' Mr. Richman, 42, said in a recent interview. ''There's a degree of paternalism. On the one hand, it's genuinely born out of concern. The rabbis who run the placement system really think they know what's best for their congregations. But by controlling the marketplace with their ossified rules, they are doing long-lasting damage.''
Leaders of the Conservative movement, for their part, deem Mr. Richman the source of damage. Where he sees an illegally rigged job market, they depict a placement program that operates by consensus, including not only the Rabbinical Assembly, the movement's association of rabbis, but also its seminaries and its congregational organization, the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism.
''I don't think Professor Richman sees the harm his proposal would cause,'' said Rabbi Julie Schonfeld, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Assembly. ''If each congregation is deciding for itself, some of these decisions will dilute the ability of this worldwide group of people to promote its vision worldwide.''
The conflict's scope is both limited and wide-ranging. In recent years, the Conservative movement has placed only about 50 rabbis annually. But the Reform and Reconstructionist movements employ rules similar to those Mr. Richman has assailed.
And in the broad sweep of American religion, the method of selecting clergy members ranges from denominations like the Baptists, in which congregations autonomously choose their ministers, to those like the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, in which a hierarchy appoints priests. Somewhere in the middle lie not only the Jewish movements but also much of the Protestant sector. Certainly, as portrayed both by Mr. Richman and Rabbi Schonfeld, the constitutional stakes are great. To Rabbi Schonfeld, the free exercise of religion includes the ability to set standards for worship, ritual and religious law, and to ensure that only rabbis committed to those standards lead congregations. To Mr. Richman, because Conservative Judaism has neither a single theological authority nor a corporate structure, religious freedom means each congregation selecting its own leader.
He tested those arguments in an amicus brief he filed last year in a Supreme Court case known as Hosanna-Tabor for the Lutheran school that was the plaintiff. The court ruled that both the free-exercise clause and a ''ministerial exception'' allowed the school to fire a particular religion teacher, who also held the title of minister.
The ruling, though, was deliberately narrow, focused more on one particular dismissal than on the scope of the ministerial exception. Mr. Richman's brief, in any event, served less as an endorsement of the teacher than as a highly visible opportunity to make his case against the placement system.
''Because a congregation's selection of its religious leaders is so central to its religious mission,'' he wrote, ''an overbroad ministerial exception would limit the religious freedoms of independent institutions.'' The Conservative ''cartel,'' he went on, ''harms both the economic welfare and the religious interests of individual congregations.''
Even though Conservative movement leaders take heart from the Hosanna-Tabor ruling, Mr. Richman remains a formidable foe -- a law degree from Harvard; a doctorate in business from the University of California, Berkeley; a member of Conservative synagogues all his life; the president now of Beth El. For now, Mr. Richman has no plaintiff around whom to build a court case. But he does sound like someone on the hunt. ''You need a Curt Flood,'' he said, referring to the baseball player who successfully challenged the game's reserve clause. Then, referring to the Virginia State Bar case, he added, ''Or a Lew Goldfarb.''

HEADLINE: Resort Towns Face A Last Picture Show

BYLINE: By ERIC HYNES

 BODY:
OCEAN CITY, N.J. -- There are nicer and newer movie theaters than the Strand 5 on the boardwalk here on the Jersey Shore. The sound is uneven, and the auditoriums haven't been renovated in decades.
But the Strand does have history. It opened as a one-screen movie house in August 1938, and nearly 75 years later the cinema, now a five-screen multiplex, is still serving exiled beachgoers. But for how long?
As a woman in a black bikini and white cover-up flip-flopped into ''The Dark Knight Rises'' one afternoon this month, the ticket taker, Shelby Fogarty, struck a mournful tone, mindful that the Strand has been for sale for several years, and that management -- the family-owned Frank theater chain -- won't say if the theater and its boardwalk neighbor, the Moorlyn Stadium 4, will reopen next season.
If they don't, Ms. Fogarty, 20, whose family has been summering here since she was a baby, said the loss wouldn't just be personal: ''Time and again I've had people come up to me and say, 'I remember coming here when I was little, and it was only 15 cents to see a movie.' '' 
All along the Jersey Shore, as well as from Montauk to Martha's Vineyard -- indeed in just about any area in the country where mom-and-pop theaters still survive -- old movie houses like the Strand are faced with a live-or-die proposition this Labor Day. In an already unsparing economy, and with entertainment rivals multiplying with every new tablet and flat screen, movie theaters are being asked to invest in costly digital projectors just to stay open.
According to recent industry statements, the major Hollywood studios are planning to complete the switch to digital by ceasing to release 35-millimeter film altogether; 20th Century Fox promises to phase out film by the end of next year, and the others are expected to follow. Which means that the analog projectors that have whirred along for decades will be suddenly rendered incapable of playing modern movies. For many seasonal theaters, the dog days of this summer may be the only days they have left.
Though his theater will probably adjust, John Esposito, the owner of the Beach Cinema in Bradley Beach, N.J., warned, ''America's going to lose a lot of its past because of this.''
Digital projectors are compatible with hard drives and files called Digital Cinema Packages, which are cheaper to produce and easier to disseminate than film. John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners, says 30,000 screens have already been converted, leaving nearly 10,000 in some stage of transition. As he told exhibitors at CinemaCon in 2011, ''If you don't make the decision to get on the digital train soon, you will be making the decision to get out of the business.''
But for many small cinemas, especially the seasonal, for which a single $75,000 digital projector and attendant costs can exceed an entire year's profits, the decision to get on the digital train comes with considerable risk. Thanks to pooled resources and capital, multiplex chains like Regal and Cinemark can more easily absorb such expenditures, but for small theaters it's especially tough to justify that kind of investment -- or to persuade banks to give them loans.
''Even if the finance company is willing to hold the equipment as collateral,'' said Judith Deleonardis, an owner of the Delsea Drive-In in Vineland, N.J., ''they're going to look at your debt to income and say, 'You're maxed, and therefore we can't do this.' ''
And while exhibitors are accustomed to spending money to improve their businesses, digital conversion isn't an outlay that can be used to attract audiences: the digital image has its partisans, but it's still replacing something that was already there.
''It's not like you're taking on that debt load to add another auditorium that brings in more income,'' said Bob Card, owner of another Strand Theater, the classic marquee-on-the-town-square movie house in the lakeside Adirondacks town of Old Forge, N.Y. (Strand is an especially popular name for waterside theaters.)
He said that he was committed to keeping the Strand running but that he was undecided about how to finance a conversion that could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for his theater's four screens. Since the Strand is a for-profit theater, he's reluctant to ask patrons for donations (though that hasn't stopped theaters like the Onarga and the Harvest Moon Twin Drive-In, both in Illinois, from doing so). Instead he's waiting to hear about several state grants and weighing, as many other independent exhibitors are, whether to sign a joint financing agreement.
Devised through negotiations between the national theater owners group and the major studios, these Virtual Print Fee agreements entail per-movie payments from distributors for running their movies. For distributors, these givebacks are more affordable than striking film prints, and for theaters that qualify (because of limited grosses, many seasonal ones don't), these payments can help pay off bank loans or leases.
But those agreements, many of which must be entered into by Sept. 30, come with strings attached that can dictate what and how often films are shown, and even deter independent distributors that can't afford to pay the fee. ''It puts some rough constraints on what you do with your business,'' Mr. Card said.
Which is why indie-minded nonprofits like the Ambler and County Theaters outside Philadelphia not only raised funds from members and patrons, but also bought equipment that could be upgraded as the industry pursues further technical advancements.
''The scary part of switching to digital cinema is that because it's computer-based, it's all going to happen again very soon,'' said John Toner, the executive director of both theaters.
Some seasonal exhibitors can't afford that gamble. The knotty-pine Tamarack Cafe and Movie House in Inlet, N.Y., is closing after having served that lakeside community, not far from Old Forge, since 1946.
''There's no one in the world that would consider it a wise choice to continue,'' said the owner, Brandon DiMartino, citing the drop-off in attendance since a multiplex opened nearby, as well as the digital expenses for an especially short earning season. (The Tamarack is open only in July and August.) ''Honestly, the digital thing came at a good time. We've reached a crossroads.''
Deborah Frank, executive vice president of Frank Theaters, understands the predicament. ''It's a tough job to run a seasonal business, whatever kind,'' she said. ''You don't have those 12 months to spread things out.''
While still mulling the fate of the Ocean City cinemas, Frank has decided to close the Beach Stadium 5 on Long Beach Island, N.J., at season's end, yielding the space to an expanding Acme Supermarket. Ms. Frank said keeping the theater going in this strictly seasonal town made little economic sense, especially with the digital outlay looming.
Farther down the Jersey Shore, yet another Strand Theater, this one on the Wildwood boardwalk, didn't even open this summer, leaving this vacation town -- once so movie-mad that there were as many as seven theaters -- without a single operating cinema.
Mr. Esposito's single-screen Beach Cinema in Bradley Beach is still hanging around as a charming, second-run retro house. With musty old felt seats and majestic shoulder-height urinals in the men's room, the theater seems untouched since Jack Nicholson, who grew up nearby, would go there in the early 1950s. Mr. Esposito, who began running the Beach after saving it from disrepute as a pornography house in 1977, is considering digital options but begrudges having to do so.
''I really would like to see film stay film,'' he said. ''Why does it have to disappear 100 percent?''
Back down the Garden State Parkway, the venerable Harbor 5 in Stone Harbor will be outfitted for digital, thanks to the presence of more year-round residents and a slightly longer season, Ms. Frank said. But the Kriss Kringle-bearded projectionist, Joe Griesbach, lamented that his profession would become redundant.
''With digital you pretty much don't need anyone in the booth at all,'' he said. ''Only to download the movies into the server. You can do it all from the manager's office.''
But when he waxed romantic about mechanical projectors, the manager, Tom Fink, reminded him of how much maintenance the old dogs required. ''Christ showed a movie at the Last Supper with some of these machines,'' Mr. Fink said.
At the two-screen Delsea Drive-In analog projectors still beam images from little white buildings nestled in a field of cars and minivans. But that should change by next year, since the Delsea is adding a floor above the snack bar for the digital equipment. That's where the owners, Judith and John Deleonardis, were talking shop recently as ''Total Recall'' and ''Ice Age: Continental Drift'' flickered beneath stormy skies.
The Deleonardises reopened the dormant theater in 2004 and are pressing on, even though digital-conversion loans are proving hard to secure, and even though their triplets have reached college age.
''When I think of what we had to do to take it this far, we probably shouldn't have done it,'' Mrs. Deleonardis said.
''C'mon,'' her husband asked, ''what would you be doing?''
''I would have had equity in my home,'' she said, ''which I could have used for my children's college.''
He shrugged. ''Overrated.''
Later he stood under the snack shop awning while rain fell hard -- blessedly briefly -- and the ''Ice Age'' credits rolled. Some cars drove off; others arrived for the second feature. A young man approached and sheepishly asked if someone could jump-start his car. After a brief intermission, the show went on.

HEADLINE: Missouri Lawmaker Tries to Shift Focus From Comments on Rape

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON; Monica Davey contributed reporting from Chicago.

 BODY:
CHESTERFIELD, Mo. -- Representative Todd Akin held a public event on Friday afternoon for the first time since the broadcast of his controversial comments about rape victims, and attempted to turn the focus of his Senate race in Missouri back on the issue that had once made victory seem a sure thing: Senator Claire McCaskill.
In a brief news conference near his campaign headquarters here, Mr. Akin blasted Ms. McCaskill, the incumbent who is his Democratic opponent, saying that she represented ''an America that has less freedom, less jobs, more big government, more taxes and the same stalled economy that we've observed for the last three-plus years.''
Seemingly energized from several days in Florida, reportedly meeting with a group of social conservatives, Mr. Akin, 65, also reiterated that he was staying in the race, rebutting reports that an exit was being discussed. 
''We're going to be here through the November election, and we're going to be here to win,'' he said during a 90-second opening statement.
With the brief appearance -- he took a handful of questions from reporters before staff members ushered him from the room -- Mr. Akin took the first step toward breaking from the siege mentality that he and his campaign have been under over the past week. Numerous establishment Republicans had called on him to abandon his campaign, fearing that he could no longer win what had once seemed an easy race. He did not make any public appearances and limited his interviews to talk radio and television news shows, making his plea to voters through a television advertisement apologizing for suggesting that rape victims could not get pregnant.
Amid the storm of criticism, members of Mr. Akin's staff had been holed up in his headquarters here -- a sterile, gray, one-story office building -- fielding a thousand e-mails and telephone calls a day, rallying volunteers who stop by (some with checkbooks in hand) and plotting the candidate's message.
Days have been stress-filled, aides say, though they have allowed for levity. On a recent morning, campaign staff members joked that one of them was so new they had not thought of a title for him yet.
In some ways, the staff members here have been reinvigorated to beat back what they see as attacks from the establishment on a candidate who has relied on grass-roots support throughout his nearly quarter-century in politics. They said they were heartened to have received more messages of support than criticism.
''Wednesday and Thursday, it's just been a nonstop pouring of folks across the state saying, 'Stand in there; don't you dare back down,' '' said Perry Akin, Mr. Akin's son, a 31-year-old Marine Corps veteran who is serving as campaign manager.
The younger Mr. Akin, who has a master's degree in business from the University of Chicago and is taking a leave of absence from his job in the corporate offices of John Deere, oversees a full-time staff of about 30 and hundreds of volunteers and three or four campaign offices throughout the state.
If much of Mr. Akin's political apparatus feels homemade, the team that creates his political ads -- the Strategy Group for Media, which is based in Ohio and has worked with Mr. Akin on Congressional races since 2000 -- is well known, and has assisted campaigns of politicians like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio.
Hours after Mr. Akin made his controversial comments on Sunday, Rex Elsass, the founder of the company, and Nick Everhart, its president, returned from an unrelated business trip to a mound of messages about what had happened. By Monday morning, Mr. Akin flew to Ohio, where the company created an apology advertisement.
Those advising Mr. Akin say he now needs to move on with his campaign, past the events of the week, and back to questions of the economy, jobs and fiscal stability -- just as he seemed to try to do Friday afternoon.
''After deciding he was going to get back in the race,'' Mr. Everhart said in an interview, ''he needs to wage a campaign against Claire McCaskill, not against this incident.''
Still, Perry Akin acknowledged the challenges presented by influential groups like the National Republican Senatorial Committee pulling their support -- and their money -- for his father. Those groups had provided experts to the campaign with connections to people in Washington who had money, he said. Now he has to shift people to new roles, he said, and hire new consultants. Though with less financing, he said, he may not be able to afford high-priced advisers.
In the days since the controversy, the campaign has said that it raised more than $200,000 from small, individual contributions, but that is a far cry from the millions of dollars spent by outside groups like Crossroads GPS on advertisements attacking Ms. McCaskill.
''The Senate race in Missouri is an extremely important race that has some national priority,'' said Ryan Hite, Mr. Akins's 23-year-old communications director. ''So I would, by my guess, expect to see some of the larger donors come back in because of the need to get rid of Claire McCaskill in our Senate seat.''
Before he took his turn in front of the news media on Friday, a smiling yet seemingly weary Mr. Akin stepped into his headquarters here carrying a Culver's fish sandwich and greeted his staff after returning from Tampa. A woman walked in through the glass doors of the building, which sits at the front of an industrial office park, near a small airport with single-engine planes buzzing overhead.
''Hey, Lois, how you doing?'' Mr. Akin called out to the woman.
He retreated to a conference room with aides, and later emerged with his statement for the news conference written on a yellow legal pad.
While Mr. Akin was in the conference room, the staff galloped through the hallways, preparing for what was coming. One woman, her keys jingling as she hustled down a long hallway, carried a role of Akin stickers; another toted a large banner out to her car.
At one point in the afternoon, Perry Akin -- who had waded into the office that morning with a red backpack slung over his shoulder, two other bags hanging from his hand and a cellphone to his ear -- paced the hallway.
''It's been a tough week,'' he said to a woman who had come in briefly.
''I know it has,'' she responded. ''You're on the right track. Just hang in there.''

HEADLINE: Romney in Crisis: 2 Dark Spots in Fortunate Life

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney was, uncharacteristically, terrified.
It was the fall of 1998, the height of Mr. Romney's high-flying career as a private equity executive. But his wife, Ann, was not well. She was exhausted, and having difficulty walking; her right foot was dragging. When a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital arrived at a diagnosis -- multiple sclerosis -- ''they just held each other in their arms,'' their son Josh said, ''and just cried.''
Thirty years earlier, in the spring of 1968, Mr. Romney, then a Mormon missionary in France, had a scare of a different sort. He was at the wheel of a tiny Citroën, cruising along a country road, when a Mercedes rounded a curve and crashed into his car, head on. One of his passengers -- the wife of the French mission president -- was killed. Mr. Romney, by all accounts not at fault, was knocked unconscious and mistakenly pronounced dead at the scene.
Next week, Mr. Romney will go to Tampa, Fla., to accept the Republican nomination for president, after months on the campaign trail casting himself as Mr. Fix-it, a turnaround specialist whose business experience can revive a struggling economy. There, his advisers will seek to humanize Mr. Romney, who has had trouble connecting with ordinary voters. 
But what his campaign has not offered, to date, is a crisis narrative, the kind of biographical story of overcoming hardship that other politicians have used to define themselves and inspire other Americans.
The French car crash and Ann Romney's illness provide such a narrative; they are dark moments -- bookends of sorts -- in what otherwise has seemed a charmed existence. Both offer clues into Mr. Romney's character, and the way he reacts to challenges. He is both forward-looking and inward-looking, practical and deeply private, with a consultant's instinct for identifying solutions even in the most personally trying times.
After the shock of Ann Romney's diagnosis, he immersed himself in research about multiple sclerosis, becoming ''a mini-expert,'' said Laraine Wright, a close friend of Mrs. Romney. He read scientific papers and called medical experts. And he began focusing on practical ways he might make his wife's life easier. He contemplated installing an elevator in their home and moved the master bedroom downstairs.
''Mitt is always calm, deliberate, he's a planner,'' Mrs. Wright said. ''It was like, 'Now we have the diagnosis; this is the plan.' ''
After the car crash in France, Mr. Romney returned to his mission duties with a broken arm and renewed zeal; along with another 21-year-old, he was left in charge of the mission. In an early hint of his executive abilities, he concentrated on motivating his peers to win more converts.
''Mitt was deeply enmeshed in thinking about leadership,'' said Douglas D. Anderson, a friend who is dean of the business school at Utah State University. ''He developed a very early set of core beliefs and values that had to do with being cool under pressure, that had to do with looking for opportunities where others saw threats, that had to do with being analytical and somewhat detached in order to look at reality the way it is, rather than how it is being perceived by people who are driven by the hysteria of the moment.
''And out of that,'' Dr. Anderson went on, ''came a pattern of living that was reinforced by events like that critical accident in France.''
An Intensely Private Man
The crisis narrative is standard fare for modern politicians. Barack Obama had his search for identity, born of his mixed-race heritage and of the father who abandoned him when he was 2. George W. Bush quit drinking at 40, and turned his life around. John McCain endured harrowing abuse as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Bill Clinton fought off his alcoholic stepfather. Mr. Romney's vice-presidential pick, Representative Paul D. Ryan, was 16 when his father died, and was forced to become more self-reliant.
But the broad outlines of Mr. Romney's biography -- the son of an auto executive and former Michigan governor who married his high school sweetheart and went off to Harvard before making his private equity fortune -- do not make for the kind of story most voters can identify with. Indeed, a recent poll showed that President Obama has an empathy edge over Mr. Romney.
''It's not easy,'' said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, ''for any human being to reveal moments when they were not 100 percent on top of things, and every presidential candidate is especially reluctant to show weaknesses, but this is one of the most crucial ways we come to comprehend and bond with a possible president, and when voters don't have it, they wonder.''
Mr. Romney is, by nature, intensely private, not given to talking about himself, even with friends. One who has known him for 30 years said the accident in France had come up only a handful of times. His own children did not learn some of the details until Mr. Romney's Senate race in 1994, when The Boston Globe published an article. (However, Craig Romney, the youngest of the five sons, said he learned as a boy that his father had suffered nerve damage on the tip of his nose during the accident. ''I knew whenever I was wrestling with my dad, you don't want to touch his nose.'')
At their Mormon church in Belmont, Mass., Mitt and Ann Romney were known as a couple who often pitched in to help others, always ready with a home-cooked meal for someone who was sick, or quiet financial help for a family in need. After Mrs. Romney became ill, church friends came forth with offers of assistance -- cooking meals, running errands, whatever was needed. And while the couple did accept some help, they soon turned inward, telling friends they had family they could rely on, said Grant Bennett, a friend and fellow church member.
''Their close friends helped out and provided meals, but it was fairly short term,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''Once they got over the initial shock it was, 'Well, let's figure out what changes we can make that will allow us to return to normalcy.' ''
For Mitt Romney, that meant spending more time at home and picking up some of the chores.
''He was the one bringing meals home,'' Craig Romney said. ''He would stop by the grocery store on the way home and grab a roast chicken. They moved their bedroom to the ground floor so she didn't have to deal with walking upstairs. Basically, he took over doing the dishes, doing laundry, doing all that stuff that my mom would have done.''
At Bain Capital, the private equity firm he co-founded, Mr. Romney at first kept his wife's diagnosis to himself. Geoffrey S. Rehnert, a former Bain partner, said Mr. Romney shared the news with him at a breakfast in January 1999. ''It was probably the most pained and afraid I had ever seen him,'' Mr. Rehnert said. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Romney told the partners that he and Ann would be moving to Utah so that he could run the Salt Lake City Olympics.
Dr. Anderson, the Utah State business school dean, said he had lunch with Mr. Romney several times after the couple moved to Utah. But they never spoke of Mrs. Romney's illness. Mr. Romney, he said, is not one to share his feelings -- or prompt others to share theirs.
''I think in a very real way he is not so much the un-Barack Obama as he is the un-Bill Clinton,'' said Dr. Anderson, who once ran for Senate as a Democrat from Utah, but supports Mr. Romney for president. ''Bill Clinton was an enormously empathetic person who in a crowded room could lock onto you and make you feel like you were the only one there. But he was a totally undisciplined person in his own personal life.
''Mitt Romney will never disgrace the office. He will set an example of moral rectitude. But don't expect him to sit down and feel your pain.''
The move to Utah was a time for Mr. Romney to reset and refocus his priorities; after years in the grinding world of business, he was now concentrating on just two things: the Olympics, and caring for his wife. Mrs. Romney had persuaded him to accept the offer, but had second thoughts once they arrived.
''She was really sick when they got to Utah, really depressed, and wasn't sure they had done the right thing,'' Craig Romney said.
But the move proved beneficial to Mrs. Romney's health. While there, she found an expert in reflexology who helped her; Mr. Romney accompanied her to treatments and learned the technique, Mrs. Wright said. Mrs. Romney also rekindled her childhood interest in horseback riding; Mr. Romney, not much of a fan of horses, took up the sport.
''I don't know how much he enjoyed horseback riding,'' said Robert H. Garff, a Salt Lake businessman who recruited Mr. Romney for the Olympics job, and often invited the couple to ride at his ranch outside Park City. ''He went as a loyal and faithful companion with her, knowing that this was important to her.''
A Sense of Purpose
There are some reasons Mr. Romney may not want to talk to voters about the vulnerable moments in his life. Ann Romney, whose story has inspired patients all over the country, undoubtedly has access to the finest medical care, at a time when many Americans are struggling for lack of health insurance.
And the car accident shines a spotlight on Mr. Romney's Mormon faith, something that until recently he has mostly tried to avoid.
Because he was not to blame for the accident, Mr. Romney has never been tormented by guilt, people who know him say, but rather felt that he had been at the wrong place at the wrong time. In their book, ''The Real Romney,'' the authors Michael Kranish and Scott Helman quote him as saying the accident gave him a sense of purpose -- one of the rare times he has made any public comment about it.
''This made me painfully aware that life is fragile,'' Mr. Romney said, ''that we're only here for a short time and that life is important, and that what we do with our time is not for frivolity but for meaning.''
The crash occurred just after Mr. Romney had been given a prestigious new assignment: assistant to the mission president, H. Duane Anderson. On a trip to a Mormon congregation in southern France, President Anderson, as he was known, and his wife, Leola, who was called Sister Anderson, took Mr. Romney as their driver, and another young missionary, David L. Wood.
The drive there was uneventful. But on the way back, according to published accounts and interviews, a Mercedes being driven by a Catholic priest missed a curve on a winding road and hit the car Mr. Romney was driving. Mr. Romney, who suffered a broken arm, was knocked unconscious, as was Mr. Wood. Sister Anderson died in the hospital; her husband, also seriously injured, later returned to the United States to bury her, leaving the mission without a leader.
Mr. Romney, who recovered quickly, and another young missionary, Joel H. McKinnon, took charge, supervising some 200 young people and running the mission's financial and administrative affairs. Mr. McKinnon, who now lives in Florida, said it was an early hint of Mr. Romney's smarts and creativity.
''While I worried about whether two missionaries in some small town were going to get along, he would say, for example, 'We haven't had missionaries there for 10 years, why don't we send two back into this town?' '' Mr. McKinnon said. ''My response would be, 'Well, let's leave things as they are, batten down the hatches and when the mission president gets back, he can handle that stuff.' I was uncomfortable, but Mitt was not. The confidence he had in himself and his ability to reason things out was pretty astounding.''
But if he was deeply troubled by his role in the death of Sister Anderson, Mr. Romney kept his emotions in check. ''I'm sure he was saddened,'' said Mr. Wood, who now teaches French at a high school for gifted children in Louisiana, ''but he had a lot of responsibility on his shoulders and he threw himself into his work, and maybe dealt with his sorrow in that way, staying focused and staying busy.''
Later, he did tell his children about the accident. Craig Romney said his father was exceedingly careful in teaching him how to drive, though he is not sure if the accident was the reason. Josh Romney said his father spoke often of the reaction of his own parents, George and Lenore, who had been told their son might be dead. Lenore Romney refused to believe it.
''He often recalls that she just didn't blink an eye and said, 'Well, I know he's not dead,' '' Josh Romney said. ''His mother's response, I think, had an impact on him,'' reinforcing ''the family connection, the bond that exists between parents and children.''
Mr. Romney does not share that kind of intimate reflection with voters or the news media. Ronald B. Scott, a Romney biographer and distant relation, said Mr. Romney's impulse to stay busy after the crash, without dwelling on his inner feelings, was typical.
''There's a certain expediency about how he deals with crisis,'' Mr. Scott said. ''He deals with it, he ties up the loose ends and he moves forward.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Backs 'Responsible' Extraction of Gas and Pays to Help Set Up Rules

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
After giving away a chunk of his personal fortune to the cause of eliminating coal-fired power plants, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is opening his checkbook in support of ''responsible'' extraction of natural gas by hydraulic fracturing.
In an op-ed article in The Washington Post on Friday, the mayor came out strongly in favor of natural gas extraction through the controversial drilling process, known as fracking, as a way to lower utility bills, spur economic growth and reduce the nation's dependence on coal. But the mayor said the drilling should take place under ''common sense'' regulations, to minimize environmental harm. 
To ''jump start'' that effort, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced Friday that it was giving a $6 million grant to the Environmental Defense Fund to help secure strong rules in 14 states that account for 85 percent of the gas reserves accessible through fracking.
Mr. Bloomberg wrote the article with George P. Mitchell, the Texas gas producer who pioneered the technology of hydraulic fracturing of shale rock, combined with horizontal drilling, in the 1990s. They wrote that their intention was to promote ''the sensible center'' in the charged debate over fracking.
But in doing so, Mr. Bloomberg has injected himself into the most polarizing environmental debate facing New York State, at a time when the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is deciding where and how to allow fracking. It is uncertain when a decision will be announced.
The governor's office did not respond to requests for comment on the mayor's position.
But the mayor's words immediately drew a rebuke from environmentalists, who say no amount of regulation would make fracking safe and are seeking an outright ban on drilling.
''He speaks for himself, not the upstate New Yorkers who would be most directly and most immediately affected by fracking,'' said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food and Water Watch, one of the most active antifracking groups in the country.
Mayor Bloomberg has long opposed fracturing in or near the city's watershed in upstate New York, largely in the Catskills, which supplies drinking water to nine million people in the city and nearby counties. The city succeeded in getting the state to agree to a ban in the watershed if fracking is allowed.
Deputy Mayor Caswell F. Holloway said the city had commissioned a study that showed there would be ''serious risks'' to the water supply if drilling were allowed in the watershed. He said Mr. Bloomberg is advocating that other water supplies be protected as well if they are found to be at similar risk.
''When it comes to other water supplies, the mayor is calling for protection of groundwater and restrictions to protect those water supplies,'' Mr. Holloway said.
He has consistently supported more domestic use of natural gas as a way to reduce the country's and the city's greenhouse gas emissions. His
administration is prodding buildings to switch to natural gas -- which already supplies 57 percent of the city's energy -- by phasing out the dirtiest home-heating oils, and has backed construction of a just-approved interstate gas pipeline from Staten Island through New Jersey into the West Village in Manhattan.
Last year, Mr. Bloomberg gave $50 million to a Sierra Club campaign to block new coal-fired power plants and eliminate existing ones. Mike Marinello, a spokesman for Bloomberg Philanthropies, said the mayor's active support for natural gas was a next logical step.
''Fracking for natural gas can be as good for our environment as it is for our economy and our wallets, but only if it's done responsibly,'' Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Mitchell wrote. ''The rapid expansion of fracking has invited legitimate concerns about its impact on water, air and climate -- concerns that industry has attempted to gloss over.''
The Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation has committed $1.6 million to this effort, with $400,000 going to the Environmental Defense Fund to help institute new or improved regulations in fracking states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas, as well as in New York.
Fred Krupp, president of the group, said t ''the country is doing a lot of hydrofracking and we have an obligation to make sure that the neighbors and the environment are protected.''
They outlined principles for safer extraction, including disclosing all chemicals used in fracking, minimizing water consumption and protecting groundwater, and reducing the impact on roads and ecosystems.
Matthew T. Ryan, the mayor of Binghamton, N.Y., which is in Broome County, one of the areas of potential fracking in the state, said he would prefer that his colleague downstate use his money to lobby for a national energy policy that emphasizes renewable energy instead of more fossil fuels.
''His water is protected,'' he said of the mayor. ''Ours isn't.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rise on Hopes For Further Fed Action

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Friday, paring the first weekly decline in almost two months for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, as the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said he saw ''scope for further action,'' increasing speculation that the central bank would act to stimulate economic growth.
Nine out of 10 groups in the S.& P. 500 rose, as consumer discretionary, industrial and technology stocks erased earlier losses. Watson Pharmaceuticals climbed 6 percent for the biggest gain in the index as its generic painkiller Lidoderm was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. QEP Resources rose 6 percent after agreeing to buy oil development properties in North Dakota. 
The S.& P. 500 added 9.05 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,411.13. The gauge fell 0.5 percent for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 100.51 points, or 0.8 percent, to 13,157.97.
''It was confirmation of Bernanke's commitment to potentially do something more if the economy appears it needs it,'' John Carey, who helps oversee about $220 billion at Pioneer Investments in Boston, said in a telephone interview. ''That was reassuring to people who might have thought he was stepping back from that.'' He added: ''It's summer trading and volume is light, so it doesn't take much to move the market. A little whiff of positive news was enough.''
The S.& P. 500 had advanced for the last six straight weeks amid optimism that global central banks would take actions to stimulate growth.
''There is scope for further action by the Federal Reserve to ease financial conditions and strengthen the recovery,'' Mr. Bernanke said in an Aug. 22 letter to the California Republican Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's July 31-Aug. 1 meeting showed that many members judged that more stimulus ''would likely be warranted fairly soon'' unless the rate of the recovery picked up. Mr. Bernanke will have an opportunity to clarify his views in his Aug. 31 speech at Jackson Hole, where he signaled a second round of bond-buying in 2010.
Global stocks fell earlier as two central bank officials said the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, might wait until Germany's Constitutional Court rules on the legality of Europe's permanent bailout fund before introducing details of his plan to buy government bonds. With the court set to rule on Sept. 12, investors looking for Mr. Draghi to announce a definitive program at his Sept. 6 news conference might be disappointed, according to the officials.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said at a joint news conference with Prime Minister Antonis Samaras of Greece that Germany was ready to help the Greek government as it took the necessary steps to resolve the country's economic woes.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as the VIX, fell 4.9 percent to 15.18 today.
The Morgan Stanley cyclical index, a gauge of 30 stocks tied to economic growth, rose for the first time in five days, adding 0.4 percent. Sears Holding led gains in the measure, rising 3.8 percent to $56.51. Masco, a home improvement and building products maker, advanced 1.4 percent to $14.13.
Nine out of 10 groups in the S.& P. 500 gained at least 0.4 percent, with telephone stocks rising the most. Consumer discretionary companies climbed 0.8 percent, after earlier falling as much as 0.2 percent. Industrial stocks added 0.5 percent after losing 0.4 percent. Technology stocks advanced 0.4 percent.
Watson Pharmaceuticals advanced 6 percent to $83.32 after the Parsippany, N.J., based generic-drug maker said in a statement after the market close Thursday that its generic version of Lidoderm received approval from the F.D.A. and it is planning on introducing the product in September 2013.
QEP Resources rallied 6 percent to $28.80. The explorer spun off from Questar in 2010 agreed to buy North Dakota oil assets from companies including Sundance Energy Australia, expanding its Williston Basin acreage by 30 percent.
Eli Lilly added 3.4 percent to $43.86 as the company said its experimental Alzheimer's treatment slowed the decline of cognition in some patients even though it failed to meet the primary goals of two large studies.
Autodesk fell 16 percent to $30.13 for the biggest decline in the S&P 500 after the software maker lowered its annual sales forecast and said it plans to cut jobs as it restructures to focus on cloud and mobile computing.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 4/32, to 99 14/32, and the yield rose to 1.69 percent from 1.67 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Dump It on the States

 BODY:
On Thursday, Mitt Romney unveiled the latest in a series of bad ideas for taking government duties out of Washington and hiding them in the back rooms of state capitols. Mostly, Mr. Romney wants to allow states to quietly smother social programs the federal government has run for decades. In the case of his new energy policy, he wants to give states power to bypass Washington's caution in burrowing for oil, gas and coal on federal lands.
States, he said, could accelerate the permitting process for energy extraction, resulting in far more production than Washington has allowed. That's probably true because many states have traditionally been poor stewards of their resources. They are far more captive than the federal government to the energy and timber interests that have long pressed for this concession and have far less oversight by government inspectors and journalists. 
No state, on its own, has an interest in preventing global climate change or reducing energy imports for strategic reasons. Those are national issues that need to be closely supervised by a government with broader interests than competing with the next state for oil leases. Bypassing those controls, which frustrates Mr. Romney and his generous supporters in the energy industry, are at the heart of his new energy policy.
Mr. Romney has a long list of other core federal functions that he wants to dump onto the states. He has proposed offloading Medicaid and food stamps by writing a sharply reduced check to the states to take care of the health and nutrition needs of poor people. He wants to repeal health care reform and let the states design their own programs for the uninsured (or not).
He wants to turn over federal job-training programs to the states, let them design their own unemployment insurance programs and give them a bigger role in designing immigration controls. (Of course, he is strongly opposed to giving the states flexibility in their welfare programs, lest they give money to a low-income family that isn't working up to Republican standards.)
Don't be fooled by his claims that states can perform these vital functions ''more efficiently'' than Washington. They can't. Battered by the downturn, states can barely perform the core functions they have. They have been laying off teachers and school personnel by the tens of thousands, cutting services to the poor past the bone and falling far behind on needed public works.
Mr. Romney is really saying that education and safety-net programs are so low on his priority list that he doesn't care what states do with them. If a blue state wants to pay for an adequate Medicaid and food stamp program, it is free to do so. But many red states care more about low taxes, and will not pay a price, no matter how much residents suffer. Many states are likely to compete in a race to the bottom to drive the poor into other states with governments that have a more enlightened sense of their role.
In many ways, that is already happening. To use one measure, the Southwest region has had the nation's greatest increase in child poverty over the last five years. But as Thomas Gais of the Rockefeller Institute notes in a forthcoming paper in the journal First Focus, states in the region have taken little action to deal with increasingly poor health and nutrition, along with declining education standards. Texas has been particularly disdainful of helping its huge uninsured population and cannot be relied upon to continue the new load of programs Mr. Romney wants to place on its shoulders.
The true hollowness of these proposals can be seen in the demands by Mr. Romney and Representative Paul Ryan to drastically slash the amount of state aid provided by Washington. Ronald Reagan had a misguided idea in 1982 when he proposed a ''new federalism'' that would give states control of welfare programs in exchange for complete federal control of Medicaid, but at least he wasn't proposing an abdication of Washington's responsibility for the safety net.
Mr. Romney wants to put these programs on the backs of state governments he knows cannot handle the load, then reduce the resources they have now. That may thrill a few die-hard opponents of government, but it could have disastrous consequences.

HEADLINE: Tax Credits Shed Light On Romney

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
What doesn't Mitt Romney want us to know?
The presumptive Republican presidential nominee's refusal to disclose more than his most recent two years of tax returns has spawned wide-ranging and sometimes far-fetched speculation from water coolers to talk shows. But a few tax experts are zeroing in on an esoteric corner of the tax code and pointing to some intriguing clues buried in the returns Mr. Romney has already revealed.
Mr. Romney has insisted that his returns from 2010, and preliminary returns for 2011 (until he provides a final version) are enough for voters to evaluate his fitness for office. But even though he has not released his returns from earlier years, the 2010 return sheds some light on those years.
That's because Mr. Romney paid income tax to foreign countries, and as result claimed in 2010 a $129,697 foreign tax credit, which he used to offset taxes he owed in the United States. American taxpayers who claim the foreign tax credit are required to report their total foreign taxes paid and tax credits used for the previous 10 years. So that return contains foreign tax data going back to 2000. 
The good news for Mr. Romney is the forms suggest that he paid at least some federal income tax every year, as he has said he did. He used the foreign tax credit every year to offset his taxes in the United States, and American taxpayers can't use a tax credit if they owe no federal income tax. This casts even more doubt on the claim by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, attributed to an unnamed Bain Capital source, that Mr. Romney paid no income taxes during that time.
But the data does suggest that Mr. Romney was able to reduce his taxable income in 2009 to a very low level, and thus might have paid relatively little tax -- even if it did, as Mr. Romney claims, amount to at least 13 percent of his taxable income. Tax experts also said it is theoretically possible, though highly unlikely, that he paid no federal income tax in 2009. At the same time, an unusually high foreign tax credit in 2008 raises questions about the size and source of Mr. Romney's foreign income that year and how it was treated for tax purposes.
There's nothing to suggest that Mr. Romney did anything wrong. He has said he has paid what he owed but not one dollar more. The Romney campaign has said that Mr. Romney's foreign income came through a blind trust established in 2003, when he became governor of Massachusetts. Thus, he didn't oversee the foreign investments that produced the income and tax credits.
But a relatively low taxable income in a year like 2009, as well as the large foreign tax credit in 2008, raise questions that he might prefer to avoid. They also shed light on tax avoidance tactics commonly used by the ultrawealthy but out of reach for the average taxpayer.
Foreign tax credits are highly prized because they reduce tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Every dollar of credit is a dollar in tax saved, unlike deductions, which reduce only taxable income. Most American taxpayers don't have foreign bank accounts or partnerships in the Cayman Islands, but many get a foreign tax credit because they own mutual funds that invest on foreign exchanges. Foreign taxes paid by the funds are passed on to shareholders in the form of tax credits. The rationale is that people shouldn't be taxed more than once on the same income.
That may sound simple, but the tax code is anything but. Over the years, wealthy taxpayers have found countless ways to game the system, and every time the Internal Revenue Service has moved to plug a loophole, the code has become more complicated. ''The U.S. tax laws for foreign income are a horrible mess,'' Daniel Shaviro, professor of taxation at New York University School of Law, told me this week. ''It's insanely complex.''
I discovered that firsthand over the last few weeks as I talked to accountants and struggled to make sense of those portions of Mr. Romney's return. Besides the credit itself, his return includes no fewer than four versions of I.R.S. Form 1116, used to calculate the foreign tax credit, as well as related worksheets, which contain the information from the previous 10 years.
I even took the online course offered by the I.R.S. to try to understand the complex calculations. Although I passed several quizzes, I still needed help from James R. Hines Jr., a professor of international taxation at the University of Michigan Law School.
Mr. Romney's return shows how wealthy Americans with foreign earnings can sharply reduce their tax liability in the United States. In 2010 Mr. Romney reported $2.73 million of gross foreign income. On that amount, he paid foreign taxes of $67,173, or just 2.5 percent of his gross foreign income.
After all his deductions (including the kind of noncash charges that are central to all tax shelters, like depreciation) that multimillion-dollar sum declines to just $392,000 in taxable income. This amount appears on his federal tax return, but at his 13.9 percent effective rate, the federal tax on that income -- $54,627 -- was more than offset by a $129,697 tax credit for foreign taxes he paid in 2010 and earlier years.
The I.R.S. has struggled for years to cap the foreign tax credit at the amount an American would have paid in tax on that same income in the United States, so as not to subsidize higher-tax foreign governments, but with limited success. One of the basic problems with the foreign tax credit, Professor Shaviro observed, is ''it's overgenerous.''
Mr. Romney's foreign tax credit was so high in 2010 in part because the tax code allows American taxpayers to use credits from previous years. Mr. Romney had an unused foreign tax credit from 2009 that he carried over to 2010, when he was able to use most of it (the rest was carried over to 2011). The year 2009 was the first time in 10 years that Mr. Romney didn't use the full amount of his foreign tax credit to offset his taxes in the United States, which means that his foreign losses that year more than offset his gains, producing a net loss. American taxpayers can't use a foreign tax credit if they don't report foreign income on their tax return.
Since Mr. Romney didn't use all the foreign tax credit available to him in 2009, tax experts said he must have reduced the tax owed on his foreign income to zero. In the highly unlikely event he also reduced his taxable income from United States sources to zero, or even showed a loss, he would have owed no federal income tax in 2009.
That's not the only evidence that Mr. Romney's income in 2009 was substantially lower than in 2010. He was able to use substantial losses from previous years to reduce his 2010 capital gains, indicating that he had no net capital gain in 2009. Capital gains accounted for most of Mr. Romney's income in 2010 -- $12.6 million of his $21.6 million total. In addition, he reported more than $800,000 in taxable refunds from 2009, which seems very high. If he had smaller refunds, lower speaking and director's fees, and lower business income or even a business loss, his adjusted gross income for 2009 could have been quite low, at least by Mr. Romney's standards. Assuming he had similar itemized deductions to the $4.5 million he had in 2010, his taxable income could have been extremely low.
The data Mr. Romney filed also indicated that his foreign tax liability shot up in 2008, the year the financial crisis began. His total foreign taxes amounted to nearly $800,000, far more than any other year. Even if his foreign tax rate was the comparatively high rate that prevails in the United States, 15 percent, that suggests substantial income, more than $5 million from his foreign assets.
How could Mr. Romney's blind trust have earned such amounts in foreign countries and generated such large tax credits? One possibility is that the financial crisis and resulting bleak economic outlook caused Mr. Romney's trustee to cash in long-held, appreciated foreign assets. Another possibility is that they resulted from some kind of more elaborate tax shelter, or some combination of the two. The issue has baffled tax experts.
The big foreign tax credit that year ''makes no sense to me at all,'' Professor Shaviro said. ''We have no idea what he actually did.'' But if it is the result of some kind of tax shelter, ''The key in general is to try to exploit technical gaps in the rules by using transactions that have little or no economic substance.'' He said the I.R.S. had challenged many such deals intended to generate foreign tax credits.
Professor Hines added: ''Lots of people are speculating about the source of this tax credit, but at this point it's just conjecture. Why doesn't he just release the returns?''
Mr. Romney doesn't even have to release his 2008 and 2009 returns to answer questions about numbers he has already made public on his 2010 returns. Since his foreign income and resulting tax treatment came through his blind trust, he presumably doesn't know the answers, but his trustee would. If there's a simple explanation -- or any explanation for that matter -- no one is offering it. After I discussed the foreign tax credit issues with a spokeswoman for the campaign, she declined to comment.
Mr. Romney aside, the complexity and frequent abuse of the foreign tax credit provisions seem to make another compelling case for tax reform. Professor Shaviro is writing a book on the topic, and says the foreign tax credit as it now exists is a ''nightmare,'' adding: ''It's subject to abuse. If it was up to me, I'd wipe out the credit, wipe out the deferrals, and simply tax all foreign income at a single low rate.''

HEADLINE: Appeals Court Blocks Graphic Warnings on Cigarettes

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- A federal appeals court struck down a law on Friday that requires tobacco companies to place graphic health warnings on their packages and advertising.
In a 2-to-1 decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said that the law, which is administered by the Food and Drug Administration, violated corporate free speech rights. The ruling contradicted another appellate court decision in a similar case this year, setting up the possibility that the United States Supreme Court will have to rule on the dispute.
''This case raises novel questions about the scope of the government's authority to force the manufacturer of a product to go beyond making purely factual and accurate commercial disclosures and undermine its own economic interest -- in this case, by making 'every single pack of cigarettes in the country a mini billboard' for the government's antismoking message,'' wrote Judge Janice Rogers Brown of the District of Columbia Circuit. 
The F.D.A. ''has not provided a shred of evidence'' showing that the graphic labels would reduce smoking, Judge Brown added.
The rules were challenged by five tobacco companies representing most of the major cigarette makers in the United States: Reynolds American, Lorillard, the Liggett Group, the Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company and Commonwealth Brands, which is owned by the Imperial Tobacco Group of Britain.
Judge Judith W. Rogers, who wrote the dissenting opinion, said the F.D.A. warnings were factual and necessary to counter tobacco companies' history of deceptive advertising.
''The government has an interest of paramount importance in effectively conveying information about the health risks of smoking to adolescent would-be smokers and other consumers,'' she wrote.
The F.D.A. has argued that the images of rotting teeth and diseased lungs are accurate and necessary to warn consumers, especially teenagers, about the risks of smoking.
The agency said on Friday that it did not comment on possible, pending or continuing litigation. The Justice Department, which argued the case for the F.D.A., said it needed to review the ruling before deciding on its next steps.
The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which has vigorously supported stricter cigarette laws, urged the government to appeal.
''Today's ruling is wrong on the science and law, and it is by no means the final word on the new cigarette warnings,'' Matthew L. Myers, the group's president, said in a statement.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 45 million adults in the United States smoke cigarettes, which are the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. And the World Health Organization predicts smoking could kill eight million people each year by 2030 if governments do not do more to help people quit.
Congress passed a law in 2009 that gave the F.D.A. broad powers to regulate the tobacco industry, including imposing the label regulation. The law requires color warning labels big enough to cover the top 50 percent of a cigarette pack's front and back panels, and the top 20 percent of print advertisements.
The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, based in Cincinnati, upheld the bulk of the F.D.A.'s tobacco regulations in March, including the requirement for warning images on cigarette packs.

HIGHLIGHT: We're number four! 

 BODY:
New Jersey's own Chris Christie will be the keynote speaker at the RNC, where he will be billed as a guy who gets things done. According to reports, however, one thing he won't be talking about is the state of the New Jersey economy.
You could argue that this omission makes sense. After all, state governors don't really have much impact on their local economies, at least in the short run. But here's the thing: Christie has spent most of his time in Trenton boasting about how well things are going here; it's the Jersey Comeback!
Or not:
I've included a real comeback story, because I think that it's kind of impressive that NJ now has a higher unemployment rate than Michigan; still only the fourth highest in the nation, but give it time.
OK, I don't really think this is Christie's fault -- but he was the one boasting about it.

 BODY:
Today's Times
 A 1968 car crash in France and the 1998 diagnosis of Ann Romney's multiple sclerosis were dark moments in what has otherwise seemed a charmed existence for Mitt Romney, Sheryl Gay Stolberg writes. Both offer clues into the Republican nominee's character and the way he reacts to challenges.
 The Capitol dome has 1,300 known cracks and breaks, and, according to the architect of the Capitol, has become a "public safety issue," Jennifer Steinhauer reports. The dome is imperiled not only by inclement weather, but by tough economic times and a politically polarized Congress, with the Senate appropriators voting to repair the dome and their House counterparts saying there is not enough money to do so.
 After President Obama's endorsement of same-sex marriage, coupled with the standoff between his administration and Catholic bishops over birth control, Republicans are sensing an opportunity to cut into the advantagethat Mr. Obama had among Catholic voters in 2008, Laurie Goldstein reports. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York will deliver the benediction at the Republican National Convention - a sign of a more aggressive push by Republicans to win over that voting bloc.
 While Mitt Romney's campaign will run a video tribute to Representative Ron Paul at the Republican National Convention, it is also proposing a new rule that would prohibit states from holding nonbinding primary contests and then picking delegates at a later state convention, Michael D. Shear reports. Mr. Paul used the existing process to amass a large delegation this year, primarily in states where Mr. Romney had won highly publicized but nonbinding contests.
 Representative Todd Akin's Senate campaign is seemingly reinvigorated after beating back attacks from the Republican establishment, John Eligon writes. He used his first public appearance since the controversial comments about rape victims as an effort to turn the focus back to his opponent, Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri.
 Mitt Romney seemed to make a joke about President Obama's birth certificate at a campaign stop in Michigan, but his aides quickly walked back the comments, saying he was only sharing his state pride, Ashley Parker and Trip Gabriel write. But other remarks by Representative Paul D. Ryan seemed to emphasize a cultural difference between his ticket and Mr. Obama's.
Weekly Address
 President Obama used his weekly address to add what he called "some actual facts" to the current political melee over Medicare, saying that there are "a lot of accusations and misinformation flying around." He said that the health care overhaul has helped give older Americans deeper discounts on prescription drugs, made sure preventive care like mammograms and other cancer screenings are free without co-pay, and extended the life of Medicare by almost a decade. He said he was willing to work with anyone wanting to improve the current system, but derided the plan by Congressional Republicans to turn Medicare into a voucher program. "I think our seniors deserve better," he said. "Here in America, we believe in keeping our promises - especially to seniors who have put in a lifetime of hard work and deserve to enjoy their golden years."
Around the Web
 The Romney campaign has barred one of its spokesmen in Colorado from dealing with the press after it was revealed that she prohibited a journalist from asking questions about abortion or Representative Todd Akin, Politico reports.
 Members of the tech community took to Twitter tovoice their disappointmentin the gender imbalance among the new crop of fellows selected for the White House Presidential Innovation Fellowship Program, The Hill reports.

HEADLINE: Romney Compares Protesters to a Greek Chorus

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney said he had re-read Mr. Obama's Denver acceptance speech. "He says marvelous things," Mr. Romney said. "He just hasn't done them." 

 BODY:
POWELL, Ohio - Mitt Romney had a message for the protesters who greeted him and Representative Paul D. Ryan, along with 5,000 supporters, here on Saturday morning: "This is kind of like the Greek chorus in the background," he said, in a reference to President Obama's speech four years ago at the Democratic convention in Denver, which he delivered in front of large Greek columns. 
"Everything they do reminds us of Greece and we're not going to Greece," Mr. Romney said. "We're going to get America back to being America."
Mr. Romney said he had re-read Mr. Obama's Denver acceptance speech, and that it was "really a brilliant speech."
"He says marvelous things," Mr. Romney said. "He just hasn't done them." 
He returned to the Greek theme later in his speech, using the protesters to attack Mr. Obama's record.

"Our Greek chorus out there is chanting, 'Four more years!' " Mr. Romney said. "Do you want four more years of high unemployment? Do you want four more years of declining wages? Do you want four more years of home values in the basement? Do you want four more years of the big banks getting bigger, the small banks getting smaller? Do you want four more years of Barack Obama?"
As the crowd shouted "No," Mr. Romney replied: "Neither do I."
Mr. Romney, who often uses his wife, Ann, to make a pitch to female voters, made the appeal himself Saturday.
"Just a word to the women entrepreneurs out there," he said. "If we become president and vice president, we want to speak to you, we want to help you. Women in this country are more likely to start businesses than men. Women need our help."
He returned to the topic later.
"I want to speak to the women of America who have dreams, who begin businesses in their homes, who begin businesses out in the marketplace, who are working in various enterprises and companies: I want you to be successful," he said. "Our campaign is about making it easier for entrepreneurs, women and men, to start businesses, to grow businesses."
Even Mr. Ryan got in on the routine. Talking about growing "the pie so everybody has a chance at the American idea," he made sure to use the female pronoun.
"We want every American to be able to achieve her potential," Mr. Ryan said.

HEADLINE: The Antisocial Contract

BYLINE: ROBERT O. SELF


HIGHLIGHT: The very idea of a culture war over values clouds what's really at stake: women's economic freedom. 

 BODY:
WHEN the Republican Party meets in Tampa, Fla., this week, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey will deliver the keynote address. He promises "hard truths." Twenty years ago, the Democrat-turned-Republican Phil Gramm had that job. Warning to Governor Christie: no one remembers anything Mr. Gramm said. What we do remember from the 1992 convention in Houston is the jeremiad delivered by Patrick J. Buchanan, the former speechwriter for Richard M. Nixon who won nearly a quarter of Republican primary votes that year. With his invocation of a "cultural war" for the "soul of America," Mr. Buchanan brought down the house.
His fulminations against abortion, homosexuality and other hot-button "cultural" issues exceeded tolerable political rhetoric and likely hurt President George Bush in the general election. But Mr. Buchanan nonetheless set the tone for the Clinton years, and "culture war" became shorthand for the battle between Red and Blue in the 1990s.
With Mitt Romney trying to keep the focus on the economy, Mr. Buchanan's outrage is not the preferred Republican template for 2012. But the primary season and Mr. Romney's selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan as his running mate are evidence that the culture wars are still raging. Controversies over transvaginal ultrasound, birth control, Mr. Ryan's strict anti-abortion views and, perhaps most spectacularly, the notion of "legitimate rape" put forward by Representative Todd Akin, the Republican candidate for Senate in Missouri, indicate that cultural issues remain front and center.
This should come as no surprise. For liberals, government promises to support individuals and families economically. For conservatives, government promises to protect individuals and families morally. Nothing has divided our two political tribes in the last half century quite like that distinction.
But at least two things distinguish 2012 from 1992. First, 8 percent unemployment and the weak recovery suggest that the state of the economy might work in the Republicans' favor. Second, many single women have given up on the Republican Party; they identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party by a 2-to-1 margin.
In this environment, culture-war appeals can backfire as easily as they can succeed. That was evident last week as Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan spent precious time calling for Mr. Akin to end his campaign against Senator Claire McCaskill for a seat Republicans hoped to win.
But treating the economy, on one hand, and women and family, on the other, as if they are mutually exclusive is a fallacy. When Americans argue about gender, sex and family, they are arguing about equality, power and money - in essence, about the nature and role of government.
What we call the culture wars are only the tip of a historical iceberg, the visible part of a protracted and wrenching fight over American citizenship that dates from the 1960s (and beyond to the suffrage movement). The fight over feminism cannot be confined to a narrative about "culture wars." Indeed, the very idea of a culture war clouds what's really at stake.
Conventional wisdom has it that in politics there are values issues and economic issues, with "values" conservatives and "fiscal" conservatives to match. Yet this distinction obscures as much as it reveals. When we cast culture-war issues solely in terms of religious or moral values, we miss their deep entanglement with government power.
How people conceive of these issues - reproductive rights, say, or rape, or sexual harassment - says a great deal about how they view the social contract. The social contract is supposed to bind us together. It's everything from Medicare to the Americans With Disabilities Act to Social Security to the Equal Pay Act. It is the basic architecture of our collective responsibility to ensure that Americans share in a decent life. The social contract says that though our individual fates differ, we have a collective destiny, too. Many of us respond viscerally to comments from politicians like Mr. Akin because he leaves us wondering what place for women Republicans see in that collective future.
TO tease this out, let's go back to a moment that few remember today: the 1971 debate over child care. It may seem implausible, but that year Congress passed the Comprehensive Child Development Act, which would have established government-supported child care for middle-class families. Led by Marian Wright Edelman (who later founded the Children's Defense Fund), dozens of liberal organizations had lobbied relentlessly since the late 1960s for the bill. Ms. Edelman told Congress that child care was critical for "more than 12 million working women in this country."
For the liberals who pushed child care onto the national agenda, and for the Democrats who controlled Congress, it represented an addition to the social contract. Like Social Security and Medicare, it spread the cost of a social good across society.
President Nixon eventually vetoed the bill, but not before his inner circle gave government-supported child care a fairer hearing than did any subsequent Republican administration. Kevin Phillips, one of the architects of Nixon's famed "Southern strategy" for building a new Republican coalition, explained the administration's thinking: "Working mothers, a huge slice of the electorate, are extremely reachable on the subject of day care."
Nixon's veto message, in which, despite Mr. Phillips's insight, he called the bill "the most radical piece of legislation to emerge from the 92nd Congress," was among the first shock waves of a new kind of politics.
Nixon had actually been taken by surprise by the eruption of a small but vocal segment of his party over the bill. John G. Schmitz, a congressman from Orange County, Calif., predicted the "destruction of the basic family unit" if the bill passed. Senator James L. Buckley of New York insisted that it would "destroy parental authority and the institution of the family."
But Republicans like Mr. Schmitz and Mr. Buckley did not dominate the party as they do today. The most vocal opposition to new government initiatives came from the grass roots. A woman named Jaquie Davison founded an organization called Happiness of Womanhood - HOW - in her living room in Kingman, Ariz., to respond to feminism's rising popularity. Her blond bouffant hairstyle stood in proud defiance of the Gloria Steinem-inspired natural look popular among her feminist adversaries in the National Organization for Women. In 1971, Mrs. Davison embarked on what she called a "satin pillow" tour of the United States. "As real women, we want to defend our homes," she told reporters. Satin pillows - not work gloves and not government child care - were women's birthright.
The child care imbroglio was part of an emerging pattern. Mainstream feminists fought to ensure women's equality by revising the social contract to include protection of their standing in American life. Conservatives like Mr. Schmitz and Mrs. Davison responded with appeals to values. As Mrs. Davison revealingly saw it, women's homes were under assault not so much by the feminist vision of the family as by the government. On her tour, she ran through the list of government perfidies: child care, sex education, abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment (in 1971, Congress was debating the E.R.A., and Roe v. Wade had just landed on the Supreme Court's docket).
The threat to the family stalking the land was not women's liberation but an expansive government seeking to intrude upon and regulate the private sphere. What liberal women saw as routes to equality, conservatives saw as invasions of the private sphere of morality, an invasion only a huge, interventionist government could accomplish.
To Americans who saw things the way Mrs. Davison did, this threat had first become apparent some years earlier. By including "sex" in the employment section (Title VII) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress had committed the national government to advancing a vast array of women's rights. Nebulous at first, those rights gradually came into view as women in organizations as different as the National Welfare Rights Organization, led largely by poor women of color, and the A.C.L.U.'s Women's Rights Project, led by a young lawyer named Ruth Bader Ginsburg, spent two decades litigating on behalf of gender equality in the workplace.
Their efforts were not about values or culture; they were about the dollar. They wanted to fix the market, not the American family. They sought to strip the former of all the advantages law and custom had given to men.
The feminists who waged these battles may have overestimated government's capacity to adapt to a changing society, as many liberals of that era did. But their ambitions were not radical. They sought what many women still seek: to bring the law into alignment with how they actually live, to make it possible for women to raise families and to work for pay at the same time.
Before the Akin flare-up, the many fronts of the right's war on women might have seemed little more than attempts to inflame the passions of the conservative base, but Mr. Akin has done us a favor. He has drawn the curtain back on how central women are to a presidential campaign in which no women are actually running. This election is not about the gap between the economy and the culture wars. It's about how they collapse together, and in the candidates' views of women we catch a glimpse of how we will write the social contract over the next generation.

HEADLINE: Citing Weather, Republicans Cancel First Day of Convention

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican National Convention will officially open on Monday but will immediately recess until Tuesday afternoon at a time to be determined later, Mr. Priebus said. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. - Republicans on Saturday canceled the opening day of their national convention, saying their first concern was for the safety of delegates and guests in the face of Tropical Storm Isaac, which is strengthening and is headed toward Florida's West Coast.
"Our first priority is ensuring the safety of delegates, alternates, guests, members of the media attending the Republican National Convention and citizens of the Tampa Bay area," Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement.
"R.N.C. convention officials and the Romney campaign are working closely with state, local and federal officials, as well as the Secret Service, to monitor Tropical Storm Isaac and preserve Florida's emergency management resources," he said. "Officials have predicted participants may encounter severe transportation difficulties due to sustained wind and rain."
The convention will officially open on Monday but will immediately recess until Tuesday afternoon at a time to be determined later, Mr. Priebus said.
Planners stressed that the official business of the convention will go on as planned later in the week.
"The Republican National Convention will take place and officially nominate Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, and the party has other necessary business it must address," Mr. Priebus said in the statement. "We also are remaining in constant contact with state and federal officials and may make additional schedule alterations as needed."
Canceling the first day disrupts a carefully planned schedule that had been intended to highlight Mr. Romney's qualifications and offer a critique of President Obama.
The opening day was to have been called "We Can Do Better," featuring speakers who would address what they considered to be the failures of Mr. Obama's administration. Planners had said "real people who have been affected by the Obama economy" were scheduled to speak.
Officials said the roll call vote of the states nominating Mr. Romney would take place on Tuesday. And they expressed confidence that the message of the convention would be effectively made in three days.
"We will absolutely be able to get our message out," said Russ Schreifer, a top aide to Mr. Romney. "We still have an opportunity to tell the story of the last four years of how President Obama has failed the country."
He added, "We think we can absolutely do it in three and we look forward to telling that story."
Among the speakers scheduled to address the delegates on Monday were Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, and Nikki R. Haley, the governor of South Carolina. Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, and Florida's current governor, Rick Scott, were also supposed to speak on Monday.
They and the other speakers may be rescheduled and fit into the other three days. Republican officials said they would make announcements about a new plan as soon as Sunday morning.
"We have been working closely with the campaign, the party and state and local officials for months to ensure a successful, enjoyable convention," Bill Harris, the chief executive officer of the convention, said in a statement. "Federal, state and local officials assure us that they are prepared to respond, if needed, and the scheduling changes we are announcing today will help ensure the continued safety of all participants."
The main three broadcast networks had already deemed the first day to be less interesting than the rest of the convention and decided not to carry any of the prime time speeches live. In response, convention planners had moved Ann Romney's speech from Monday to Tuesday.
The weather situation was eerily reminiscent of four years ago, when a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico also forced the cancellation of the first day of the Republican convention.
But in 2008, Republicans were meeting in Minnesota. Because the hurricane had the potential to hit New Orleans, convention planners decided they did not want to risk a poor reaction from voters watching partisan speeches as people suffered along the Gulf Coast.
As of Saturday evening, Tropical Storm Isaac was headed into the Gulf after battering Haiti. The track of the storm suggested that it could bring heavy rains and winds to South Florida and perhaps to Tampa.

HEADLINE: Erin Miles, Adam Cloud

BYLINE: By TIFFANY FRASIER

 BODY:
Erin Elizabeth Essen Miles and Adam Ormand Cloud were married Saturday at the Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church in Baltimore. The Rev. Dr. Edwin A. Ankeny, a retired United Methodist minister, performed the ceremony. 
The bride, 29, is a staff lawyer in the family defense practice of the Bronx Defenders, a nonprofit organization that provides free legal representation in civil and criminal cases. She graduated from Emory University and received a law degree from Fordham.
She is the daughter of Cathleen J. E. Miles and Melvin N. Miles Jr., of Baltimore. The bride's father, is the director of university bands at Morgan State University in Baltimore. Her mother is the principal of the Abbottston Elementary School in Baltimore.
The groom, 32, is the manager of business services and real estate at East Williamsburg Valley Industrial Development Corporation, an economic development organization in Brooklyn that provides financing, real estate and government incentives to small businesses. He graduated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County and received an M.B.A. from New York University.
He is the son of Shirley L. Faulcon and Dwight Cloud, both of Baltimore. His mother is a customer accounts coordinator for Baltimore Gas and Electric Company. His father is a sales representative for Sears in Baltimore.
The couple met in 1995 when Ms. Miles, then 12, went to a Christmas party in Baltimore at the home of Mr. Cloud's paternal grandmother, Margaret Cloud. Ms. Miles was the best friend of one of his cousins, Dea Thomas.
After years of family gatherings and holidays spent together, Mr. Cloud and Ms. Miles developed a friendship. It was in May 2001, when Ms. Miles was a senior in high school, that the relationship moved beyond that. He came to the rescue when one of her friends was stood up at her senior prom, and stood in as her date.
''When I found out that he was coming to my prom, I was excited because I hadn't seen him in a long time,'' Ms. Miles said. ''I was flirting with him the whole time but he didn't seem interested. I thought it was a lost cause.''
Mr. Cloud was interested, but was reluctant to pursue a relationship given their history together. ''Since I had known her for so long and she was my cousin's friend I was hesitant to ask her out,'' he said.
Two months later, at a Fourth of July barbecue, he finally got the courage to ask her out. ''He ran to the car as I was leaving and asked for my number,'' Ms. Miles said. ''I said yes, of course. I had been waiting a long time for him to ask me out.''
The following September, Ms. Miles left Baltimore to start college in Atlanta. ''No one thought that we would survive being apart during college,'' Ms. Miles said. ''My father told colleagues that our high school romance wouldn't last the test of college.''
But the couple wrote letters and e-mail, and Mr. Cloud made the 12-hour drive from Baltimore to see her every six weeks.
''It took a lot of effort to make things work. But she always made me feel comfortable and happy and the relationship kept getting better and better.'' TIFFANY FRASIER

HEADLINE: Where the Mob Keeps Its Money

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SAVIANO. 
A journalist and the author of the book ''Gomorrah.'' He has lived under police protection since 2006, when he received death threats from organized crime figures in Italy. This essay was translated by Virginia Jewiss from the Italian.

 BODY:
Rome
THE global financial crisis has been a blessing for organized crime. A series of recent scandals have exposed the connection between some of the biggest global banks and the seamy underworld of mobsters, smugglers, drug traffickers and arms dealers. American banks have profited from money laundering by Latin American drug cartels, while the European debt crisis has strengthened the grip of the loan sharks and speculators who control the vast underground economies in countries like Spain and Greece.
Mutually beneficial relationships between bankers and gangsters aren't new, but what's remarkable is their reach at the highest levels of global finance. In 2010, Wachovia admitted that it had essentially helped finance the murderous drug war in Mexico by failing to identify and stop illicit transactions. The bank, which was acquired by Wells Fargo during the financial crisis, agreed to pay $160 million in fines and penalties for tolerating the laundering, which occurred between 2004 and 2007.
Last month, Senate investigators found that HSBC had for a decade improperly facilitated transactions by Mexican drug traffickers, Saudi financiers with ties to Al Qaeda and Iranian bankers trying to circumvent United States sanctions. The bank set aside $700 million to cover fines, settlements and other expenses related to the inquiry, and its chief of compliance resigned. 
ABN Amro, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Lloyds and ING have reached expensive settlements with regulators after admitting to executing the transactions of clients in disreputable countries like Cuba, Iran, Libya, Myanmar and Sudan.
Many of the illicit transactions preceded the 2008 crisis, but continuing turmoil in the banking industry created an opening for organized crime groups, enabling them to enrich themselves and grow in strength. In 2009, Antonio Maria Costa, an Italian economist who then led the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, told the British newspaper The Observer that ''in many instances, the money from drugs was the only liquid investment capital'' available to some banks at the height of the crisis. ''Interbank loans were funded by money that originated from the drugs trade and other illegal activities,'' he said. ''There were signs that some banks were rescued that way.'' The United Nations estimated that $1.6 trillion was laundered globally in 2009, of which about $580 billion was related to drug trafficking and other forms of organized crime.
A study last year by the Colombian economists Alejandro Gaviria and Daniel Mejía concluded that the vast majority of profits from drug trafficking in Colombia were reaped by criminal syndicates in rich countries and laundered by banks in global financial centers like New York and London. They found that bank secrecy and privacy laws in Western countries often impeded transparency and made it easier for criminals to launder their money.
At a Congressional hearing in February, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, a Justice Department official in charge of monitoring money laundering, said that ''banks in the U.S. are used to funnel massive amounts of illicit funds.'' The laundering, she explained, typically occurs in three stages. First, illicit funds are directly deposited in banks or deposited after being smuggled out of the United States and then back in. Then comes ''layering,'' the process of separating criminal profits from their origin. Finally comes ''integration,'' the use of seemingly legitimate transactions to hide ill-gotten gains. Unfortunately, investigators too often focus on the cultivation, production and trafficking of narcotics while missing the bigger, more sophisticated financial activities of crime rings.
Mob financing via banks has ebbed and flowed over the years. In the late 1970s and early 1980s organized crime, which had previously dealt mainly in cash, started working its way into the banking system. This led authorities in Europe and America to take measures to slow international money laundering, prompting a temporary return to cash.
Then the flow reversed again, partly because of the fall of the Soviet Union and the ensuing Russian financial crisis. As early as the mid-1980s, the K.G.B., with help from the Russian mafia, had started hiding Communist Party assets abroad, as the journalist Robert I. Friedman has documented. Perhaps $600 billion had left Russia by the mid-1990s, contributing to the country's impoverishment. Russian mafia leaders also took advantage of post-Soviet privatization to buy up state property. Then, in 1998, the ruble sharply depreciated, prompting a default on Russia's public debt.
Although the United States cracked down on terrorist financing after the 9/11 attacks, instability in the financial system, like the Argentine debt default in 2001, continued to give banks an incentive to look the other way. My reporting on the 'Ndrangheta, the powerful criminal syndicate based in Southern Italy, found that much of the money laundering over the last decade simply shifted from America to Europe. The European debt crisis, now three years old, has further emboldened the mob.
IN Greece, as conventional bank lending has gotten tighter, more and more Greeks are relying on usurers. A variety of sources told Reuters last year that the illegal lending business in Greece involved between 5 billion and 10 billion euros each year. The loan-shark business has perhaps quadrupled since 2009 -- some of the extortionists charge annualized interest rates starting at 60 percent. In Thessaloniki, the second largest city, the police broke up a criminal ring that was lending money at a weekly interest rate of 5 percent to 15 percent, with punishments for whoever didn't pay up. According to the Greek Ministry of Finance, much of the illegal loan activity in Greece is connected to gangs from the Balkans and Eastern Europe.
Organized crime also dominates the black market for oil in Greece; perhaps three billion euros (about $3.8 billion) a year of contraband fuel courses through the country. Shipping is Greece's premier industry, and the price of shipping fuel is set by law at one-third the price of fuel for cars and homes. So traffickers turn shipping fuel into more expensive home and automobile fuel. It is estimated that 20 percent of the gasoline sold in Greece is from the black market. The trafficking not only results in higher prices but also deprives the government of desperately needed revenue.
Greece's political system is a ''parliamentary mafiocracy,'' the political expert Panos Kostakos told the energy news agency Oilprice.com earlier this year. ''Greece has one of the largest black markets in Europe and the highest corruption levels in Europe,'' he said. ''There is a sovereign debt that does not mirror the real wealth of the average Greek family. What more evidence do we need to conclude that this is Greek mafia?''
Spain's crisis, like Greece's, was prefaced by years of mafia power and money and a lack of effectively enforced rules and regulations. At the moment, Spain is colonized by local criminal groups as well as by Italian, Russian, Colombian and Mexican organizations. Historically, Spain has been a shelter for Italian fugitives, although the situation changed with the enforcement of pan-European arrest warrants. Spanish anti-mafia laws have also improved, but the country continues to offer laundering opportunities, which only increased with the current economic crisis in Europe.
The Spanish real estate boom, which lasted from 1997 to 2007, was a godsend for criminal organizations, which invested dirty money in Iberian construction. Then, when home sales slowed and the building bubble burst, the mafia profited again -- by buying up at bargain prices houses that people put on the market or that otherwise would have gone unsold.
In 2006, Spain's central bank investigated the vast number of 500-euro bills in circulation. Criminal organizations favor these notes because they don't take up much room; a 45-centimeter safe deposit box can fit up to 10 million euros. In 2010, British currency exchange offices stopped accepting 500-euro bills after discovering that 90 percent of transactions involving them were connected to criminal activities. Yet 500-euro bills still account for 70 percent of the value of all bank notes in Spain.
And in Italy, the mafia can still count on 65 billion euros (about $82 billion) in liquid capital every year. Criminal organizations siphon 100 billion euros from the legal economy, a sum equivalent to 7 percent of G.D.P. -- money that ends up in the hands of Mafiosi instead of sustaining the government or law-abiding Italians. ''We will defeat the mafia by 2013,'' Silvio Berlusconi, then the prime minister, declared in 2009. It was one of many unfulfilled promises. Mario Monti, the current prime minister, has stated that Italy's dire financial situation is above all a consequence of tax evasion. He has said that even more drastic measures are needed to combat the underground economy generated by the mafia, which is destroying the legal economy.
Today's mafias are global organizations. They operate everywhere, speak multiple languages, form overseas alliances and joint ventures, and make investments just like any other multinational company. You can't take on multinational giants locally. Every country needs to do its part, for no country is immune. Organized crime must be hit in its economic engine, which all too often remains untouched because liquid capital is harder to trace and because in times of crisis, many, including the world's major banks, find it too tempting to resist.

HEADLINE: Financing Student Housing

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
AS college students prepare for fall classes, some of their parents or grandparents will be studying up on the real estate markets near campus.
Investing in student housing may not only help to reduce the room-and-board portion of the tuition bill, but also provide a revenue source, and in some cases a tax deduction.
Valerie Adelman, a wealth manager and a principal of the Financial Asset Management Corporation in Manhattan, says many of her clients have invested in property near colleges for family members to use for a few years, reclaiming it for themselves afterward. She says that the key to a successful purchase is to concentrate on making ''a good investment choice -- the bonus is that their child can live there at the same time.'' 
Families must decide whether they're buying the property as their second home or solely as an investment, in which case it would be run as a business, with costs and depreciation deducted from rental income. This would require more record-keeping, but can provide tax benefits, experts say.
As long as you are buying a one- to four-family home, you will probably qualify for a residential mortgage. The lender will expect the buyers to show that they have sufficient steady income and a good credit score (740 or higher is ideal).
Lenders often call these properties ''kiddie condos,'' and they typically put the student on the mortgage along with the parents so it can be considered owner-occupied housing, said Jeff Lipes, a vice president of Rockville Bank, which is based in South Windsor, Conn., and the president of the Connecticut Mortgage Bankers Association.
''Most people who are going to college are not making anything near what is needed to buy a home,'' Mr. Lipes noted. Yet being on the mortgage will help them build their credit and take some responsibility for the property.
''As long as they're of age, absolutely'' the students go on it, said Jody Tobia, a senior vice president for mortgage lending of Somerset Hills Bank in Madison, N.J. That way, the parents' and student's incomes (if the student has any) are used to qualify for the home loan, he said, even though the student is unlikely ever to make a payment.
Owner-occupied properties typically qualify for lower mortgage rates and down payments, Mr. Tobia said; his bank usually expects at least a 20 percent down payment.
If your child is attending college in a distant city, you may need to find a lender there. Some parents may refinance their primary residence or take out a home-equity loan to finance the purchase of the second home, Mr. Tobia said.
One advantage of using the property as a second home is that the parents get to deduct the mortgage interest and property taxes. But keep in mind: you can only claim two residences.
Interest in student housing has been steadily rising as enrollment in colleges and universities has increased. According to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics, enrollment rose 33 percent from 2000 to 2009.
Lawrence Yun, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, suggested in a post this spring on the Realtors' blog that because of increases in college enrollment, ''buying a rental property in college towns or college areas of a large city may prove a good return on investment for those who are patient.''
Parents looking to buy property near colleges, however, may face some competition for student housing. A quarter of colleges have plans to build on-campus housing, of which 39 percent expect to do so within five years, according to a survey of 209 university housing administrators published in June by College Planning and Management.

HEADLINE: Appreciation For Vintage Cars, In Two Senses

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
Monterey, Calif.
FOR solid financial returns, gold seems nearly alone among investments that are legal -- and fathomable -- to those of us who are not bankers. Gold's performance over the last five years has been overwhelmingly positive, its price per ounce more than doubling since 2007.
But the skyrocketing prices of certain Ferraris built from the 1950s through the 1970s have in some instances made gold's gaudy rate of appreciation look like a passbook savings account at the neighborhood bank branch.
''People who have been in the collectible automobile market and originally bought for the love of object are now looking at it as a diversification tool and a strategic part of a well-organized investment portfolio,'' Claiborne Booker, an independent financial consultant based in Virginia, said. 
Certainly, Ferraris are not the only vintage vehicles whose values have outstripped inflation and conventional investments, but they have been one of the most reliable market indicators among collectible automobiles. And their sales at auctions are closely followed, so there is a reliable track record on which projections can be based.
Examples of impressive returns can be found in several Ferraris consigned to the auctions that took place here in the days around the Pebble Beach Concours d'Élégance. Gooding & Company of Santa Monica, Calif., offered a rare 1962 Ferrari 400 Superamerica Coupe Aerodinamico, one of only about 14 built by the coachbuilder Pininfarina, each car individualized for its first buyer. No two were precisely alike in their details.
That car was offered with Gooding's presale estimate of $1.75 million to $2 million; it sold for nearly $2.4 million, including buyer's premium. The same car sold nine years ago at a Barrett-Jackson auction in Los Angeles for $432,000. That represents a $2 million return in less than 10 years, a period that some investors consider a lost decade.
Perhaps those results could be attributed to good luck or great intuition. But the timing of the buyer in 2003 could scarcely have been better: shortly after the red Superamerica was purchased, prices for the model began to rise, indicated by sales of other Superamericas: a $560,000 sale of a similar car in late 2005, followed by a jaw-dropping $1.6 million sale in Pebble Beach in 2008 and culminating with a $2 million sale at RM's Monterey auction last year.
The year-over-year difference between this year's sale and the one last year is an impressive $400,000. Condition, ownership history and the circumstances of the sales are all influencing factors in the price, surely, but the trend is still unmistakable.
Later, higher-production Ferraris like the 365 GTB/4, commonly known as the Daytona, have also seen increases in price exceeding that of gold over the same period. The Daytona was one of the last models whose development was influenced directly by Enzo Ferrari. They're brutish, exceedingly handsome and quite fast even by today's standards; with a top speed of 172 m.p.h., the Daytona was the fastest production car available for much of its time on the market.
RM Auctions of Chatham, Ontario, offered two Daytona coupes this year, a black 1973 model and a bright yellow 1972. The yellow car had a relatively active auction history over the last decade. The same car was offered at a Bonhams auction in Massachusetts in 2003 where it failed to sell on a high bid of $97,000. Six years later, Bonhams once again offered the car, this time at its auction in Carmel, Calif., where the seller again declined the high bid -- which, at $210,000, was more than double that of the last time out.
This year, the presale estimate for the same car was $375,000 to $475,000. The third time across the block was clearly the charm, and patience paid off: the yellow Daytona sold for $396,000, while the more staid black car went for about $30,000 less.
The impressive returns have not been limited to Ferraris and other rare European exotics. Following Carroll Shelby's recent death, there were an unusually large number of Shelby automobiles offered in Monterey.
There were predictions of a Shelby feeding frenzy, but in reality the market seemed to have taken Mr. Shelby's death at age 89 into account quite some time ago. Even so, over the last 10 years, the most collectible Shelbys have done quite well.
For instance, RM's auction here included the sale of a 1965 Shelby Mustang GT350 R, a rare competition version of the GT350, for $990,000. Three years ago, in the depths of the recession, Russo & Steele sold a similar car in Monterey for just $396,000. In 2003, RM Auctions also sold a GT350 R for $206,700.
To maximize the return on a Shelby, however, one's timing had to be astute -- either getting into the market in the early part of the last decade or buying after a recent, but apparently short-lived, correction. It should be noted that at the prerecession height of the market in 2007, these cars were trading for prices near what the RM car brought.
Just as gold has had its share of peaks and valleys, so have collectible automobiles. Ferraris in particular have had periods of considerable volatility.
According to Michael Sheehan, a Ferrari historian and dealer, the market has imploded twice in the last 30 years or so. The first time was in 1979, and then it happened again -- spectacularly -- in 1990 after a sharp downturn in the stock market, coupled with the bursting of the Japanese real estate bubble, began a slide in the Ferrari market. By 1995, some models lost 75 percent of their value.
''There's no sign of an imminent bubble burst in the current market, but most people don't realize that some Ferraris still haven't regained their 1989 highs,'' Mr. Sheehan said.
Naturally, this raises questions about the wisdom of buying a classic automobile for its investment potential -- after all, there are storage, maintenance and insurance costs to consider -- rather than the pleasure that ownership brings.
Drew Alcazar, founder of the Russo & Steele auction house, said in a telephone interview that he had witnessed three previous boom periods in the collector car market before the current one.
''Some of the really big cars eclipsed high-water marks from a few years ago that we didn't think would return this soon,'' he said. ''While there are without question certain cars that are blue-chip cars, if you wake up tomorrow to find that what you paid XYZ for is now worth five bucks, but it still puts a smile on your face, then you're doing things right.
''You should do your due diligence and then buy what you like,'' Mr. Alcazar said.

Two Ferrari models with well-documented auction histories, charted below, have outpaced both the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the spot price of gold. This trend is indicative of other vintage Ferraris, provided they are quality examples of desirable models and in top condition with the proper equipment and supporting paperwork.

HEADLINE: Border Cities Are Burdened With Calls for Help

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

 BODY:
CALEXICO, Calif. -- The calls come in thick and fast from the border, just blocks from the fire station here.
A woman suffered heatstroke in line at the port of entry. A person detained by customs officers complained of chest pain. An illegal immigrant broke his leg trying to hop the 20-foot wall that divides Calexico from its Mexican twin city, Mexicali.
In each case, the Calexico Fire Department responded. 
All along the Southwest border, from San Diego to Brownsville, Tex., local fire departments respond to medical calls as they would to any emergencies within their city limits. But such calls for medical assistance at the border have become a growing burden on the finances and resources of fire departments in cities like this one, in the California desert 100 miles east of San Diego.
Last year, with trips to the port of entry and the Border Patrol station and others to assist injured fence-jumpers, Calexico firefighters responded to 725 calls associated with the border -- a fifth of all calls the department received.
Chief Pete Mercado said the department's lone ambulance would sometimes make 10 trips to the port of entry in a given day. For many of those, he said, the department is not able to collect payment, while the ambulance is rendered unavailable for other emergencies.
''It's a very difficult thing for us to continue to do without some type of funding,'' Chief Mercado said. ''We've absorbed the cost for all these years. I can't express how difficult it is.''
Representative Bob Filner, a Democrat who represents California's entire border with Mexico, introduced a bill last year that would have required the federal government to reimburse cities for the cost of providing emergency response services at the border. But with Congress struggling to reduce the $1 trillion federal deficit, the bill seems unlikely to pass.
''At a time when every city budget is affected, the federal government should not be relying on local revenue to deal with these issues,'' Mr. Filner said. ''Unfortunately, there is very little understanding of the border situation in Congress.''
Calexico is hardly the only city fire department strained by constant runs to the border.
In San Diego, the Fire Department responded to more than 2,000 medical emergencies at border crossings last year. In San Luis, Ariz., at least 70 percent of the calls that the Fire Department receives come from the port of entry, officials said.
A huge portion of the patients at the ports of entry or in Border Patrol custody have no health insurance, according to the fire departments, leaving the departments to cover the cost of care.
In El Paso through the first six months of this year, the Fire Department collected reimbursement on 18 percent of the cost of calls to the ports of entry, compared with a collection rate of more than 50 percent for all calls.
In Douglas, Ariz., the fire chief, Mario Novoa, estimated that about 15 percent of the department's calls came from the port of entry. Firefighters also offer medical assistance to people the Border Patrol finds in the desert, more than 25 miles outside the city limits.
Chief Novoa called the collection rate on trips associated with the border ''dismal'' and ''a burden on the taxpayers.''
Not all calls from the border involve medical emergencies. In the area around Calexico, many citizens who moved to Mexico after the economic crisis of 2008 in search of a lower cost of living return to the United States for medical care, firefighters said, often calling 911 to get to the hospital. Others, tired of waiting in line at the port of entry, where the sun is a hammer, use the ambulance like a taxi to get across the border more quickly.
''We do have individuals who abuse the system,'' said Luis Cebreros, a spokesman for the San Luis Fire Department.
Chief Mercado said without assistance from the federal government to help offset the cost of the border runs, he worries that Calexico city officials might outsource the fire department.
Already, the federal government does cover some of the costs that local fire departments incur in responding to calls from the border. Some departments received federal grants -- in San Luis, the grants account for most of the fire department's operating budget, while in Calexico and Douglas, grants make up less than 10 percent of the budgets, according to fire officials.
In addition, the federal government is responsible for the cost of medical care when a person has been taken into custody by customs officers or Border Patrol agents.
In practice, however, fire chiefs in several border cities said they were seldom able to collect any reimbursement from the United States Customs and Border Protection service in such cases.
''Sometimes the calls do originate from the Border Patrol, when the patient is in custody, and the bill does get sent to the federal government,'' Chief Novoa said. ''The fact of the matter is, though, we don't recoup anything. You'd think it would be a no-brainer.''
Officials from Customs and Border Protection declined to provide statistics about reimbursement for medical treatment of people in custody.
In Calexico, each call -- be it a heart attack or someone looking for a ride -- usually ties up the city's lone ambulance for at least an hour, as firefighters drive to the nearest hospital, in neighboring El Centro, and back.
Sylvia Bernal said she worries that the delay might have been fatal for her mother. Eight years ago, Ms. Bernal, now 62, called 911 when her mother began complaining of back pain. The Calexico Fire Department sent a fire truck and paramedics, but they waited 20 minutes for the ambulance, which was on another call, to arrive.
By the time the ambulance reached the hospital, her mother's lung had collapsed. She died hours later.
''I don't know what would have happened if the ambulance would have gotten there in time,'' Ms. Bernal said. ''To have to live with this 'what if' for a long time, I don't wish that on anyone.''

HEADLINE: Making A Living, One Project At a Time

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
Q. You have noticed some high-level professionals leaving permanent jobs -- either by choice or by necessity -- to work on a project basis for a variety of different companies. Is this something you should consider doing?
A. Because the recession caused many companies to push for leaner management teams and to reduce their head counts, they've lost some of the expertise they once had in their ranks. That has made room for the career project professional -- a highly experienced professional who works in the short term on specific projects, says Jody Greenstone Miller, founder and C.E.O. of the Business Talent Group, a placement firm in Los Angeles. ''These people want control over their time, the kind of work they do and with whom they work,'' she says. 
Career project professionals are generally experts in their fields, with a demonstrable record of high-level accomplishments, Ms. Miller says.
In such work, it's important to have the ability -- both financially and emotionally -- to live from project to project, without the security that comes with permanent employment, says Wyatt A. Nordstrom, chief executive of Maven, an online professional marketplace for project-based consultants. ''You may work steadily for six to eight months and then there will be down time,'' he says.
Q. In what industries is demand greatest for career project professionals?
A. They are often specialists in a particular area within a certain industry, whether it's nuclear science or supply chain management. Those with experience in information technology are in especially high demand, says Jonathan Thom, vice president for professional staffing at Express Employment Professionals, a staffing firm based in Oklahoma City. There is also rising demand in accounting and marketing, he says. You might be a finance professional brought in to assist with an internal audit, or a marketing professional asked to manage a corporate re-branding.
Q. How do you get started? Should you register with an agency or a consulting firm that places independent workers?
A. Registering with an agency that lists projects for high-level professionals is one way to find work. But most career project professionals use their own networks. ''Ninety percent of the people we work with get their work from those they know,'' says Gene Zaino, chief executive of MBO Partners in Herndon, Va., which provides back-office support for independent consultants.
If you've allowed your professional network to stagnate, you should rebuild it before trying to get project-based work, Mr. Thom says. ''You want to be able to ask those in your network what you might be able to help with,'' he says.
Because you must sell your skills continuously, you need confidence -- and the ability to articulate clearly to prospective clients what you do and why it's valuable, Mr. Zaino says.
Q. What can you expect to earn when working on your own?
A. On an hourly basis, project-based work usually pays 50 percent to 100 percent more than what a full-time salaried professional earns, Mr. Nordstrom says. Much depends on the need for your skills in your geographic market, he says. And remember that at some point in the year, you are likely to be between projects and not earning anything.
One downside of project-based work is that you are responsible for finding and paying for your health insurance. That can be costly, especially if you have to insure an entire family.
Mr. Thom says that having a financial safety net will help you feel more secure during downtime. He suggests putting aside three to six months of living expenses before leaving your permanent job. ''Of course,'' he says, ''people do this every day with less in the bank, sometimes not by choice, and they manage.''
Q. What are the challenges in leaving permanent salaried employment for a career in project-based work?
A. Many of those who start working independently don't really know how to run a business, Mr. Zaino says. ''It's difficult enough to find clients and deliver good service,'' he says, ''but now you have to navigate taxes, regulatory issues, figure out if you have the right business insurance, how to get invoices out and how to approach clients when payment is overdue.''
You'll also need a sounding board, so try to find a mentor who has been successful at independent contracting. ''Most good companies have mentorship and career advice built in,'' he says. ''When you're on your own, you have to build that in yourself.''

HEADLINE: I Made the Robot Do It

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Boston
WHEN you hear the insane notion of ''legitimate rape'' being aired by a Republican congressman -- a member of the House science committee no less -- it makes you wonder some days how we became the world's richest, most powerful country, and, more important, how we're going to stay there. The short answer is that, thank God, there's still a bunch of people across America -- innovators and entrepreneurs -- who just didn't get the word. They didn't get the word that Germany will eat our breakfast or that China will eat our lunch. They didn't get the word that we're in a recession and heading for a fiscal cliff. They're not interested in politics at all. Instead, they just go out and invent stuff and fix stuff and collaborate on stuff. They are our saving grace, and whenever I need a pick-me-up, I drop in on one of them. 
I did just that last week, visiting the design workshop of Rethink Robotics, near Boston's airport, where I did something I've never done before: I programmed a robot to perform the simple task of moving widgets from one place to another. Yup, I trained the robot's arms using a very friendly screen interface and memory built into its mechanical limbs.
And therein lie the seeds of a potential revolution. Rethink's goal is simple: that its cheap, easy-to-use, safe robot will be to industrial robots what the personal computer was to the mainframe computer, or the iPhone was to the traditional phone. That is, it will bring robots to the small business and even home and enable people to write apps for them the way they do with PCs and iPhones -- to make your robot conduct an orchestra, clean the house or, most important, do multiple tasks for small manufacturers, who could not afford big traditional robots, thus speeding innovation and enabling more manufacturing in America.
''If you see pictures of robots welding or painting'' in a factory, ''you will not see humans nearby because it is not safe'' being around swinging robot arms, explains Rethink's founder, Rodney Brooks, the Australian-born former director of the M.I.T. Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the co-founder of iRobot, which invented the Roomba vacuum-cleaning robot. Traditional industrial robots are fixed and not flexible, and they take a long time -- and a skilled engineer -- to program them to do one repeatable task.
''Our robot is low-cost, easily programmable, not fixed and not dangerous,'' says Brooks. ''We were in a small plastics company the other day, and the owner said he is using the robot for two hours to do one task and then rolling it over to do another. With our robots, you teach them about the specific task you want done, and when you are done with that, you program another one.'' And if your hand gets in the way, the robot just stops.
The Rethink design team includes Bruce Blumberg, the product manager of the Apple LaserWriter -- as well as 75 other experts from Russia, Georgia, Venezuela, Egypt, Australia, India, Israel, Portugal, Britain, Sri Lanka, the United States and China. ''It is all made in America,'' says Brooks, but by ''the best talent'' gathered ''from around the world.''
This is the company of the future. Forget about ''outsourcing.'' In today's hyperconnected world, there is no ''in'' and no ''out.'' There's only ''good, better and best,'' and if you don't assemble the best team you can from everywhere, your competitor will.
The Rethink robot will be unveiled in weeks. I was just given a sneak peek -- on the condition that I did not mention its ''disruptive'' price point and some other unique features.
''Just as the PC did not replace workers but empowered them to do many new things,'' argues Brooks, the same will happen with the Rethink robot. ''Companies will become even more competitive, and we will be able to keep more jobs here. ... The minute you say 'robots' people say: 'It's going to take away jobs. But that is not true. It doesn't take away jobs. It will change how you do them,'' the way the PC did not get rid of secretaries but changed what they did.
Actually, the robots will eliminate jobs, just as the PC did, but they be will lower-skilled ones. And the robots will also create new jobs or enlarge existing ones, but they will be jobs that require more skills. I watched a Rethink robot being tested at the Nypro plastics factory in Clinton, Mass. A single worker was operating a big molding machine that occasionally spewed out too many widgets, which forced the system to overload. The robot was brought in to handle overflow, while the same single worker still operated the machine. ''We want the robot to be the extension of the worker, not the replacement of the worker,'' said Michael McGee, Nypro's director of technology.
This is the march of progress. It eliminates bad jobs, empowers good jobs, but always demands more skill and creativity and always enables fewer people to do more things. We went through the same megashift when our agricultural economy was replaced by the industrial economy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Therefore, what this election should be about is how we spawn thousands of Rethinks that create new industries, new jobs and productivity tools. Alas, it isn't. So I'm just grateful these folks here in Boston didn't get the word.

He modeled his arrangement, displayed on a video monitor deceptively framed as a painting, after an 18th-century still life by Jan van Huysum. Keep watching, though, and smoke slowly starts to billow from the flowers as a siren sound builds to an operatic crescendo. An explosion then blows glass and petals and smoke across the picture plane in all directions. Jewel-like shards fall in a silent slow-motion cascade, protracted and meditative, before the piece, titled ''Big Bang,'' loops back to the beginning in an endless cycle.
It is one of 25 films, videos and photographs that draw simultaneously on the histories of art and politics in ''Ori Gersht: History Repeating,'' this Israeli artist's first museum survey show, which opens Tuesday at the Museum of Fine Arts here. ''Big Bang,'' completed in 2006, was also part of ''Times Square Moment: A Digital Gallery'' in April, playing once a night that month on a dozen huge advertising screens, including several stacked vertically on a single building. 
''When the explosion happened, you had the sense that that entire building was collapsing,'' Mr. Gersht said in an interview at the museum, adding that he found associations with Sept. 11 unavoidable in this context. ''But someone can look at it and be mesmerized by the sheer beauty of the event,'' he said. ''I'm interested those oppositions of attraction and repulsion, and how the moment of destruction in the exploding flowers becomes for me the moment of creation.''
For Mr. Gersht, born in Tel Aviv three months before the Six-Day War in 1967, the sound of sirens was formative in his youth. He remembers his mother waking him to run downstairs to shelter as the sound wailed nightly during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, in which his father fought. Mr. Gersht directly experienced two more wars, including the first Lebanon war in 1982 and the first intifada, which began in 1987 as he was finishing his stint as a medic during his mandatory military service. He moved to London in 1988 and lives there today with his wife, a painter, and their two children.
''Ori grew up amidst fear and violence in a land of stunning physical beauty and great history,'' said Al Miner, who organized the exhibition for the museum, where he's an assistant curator of contemporary art. ''At the heart of Ori's work is this intersection of beauty and violence. It's an almost subversive approach to using aesthetics to lure a viewer into dealing with subject matter that's very difficult.''
Since completing his master's in photography at the Royal College of Art in London in 1995 Mr. Gersht has experimented with how the camera and contemporary technology can redefine the way we perceive the world. Using high-speed digital equipment he was able to capture, in crisp resolution, every detail of the exploding flowers. In another piece he shows the path of a bullet shot through a pomegranate in a still life setup quoting a 17th-century work by Juan Sanchez Cotán -- along with the resulting spray of crimson juice. At the other end of the spectrum he has used extremely long exposures with an analog camera to produce delicate, melancholic landscapes that almost dissolve under the gaze.
''I'm constantly working on these edges of photography, either to employ so much information or reduce information to the point of collapse,'' said Mr. Gersht, who spent much of his youth in the projection room of the art cinema his father ran in Tel Aviv, which showed everything from Truffaut films to the ''Rocky Horror Picture Show.''
Mr. Gersht is also interested in the notion of landscape as a witness to history. He first made prolonged exposures in 2003, photographing ancient olive trees in Palestinian villages in Israel. The intense midday light seared the film, and from his blackened negatives Mr. Gersht coaxed haunting, otherworldly prints of the gnarled trees.
''The trees were there before the Ottoman occupation and British Mandate and before the current conflict and somehow retain within them this memory,'' he said. He compared the accumulation of light over time on the film, which continually eroded the clarity of the images, to the idea of forgetting.
Mr. Gersht, who is both soft-spoken and emphatic as he discusses his work, has traveled to many sites of historical trauma over the course of his career. He drove to Sarajevo shortly after the war there and took pictures from the window of a train moving between Krakow and Auschwitz. He has gone to Hiroshima to photograph cherry blossoms that bloom in the irradiated soil, and to swamps on the border of Poland and Belarus that were used for hiding during the Nazi era.
His most personal journey, he said, was to the Ukrainian countryside in 2005 with his wife, Nogah Engler. Her father had hidden there for two years, under floorboards in the house of a sympathetic family, after the Nazis had shot more than 2,000 Jewish villagers at the top of a nearby mountain on the edge of a forest. ''Everything looked very pastoral,'' he said. At night they read her father's matter-of-fact accounts of what happened at these locations. ''We walked back in the landscape in the daytime and the experience changed so much.'' The same shift happens for the viewer looking at Mr. Gersht's ethereal images after reading the caption information.
He also made his first projected film, ''The Forest,'' on that trip. In it the camera pans through the dense woods outside his father-in-law's village, the location both a safe haven for those in hiding and a site of atrocities. Trees start to fall, one by one and from no apparent cause, crashing thunderously before an ominous tranquillity is temporarily restored.
''I wanted to create the illusion that the trees are falling in a paranormal manner,'' said Mr. Gersht, who worked with the British Consulate and the Ukrainian government to accelerate the chopping down of diseased trees marked for removal. In the Boston show the piece is one of three immersive cinematic experiences presented in individual projection rooms.
For the museum, which opened its new contemporary wing last September, the exhibition has been its biggest foray into film and video, Mr. Miner said.
He commissioned Mr. Gersht to do a new video for the show based on a piece from the Museum of Fine Arts collection. In ''Liquid Assets,'' a molten, pewter-colored disc seems to ripple and strain against invisible forces. A face barely starts to emerge, then disappears, then slowly reappears in the mercurial circle, which finally comes to rest as a coin imprinted with the profile of a king.
Mr. Gersht used an ancient Greek coin from the museum's collection as his starting point and spent 18 months figuring out how to achieve this alchemy. He prefers to keep the specifics of his process mysterious but emphasized that the shifting image was exactly what the camera recorded, without digital manipulation (though it is shown backward and at a much slower speed). He was thinking about the meltdown of the economy, the span of Western civilization and that coins may soon be obsolete, he said. But first and foremost he wanted to offer the viewer a sensual visual experience. ''The longer I manage to suspend the tension of not being able to resolve what you're looking at,'' he said, ''the more successful the work will be.''

HEADLINE: Aerobic Fortitude a Big Plus

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
THE Harlem River curves by Kingsbridge, a middle-class neighborhood of 47,000 folded into a valley in the northwestern Bronx. There's also a busy highway, the six-lane Major Deegan Expressway, that slices through the area. And mature trees shade many sidewalks -- as along Tibbett Avenue, which is named for a brook buried long ago.
But the feature that makes the most lasting impression is the series of open-air public stairways running up neighborhood hills; they seem as steep and geometric as lines on a graph.
One staircase, squeezed between midrise apartment houses, connects West 231st Street with Naples Terrace. Another links Bailey and Heath Avenues. And Ewen Park, an expanse of lawns at Kingsbridge's edge, even has a staircase reminiscent of the magisterial Potemkin Stairs, in the Ukrainian seaport of Odessa (though not anywhere near as wide or as long); they climb up, and up, and up, promising a heart-pounding shortcut to Riverdale. 
''They're really important, because the roads zigzag so much,'' said Dean Parker, a resident, referring to all the stairs. ''It would take too long to get around without them.''
For new arrivals, adjusting to the neighborhood can be like a strenuous stair climb: It requires a little work and some faith, maybe, but the payoff can be extraordinary, residents say.
For Mr. Parker, who works as a composer, Kingsbridge offered the chance to buy a house large enough to include a recording studio -- which would have been unthinkable in many city neighborhoods, especially in the two-bedroom co-op he used to own in Riverdale.
His seven-bedroom, 2,300-square-foot house, bought in December, also has room enough for an office for his wife, Tanya Krohn, an SAT tutor, and plenty of space for the couple's two sons.
The 1910 wood-frame home, with a gambrel roof and metal siding, and views of the Jerome Park Reservoir from the third floor, cost $250,000, about a third of what it would have sold for in Riverdale, Mr. Parker guesses. But it definitely was not in move-in condition: at some point, pipes broke, raining water down on walls. Mr. Parker took care of some renovating himself.
The upside was the area, with its interesting mix of residents -- quite different from Bronxville, in the Westchester suburbs, which Mr. Parker recalled as homogeneous. ''I like a diverse economy, diverse cultural backgrounds,'' he said. ''I think it keeps everybody polite.''
There also seems to be a golden rule in effect about working together to solve problems. Mr. Parker, for instance, recently aided a neighbor's house-painting job by letting him set up a ladder in his yard. ''Everybody realizes that it's better off to be connected than isolated here,'' he said.
Judging from the local attitude toward various new commercial developments in recent years, people also appreciate their importance in providing a needed jolt to the somewhat ragtag shopping strip along Broadway.
Tears were shed in 2009 when Stella D'Oro, the cookie company, closed its longtime factory on West 237th Street, but many are looking forward to a 118,000-square-foot BJ's, of big-box fame, which is set to rise in its place.
Also, a 133,000-square-foot shopping center is to go up on a city parking lot on West 230th Street. And, under plans being weighed by the city, the castlelike Kingsbridge Armory, long empty, could someday have shops inside.
They would join River Plaza on West 225th Street, an eight-year-old mall with a Target store, which Urvashi Rangan is fond of. But she often has to drive to Yonkers in Westchester (where she works as a toxicologist) for big grocery purchases, which is why she's in favor of new supermarkets.
''If we were living in the country and somebody was going to stick a big development next to me,'' Ms. Rangan said, ''I don't think I would like it. But we live in a very dense area already, and everybody needs to eat.''
Though some blocks may be shoehorn-tight, that doesn't mean they lack for square footage, or style. A case in point: Ms. Rangan's home, a four-story Queen Anne that soars from a skinny lot, boasting cedar clapboards, pocket doors and a turret. In 2002, it cost $410,000. But it, too, needed major fixes, including a new boiler, kitchen and roof.
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
Ms. Rangan's house is in Marble Hill -- which, though contiguous to the neighborhood and on the same side of the Harlem River, is not officially part of the Bronx at all, but a part of Manhattan, to which it was geographically connected before the river was reoriented in 1897, cutting it off.
Yet just as Marble Hill telephones use the Bronx's 718 area code and the area is represented by the Bronx's Community Board 8, Marble Hill residents don't cross the river every time they go shopping. Boundaries are one thing, convenience another, as Ms. Rangan's approach makes clear. Describing the sometimes annoying way salsa music blares from cars and echoes up the hills, she said, ''There's a vibrancy here that's made me appreciate the Bronx.''
Kingsbridge is a patchwork of smaller neighborhoods, each with a personality all its own, spread over barely 0.75 square miles.
Kingsbridge proper sits in the crease of a valley. Along Corlear Avenue, a row of bungalows look as though they could be on a waterfront. And at the turn of the last century West 230th Street was actually an oxbow of the Harlem River, before it was diverted and the riverbed filled.
Close by are attached brick homes from a more modern era, some of which seem tiny beside glassy high-rises that have recently shouldered their way in.
Terraced across the eastern ridge is Kingsbridge Heights, where row houses have security gates on their windows, as on Heath Avenue. The crime rate in the 50th Precinct, which includes upscale Riverdale, is relatively low: there were four murders in 2011, versus eight in 2001, and one so far this year.
Van Cortlandt Village, which flanks the reservoir, is dominated by co-ops: to be precise, the Amalgamated Cooperative Houses, a Tudor-esque complex developed by a garment workers union in 1927. It has 1,500 units in 11 buildings.
In 2004, a city rezoning made it harder to build tall condominiums.
As for the reservoir, it is dry now, but will be refilled by next summer, according to the city Department of Environmental Protection; at that point a water tunnel being built next door in Van Cortlandt Park will be complete.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
Eighty-five percent of the housing stock is rentals, census figures show. That means there is never a lot on the for-sale market. This month there were 30 listings, among them houses, co-ops and condos, asking an average of $246,000, according to Streeteasy.com.
They ranged from a co-op studio in a seven-story brick building on Kingsbridge Terrace facing the reservoir, at $69,900, to a postwar two-family row house, with a total of five bedrooms and updated kitchens, at $795,000.
Sales volume has plunged since the recession, though prices have since stabilized. In 2007, at the height of the market, there were 119 sales of market-rate houses, co-ops and condos, at an average price of $267,000, according to Streeteasy data. In 2011 there were just 27, though the average was virtually unchanged.
The market is relatively resilient because Kingsbridge is ''close to everything: transportation, good schools, parks,'' said Maria Moragianis, a broker with Weichert Realtors House and Home, who lived there for 25 years. ''It just works all around.''
WHAT TO DO
Irish bars are scattered along Broadway, though the area is about 60 percent Latino today. And Gaelic Park stadium, where Gaelic football matches were once regularly played, is today mostly used by Manhattan College students for soccer.
In 2011, after delays, the Kingsbridge Library opened in a new glass-walled home on West 231st; a sunken rock garden offers a place to relax with a book.
THE COMMUTE
Those who work on the West Side of Manhattan can hop on the No. 1 train at West 225th, West 231st or West 28th Street. Times Square is about a 25-minute ride.
East Side commuters can take Metro-North Railroad, from a Marble Hill stop on the Hudson line. On weekdays from 6 to 8 a.m., six trains leave for Grand Central Terminal, arriving in about 20 minutes. Monthly passes are $178.
THE SCHOOLS
Public School 95, in Van Cortlandt Village, is one option for kindergarten through eighth grade. On state exams last year, 46 percent of fourth-graders met standards in English, 62 percent in math. Citywide, those percentages were 51 and 62.
Next door is the public AmPark Neighborhood School, a six-year-old grade school with a more arts-focused curriculum. It enrolls 280 students.
The John F. Kennedy High School enrolls about 1,150 students. SAT averages last year were 348 in reading, 355 in math and 331 in writing, versus 437, 460, and 432 citywide.
THE HISTORY
The neighborhood is named for the first bridge connecting Manhattan to the mainland, erected in 1693 in honor of King William III of England. Tolls applied to all people, and cows, crossing it.

HEADLINE: Early Detection For Brain Injuries

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG

 BODY:
FOOTBALL teams of the future -- even high school squads on limited budgets -- may someday have a new tool to check players for brain injuries. It's a special form of headgear, packed with sensors that read the brain waves of athletes after they come off the field, thus detecting changes caused by the trauma of hard knocks.
The compact, portable sensors decipher neural activity by measuring changes in the brain's tiny magnetic field. These small magnetometers -- still in the laboratory and in prototype -- have yet to be tried on athletes. But their potential is enormous for brain imaging and for inexpensive monitoring of brain diseases, as well as for many other applications like the control of prosthetics, said Dr. José Luis Contreras-Vidal, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Houston. 
Dr. Contreras-Vidal's research includes work on a system that will use brain signals to control prosthetic legs.
''This is a transformative technology'' that could make brain interfaces available at a small cost, he said. ''We could potentially use these devices to record in real time brain waves that could be analyzed for specific diseases such as Alzheimer's, or the progression of these diseases.''
The research is occurring at a time of growing concern about collisions and subsequent brain injuries in sports -- and the dire effects that may show up only many years later. But an inexpensive system for spotting changes in brain behavior could play an important safety role one day in boxing, football and many other sports.
The magnetic sensors, part of a field called optical or atomic magnetometry, were created at the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colo., by Svenja Knappe and colleagues.
''We are trying to make them small and inexpensive,'' Dr. Knappe said of the devices, each roughly the size of a sugar cube. The sensors are designed to be mass-produced in the future, so that several hundred of them might one day line the inside of the special headgear that detects brain changes. She and her colleagues are also trying to improve the sensors' performance.
Instruments that measure magnetic fields are not new, said Dr. Dmitry Budker, a physics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and an editor of ''Optical Magnetometry,'' a coming book.
But the sensors under development at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and other labs may someday offer portability, compactness and flexibility that isn't possible with conventional magnetometers called superconducting quantum interference devices, or Squids. Those superconducting devices are highly sensitive detectors for brain signals, said Matti S. Hamalainen, a neuroscientist who specializes in functional brain imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. But they require cryogenic cooling, and patients must be protected from the extremely low temperatures with a heavy, insulated housing.
Installing Squid systems can cost $1 million to $3 million, Dr. Hamalainen said. So they won't be found on a high school football field soon.
He said the compact sensors have advantages. Unlike those in superconducting devices, they could be used at room temperature, and in helmets that could match the size of the head.
''It would be nice to be able to use a portable, adjustable sensor'' that could be fitted closer to the skulls of smaller adults and children, he said. ''The closer you are to the sources of the signals, the better the information you can get.''
The magnetic sensors may also help to interpret neural signals in other applications, Dr. Contreras-Vidal said. One standard, noninvasive way to read the complex snap, crackle and pop of neurons is by electroencephalography, or EEG. A cap of electrodes is placed on the skull to eavesdrop on the signal.
''But there are many artifacts when you record electrical brain waves with EEG,'' he said. ''You get a fuzzy, blurry picture of what's going on inside. Some of these problems do not occur when you are using magnetic recordings.''
AT the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Thad G. Walker, an atomic physicist, uses optical magnetometry to monitor the magnetic fields of the beating heart rather than the brain. Professor Walker and his group have created small magnetometers that are an inexpensive alternative to superconducting devices now used to spot various heart abnormalities in a fetus.
The technology is sensitive enough to measure different features of the heart signal of a 20-week-old fetus, he said.
Research groups at many institutions are trying to find practical and economical ways to commercialize optical magnetometry, said Dr. Michael Romalis, a physics professor at Princeton University and a prominent researcher in the field.
''My guess is that it will take a few years for these efforts to mature,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Carefully Calibrated For Protest

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
DEPENDING on your taste, punk died in 1979, or maybe 1994, or whenever studded leather cuffs became a must-have mall-girl accessory. Now, suddenly, punk has been resurrected, stitched together anew in the form of the well-accessorized Russian women who call themselves Pussy Riot.
The name helps. It's its own form of culture jam, a savvy reference to feminist and musical history -- riot grrrl and Susie Bright, as well as a wink to women's appropriation of sexual agency and bodily power. Madonna has worn Pussy Riot's name on her bare skin, a statement both of her support and of her own rebelliousness. (She still knows how to flaunt it.) The inevitable aesthetic judgment has found these girls, as they sometimes refer to themselves, on the right side of cool. For women identified with rock 'n' roll -- and for fans, especially in the West -- Pussy Riot is expertly constructed, perfectly charged. Plus, it's fun to say -- unless you're in American network news, which has been demurely referring to the group as an all-female punk band. 
But for artists and activists around the world the recent travails of Pussy Riot, founded in 2011, have become a cause célèbre. When its members, Maria Alyokhina, Yekaterina Samutsevich and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, were sentenced on Aug. 17 to two years each in a prison camp for staging a flash protest against President Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow's main Orthodox cathedral in February, it served as another rallying point, at a time when many are concerned with government malfeasance, economic and social equality, and, not incidentally, women's rights. The ladies of Pussy Riot are of-the-moment renegades.
That the group is so digestible to Western audiences has been much noted. Yes, the choppy performance that got its members arrested could have just as easily taken place at an undergrad art school, where the corresponding video might've been mocked for its low production value (or turned up in a flashback episode of HBO's ''Girls''). Instead, when it made the rounds online, it found eager and sympathetic spectators and an instant distribution channel aided by social media. Punk was never shy about being amateur; DIY spread wide is its hallmark. And in a country where public dissent is at a neophyte stage, Pussy Riot's ''Punk Prayer,'' a 40-second lip sync, only served to highlight the discordantly severe punishment its members received. Supporters -- like the hundreds who gathered at a reading in New York on the eve of the sentencing -- viewed the group members as unfairly judged, less creatively shackled musicians than oppressed symbols of heroism.
It's been a long time since music had the whiff of danger, and longer still since it carried the beat of political change, at least in democracies. Hardly anyone would've expected that to come out of Russia, where both the songcraft and the messaging seem outdated, vestiges of retro power-pop and a barely concealed propaganda machine. The women of Pussy Riot took those tools and used them for their own sophisticated means. Immediately after their conviction on charges of hooliganism based on religious hatred -- a more punk indictment could scarcely be invented -- Pussy Riot, though only nominally a band, released its first single. Titled, in translation, ''Putin Lights Up the Fires,'' it's defiance set to bracing guitars and drum kicks. You can't seal us in a box, the women shout in a singsong as they demand more jail time. The chorus announces that the country is taking to the streets, bidding farewell to the regime, driven by a ''feminist wedge.'' A few acolytes, complete with balaclavas, performed it in the courthouse during the sentencing. It's pure agitprop, and it's incredibly catchy.
Paul McCartney, Bjork, Peter Gabriel and many other performers have expressed solidarity, as has Amnesty International; Kathleen Hanna, a founder of riot grrrl, saw in Pussy Riot the movement's future. Although called a punk band on TV, it's not quite right to consider Pussy Riot as musicians yet. Instead, these women belong squarely with art provocateurs and thinkers like Judith Butler (whose pioneering feminist influence they acknowledged) and Guerrilla Girls, the anonymous rabble-rousers who took on the sexist art establishment only to be welcomed into it (now part of the permanent collection in the Museum of the Modern Art). Pussy Riot's unapologetic court statements revealed an intellectual and philosophical rigor, and its earlier efforts with the art group Voina offered even more brazen forms of dissent.
''Pussy Riot are our kind of girls: feminist activists in masks making trouble,'' Kathe Kollwitz and Frida Kahlo, pseudonymous Guerrilla Girls, wrote in an e-mail. ''But,'' they added, ''we live in a very different culture where art is not as dangerous, and we can pretty much do what we want.''
The Russian response to Ms. Alyokhina, 24; Ms. Samutsevich, 30; and Ms. Tolokonnikova, 23, has been mixed at best. Russians are generally deeply distrustful of feminism, even though Russian women are no shrinking violets.
Yet the stoicism of Ms. Samutsevich, Ms. Alyokhina and Ms. Tolokonnikova -- the latter two, we are frequently reminded, the mothers of young children -- has made a deep impact in both Russia and the West. Their symbolism as radicals -- Ms. Tolokonnikova with her fist raised as she was led out of the courtroom -- has been so successful in the West that there is now debate not about whether to support them but on what grounds: as social agitators, or broad critics of the Kremlin. For its part the group -- along with an unofficial spokesman in Pyotr Verzilov, Ms. Tolokonnikova's husband -- has made its ambitions plain: revolution.
''One really inspiring thing about Pussy Riot is that they always make it clear that their actions are political and feminist,'' the Guerrilla Girls wrote. ''The world needs more feminist masked avengers. We urge everyone to make trouble, each in her own way.''
That message was not lost on Aug. 17, when thousands around the world protested the two-year sentences. A lawyer for the women, Nikolai Polozov, said they would appeal, though he noted they would not ask Mr. Putin for a pardon. ''Literally this is what they said: 'Let them go to hell with their pardon,' '' he told Agence France-Presse of his clients.
Ms. Tolokonnikova and Mr. Verzilov's 4-year-old daughter has been making plans to bust her mother out of jail. ''She draws diagrams showing how we can go about doing this with bulldozers and buses, first by tearing down the prison walls and then by breaking open the cage,'' he told the German publication Der Spiegel.
In New York, where, as in many other cities, people were arrested as they expressed their solidarity with Pussy Riot. Marian, a 12-year-old soon to enter eighth grade, came to the demonstration in Times Square from her home in Queens. She held a neon drawing of a balaclava, having been warned that wearing one might get her in trouble.
''It's cruel -- they're in jail for two years, and they just spoke their minds; I'm here to support them,'' said Marian, whose parents did not want her last name used. She wore a flowered dress and silver Doc Martens, explaining eagerly that she considered herself a riot grrrl. ''It was a thing in the '90s,'' she offered, adding that she began to think of herself as a feminist at the age of 10, learning about it from her mother, Christine. ''Mostly by example,'' Christine said. Marian, the daughter of a Russian father, read about Pussy Riot online, absorbing its videos and ethos.
''The fact that they're not apologizing for what they did is really inspiring to me,'' she said. She looked around the sparsely attended protest. ''I feel like if people did this more,'' she said, ''women would be more respected.''

HEADLINE: In New Haven, A Market Opens, And Others Follow

BYLINE: By LIONEL BEEHNER

 BODY:
TUCKED amid New Haven's gritty downtown not far from the well-groomed Yale campus lies the Ninth Square, a district of old red-brick buildings whose storefronts sat mostly vacant for decades. But that has changed in recent years. The opening last year of a sprawling organic food store, Elm City Market (elmcitymarket.coop), announced the area's rebirth, with an assist from an urban-renewal city initiative that has converted empty spaces into artsy businesses called Project Storefronts. A wave of new art galleries, trendy boutiques and Brooklyn-style lofts stuffed with architects and social media types has followed. ''We have so many like-minded people with a do-something attitude that want to collaborate in a shared space,'' said Ben Berkowitz, a founding member of MakeHaven (266 State Street; makehaven.org), a collaborative workshop. The same might be said of the Ninth Square at large. LIONEL BEEHNER

HEADLINE: With New Toll Lanes, Concerns Over Mexico Traffic

BYLINE: By AMAN BATHEJA. 
abatheja@texastribune.org

 BODY:
As El Paso prepares for its first toll lanes, officials in this border city are struggling with a question that for geographical reasons has been of less concern in Dallas, Austin and Houston, where toll roads are prevalent and proliferating: Will Mexican drivers pay their share?
El Paso will have an electronic tolling system, the same kind that has replaced tollbooths in other parts of the state. Vehicles sporting toll tags are charged as they speed past electronic readers. Those without a tag are sent a bill by mail. 
''What do you think is going to happen when we send those bills to Juárez?'' Mayor John Cook of El Paso asked at a transportation conference in Irving this month.
He predicted that the bills, which come from a tolling agency in another country, would be ignored.
''The tolls will only be for Texans, not for Mexicans,'' Mr. Cook said. ''It's going to be highly unpopular, and I don't think the revenue is going to be there for it.''
The Texas Department of Transportation is overseeing the expansion of a busy nine-mile stretch of Loop 375, also called the Border Highway, from four lanes to six lanes, two of which will be tolled. Rates have not been set but will vary by time of day to keep traffic on the toll lanes flowing, said Raymond Telles, the head of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority in El Paso.
Although critics of the plan have said that the region may be too poor to sustain toll lanes, Mr. Telles noted that local residents paid bridge fees at area border crossings.
''The idea we've never paid a toll in El Paso is not exactly correct,'' Mr. Telles said. ''We just know them as different names.''
More than 30,000 vehicles cross the bridges northbound from Mexico daily, according to the El Paso Regional Economic Development Corporation. Local officials worry that few Mexican drivers will feel compelled to pay the tolls.
Both Mr. Cook and State Representative Joe Pickett, Democrat of El Paso, said they feared the paying drivers would feel they were subsidizing Mexican drivers.
''If I had a Chihuahua license plate, I'd be using that toll road all the time,'' Mr. Pickett said.
Toll agencies in other parts of the state have charged scofflaws with escalating fines.
The North Texas Tollway Authority recently published the names of thousands of violators and will soon file civil suits against some of them, said Michael Rey, a spokesman for the authority, which is lobbying the Legislature for power to block vehicle registrations of those with delinquent tolls. Such a tool would not help with cars registered in Mexico, but the authority to impound scofflaws' vehicles would, Mr. Cook said.
The situation that some El Paso officials fear is already emerging in a border community more than 800 miles away. The first portion of State Highway 550 opened in Cameron County last year. When completed, the toll road will connect the Port of Brownsville to U.S. Highway 77.
Cars from Mexico on the road, minimal so far but expected to increase, are not being billed, said David Garcia, the assistant coordinator for the Cameron County Regional Mobility Authority. But some drivers want to do their part.
''We've had a few calls from Mexican drivers that are calling and asking where they can send payments,'' Mr. Garcia said.

HEADLINE: 'Too High To Fail'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his otherwise excellent review of Doug Fine's ''Too High to Fail: Cannabis and the New Green Economic Revolution'' (Aug. 5), Bill Maher doesn't mention the fact that a majority of people arrested for marijuana use represent minorities, particularly African-Americans. 
Thus it was surprising to learn of President Obama's dismissive answer to an ''online town hall'' question about whether legalizing marijuana might, from an economic point of view, do more good than harm (Up Front, Aug. 5). The disproportionate number of members of minority groups now behind bars because of marijuana use compels an interest in this question.
DAVID TULANIANLos Angeles
To the Editor:
As a retired police officer who spent decades trying to enforce marijuana prohibition, I agree with Bill Maher: our marijuana laws don't work, they cause great harm, they must be reformed.
I do not, however, share Maher's pessimism about the possibility of federal laws changing anytime soon. The absurdity of the federal government's costly war on marijuana has become increasingly transparent. Momentum to end that war is building.
A majority of voters in major national polls now say marijuana should be legal. Last year, for the first time, a bill was introduced in Congress to repeal federal marijuana prohibition laws. In November, citizens of Colorado, Oregon and Washington will vote on ballot initiatives to legalize and regulate marijuana. If one or more of these measures are enacted, even more members of Congress and other elected officials are likely to join the reform movement.
Assuming current trends continue, marijuana will be legal, as Maher says, during the lifetime of our youngest citizens. And many of their parents and grandparents will be around to see it.

 BODY:
ROCK THE CASBAH: Rage and Rebellion Across the Islamic World, by Robin Wright. (Simon & Schuster, $17.) Wright, a veteran foreign correspondent and the author of ''Dreams and Shadows: The Future of the Middle East'' (2008), examines the causes and repercussions of revolts against autocratic rule in countries like Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. Traveling across the region, she profiles poets, playwrights, feminists, TV imams and others working toward a ''counter-jihad'' to reclaim Islam from militants who crave perpetual holy war. 
A SMALL HOTEL, by Robert Olen Butler. (Grove Press, $14.) An acute portrayal of a contemporary marriage, Butler's novel takes place in New Orleans on the day when a Florida lawyer and his wife of two decades are to finalize their divorce. Flashbacks uncover layers of memory and pivotal moments in a relationship marred by miscommunication and insecurity.
HEMINGWAY'S BOAT: Everything He Loved in Life, and Lost, by Paul Hendrickson. (Vintage, $16.95.) Concentrating on Hemingway's later years, when life revolved around his beloved fishing boat, Hendrickson cuts through the boorishness, depression and alcoholism to show Hemingway's remarkable generosity and his lasting influence on the lives of old friends, naturalists, reporters and, most movingly, Gregory/Gloria, his tormented third child.
ED KING, by David Guterson. (Vintage Contemporaries, $15.95.) The Oedipus myth provides the framework for Guterson's satirical look at the corrosive effects of vanity, money and media mania. An orphaned child, adopted and named Edward Aaron King, grows up to become an Internet tycoon and an international celebrity (the ''King of Search''), but is hurtling toward a tragic fate.
GRAND PURSUIT: The Story of Economic Genius, by Sylvia Nasar. (Simon & Schuster, $18.) This sprawling survey, from the Victorian era to the end of the 20th century, is presented through the lives of people who helped turn economics into ''an instrument of mastery.'' Much as Nasar did in ''A Beautiful Mind,'' her 1998 biography of the mathematician John Nash, she gives us intimate portraits of her subjects, including Alfred Marshall, Beatrice Webb, Irving Fisher and John Maynard Keynes.
WHERE THINGS COME BACK, by John Corey Whaley. (Atheneum, $8.99; ages 14 and up.) Whaley's award-winning first novel tells the interlocking stories of Cullen Witter, an Arkansas teenager struggling to hold his family together after the disappearance of his brother, and Benton Sage, a disillusioned missionary in Africa.
THE UNCONQUERED: In Search of the Amazon's Last Uncontacted Tribes, by Scott Wallace. (Broadway, $16.) In 2002 Wallace, on assignment for National Geographic, joined an expedition into the Javari Valley Indigenous Reserve to gather information about a reputedly violent tribe known as the Arrow People. As this account shows, the greater dangers may have come from the malaria, poisonous reptiles and the expedition's megalomaniacal leader.
A WILD SURGE OF GUILTY PASSION, by Ron Hansen. (Scribner, $15.) A Jazz Age crime that also inspired James M. Cain and William Styron -- an irresistible woman and her hapless lover conspire to murder her husband -- is the basis for Hansen's propulsive novel.

Sex and God at YalePorn, Political Correctness, and a Good Education Gone Bad
By Nathan Harden301 pp. Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press. $25.99.
The conservative movement loves an innocent. Better yet if he has attended an Ivy League college and witnessed the debauchery of the elites firsthand. For this particular position, Nathan Harden, the author of ''Sex and God at Yale,'' possesses impeccable credentials. He was home-schooled, was already married when he got to college and had worshiped the institution so blindly that he was bound to be disappointed.
Like many home-schoolers, Harden is a true American eccentric. He quit before he finished high school, got a G.E.D. and spent his interim years drifting: loading cow manure for the gardening department at Walmart, working as a baggage handler for United and as a lounge singer in Florida, and volunteering with a medical relief charity. Somewhere in there he found his true love and, almost on a whim, married. Harden's accounts of his itinerant travels are in some ways the most entertaining parts of the book, although he takes pains to avoid seeming too world-weary so that when he arrives on campus he can be truly, deeply shocked. 
Harden had been twice rejected by Yale before being accepted, and he had the misfortune of coming to New Haven during the decade when students were cementing a new tradition known as Sex Week. For days leading up to this biennial extravaganza Harden receives e-mails advertising seminars like ''The Female Orgasm'' and ''Everything You've Always Wanted to Know About Sex (and Sex Toys!).'' When the big week arrives, he, along with hundreds of fellow students, attends lectures by porn stars and porn moguls and peddlers of every sex toy on the market (all eco-friendly, of course). Most of what he describes seems like fodder for satire, but Harden approaches it all with great seriousness, pausing often for helpful definitions: '' 'double anal penetrations' -- a dangerous and frequently harmful act during which two males penetrate the anus of the female simultaneously.''
Harden finds himself much in the same situation as Brad Majors at Dr. Frank N. Furter's convention in ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show''; that is, a choirboy type faced with a cast of characters he had not at this point in his squeaky-clean life imagined existed. He sits in on a lecture called ''Babeland's Lip Tricks,'' given by a burlesque performer named Darlinda, who leads the students in chanting unprintable words, and then demonstrates with great care and enthusiasm her whole foreplay array of lip, tongue and hand techniques. The fact that Yale lends its name and its classrooms to such a display is too much for Harden to stomach. He sits in the back where a couple of pervy professors are lurking, and watches his dreams die.
Every oral-sex seminar, ''every masturbation how-to session, every tip I heard on how to stimulate the anus -- each of these seemed to be mocking the greatest achievement of my life up to that point, which was that somehow I, a home-school dropout with a G.E.D., had clawed and scratched and fought my way into Yale,'' he writes. ''Yale had been like some kind of drug. It was a blast, and then I came down with a crash.''
Drinking the Ivy League poison is, of course, a great conservative tradition, a way for Young Turks to show they could be accepted into the elite even as they choose to set themselves apart. William Buckley began his career with ''God and Man at Yale,'' in which he accused the university of forcing secular liberalism down the students' throats. His son, Christopher Buckley, writes the introduction to Harden's book. More recently, the New York Times columnist Ross Douthat took on the other obvious target with ''Privilege: Harvard and the Education of the Ruling Class,'' in which he accused the students and faculty of being too career-obsessed and amoral for anything of worth actually to be learned.
Douthat's book contains plenty of complaints about the campus culture's casual approach to sex, but he also takes on a host of bigger questions: grade inflation, misplaced ambition, dull careerism, the humanities' crisis of confidence and the general irrelevance of the core curriculum. By narrowing himself to just the sex, Harden, by contrast, sets himself a higher burden of proof. Sex Week is after all only a matter of days. And though Yale, like any other campus, has plenty of students who engage in sex with no thoughts of romance or love or emotional connection, as Harden puts it, the university certainly can't compete with the rampant hookup scene one would find at, say, a big state university. As Douthat said in an interview when asked how big a role sex plays at Harvard: ''Less of a role than it does at a typical American college, I imagine, in part because the student body contains more than its fair share of dorky and socially awkward kids.''
Harden's other examples of an institution run amok (an acting class run by a yoga fascist, a Spanish language class in which the professor shows a film with a lesbian sex scene) are revealing but not revealing enough to make one feel that an obsession with sex has turned Yale into a ''great institution in decline -- an institution of tremendous power and influence that is no longer aware of why it exists or for what purpose,'' as Harden claims.
Harden certainly raises some fair points. As a parent, I don't really want to think about one of my children attending Darlinda's instructional sessions. And I have reservations about Yale's decision to host Steven Hirsch, the chief executive of the pornography enterprise Vivid Entertainment. On the other hand, Hirsch's presence gives the students, who have no doubt already logged dozens of hours watching online porn, a chance to think about what they are doing and how they feel about it. Harden reports that one young woman in the audience, for example, asked Hirsch what he would do if one of his own children wanted to appear in one of his films. An excellent question, and not one a college student would normally have the opportunity to inflict on Hirsch.
In arguing against pornography and the loose sexual culture, Harden is generally protective and patriarchal but in an idiom that resembles Andrea Dworkin's. The problem with the hookup culture is that it breeds sexual violence, he argues. ''Rape is rape. It's the hideous, hidden reality behind the hookup culture,'' he writes. The only problem is, Sex Week has always had the sound approval of campus feminist groups, with an exception or two where a film has proved a shade too violent. If Harden hopes that his book will reignite a debate about Sex Week, he's a little late. Last year, conservative students protested the prominence of pornography at Sex Week, and the administration threatened to ban the event (at the time, Yale was also being investigated for Title IX violations and for underreporting sexual harassment). Organizers have since submitted a proposal for a much tamer Sex Week that emphasizes sex education. Darlinda holds many things in her hands, but the fate of America's great institutions of learning is no longer one of them.

HEADLINE: Swing State

BYLINE: By JON MOOALLEM

 BODY:
The monkey appeared behind a Bennigan's. The Bennigan's was one in a row of free-standing, fast-casual joints in Clearwater, Fla., just outside Tampa, that also includes a Panda Express and a Chipotle. At one end, a Perkins Family Restaurant flies a preposterously large Stars and Stripes in its front yard, as if it were a federal building or an aircraft carrier.
Someone spotted the monkey poking through a Dumpster around lunchtime. When a freelance animal trapper named Vernon Yates arrived, all he could make out was an oblong ball of light brown fur, asleep in the crown of an oak. It was a male rhesus macaque -- a pink-faced, two-foot-tall species native to Asia. It weighed about 25 pounds. 
No pet macaques were reported missing around Tampa Bay -- there wasn't even anyone licensed to own one in the immediate area. Yates, who is called by the state wildlife agency to trap two or three monkeys a year, was struck by how ''streetwise'' this particular one seemed. Escaped pet monkeys tend to cower and stumble once they're out in the unfamiliar urban environment, racing into traffic or frying themselves in power lines. But as Yates loaded a tranquilizer dart into his rifle, this animal jolted awake, swung out of the canopy and hit the ground running. It made for the neighboring office park, where it catapulted across a roof and reappeared, sitting smugly in another tree, only to vanish again. Yates was left dumbstruck, balancing at the top of a ladder. (By then, a firetruck had been called in to assist him.) ''There's no way to describe how intelligent this thing is,'' he told me recently.
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (known as the F.W.C.) came to believe that the macaque wasn't a pet but had wandered out of a small population of free-roaming, wild macaques that live in a forest along the Silver River, 100 miles away. Soon, the F.W.C. was warning that wild macaques can carry the herpes B virus, which, though not easily transmitted to humans, can be fatal. A spokesman also told the press, ''They're infamous for throwing feces at things they don't like.''
As sightings stacked up in the following days, it became clear that the macaque was crossing the highway again and again, threading traffic like a running back. One afternoon, Yates and an F.W.C. investigator named James Manson managed to dart the animal in a church parking lot but lost track of it before the drug took effect. At one point, the two men were staring into tangled brush, stumped, when Manson tilted his head and saw the monkey perched with ninja-like stillness above him, close enough to touch. The two primates locked eyes. Then the monkey turned and was gone. ''And that's really when the story began,'' Manson told me.
It was the third week of January 2009. Now, more than three and a half years later, the macaque is still on the loose. After outmaneuvering the cops in Clearwater, the animal eventually showed up on the opposite side of Old Tampa Bay, somehow crossing the West Courtney Campbell Causeway, a low-lying bridge nearly 10 miles long. (The F.W.C. posits that it hid in the back of a covered truck.) That fall, it materialized in a low-income neighborhood in East Tampa, crouching in a tree. Guessing it was a raccoon, an F.W.C. lieutenant scaled a ladder and barked at it. The monkey urinated on him and disappeared.
By the following spring, a long string of sightings showed the macaque doubling back around the bay, overland, then boogieing down the Gulf Coast and into St. Petersburg, where it scrambled over the roof of a Baptist church during evening service. (''He came to worship,'' one witness told The Tampa Bay Times.) A woman watched it swing off a tree limb and flop into her swimming pool. On Coquina Key, one neighbor told me, homeowners would climb ladders to prune their trees before hurricane season and find spent citrus peels littering their roofs.
And on it went, with the monkey zigging and zagging around Tampa Bay, dodging the government agencies bent on capturing it. The state considers the animal a potential danger to humans and, like all invasive species, an illegitimate and maybe destructive part of Florida's ecology. But the public came to see the monkey as an outlaw, a rebel -- a nimble mascot for ''good, old-fashioned American freedom,'' as one local reporter put it. This week, tens of thousands of Republicans will pour into Tampa. There will be lots of national self-scrutiny and hand-wringing at the convention center downtown. But the most fundamental questions -- What exactly is government for? Where are the lines between liberty, tyranny and lawlessness? -- have been shaking the trees around Tampa for years.
Vernon Yates is 59, with a broad, serious face and white-threaded hair. He lives on the west side of Tampa Bay, in the suburb of Seminole. He came to open his front gate wearing camouflage crocs and khaki shorts, throwing on a Jack Hanna-style khaki shirt as he walked, but never going so far as to button it.
He'd been hosing down his bear cage when I rang. Yates has about 200 exotic animals at his house. Most are pets that the F.W.C. confiscated from owners who failed to comply with state regulations and then entrusted to Yates's one-man nonprofit, Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation. There were 17 tigers, some leopards, cougars, a pile of alligators in a concrete pool and a dusty battalion of large African spurred tortoises. Yates likes tortoises -- he also keeps a single Galápagos tortoise as a pet. ''I've been married five times,'' he told me. ''In one of my divorces, I lost $100,000 worth of tortoises.''
At his desk, Yates unfolded a map of Tampa Bay. But he found he had to flip the map over, then consult other maps, at different scales, to trace the macaque's entire odyssey. ''It's an amazing feat, when you think about his travels,'' he said. Since 2009, Yates estimates that he has gone after the animal on roughly 100 different occasions. The monkey was his white whale. He claimed to have darted it at least a dozen times, steadily upping the tranquilizer dosage, to no avail. The animal is too wily -- it retreats into the woods and sleeps off the drug. A few times, the monkey stared Yates right in the eye and pulled the dart out.
For the last two years, the macaque seems to have lingered in the same area of South St. Petersburg, ranging between a bulbous peninsula and the small island of Coquina Key, about two miles away. Yates still received calls about the animal -- one came in the previous week. But the trail went cold a long time ago. Sightings were seldom reported now. As a woman on Coquina Key named Rosalie Broten told me: ''Nobody wants the monkey to be captured. Everybody wants it to be free.''
The citizenry of Tampa Bay was adamantly pro-monkey. People had long been abetting the animal, leaving fruit plates on their patios. A few people, one F.W.C. officer told me, called the agency's monkey hot line to report that they'd seen the macaque several hours or even a couple of days earlier -- offering totally useless intelligence, in other words, presumably just to stick their thumbs in the government's eye. The Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay, as people called it, had very quickly become a celebrity. There were at least two styles of Mystery Monkey T-shirts on offer, and a catchphrase: Go, Monkey, Go. As the macaque passed through the town of Oldsmar, a self-storage facility threw the monkey's picture on a digital billboard with the message: ''Stay Free Mystery Monkey.'' And a Facebook page for the animal got 82,000 likes. ''The taxpaying citizens of Tampa have been driven bananas by the out-of-touch political establishment,'' the monkey wrote on its blog at the end of 2010, announcing its run for mayor.
At no point had the macaque threatened or hurt anyone. So it was easy for the public to see the authorities -- who, on at least a couple of occasions, surrounded the macaque with rifles and Tasers drawn, or hovered overhead in helicopters, beaming video surveillance to troops on the ground -- as bullying or wasteful. (''In this economy,'' one television reporter quipped, ''you have to wonder if it's time to stop monkeying around.'') Lt. Steve De Lacure of Florida Fish and Wildlife told me, ''The general public perceives that we're the Gestapo.'' He was adamant that his agency was not ''chasing'' the animal, and had deployed officers only a handful of times, when they felt they had a reasonable shot at capturing the macaque. He didn't even like it when I used the word ''pursue.''
I sympathized with the F.W.C. What they had to do was unpopular, but their sense of duty was unshakable. They were even prepared to shoot the animal dead if, in a given situation, tranquilization wasn't an option. And they knew they'd be vilified if it came to that. But they took a somewhat traditional view: the American people had a right to be protected by their government from wild monkeys. It was disorienting to watch the people of Tampa Bay champion the monkey's rights instead.
Vernon Yates was especially ridiculed. At the height of Mystery Monkey mania, he received death threats from pro-monkey radicals. He seems to have been caricatured as a small-town sheriff determined to kill the monkey or lock it up. This offended Yates. ''I don't hate the monkey!'' he told me. ''I don't hate the monkey at all!''
I took him at his word. He's not paid by the F.W.C. for the trapping he does but volunteers because, he explained, he doesn't trust law enforcement to handle exotic animals with the level of expertise and equipment he can offer. (Though his working relationship with the F.W.C. is stellar, Yates seemed to think very little of government in general. ''I love my country, but I hate my government,'' he told me. Among his many complaints was the attitude of the U.S.D.A. bureaucrats who inspect his menagerie. He filled me in on a protest he was planning. During the Republican convention, he'd take one of his tigers -- 3 of the 17 at his house are personal pets -- on his boat and just sit on the river in front of the convention center, with a sign condemning the U.S.D.A.)
Yates insisted that his only interest was the welfare of the macaque. He planned to surrender the Mystery Monkey to a pet owner who already kept a female macaque. The monkey would be put into captivity, but with its own kind. Yates, like the F.W.C., argued that this was the only compassionate resolution. (The F.W.C. maintained that a monkey this habituated to humans couldn't simply be put back in the wild.) It was also the safest. Out there, in the subdivided wilds of Tampa Bay, the monkey was in danger. It could eat rat poison. Or it could be accidentally provoked by someone feeding it and lash out, all but forcing the government to shoot it. Besides, macaques, like humans, are social creatures. They live in groups -- like the troop of macaques this one had come from, along the river in Central Florida. Researchers believe that the animals' mental and physical well-being can suffer if they're shorn from that community.
In other words, the monkey's lone-wolf, fugitive lifestyle, so inspiring to liberty-loving Floridians, might actually be a distressing exile. This idea got traction briefly around Labor Day 2010, when a retired newspaperman named Don McBride photographed the macaque among crags of metallic modern art in his neighbor's yard. The animal was staring into a mirrored cube, pressing its cheek against its own reflection.
''Everyone's shouting, 'It's gotta be free, it's gotta be free,' '' Yates told me. ''Well, go find the guy who's living on the street with his family and ask him how it feels to be free.'' Yates seemed to be arguing that sometimes we need a hand to reach down and nudge us, however forcefully, back into place. ''Sometimes, freedom isn't necessarily a good idea.''
This is not the first time that monkeys have incited a minor populist uprising in Florida. The population of wild rhesus macaques in the middle of the state -- the tribe from which, the theory goes, the Mystery Monkey strayed -- was established in the late 1930s by a New Yorker named Colonel Tooey. (Colonel was his first name.) Tooey ran boat tours on the picturesque Silver River, a premier tourist destination. A brazen showman, he wanted to ratchet the scenery up another notch. So he bought a half-dozen macaques and plopped them on a small island. Macaques are strong swimmers; Tooey had no idea. According to local lore, the animals were off the island within minutes.
By the mid-'70s, the population had expanded to about 80 macaques, living in two separate troops on either side of the river. They were fed constantly by tourists but were also encountered as many as 25 miles away. (''Reports of monkeys riding on the backs of wild pigs have not yet been confirmed,'' one university researcher wrote.) The troops continued to grow until, in 1984, a forerunner to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission started trapping the animals, citing herpes among other risks. Residents of the town of Silver Springs and neighboring Ocala were outraged. For years, a grass-roots opposition made all the noise it could. When the state compiled a report of monkey attacks and property damage -- one macaque was said to have bitten a 3-year-old in the neck -- activists hired a private investigator to debunk it.
In 1993, a state legislative committee held a hearing about exterminating the monkeys once and for all. Tish Hennessey, an Ocala schoolteacher and leader of the resistance, was hospitalized for a respiratory condition at the time, but nevertheless made it to the state capitol in Tallahassee, entering the hearing room attended by a nurse and oxygen tank. ''Hear the sound of our voices,'' Hennessey said. Then, with a thwunk, she dropped a petition to save the macaques on the chamber floor, signed by 25,000 citizens. The committee recommended that the killing be called off. ''I think the will of the people was heard,'' Hennessey told me.
In truth, though, the controversy was never resolved. The State of Florida still holds that the monkeys don't belong on the land around the river, but officials are no longer racing to clear them out. I went to Silver Springs hoping to trace the mystery of the Mystery Monkey to its roots -- to see, at the very least, how large the population of macaques has become, and how far its range has expanded. But all I found was more mystery. ''We don't really have good answers,'' an F.W.C. spokeswoman in Ocala told me. A retiree named Bob Gottschalk, who has a background in biology and, as a hobby, has been studying the monkeys from a kayak over the last three years, told me he believes there are no more than 100 monkeys on the Silver River today. But state officials also pointed me to an independent count done in 2010 that estimates there may be as many as five more troops living along 20 miles of the neighboring Ocklawaha River to the east.
''I think there's probably way more monkeys than anybody imagines,'' Capt. Tom O'Lenick told me one afternoon, as we drifted down the Silver River in his pontoon boat. Captain Tom is 63, a spindly, aging Popeye of a man with a bristly white beard, white captain's hat and jagged grin. He has led tours of the river 200 days a year for 29 years, hollering, ''Monkey! Monkey! Monkey!'' into the cypresses, to coax out the marquee attraction.
We couldn't find any macaques that afternoon. But Captain Tom filled the time with stories of his young adulthood as an antiwar activist, his stint as a roadie on tour with the Doors and his high hopes for and subsequent disillusionment with President Obama. (''It doesn't matter which clown you vote for,'' he said, ''you always get the same bozo.'') Mostly, we talked monkeys. He warned me against underestimating the macaques or overestimating the authorities' grasp on the macaques' whereabouts and behavior. The monkeys are opportunistic and adaptable animals, he said. It seemed inevitable that they would have steadily expanded their territory since the 1930s. Personally, he has spotted macaques as far as 40 miles away, on waterways that don't connect directly with the Silver River. Sometimes they turn up at his girlfriend's mobile-home park, ''just grazing and eating, minding their business,'' he said. ''It's not like they got an agenda.''
When I asked about the Tampa macaque, Captain Tom reiterated what both the F.W.C. and an anthropologist at Notre Dame who studies macaques, Agustín Fuentes, told me: in the wild, young macaques that challenge their troop leaders and lose are often forced out, left to wander in search of a new troop. The Mystery Monkey is presumed to be one of these disenfranchised males; it just kept wandering until it hit a city full of human primates instead.
It sounds like a freak thing. It may not be. As Gary Morse, a 34-year veteran of the F.W.C. told me, ''We're starting to see macaques show up in places we haven't seen them before.'' In May, another lone male macaque was spotted near a Sunoco station northeast of Orlando, 65 miles from Silver Springs. And last September, one appeared in St. Cloud, 80 miles away. It's possible that all three spilled out of these woods -- that they are the far-flung refugees of a population that might itself be more far-flung than anyone realizes.
Linda Wolfe, an East Carolina University anthropologist who studied the Silver River macaques in the '80s, disagrees. ''There's no such thing as rogue monkeys,'' she told me. ''The state wants to play it up so that they can say they're overrun with monkeys'' and start killing them again. But I had trouble gauging how much Wolfe's position was colored by old political resentments. Wolfe was part of the original pro-monkey protest movement and, 25 years later, was still angry about the government's tactics. (She described the law-enforcement division of the F.W.C. as ''essentially a paramilitary organization. They answer to no one.'')
Captain Tom, however, seemed to have it all mapped out in his head: the network of greenways that a macaque could travel undetected between here and Tampa. I asked if this scenario didn't sound a little improbable: a lone rambler ups and walks 100 miles to Tampa. Sure does, Captain Tom said. ''But I don't think it's one, lone monkey.'' Just maybe, he said, the Mystery Monkey that everyone is spotting is actually several different monkeys -- or one particularly audacious monkey acting as a sentinel for a group. ''I hate to say 'invasion,' '' Captain Tom told me, ''because it sounds so alarming. But I would say it's a natural expansion of the troops.''
That night, I stayed up late at a La Quinta inn in Ocala reading ''Planet of the Apes.'' I never knew the movies were based on a novel. (The author, the Frenchman Pierre Boulle, was a prisoner of war during World War II and also wrote ''The Bridge Over the River Kwai.'') In the book, a journalist accompanies an expedition to the planet Soror, where, everyone is horrified to discover, apes wear tailored suits and hold scientific symposia, while humans -- naked, mewling, incapable of language -- scurry through forests like terrified deer.
Eventually, a kind of oral history is unlocked, explaining how the animals came to power on the planet and the humans devolved into animals. People had trained the apes to be their slaves. Gradually, society's stress-free lifestyle sapped everyone of their curiosity and willpower. ''A cerebral laziness has taken hold of us,'' one man narrates; folks couldn't even be bothered to read cheap detective novels anymore.
The apes, meanwhile, never stopped learning. And slowly, individual animals began to stand up for themselves. One night, a gorilla butler decided to sleep in its master's bed. Soon circus orangutans were forcing their tamers to do the tricks. In every case, it was just easier for the humans to go along -- to surrender the bed and sleep on an armchair in the living room; to turn somersaults when the orangutans told them to. ''Most of us are adapting to this regime,'' one woman says. ''To give them their due, the apes treat us well and give us plenty to eat. . . . I'm not unhappy. I have no more worries or responsibilities.'' It hardly seemed alarming when the first chimpanzees used language. Eventually, humans withdrew to camps -- and from there, the wilderness.
Maybe it was because I'd listened to so much talk radio while driving around Tampa, because I'd absorbed all those biting, riled voices urging me, for example, to buy gold before the federal government started limiting A.T.M. withdrawals. But there at the La Quinta I experienced what can only be described as a waking nightmare. Reality and science fiction sloshed together. Some of us in America seemed to be sliding into the same disillusioned lethargy that undid humanity in the novel, while others of us were doing the exact opposite: vigilantly looking for the worst in our government, and in one another, to keep from being conned out of even the thinnest sliver of our freedom.
It occurred to me that the two mind-sets -- apathy and paranoia -- probably yield the same result. You wind up off to the side of real democracy, disengaged from the strenuous project of brokering a better society.
''What is happening could have been foreseen,'' one witness claims on the planet Soror. But the thing is, no one saw it.
I saw the Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay my last morning in town.
In February, a retired man in South St. Petersburg e-mailed Emily Nipps, a reporter at The Tampa Bay Times. The macaque had been out of the news, and the man wanted the public to know that it was alive and well. For more than six months, the animal had been hanging out on his patio and swinging through the surrounding woods. He and his wife were feeding the monkey; they'd become close.
The couple asked Nipps to write a story, on the condition that she wouldn't print their names or the location of their house. What Nipps described was essentially the scenario that the F.W.C. was afraid of -- the wild animal losing its wariness of people, endangered by kindness. Vernon Yates told me, ''What they're doing is signing the monkey's death warrant.''
I managed to get a message to the couple. The husband asked me to call him ''Clas,'' a fragment of his e-mail address. Eventually, he invited me to visit.
Clas came ambling out of the house in socks and sandals to prep me when I pulled in the driveway. ''Monk'' was out on the patio right now, he whispered. The animal usually flees from strangers, so Clas advised me not to look directly at it -- that's a threat -- and to just check it out in my peripheral vision while we pretended to have a conversation.
We walked onto the screened-in porch. Immediately, I saw the monkey pause to size me up, then scoop a pile of peanuts off the patio and hop away as fast as it could. I'd totally blown the peripheral-vision thing. Clas gave a shrug. Then he introduced me to his wife -- I'll call her Mrs. Clas -- and we sat down to talk.
They'd heard about the monkey on the news, they said, but were still shocked one morning when they suddenly saw a macaque skitter up a post and vanish onto their roof. Mrs. Clas set out a banana and rushed inside to watch. The monkey hesitantly descended, sat on their woodpile and ate the banana. That was a year ago. ''He's been here ever since,'' Clas said.
The morning banana became a routine. Sometimes grapes. Once in a while, Mrs. Clas left the monkey Oreos that he would twist apart and lick the frosting out of like a child. After a while, the monkey packed on 10 pounds. He looked husky; Clas took to calling him Banana Butt. So they dialed back the feeding, mostly leaving the monkey to forage for itself in the woods. ''And he toned down!'' Clas said. ''I think he looks great.''
Clas was spreading snapshots across the table -- scenes from their life together. The monkey watched them play gin rummy from the patio and thundered over the roof to the kitchen window to watch Mrs. Clas make dinner. It followed them, Clas explained. ''It's pretty incredible. You're sitting on the crapper, and a monkey swings by.''
Eventually, Clas's mother -- I'll call her Mama Clas -- joined us on the porch. She is 106 years old, a wobbly but astoundingly together woman for her age. ''Is Monk here?'' she asked casually, having lowered herself into a chair without first turning to check the patio. Mama Clas recently came to live with her son. Every morning, she walks down the long driveway with her walker to collect the newspaper. And by now, the monkey escorts her, staying 20 feet ahead or behind, keeping watch. ''Like a guard,'' Clas said, showing me a photo and laughing. ''Honest to God, like a guard.''
Otherwise, though, the family made an effort to keep their distance. They were principled enough not to turn the animal into a pet. ''We really don't want to be friends with him too much,'' Clas said. ''We like our critters wild out here.'' Living alongside a monkey clearly had its inconveniences. The macaque throws the wire screens off their rain barrels when it needs a drink. It eats the honeybell oranges off their favorite tree. And though they wouldn't elaborate, I wondered if they'd glimpsed a temperamental side of the animal from time to time too. ''Everybody has good days and bad days,'' was all Clas kept saying. ''But it doesn't carry over. It's just forgotten.''
I'd listened to more talk radio on the way over. Florida's governor, Rick Scott, had denied the mayor of Tampa's request to temporarily ban firearms around the Convention Center during the week of the Republican convention for the sake of public safety -- ''We have the Second Amendment for a reason, and that's to make sure that we can always defend our freedom,'' Scott said -- and, in New Mexico, a court ruled that a Christian photographer's refusal to take a job photographing a lesbian couple's commitment ceremony violated the couple's civil rights, even though the photographer said that shooting the ceremony would have gone against her religious convictions. Everywhere, it seemed, everyone's inalienable rights were grinding against everyone else's, and against the government, with all those opposing ideals refusing to settle into a sloppier, if relatively fair, society. Against that backdrop, what was happening at the Clas house was so radical that it took a moment to recognize it. It was a compromise.
Granted, it was a tense and untidy compromise -- more of a détente. The monkey hadn't really found a new troop -- it wasn't even allowed in the house -- and for all I knew, it would freak out the next morning and knock over Mama Clas as she reached for her Tampa Bay Times. But for the time being, strange neighbors were making a go of it, getting along.
Maybe there's some muddled metaphor for America in that. Or maybe it's only tempting to look for one because there's such hunger for a hint of the way forward. Maybe it's not a metaphor. Maybe we're on our own. Maybe it's just a macaque.

HEADLINE: Sleepwalk to Work

BYLINE: By CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS

 BODY:
IT took a while for Athanasios Biros to solve the mystery of his noisy upstairs neighbor. Mr. Biros, 35, who works for a bank, at first suspected a bartender with odd working hours lived above his studio in Greenwich Village. Then he heard a pounding noise at 7 in the morning. ''I just snapped,'' he said. He knocked on the door, and met his neighbors, an Eastern European family with a child. The mother promised to stop the child from crisscrossing the paper-thin floors.
Problem solved, until one weekend when revelers partied overhead from 2 to 5 a.m. ''I was seething in my bed,'' Mr. Biros said. He wondered what had happened to the nice family.
Mr. Biros starting knocking on his upstairs neighbors' door whenever commotion started, sometimes twice a week. After he met a Hispanic mother, a British family and a French-speaking pair, and also saw a cleaning lady, it dawned on him that the person above him was actually a one-room hotel. One woman told Mr. Biros she had rented the place from an agent for four days. 
''I didn't sign this lease to be living under a hotel,'' Mr. Biros said. But even after he wrote and called the landlord and management company, nothing changed. Mr. Biros broke his lease in May and moved to the Upper East Side.
''It bothered me twice as much because of the nuisance, and then the total disregard from the landlord,'' he said.
In New York -- where space is expensive and many residents have an entrepreneurial streak -- the odds are pretty good that people will find themselves living close to someone who has turned part of a home into a work space for some kind of business. Such proximity can mean noise, shipping boxes, foot traffic or even the rotating cast of characters Mr. Biros encountered.
Home businesses also can run afoul of zoning rules and inspectors. For example, renting out an apartment as if it were a hotel room is ''perfectly illegal,'' said Michael Parley, a zoning consultant for residential developers, noting there are clear rules against it. ''That's it, flat out, end of discussion.''
Yet, this being New York, a lot of people get away with things they shouldn't, perhaps because they observe the wisdom of the don't-annoy-the-neighbors rule, or because they have lucked into landlords or neighbors who embrace their business ventures.
Before opening a children's used-clothing shop called Monk's Trunk in her 3,000-square-foot brownstone in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, Carrie McLaren researched commercial sites on Flatbush Avenue. But she worried that an 800-square-foot storefront couldn't house enough apparel to cover the $3,000 monthly rent. Profits are slim in consignment, so selling and displaying a lot of inventory are key.
''Consignment shops do better where real estate is cheaper,'' Ms. McLaren said.
So she decided to set up shop on her parlor floor. But first she asked the opinion of her longtime basement renters (who were, as luck would have it, newish parents).
''They were like: 'Yeah, a children's consignment shop. We can just walk upstairs when we need anything,' '' Ms. McLaren recalled.
Her shop usually closes before 6 p.m. Subway use is encouraged so that the street where she lives isn't overtaken with shoppers' cars. Two years in, ''people on the block shop here,'' she said, and ''we don't have a big, gaudy sign.''
Tommy Semosh, who has rented an 800-square-foot two-bedroom in Washington Heights for a decade, even managed to win over his landlord. Since 2011, his long, narrow kitchen with ample counter space has been the headquarters of Sweet Semosh, his vegan cookie business. Every night after his 9-to-5 publishing job, Mr. Semosh, 36, bakes an average of six dozen jam thumbprints and chocolate-chip cookies. A one-man enterprise, he also packages them and delivers them by subway to stores like the Westerly Natural Market in Midtown or the Uptown Veg and Juice Bar in Harlem.
The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets inspected Mr. Semosh's kitchen; his labels and ingredients were also vetted so that he could become a ''home processor.'' The exemption allows him to sell certain baked goods (not, say, cream puffs, which need refrigeration) in certain markets but not online or out of his apartment.
His landlord, Victor Gorodischer, hasn't had any tenant complaints, and is supportive. Indeed, he once hurried to fix a broken refrigerator to avoid a production hiccup. And when Mr. Gorodischer saw the five-quart standing mixer sent by Mr. Semosh's mother, he exclaimed, ''You can bake even more cookies!''
Because so many home businesses operate under the radar, it is hard to say just how many there are. Complaints to the city's 311 telephone system about illegal commercial use in a residential area have been decreasing. In 2011, the tally was roughly 2,150, down from about 2,450 in 2008. Even so, the data may not accurately reflect the full range of complaints about businesses, because annoyed tenants who call 311 to carp about ungodly noise may not know about zoning rules.
By any measure, microbusinesses are the lifeblood of the New York economy.
In 2008, the latest figures available, 65.2 percent of the businesses in New York City had fewer than five workers, up from 63.9 percent in 2000, according to the Center for an Urban Future. During that period, no other group of businesses, measured by size of firm, increased their overall share of city businesses.
''New York has long been a town of small businesses,'' said Jonathan Bowles, the executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, a public policy research group. ''But, incredibly, it's becoming a city of very small businesses. Many people think of New York City as a place for large corporations. But in fact what's been driving economic growth in the city for much of the past decade are very tiny businesses, those with fewer than five employees.''
Pricey rents for commercial space often drive entrepreneurs to start homegrown businesses. But residences can't be incubators for every conceivable venture. Not surprisingly, kennels and veterinary practices aren't allowed to operate from homes. Zoning rules also prohibit a curious mix of other businesses, including advertising and public relations. Stock brokerages and offices for real estate, insurance and interior design aren't supposed to operate from a desk in the bedroom. Running a commercial kitchen at home isn't permitted, either -- ''home processors'' like Mr. Semosh cannot use commercial-size equipment.
Many entrepreneurs feel they have no alternative but to start businesses out of their homes. When Anne Kilcullen, a floral designer, started Blade in 2007, she worked from her one-bedroom apartment on East 64th Street. Back then, renting work space in flower markets for a day to make arrangements for gifts or small luncheons ''just didn't make sense,'' she explained.
Nor could she afford a Manhattan storefront. After two years, she started splitting rent on studio space at the flower market on West 28th Street. With enough clients, ''it felt right, and it was going to improve my business.''
Amy Anderson, a planner at the Pratt Center for Community Development, said that was a familiar pattern. ''Starting a business represents an enormous commitment,'' she said. ''By being in your home, you can experiment without some of the financial ramifications, as opposed to renting a space.''
She is not surprised by the number of businesses that operate without knowing whether they are violating zoning rules. Odds are, ''you are not going to have Big Brother knocking on your door,'' she said, but added, ''It's a scary piece to rest your hat on.''
The Department of Buildings responds to all complaints about illegal home businesses and takes the appropriate action, Tony Sclafani, a spokesman, wrote in an e-mail. ''Individuals found to be operating illegal home businesses can be subject to violations, as well as additional enforcement measures,'' he said.
Even if entrepreneurs manage to keep peace with the neighbors, they may not win over spouses and significant others. When Lauren Levy, a founder of Magnificent Baby, started out, she did not devote much thought to fitting inventory into company headquarters, a.k.a. her home.
Then 29 huge boxes arrived. The fifth-floor apartment on West End Avenue that she shared with her new husband became a de facto warehouse. Onesies obscured the view of the television -- for seven months. Her husband, who would eventually kick the business out of their home, was unhappy. But in retrospect, Ms. Levy, who previously worked as a commercial real estate banker, still thinks renting a warehouse early on would have been out of the question financially. (Cue marital spat.)
To mollify neighbors, she recruited their newborns to be fit models and paid them with free clothes. Some grew accustomed to the convenience of shopping for shower gifts in their pajamas.
Ms. Levy worried that piles of mail and shipping boxes would become annoying to the managers of her apartment building. ''We tried to stay on the down-low with what we were doing,'' she said, ''because to be honest, we didn't look into the rules of operating an office out of the apartment.''
One close call came when FedEx didn't pick up packages one afternoon, and Ms. Levy had to haul them back upstairs via elevator before her neighbors returned home from work. Another came when she dropped a huge box in the lobby. The loud noise got the superintendent's attention and he asked if the marble floor had been damaged. (It hadn't.)
Magnificent Baby now rents a Midtown office for $2,500 a month.
Some entrepreneurs, rather than viewing their homes as temporary launching pads, hope to keep their businesses there. ''Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, their goal was to get out of that garage into a fancy suite,'' said Sara Horowitz, the executive director of Freelancers Union, whose members include home-based independent workers. ''But what's interesting now about many people starting and working in their home is that's how they want to work.''
In the winter months, Dièry Prudent, a personal trainer, puts clients through their paces on the top floor of his 3,850-square-foot brownstone on Prospect Place in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. In the summer, they exercise in his serene garden. No more renting space in Manhattan, or commuting at sunrise.
''It's local,'' he said. ''It's in the neighborhood. It's training someone you know you've seen before. It's investing in the health of a community.''
His clients include the writers Philip Gourevitch and Alex Prud'homme (who held a book party in Mr. Prudent's backyard), and Lee Warshavsky, the general counsel for the Settlement Housing Fund, a nonprofit that supports affordable housing.
Mr. Warshavsky, who lives two doors away, favors home businesses, though he said, ''It all depends on what one is doing.''

HEADLINE: 36 Hours: Montpelier, Vt.

BYLINE: By SARA BECK

 BODY:
TUCKED away in a tangle of wilderness and clinging to the edges of the Winooski and North Branch Rivers, Montpelier, Vt., with a population of about 8,000, is one of the smallest state capitals in the country, but it is also among the most forward-thinking. It's the capital of the first state to formally abolish slavery in 1777, and the first to allow civil unions for gay couples.
The residents of this New England town in the foothills of the Green Mountains include students (at the Vermont College of Fine Arts), movie buffs (each March it hosts the Green Mountain Film Festival), foodies (the New England Culinary Institute is based here, after all), artists and outdoors enthusiasts. They also include, for part of the year, the legislators who supported, with their votes and their forks, Vermont's 2009 Farm-to-Plate Initiative, underscoring the state's commitment to a strong sustainable agricultural economy. Whether you're in search of a meal at one of the many new farm-to-table restaurants, an art house movie or live music, you'll find it all in this little capital city.

It's not difficult to orient yourself in a city where the downtown is roughly five blocks. Stop by the Capitol Region Visitors Center (134 State Street; 802-828-5981; bgs.vermont.gov/information_centers/capitol) for a map and directions to the 185-acre Hubbard Park with its seven miles or so of hiking trails. The quad-burning walk necessitates a lovely pause on the Cliff Street overlook where you can see the town's church spires pierce the sky, and Federalist and Colonial Revival buildings hover over the water, impervious to past floods, including the 10-foot rise from Hurricane Irene. Then climb the 54-foot observation tower where you can see Camel's Hump, one of Vermont's tallest mountains.
6:30 p.m.2. BATTER UP!
Skiing is not Vermont's only sport. Less than two miles north on Elm Street is Montpelier Recreation Field, built in 1941 and home to the Vermont Mountaineers collegiate level baseball team (tickets, $6). With sun-drenched foothills as the field's backdrop, you won't find a bad view of the game, or of the mascot, Skip the Woodchuck. Try the fried dough with maple syrup ($3) and don't feel guilty when you see your fellow fans eating their own garden-fresh carrots and sugar snap peas.
8:30 p.m.3. AS LOCAL AS IT GETS
At Salt (207 Barre Street; 802-229-6678; saltcafevt.com), the owner, Suzanne Podhaizer, a former food writer, has created a no-frills 20-seat cafe, with many herbs and vegetables picked from her backyard garden. One summer menu included smoked, braised jerk goat over rice pilaf with mint gastrique ($24), oyster and hen-of-the-wood mushroom ragout over a trio of polenta cakes ($19) and a homemade honey ice cream dusted with almonds and drizzled with mulled wine ($6).
10:30 p.m.4. SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
You won't find much in the way of late-night business in Montpelier unless you count a clear, star-studded night sky. A few spots cater to those in need of a nightcap and a song. The Black Door (44 Main Street; 802-225-6479; blackdoorvermont.com) is a bar and bistro on two floors of a brownstone with low lighting and red velvet drapes. Here singers croon old-time ballads, jazz standards or country tunes. If classy and country don't mix for you, pop into Charlie-O's a few doors down, Montpelier's dive-bar classic. You'll stand out if you're not drinking the $2 Pabst Blue Ribbons, playing pool or bobbing your head to one of the area bands (70 Main Street; 802-223-6820).
Saturday
9:30 a.m.5. DOWNTOWN GRAZING
Vermont's state seal includes two sheaves of grain and a cow; you can appreciate this agricultural zeal at the Capital City Farmers Market (corner of State and Elm Streets; 802-223-2958; montpelierfarmersmarket.com). Each week, more than 50 vendors showcase an array of products, from raw goat milk to hand-dyed wool hats. Pick up a slice of the bacon, egg and cheese breakfast pizza at WoodBelly Pizza ($4) and wash it down with Artesano blueberry mead ($22). Or go to Bagitos (28 Main Street; 802-229-9212; bagitos.com) for house-made bagels and Vermont Coffee Company brew while fiddlers spin songs during their weekly Irish Sessions.
11 a.m.6. HISTORY CLASS
On the free half-hour tours of the State House, a Greek and Renaissance Revival building completed in 1859, you will learn about the fireproof Lake Champlain black marble, study Civil War art, sit at the desks of legislators and admire the gaselier (electrified gaslight chandelier) that weighs ''as much as a Volkswagen bus'' (115 State Street; 802-828-2228; vtstatehouse.org). Afterward, head to the Vermont Historical Society Museum (109 State Street; 802-828-2291; vermonthistory.org), where the permanent collection invites you to walk through an Abenaki wigwam ($5 admission).
12:30 p.m.7. PLUNGE INTO NATURE
Vermonters take their swimming holes seriously. At Bear Pond Books (77 Main Street; 802-229-0774; bearpondbooks.com), glance through a copy of ''Take the Plunge,'' by David Hajdasz, and find directions to the region's wildest waters. For a tamer spot and a warmer swim, grab a lunch to go at the Mad Taco (72 Main Street; 802-225-6038; themadtaco.com) and head five miles north to Wrightsville Beach Recreation Area (369 Route 12; 802-272-0779; wrightsvillebeachvt.com), where the North Branch of the Winooski has been dammed into a meandering lake with a tiny beachfront, a boat launch and a picnic area ($2.50). Stop at North Branch Nature Center (713 Elm Street; 802-229-6206; northbranchnaturecenter.org) on your way back and go bird-watching in 28 acres of waist-high grasses and wild raspberries.
2:30 p.m.8. BROWSE THROUGH TOWN
Brighten up the afternoon with a coffee milkshake from the Coffee Corner diner (83 Main Street; 802-229-9060; coffeecorner.com), where politicians have been lunching with their constituents for 53 years, or head to the Three Penny Taproom (108 Main Street; 802-223-8277; threepennytaproom.com), with 24 tap lines primed with craft beer. It won't take long to wander through the cute stores on Montpelier's shopping streets. The Getup Vintage (27 Langdon Street; 802-279-5942) sells strappy retro heels and beaded dresses from the '20s, and shares space with Buch Spieler record shop (802-229-0449; bsmusic.com), where you can try out the 1896 pump organ and buy a copy of the first album by the Fugs. Around the corner, Rivendell Books (100 Main Street; 802-223-3928; rivendellbooksvt.com) may be the only used bookstore where you can read about Russian desert tortoises while admiring a real one named Veruca.
7:30 p.m.9. PROMENADE YOUR PARTNER
The State House lawn turns into a sprawling front porch just before the sun goes down. Promenade along the sidewalk or hang out on the steps to watch a competitive game of pickup Ultimate Frisbee. Then join the locals at the Capital City Grange (6612 Route 12; 802-229-9425; capitalcitygrange.org) for a Contra Dance. Whirl down the line from partner to partner or sit on the sidelines and enjoy the local color -- friendly grandmothers dancing with skirt-wearing gentlemen, and longhaired beauties with bearded farmers ($8).
9:30 p.m.10. GOOD SLOW FOOD
Dash over to Kismet (52 State Street; 802-223-8646; kismetkitchens.com) before the kitchen closes and order one of seven types of burgers including a vegan club with tempeh ($14). The farmhouse-chic atmosphere makes it easy to snuggle into the leather couch, study a stack of slow-food manifestoes and enjoy a Honey Flower cocktail (Green Mountain chamomile-infused vodka laced with St. Germain, $9).
Sunday
10 a.m.11. MAPLE SYRUP
Eight generations of Morse men at the Morse Farm Maple Sugarworks (1168 County Road; 800-242-2740; morsefarm.com) have specialized in bringing syrup to your pancakes, and Burr -- sugaring expert, newspaper columnist, woodcarver and musician -- is usually around to show off the equipment and tell stories. Walking paths take you past Otis, the performing goat and a scale replica of the State House. Don't leave without trying the creemee, a cone heaped high with maple-infused ice cream and topped with maple crystals ($2).
IF YOU GO
The 19-room Inn at Montpelier (147 Main Street; 802-223-2727; innatmontpelier.com) was built in the early 1800s as two separate residences before opening as an inn in 1988. The rooms are spacious, and on the wrap-around porch you can sip coffee, eat New England Culinary Institute pastries and read the newspaper. Rates from $165 to $250.
Across from the State House, Capitol Plaza Hotel and Conference Center (100 State Street; 802-223-5252; capitolplaza.com) has 62 comfortable rooms, a steakhouse and a fitness center; from $133 to $282.

HEADLINE: A Patent War in Your Pocket

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The smartphone in your hand is a marvel of innovation, packing sophisticated computing and communications technologies into a sleek digital device.
It is also a litigation magnet.
In the last few years, the companies in the smartphone industry have spent billions of dollars buying patents and hundreds of millions suing one another. On Friday, that battle reached a peak with the decision by a federal jury in San Jose, Calif., to award Apple $1.05 billion in damages from Samsung for infringing on just six patents.
The case underscores how dysfunctional the patent system has become. Patent litigation has followed every industrial innovation, whether it is steam engines, cars, phones or semiconductors, but the smartphone wars are bigger, global and unusually complex. 
And it is the courts, rather than the patent office, that are being used to push companies toward a truce. In the end, consumers may be the losers.
''It is hard not to see all the patent-buying and patent lawsuits as a distortion of the role of patents,'' said Josh Lerner, an economist and patent expert at Harvard Business School. ''They are supposed to be an incentive for innovation.''
By one estimate, as many as 250,000 patents can be used to claim ownership of some technical or design element in a smartphone. Each patent is potentially a license to sue.
Samsung says it will challenge the jury's decision, which covered design basics like the shape of the iPhone itself and its array of small on-screen icons. So the courtroom conflict could continue for years, and even then, the case is but one of dozens of suits and countersuits in 10 countries between Apple and Samsung, the world's two leading smartphone makers.
But Apple has more than Samsung in its sights in its litigation campaign against the Korean electronics giant. Samsung is the leader among companies using Google's Android mobile operating system. So while Apple may be suing Samsung in courtrooms from Germany to Australia, the real enemy is up the road from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., at the Googleplex in Mountain View.
Ultimately, the Apple-Samsung roadshow is just the main attraction in the global smartphone patent wars. The roster of litigants includes Microsoft, Nokia, HTC, Google's Motorola Mobility subsidiary and others.
In a recent case between Apple and Motorola, Judge Richard A. Posner, a prominent federal appeals court judge in Chicago, said in court that the use of patents in the smartphone industry showed a system in ''chaos.'' In June, Judge Posner dismissed the case, chastising both sides. He heaped scorn on Apple's broad claims for its user-experience patents and on Motorola's claim that Apple should pay a rich royalty on its basic communications patents. Both companies have appealed.
The disputes are fueled, legal experts say, by companies rushing to apply for patents as both defensive and offensive weapons, and by overburdened government examiners granting patents too easily.
''The smartphone patent battles are enabled by lots of trivial patents that never should have been granted in the first place,'' said James E. Bessen, a patent expert and lecturer at the Boston University School of Law. ''That's where Judge Posner was coming from in his ruling.''
To the winners of the patent wars, the rewards will be rich. Mobile computing, or smartphones and tablets, is the most lucrative and fastest-growing market in business. It has made Apple the most valuable company in the world. As Samsung passed Apple in the last year to become the largest smartphone maker, its profits surged along with its sales.
Despite the hostilities, experts say the smartphone patent wars will eventually end in an industrial armistice.
The California court decision, if it holds up on appeal, could have that effect. ''This ruling sends a message to all the handset makers that you have to make truly differentiated products that look different,'' said Colleen V. Chien, an assistant professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law. ''And that's the message Apple wanted to send with its litigation.''
Most legal experts thought Apple would have the most trouble winning infringement judgments on its design patents, which are generally considered weaker than engineering patents for hardware or software, known as utility patents.
But the jury found that Samsung infringed on three of the four design patents in the case. The fourth was a patent for shape of a tablet computer -- a rectangle with rounded corners.
''This could open up a whole new front in the patent wars, as companies race to file applications for design patents,'' said Kevin G. Rivette, a Silicon Valley consultant and former vice president of intellectual property strategy for I.B.M.
Yet Mr. Rivette is convinced that the smartphone patent wars will subside and an accommodation will be reached. The sheer number of smartphone patents and the speed of innovation in product development undermine the power of the patents. That is very different than the role patents play in an industry like pharmaceuticals, where a blockbuster drug may be covered by a single patent or a few. In chemistry, the molecule is the patentable idea.
Smartphones are very different. An infringement ruling can slow a rival down for a few months, but not block it. Samsung engineers, for example, have already devised an alternative to one of the patents found to have been infringed upon in the California decision -- the ''bounce'' feature. Pull a finger from the top of the iPhone's touch screen to the bottom and the page bounces. On the newest Samsung smartphones, the same downward finger stroke brings a blue glow at the bottom on the touch screen, not a bounce.
''In this industry, patents are not a clean weapon to stop others,'' Mr. Rivette said. ''The technology, like water, will find its way around impediments.''

HEADLINE: Blunting Ideology With Biography

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Unless you've subjected yourself to an Internet blackout to better commune with the natural pleasures of summer, chances are you've heard something about Mindy Meyer, the 22-year-old New York State Senate contestant, who, when asked about Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in an interview, said she was ''not familiar with him in particular, like his issues, and you know, everything about him.'' A Brooklynite who would appear to find her intellectual stimulation in caricatures of celebrity vapidity, she has sought the endorsement of Kim Kardashian.
Political savants don't take Ms. Meyer's campaign terribly seriously. But even if you've been keeping abreast of things, it is possible that you have heard less about Wendy E. Long, a very real candidate for the United States Senate, who is opposing the Democratic incumbent Kirsten E. Gillibrand as a Republican here in New York. While the disparity in attention invites one to decry the bleak state of our civic engagement, to groan on about misplaced priorities and ''The Real Housewives of New Jersey,'' the August heat has defeated my instincts to moralize. 
Ms. Long, a Manhattan lawyer, is almost assured to lose. But her prospects shouldn't in any way suggest that she is a dull blade. ''I had a dream to become a mounted policewoman,'' she told me when we met near her apartment in Carnegie Hill last week. Before making her Senate bid, Ms. Long had heard that the New York City Parks Enforcement Mounted Auxiliary Unit was taking recruits and she entered the training program. Her summer vacations do not seem to be spent in mindless beach colonies. This year she took her children to Krakow, Auschwitz and Berlin.
New York has followed the lead of the rest of the country, as the most right-leaning Republican candidates have gained the most traction within the party in recent years.
A former litigator at Kirkland & Ellis who served as a Supreme Court clerk to Clarence Thomas, Ms. Long secured the Republican nomination in the absence of any real political experience or decidedly meaningful competition. The field was narrow, as it was in 2006 when Republicans produced the almost insultingly deadening presence of John Spencer, once the mayor of Yonkers, to run against Hillary Rodham Clinton in November.
With the Conservative Party endorsement increasingly significant to success in New York Republican politics, Ms. Long was able to vanquish her chief rival in the primary: Representative Bob Turner of Queens, who gained national attention last year when he won the Ninth District House seat vacated by Anthony D. Weiner, becoming the first Republican to represent the area in 91 years.
Mr. Turner's unlikely victory was regarded by Republicans as a reflection of wider dissatisfaction with the current presidential administration. Ms. Long's ascension suggests a continuing interest among conservatives in cultivating candidates whose youth, or fitness levels, or musical tastes, or in the instance of Ms. Long, urbane femininity, might blunt the impact of unpalatable social ideologies. (One wonders if, going forward, the Republican Party will be increasingly wary of candidates who look too much as though they believe what Todd Akin thinks.)
A Catholic, Ms. Long describes herself as ''100 percent pro-life.'' She doesn't make exceptions for rape or incest, she told me. A Dartmouth-educated mother who left legal practice several years ago to stay home with the children she had later in life, Ms. Long is at once an immediately recognizable type and infinitely beyond classification, at least by the measures applied in New York. Her son, 12, is a student at St. Bernard's, the private boys' school; her daughter, 9, attends Sacred Heart. And when the holidays arrive, Ms. Long apparently does not easily succumb to the cliché of thumbing through the F. A. O. Schwarz catalog.
''My son was 8 or 9 and he really wanted a gun,'' she told me. ''It was Christmas and I said to my husband, 'It's time for a gun.' '' Ms. Long had grown up in New Hampshire; her husband, Arthur, a partner at Davis, Polk & Wardwell, spent his childhood in Greenwich Village and was baffled by the notion but acquiesced. As a result, the boy owns a rifle, which resides at a shooting range in Rockland County. Ms. Long has achieved the highest grade the National Rifle Association offers to politicians without voting records on Second Amendment issues.
She said she had difficulty fund-raising here, particularly among wealthy Manhattanites for whom anti-abortion, pro-gun positions are hardly catnip. She also opposes same-sex marriage. Of her life in the city, she said her opinions had occasionally left her feeling like ''an orphan.''
To the rest of her platform, attach the party line positions: Ms. Long opposes Dodd-Frank legislation and favors tax breaks. Her job-growth strategy turns vaguely on reduced government intervention. She has emphasized the importance of economics in the election, playing down the significance of social issues.
The other day, she chided Mr. Akin on her Facebook page, taking him to task less for his invidious remarks on ''legitimate rape'' than for distracting struggling Americans ''from a serious discussion on jobs and the economy.''
Yet Ms. Long has herself been unable to keep away from the flames women's issues ignite. Last month, she went to the trouble of issuing a news release calling on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to reverse what she described as his ''nandate'' -- ''nanny state'' conjoined with ''mandate'' -- to encourage breast feeding in city hospitals by asking them to limit access to infant formula. When I asked her about the mayor's tenure generally, she quickly returned to the subject.
Ms. Long was a bottle feeder, she told me. ''I'm a big believer that this is totally up to the woman,'' she said. ''This is an intimate time in a woman's life. Just leave us alone.'' Choice, in other words, is the right to Similac.

HEADLINE: Romney's First 100 Days

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It is the morning of Wednesday, Nov. 7, and after a long night of celebrating and a short night of sleep, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan wake up to confront the question awaiting every new administration: Of the campaign's many promises, which few will become the real priorities?
If they win the White House, Republicans are also more likely than not to hold on to the House of Representatives and win a narrow majority in the Senate. The party could then embark on the kind of aggressive legislative push that President Obama and the Democrats did in 2009.
Only four years after Democrats seemed on the verge of historic policy gains, Republicans could reverse many of those gains and then some. They could cut the top tax rate to its lowest level in 80 years (as Mr. Romney proposes) and make major changes to federal programs. 
Above all, a sweep of Washington could make possible the sort of change Republicans have been talking about for three decades without having yet done: a significant shrinking of government. Ronald Reagan cut domestic programs somewhat but expanded the military, while George W. Bush talked about small government but actually made it bigger. Next year, though, really could be different.
Even if Mr. Romney is not the obvious vehicle for the Tea Party revolution, his campaign and his selection of Mr. Ryan for vice president suggest he is game. ''His choice of Ryan,'' says Grover Norquist, the anti-tax activist, ''answers any questions about whether he is for dramatically reducing the cost of government.'' Congressional Republicans may force the issue anyway, arguing that their victories demand wholesale change.
''We're having a real debate about the size and scope of government,'' says Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who is overseeing the Republicans' Senate campaigns. ''If Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan win, as I expect they will, they can justly claim a mandate, and I think it will make it much easier to do the hard things we all know need to be done.''
Already, Republicans are starting to think ahead, as is only natural. A Romney transition team, known as ''The Readiness Project,'' has begun meeting. In 2008, similarly, Obama aides began discussing whether health care or climate policy should be the top priority, a hugely consequential decision.
For a Romney administration, one of the first questions will be how much to use a legislative process known as reconciliation. Under reconciliation, filibusters are prohibited and only a simple majority of 51 Senate votes, rather than 60, is needed. With Democrats likely to oppose the Romney agenda overwhelmingly and a couple of Republican moderates potentially having qualms, reconciliation would likely play a big role in 2013.
''To the extent that we can get Democrats to buy into it, great,'' Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a conservative House leader, told me. ''But we need to go there and do what we told the voters we were going to do.'' Mr. Cornyn said, ''There are a whole lot of very important things you can do with 51 votes.''
Norman J. Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute describes the plan as ''the mother of all reconciliation bills.''
Congress would first pass a temporary delay of the fiscal cliff -- the tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect, for a variety of reasons, on Jan. 1. Mr. Romney might need to sign such a bill retroactively, assuming victorious Republicans and a lame-duck Mr. Obama did not reach a compromise in late 2012.
Republicans could then turn to long-term priorities. On taxes, the crucial decision will be whether to pursue a tax-code overhaul, with lower rates and fewer tax breaks. Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have each proposed an overhaul, but they have not specified which tax breaks they would reduce to keep their rate cuts from adding to the deficit. And the large tax breaks, like those for health insurance and mortgage interest, are popular.
If a full overhaul is going to happen, the mostly likely approach may be a ceiling on how many overall tax breaks someone could claim, avoiding a series of lobbying fights over each break. Martin S. Feldstein, a longtime Republican economist, has proposed such a plan. One of Mr. Ryan's budget plans contains a related idea, in which people can opt into a simpler tax code.
But given how hard tax reform is under any circumstance, the fallback may be a simple tax cut, making the Bush tax cuts permanent and taking some rates lower. Republicans would have to endure criticism that they were violating Mr. Romney's campaign pledges, by reducing the affluent's relative tax burden and adding to the deficit. They could counter that future economic growth would solve the problems, even if independent analysts disagreed.
Mr. Norquist and many conservatives say they could support a simple tax cut. Byron Dorgan, the former Democratic senator from North Dakota, says of the Republicans, ''They value tax cuts more than virtually anything, including the deficit, and I think they've demonstrated that.''
On health care, the initial focus may not be Medicare, despite the campaign attention it has received. (Mr. Romney has promised not to touch current benefits, which suggests that he may first pursue modest changes, like pilot programs reducing the government's role.) A Romney administration may instead focus on two less politically perilous areas: Mr. Obama's health law and Medicaid, which covers many poor people and much long-term care for the elderly.
Although Republicans could not repeal all of Mr. Obama's health law with reconciliation, they could undo most of the insurance expansion, because it relies on government subsidies for the uninsured. Congress could also shrink Medicaid, which covers about one in six Americans. ''You turn the money over to states,'' says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative research group, ''and you promise less money.'' Mr. Ryan's budget envisions 75 percent less Medicaid spending than now projected.
Beyond health care, Mr. Romney and Congressional Republicans have called for large cuts in federal programs. They have not specified those cuts, but because they would exempt the military, most other areas would likely take significant reductions.
What would the combined effects of the new Republican revolution be? Some government agencies would probably become less wasteful, learning to do more with less, and the private sector would take over some government functions. But those would not be the only changes. The American economy would also devote fewer of its resources to the areas that do not naturally create opportunities for profit in a free market: mass transportation, road building, early-stage scientific research, many aspects of education and public safety.
Whether you love that idea or hate it, it certainly would be different. Around the world, the historical pattern has been for government to grow as a society becomes richer and citizens vote for more of the services that the market often does not provide by itself. Federal spending makes up 22 percent of the American economy today, up from 3 percent a century ago.
In an aging society coping with a globalized economy, where health care and education continue to grow more ambitious and expensive, the country has a choice to make. It can allow government to continue expanding. Or, as a Romney administration would, it can take a more laissez-faire path than any wealthy country has previously tried.

HEADLINE: Election 2012: Citing Weather, Republicans Cancel First Day of Convention

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. - Republicans on Saturday canceled the opening day of their national convention, saying their first concern was for the safety of delegates and guests in the face of Tropical Storm Isaac, which is strengthening and is headed toward Florida's West Coast.
"Our first priority is ensuring the safety of delegates, alternates, guests, members of the media attending the Republican National Convention and citizens of the Tampa Bay area," Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement. 
"R.N.C. convention officials and the Romney campaign are working closely with state, local and federal officials, as well as the Secret Service, to monitor Tropical Storm Isaac and preserve Florida's emergency management resources," he said. "Officials have predicted participants may encounter severe transportation difficulties due to sustained wind and rain."
The convention will officially open on Monday but will immediately recess until Tuesday afternoon at a time to be determined later, Mr. Priebus said.
Planners stressed that the official business of the convention will go on as planned later in the week.
"The Republican National Convention will take place and officially nominate Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, and the party has other necessary business it must address," Mr. Priebus said in the statement. "We also are remaining in constant contact with state and federal officials and may make additional schedule alterations as needed."
Canceling the first day disrupts a carefully planned schedule that had been intended to highlight Mr. Romney's qualifications and offer a critique of President Obama.
The opening day was to have been called "We Can Do Better," featuring speakers who would address what they considered to be the failures of Mr. Obama's administration. Planners had said "real people who have been affected by the Obama economy" were scheduled to speak.
Officials said the roll call vote of the states nominating Mr. Romney would take place on Tuesday. And they expressed confidence that the message of the convention would be effectively made in three days.
"We will absolutely be able to get our message out," said Russ Schreifer, a top aide to Mr. Romney. "We still have an opportunity to tell the story of the last four years of how President Obama has failed the country."
He added, "We think we can absolutely do it in three and we look forward to telling that story."
Among the speakers scheduled to address the delegates on Monday were Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, and Nikki R. Haley, the governor of South Carolina. Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, and Florida's current governor, Rick Scott, were also supposed to speak on Monday.
They and the other speakers may be rescheduled and fit into the other three days. Republican officials said they would make announcements about a new plan as soon as Sunday morning.
"We have been working closely with the campaign, the party and state and local officials for months to ensure a successful, enjoyable convention," Bill Harris, the chief executive officer of the convention, said in a statement. "Federal, state and local officials assure us that they are prepared to respond, if needed, and the scheduling changes we are announcing today will help ensure the continued safety of all participants."
The main three broadcast networks had already deemed the first day to be less interesting than the rest of the convention and decided not to carry any of the prime time speeches live. In response, convention planners had moved Ann Romney's speech from Monday to Tuesday.
The weather situation was eerily reminiscent of four years ago, when a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico also forced the cancellation of the first day of the Republican convention.
But in 2008, Republicans were meeting in Minnesota. Because the hurricane had the potential to hit New Orleans, convention planners decided they did not want to risk a poor reaction from voters watching partisan speeches as people suffered along the Gulf Coast.
As of Saturday evening, Tropical Storm Isaac was headed into the Gulf after battering Haiti. The track of the storm suggested that it could bring heavy rains and winds to South Florida and perhaps to Tampa.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For Gen Xers, a Wake-Up Call

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
REPRESENTATIVE Paul D. Ryan, the presumptive Republican nominee for vice president, favors grunge music, Coen brothers movies and craft brews. He sprinkles the word ''awesome'' into daily speech and, as a teenager, worked the ultimate ''McJob,'' at McDonald's.
So it might seem fair to assume that the ascendance of the Wisconsin congressman -- at 42, the first member of so-called Generation X to appear on a presidential ticket -- might inspire a moment of unity, even pride, for a generation that hasn't had much reason to come together since Kurt Cobain died.
Typical Gen X, it's a little more complicated than that.
''Vice president: it's the perfect Gen X job, isn't it?'' said Elizabeth Wurtzel, the author of ''Prozac Nation,'' her 1994 memoir of disaffection that was hailed as a Gen X bible. ''To have no responsibility, to have only the perks of what was left behind by the responsible people.'' 
Consider that a quintessential Generation X take: a dollop of irony, a dash of fatalism and a sprinkle of self-loathing. As countless profiles of the generation have argued, the children of the Baby Bust that stretched between the mid-1960s through 1970s (now in their mid-30s through mid-40s) were weaned on a broken American dream.
Burned by recession and buried in a demographic trough between the baby boomers and the Millennials, they came of age among dire pronouncements that theirs might be the first generation in memory that might not live better than their parents. No one ever expected much of them.
So in the days following Mitt Romney's selection of Representative Ryan, it seemed natural for graying Lollapaloozans to reflect on their own multidecade identity crisis.
''From a vanity standpoint, it makes you feel a bit old to have a person from your generation on the presidential ticket,'' said the actor Johnny Knoxville, 41, of ''Jackass'' fame. ''And it's embarrassing that it's Paul Ryan. I wonder if the Germs ever felt this way about having Belinda Carlisle as their first drummer.''
With memories still fresh of crowd-surfing at Soundgarden shows, others wondered, are we really ready for this?
''My knee-jerk reaction is 'no,' '' said Jordan Kurland, 40, who manages the Gen X-friendly alt-rock band Death Cab for Cutie. He found it hard to reconcile that a generation whose name once served as marketing shorthand for ''restless youth'' was ready to assume the reins of power. His friends, after all, were still buying game consoles and listening to, well, Death Cab for Cutie. ''This is the generation that has fought the hardest to maintain a state of arrested development,'' Mr. Kurland said. ''How did we get to this place where we are allegedly responsible adults?''
Such ambivalence stands in marked contrast to the pride that baby boomers (never ones to underestimate their own importance) felt when Bill Clinton, with his sax and his shades, was elected to the White House in 1992 at age 46. For many Boomers, seizing the Oval Office seemed like a formality; at 76 million strong, they had been in power for years. ''Clinton's generation has already had its chance to make its tastes the country's tastes,'' was how the journalist (and boomer) Nicholas Lemann put it in Time magazine after that election.
Generation X, for its part, seems uninterested in cuing ''Pomp and Circumstance'' for its own generational graduation. Instead, it is still batting around existential questions: What does it mean to be Generation X? Is Paul Ryan real X or pseudo X?
''The generational cliché is not being able to find a job and not caring, and taking care to find yourself instead,'' said Joe Levy, a former Rolling Stone executive editor and chronicler of Gen X culture who now edits Billboard. ''Ryan is someone who always had a job and always had a path. At a time when a lot of his generation was struggling to get their own apartment, he was getting elected to the House of Representatives. That is not the way you think of a Gen Xer.''
This is not to say there weren't glimmers of pride. Conservative bloggers tended to interpret the candidate's supply-side politics as part of a broader generational narrative -- his proposed ''Path to Prosperity'' entitlement cuts, they argued, were classic Gen X financial pragmatism, an overdue effort to undo the excess of older generations.
''It is with pride to know that the first fellow 'Gen Xer' on a national ticket is a seriously intelligent conservative grounded in the fiscal realities that have placed our nation in peril,'' wrote Matthew May on American Thinker, a conservative news and opinion site.
Xers on the anarcho-left, however, expressed dismay that a former prom king and driver of the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile had been anointed to carry the torch for a Jane's Addiction generation.
''My first thought was 'Dang!' because we are definitely ready -- too long have we been in the shadow of the boomers,'' said Shane Smith, 42, a founder of Vice, recalling his reaction to the announcement. ''I just wish that a Reaganite-friend-of-the-Tea-Party-frat-boy-jock was not our first poster boy.''
Similarly, the rap-metal band Rage Against the Machine, which the congressman says he is a fan of, had made its unhappiness known. ''He is the embodiment of the machine that our music has been raging against for two decades,'' said Tom Morello, the band's guitarist, in a Rolling Stone op-ed article that has been widely quoted.
In the end, who is to say if Representative Ryan is a worthy Gen X icon? The cohort is noticeably lacking in voice-of-a-generation types to serve as arbiters. Kurt Cobain and River Phoenix are dead. The MTV executives who gave the world ''Alternative Nation'' now refuse to discuss Gen X because, a network spokeswoman explained, it's all about the Millennials now.
And many of the cultural figures who epitomized the X sensibility -- R.E.M., ''Joel'' from ''Mystery Science Theater 3000,'' many of the Brat Pack actors, and even Douglas Coupland, who wrote the seminal 1991 novel ''Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture'' -- are not X at all, by the common 1965 to 1980 definition, but, rather, late-model baby boomers.
Some academics who study the group, meanwhile, blow holes in the slacker mythology. Jean Twenge, a psychology professor at San Diego State University and author of ''Generation Me,'' explained that in surveys of millions of college freshmen conducted over decades, Generation X students tended to rate themselves considerably higher in intellectual self-confidence, the drive to achieve and leadership ability than boomers did when they were in college.
''Although boomers and perhaps the media didn't expect much of Gen X, Gen X has always expected the best from themselves,'' said Dr. Twenge, a member of the cohort herself.
Indeed, some believe that Generation X may still save the day. Krist Novoselic, Nirvana's bass player in the '90s, holds out hope that some member of his generation (likely not Mr. Ryan, whom he considers just another 20th-century-style politician like the others) is going to come along and create a new brand of politics, to ''build a structure that meets people's needs.''
''I believe in phenomena, because I've seen them and I've been a part of them, but I don't think anything is going to change until we have a new kind of politics,'' said Mr. Novoselic, 47, who is still making music near Seattle.
Until then, he's tuning out -- on Paul Ryan, on the election in general. ''I don't even watch TV, so I don't care,'' he added. ''How's that for a Gen X reply?''

HEADLINE: Romney Adopts Harder Message For Last Stretch

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Mitt Romney is heading into his nominating convention with his advisers convinced he needs a more combative footing against President Obama in order to appeal to white, working-class voters and to persuade them that he is the best answer to their economic frustrations.
Having survived a summer of attacks but still trailing the president narrowly in most national polls, Mr. Romney's campaign remains focused intently on the economy as the issue that can defeat Mr. Obama. But in a marked change, Mr. Romney has added a harder edge to a message that for most of this year was focused on his business and job-creation credentials, injecting volatile cultural themes into the race.
Some elements of that revised strategy will be evident at the Republican convention, which was set to open here on Monday but will be delayed until Tuesday because of safety concerns from Tropical Storm Isaac. The Romney campaign was hastily rearranging the schedule, but officials said the convention would still amplify the conservative arguments against the president with speakers like Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. 
''We will absolutely be able to get our message out,'' said Russ Schriefer, a senior campaign adviser. ''We still have an opportunity to tell the story of the last four years of how President Obama has failed the country.''
The strategic shift in the campaign message that has been unfolding in recent weeks reflects a conclusion among Mr. Romney's advisers that disappointment with Mr. Obama's economic stewardship is not sufficient to propel Mr. Romney to victory on its own.
Republican strategists said that many middle-class voters had proved reluctant to give up entirely on Mr. Obama, and that they still needed to be convinced that Mr. Romney would look out for their interests.
Steven J. Law, the president of the conservative group American Crossroads, said some swing voters in focus groups had helped explain why support for Mr. Obama had not collapsed despite his poor marks on the economy.
''They're somewhat seduced by the thought, 'If the guy had more time, maybe he'd be able to turn it around,' '' said Mr. Law, whose group is spending tens of millions of dollars to change that.
Republicans are nervously monitoring the pivotal battleground of Ohio, where Mr. Romney has had trouble making headway against Mr. Obama. Mr. Romney visited the state on Saturday and previewed the themes of his convention by offering faint praise of his rival, saying: ''He says marvelous things. He just hasn't done them.''
Mr. Obama, unwilling to cede the stage fully to his opponents this week, leveled a counterattack in an interview released Saturday by The Associated Press, painting Mr. Romney as beholden to ''extreme'' House Republican policies harmful to the middle class.
''He has signed up for positions, extreme positions, that are very consistent with positions that a number of House Republicans have taken,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Governor Romney's policies would make things worse for middle-class families and offer no prospect for long-term opportunity for those striving to get into the middle class.''
The battleground map has remained remarkably stable in recent months, which leaves Mr. Obama with more paths to winning 270 electoral votes and places a burden on Mr. Romney to break through in states where he so far has not. But Republicans suddenly see encouraging signs in Wisconsin after the selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan as his running mate. Mr. Romney's chances hinge to a large degree on running up his advantage among white voters in swing states who show deep strains of opposition to Mr. Obama but do not yet trust Mr. Romney to look out for their interests, Republican strategists say.
Many of those voters are economically disaffected, and the Romney campaign has been trying to reach them with appeals built around an assertion that Mr. Obama is making it easier for welfare recipients to avoid work. The Romney campaign is airing an advertisement falsely charging that Mr. Obama has ''quietly announced'' plans to eliminate work and job training requirements for welfare beneficiaries, a message Mr. Romney's aides said resonates with working-class voters who see government as doing nothing for them.
The moves reflect a campaign infused with a sharper edge and overtones of class and race. On Friday, Mr. Romney said at a rally that no one had ever had to ask him about his birth certificate, and Mr. Ryan invoked his Catholicism and love of hunting. Democrats angrily said Mr. Romney's remark associated him with the fringe ''birther'' camp seeking falsely to portray Mr. Obama as not American.
The convention will focus on a dual fire-Obama-hire-Romney message that will be presented in an abbreviated fashion from Tuesday through Thursday. Party leaders said Saturday evening that the themes of the convention would be preserved, despite the disruption from Tropical Storm Isaac. Through videos, speeches and carefully staged programming, the convention will amplify what will constantly be described as Mr. Obama's failures, with a focus on accusations that he has undercut middle-class workers and small-business owners.
But with Ann Romney, Mr. Romney's wife, taking the stage on Tuesday night, the Republican gathering will be as much about presenting Mr. Romney as a warm-blooded family man who understands the tribulations of everyday people. The campaign, after spending months arguing that the family's Mormon faith was off limits, invited speakers from Mr. Romney's church to testify how he had helped them when they were in need.
Those concurrent themes reflect a realization by strategists inside the Romney campaign and its allies at outside groups in recent weeks: Republicans need to do more than critique Mr. Obama's economic record for Mr. Romney to win. With the race entering its final, decisive phase, strategists on both sides agree that Mr. Obama maintains a razor-thin edge.
That, several Republican officials said in interviews, is the result of a stubborn affinity for Mr. Obama among key swing voters who otherwise say they are disappointed in his job performance -- a dynamic the Romney campaign and its allies are seeking to change.
Mr. Law said his group, Crossroads, had reserved roughly $35 million in advertising for the rest of the campaign and planned to spend more on efforts speaking to their other perception, that Mr. Obama had not been able to deliver.
''These folks know they are not happy with what Obama has done, but they are struggling between, 'I voted for him, I liked him, but he's not getting the job done,' '' said Carl Forti, political director for American Crossroads. ''That's where Mitt needs to take advantage.''
But, strategists acknowledge, Mr. Romney still has work to do before those critical swing voters will view him as that alternative, particularly with polls showing that voters see him as less attuned to their needs and values than Mr. Obama is. While he hopes to improve his standing among women, strategists say Mr. Romney's chances hinge to a large degree on running up his edge among white voters who do not yet trust Mr. Romney.
''Right now the perceptions of him are allowing Barack Obama to stay in this race and keep a slight lead in spite of all the environmental factors that lead you to think he should be gone,'' said Matthew Dowd, a pollster for George W. Bush's campaigns. ''If he can change perceptions about himself, then the environment takes hold, and if the environment takes hold, they win.''
Mr. Romney's team is hoping to change perceptions starting with the Republican convention and, more important, with full access to the $186 million he and the Republican National Committee have on hand and can use as soon as Mr. Romney accepts the party's nomination. It will give him his first real financial advantage over Mr. Obama this year.
Here and in Boston, Mr. Romney's team is poised to sift through post-convention polling before pressing its new advantage with final advertising bets in key states.
''For undecided voters, Obama's job performance weighs more heavily than Mitt's current image,'' said Neil Newhouse, the pollster for Mr. Romney. ''They can measure what Obama has done, and his job performance numbers among those voters are extraordinarily weak.''
Central to the weeks ahead, strategists from both parties said, will be the perceptions of voters in battleground states like Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. Both sides agree that Mr. Romney's choice of Mr. Ryan has given Mr. Romney a new opportunity in Wisconsin. But, even Republicans say, the bigger electoral prize of Ohio, as of now seems to be tilting in Mr. Obama's direction.
With Crossroads and like-minded groups providing critical backup, Mr. Romney's campaign is freer to concentrate on building its candidate up and trying to repair the damage done to his image over the summer.

HEADLINE: Despite Democrats' Warnings, Private Medicare Plans Find Success

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even as President Obama accuses Mitt Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan of trying to privatize and ''voucherize'' Medicare, his administration crows about the success of private health plans in delivering prescription drug benefits and other services to Medicare beneficiaries.
More than a quarter of the 50 million beneficiaries receive coverage through private Medicare Advantage plans, mostly health maintenance organizations, and Medicare's drug benefits are delivered exclusively by private insurers, subsidized by the government.
Obama administration officials, lawmakers from both parties and beneficiaries have generally been satisfied with the private plans.
''Medicare Advantage premiums down 7 percent on average, enrollment up 10 percent,'' the administration announced in February, and it said the quality of care under Medicare Advantage was improving. 
This month the administration reported the results of competitive bidding for 2013: ''Medicare prescription drug premiums to remain steady for third straight year.''
Federal spending on Medicare drug benefits has been about 30 percent lower than the Congressional Budget Office predicted when the drug legislation was passed in 2003.
Mr. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who is the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the drug program ''came in below cost projections because it harnessed the power of choice and competition.''
The success of the program, he said, inspired his proposal for broader changes. Under his proposal, the government would contribute a fixed amount of money on behalf of each beneficiary, and future beneficiaries could use the money to buy private insurance or to help pay for coverage under the traditional Medicare program.
What is the difference? Why do Democrats say that Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan would ''end Medicare as we know it,'' even as private plans have helped hold down costs and have satisfied most beneficiaries?
One answer, cited by many health policy experts, is that Medicare officials have aggressively regulated insurers to protect consumers and prevent abuses in the marketing and operation of private plans. Republicans who seek a larger role for private plans generally want a market with less regulation.
In the past, federal and state officials say, insurers used improper hard-sell tactics to persuade Medicare beneficiaries to sign up for private health plans. Also, some insurers offered benefits that were likely to attract healthy retirees and discouraged the enrollment of those with costly chronic conditions.
The Romney-Ryan proposal would preserve traditional Medicare as an option. Enrollment in private Medicare Advantage plans, which has risen by nearly 60 percent in the past five years, could grow even faster if they prove more efficient than the government-run program.
Private insurers, competing for business in the Medicare market, have pioneered some innovations in care intended to keep people out of the hospital. Whether such competition holds down costs is less clear.
''There is no strong evidence that competition among health plans is a powerful lever to generate a lot of savings,'' said Marsha R. Gold, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research who has been studying private plans in Medicare for more than two decades. ''It's not clear that traditional Medicare or Medicare Advantage knows how to control costs. They are both learning.''
However, Roger D. Feldman, a professor of health insurance at the University of Minnesota, said: ''Competitive bidding could save a substantial amount of money, helping solve Medicare's fiscal crisis. That type of competition has saved money for employers.''
Under the formula used in recent years, Medicare has paid private plans more than it would cost to care for the same patients in the traditional government-run Medicare program. The new health care law is expected to reduce those disparities.
A premise of the new law is that consumers will benefit from more competition. The law will set up markets, known as exchanges, where people under 65 can shop for private insurance and get subsidies to help pay for it. Massachusetts set up such an exchange under a 2006 law that Mr. Romney championed when he was governor. Mr. Ryan's proposal would establish a similar exchange for Medicare.
''Romneycare, Obamacare and the Ryan plan have some stunning similarities,'' said John K. Gorman, a Medicare official in the Clinton administration who now advises insurers.
The political imperative for deficit reduction ensures that Congress will consider changes in the structure of Medicare next year, regardless of who wins the presidential election. In the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program, the government bears the financial burden when Medicare costs increase. In Medicare Advantage and the prescription drug program, that burden is shared with private insurers.
Critics of the Romney-Ryan plan cite two major concerns. They fear that per capita Medicare payments will lag behind medical costs, forcing beneficiaries to pay more. And they worry that older, sicker and more costly beneficiaries will be left in the traditional Medicare program.
''Private Medicare Advantage plans may siphon off lower-risk patients,'' said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, a former administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
The Republican proposal would sharpen competition between traditional Medicare and private plans. The cost of traditional Medicare has long been a major factor in setting payments to private plans, but the private plans have hardly any influence on spending or premiums in the government-run program.
''It's not a two-way street,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
Under current law, federal officials say, the Medicare trust fund will be exhausted by 2024. Whether a market-oriented plan like Mr. Ryan's could rein in costs depends on the answers to a handful of technical but important questions:
¶ How would the standard payment for each beneficiary be set? Mr. Ryan would peg it to the cost of the second-least-expensive private plan or traditional Medicare, whichever was lower.
¶ Would the federal government try to control costs by limiting the growth of its defined contribution? At various times, Mr. Ryan has suggested that the federal payment could not grow faster than consumer prices or the economy as a whole, plus half of one percentage point.
¶ Would private plans have to provide the same benefits as traditional Medicare? Could they charge higher co-payments for some services? Could they offer benefits substantially different from those in traditional Medicare if the overall value of the package was the same?
¶ How much extra help would the government provide to low-income people to reduce their premiums, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs? How would Medicare adjust payments to insurers to reflect the higher costs of sicker patients?
The prescription drug benefit was added to Medicare in 2003 by a Republican-led Congress, working with a Republican president, George W. Bush. Democrats made dire predictions.
''Most seniors will be worse off,'' Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, said on the House floor. ''This is the beginning of the end of Medicare as we know it.''
Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said: ''We hear the claim that private-sector competition will drive down costs and save Medicare. Nonsense!''
Lawmakers of both parties worried that few insurance companies would offer free-standing coverage for prescription drugs. In fact, insurers, seeing a lucrative business opportunity, rushed into the Medicare market.
Beneficiaries can now choose from 25 to 35 free-standing drug plans. Or they can choose one of the many H.M.O.'s offering drug coverage.
Medicare officials cite competition as a factor holding down costs. In addition, said John F. Hoadley, a research professor at Georgetown University, Medicare has benefited from ''larger trends in the pharmaceutical marketplace,'' including greater use of generic drugs that cost less than brand-name products.

HEADLINE: The Sun Belt, Eclipsed

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY. 
The Los Angeles bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- For more than 50 years, the Sun Belt -- the band of states that extends from Florida to California -- has been the philosophical heart and electoral engine of the Republican Party. It was more than just a source of votes. The Sun Belt infused the Republican Party with a frontier spirit: the optimistic, free-ranging embrace of individualism and the disdain for big government and regulation.
From Richard M. Nixon through John McCain, a span of 48 years, every Republican presidential candidate save for Gerald R. Ford and Bob Dole has claimed ties to the Sun Belt. The last Republican president, George W. Bush, made a point of fixing his political compass in Texas once he was done with Yale and Harvard Business School, complete with what many heard as a slightly exaggerated drawl, as had his father, a Connecticut Yankee turned Texas oilman. 
Yet as Republicans gather here this week, they are nominating for president a governor of Massachusetts who was born in Michigan and, for vice president, a congressman from Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Sun Belt states that were once reliable parts of the Republican electoral map are turning blue or have turned blue, like California. Only Southern notches of the belt remain. And the sunny symbol of Ronald Reagan in a cowboy hat cutting wood, as good an image of the Sun Belt spirit as there was, has given way to the angrier politics of the Tea Party, which embraces much of the same anti-government message but with a decidedly different tone.
The Sun Belt remains an economic, political and cultural force. But the 40th Republican National Convention is a sign that the Republicans' grip on it is loosening. The nominations of Mitt Romney and Paul D. Ryan could mark the end of an era.
''It's really a dramatic change in the 30-some-odd years since I ran Reagan's campaign,'' said Ed Rollins, a Republican consultant. ''I began with a base, even when we were 30 points down, when Reagan asked me to run his campaign. The West Coast is gone, and those are big numbers.'' Stuart Spencer, another senior Reagan campaign adviser, said Reagan at once personified and defined himself as a creature of the Sun Belt. ''That's where we started, and we added from there,'' he said. ''But Colorado is in play now. Nevada is in play.''
How did this happen?
For one thing, the Republican who came riding in as the candidate of the Sun Belt -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas -- stumbled. But there are larger forces at work that lead many analysts to think that a long-lasting shift is under way. The Sun Belt is in many ways not what it was when Barry Goldwater came on the scene. Once the very symbol of economic prosperity and untrammeled growth, it has been pummeled by the collapse of the housing market.
''There is a soaring rate of poverty in these new suburban regions,'' said Lisa McGirr, a history professor at Harvard who studies the region. ''I think it's bound to have a political impact and to transform the ability of the Republican Party to appeal to suburbanites with private, individualistic solutions.''
More transformative is the demographic shift brought on by the influx of Latino voters. It is upending the political makeup of states like Nevada, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Florida. And it has come when the Republican Party has been identified with tough measures aimed at curbing immigration.
Many Republicans date the beginning of the decline to 1994, when Republicans in California backed a voter initiative, Proposition 187, to deny government services to immigrants in this country illegally. The law was eventually nullified by a federal court.
''Once California started alienating Latinos and once Latinos started moving in large numbers to Arizona and in Texas, that changes the whole game,'' said Richard White, a professor of history at the Bill Lane Center for the American West at Stanford.
The change has been noted in places like Orange County, Calif., home to the Nixon presidential library and once a symbol of conservative political power and for many years overwhelmingly white. Today, it is filled with enclaves of Latinos and Asians -- on many streets, it is hard to find an English-language sign on a store -- and only about 43 percent of the voters are registered Republican.
Eventually, some say, even Texas might move to the Democratic column as more Latinos move in and vote. Even though Florida continues to vote Republican in statewide elections, indications are that the increasing presence of non-Cuban Hispanics could tilt the state leftward.
''The real question now in Florida is whether the I-4 corridor -- between Daytona and Tampa -- is becoming more Democratic than independent,'' said Joseph Gaylord, a Republican consultant who lives there. ''Texas and Florida offset California. And there's no way a Republican can become president if you don't win Texas and Florida.''
If the political allegiances of the Sun Belt are shifting, the changes in its political philosophy, represented by the increasing power of the Tea Party in states like this and Arizona, are slightly more nuanced. The view of government expressed by Tea Party members is not that different from what Reagan or Goldwater might have said.
But Mr. Spencer, the Reagan hand, believes that the Tea Party would never have embraced Reagan. ''He was a pragmatist,'' Mr. Spencer said. ''Ronald Reagan raised taxes 13 times at least'' in his years as governor and president.
It was Reagan whose election as president seemed to mark the coming of the political age of the Sun Belt, but also of what Kenneth M. Duberstein, the White House chief of staff for Reagan, referred to as ''the lock'': the notion that the Republican Party could consider the Sun Belt in the political bank. As late as 2002, Karl Rove, the chief political adviser to George W. Bush, was arguing that California was fertile ground for Republicans.
''Reagan in many ways seemed to be the beginning of the wave, but in retrospect, it's going to be remembered as the peak of the wave,'' Mr. White said. He suggested that Mr. McCain's defeat in 2008 might come to carry its own political symbolism.
''It's always hard to say things based on one election, but he will probably be seen as the tail end of it,'' Mr. White said.

HEADLINE: The Antisocial Contract

BYLINE: By ROBERT O. SELF. 
An associate professor of history at Brown and the author of the forthcoming book ''All in the Family: The Realignment of American Democracy Since the 1960s.''

 BODY:
WHEN the Republican Party meets in Tampa, Fla., this week, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey will deliver the keynote address. He promises "hard truths." Twenty years ago, the Democrat-turned-Republican Phil Gramm had that job. Warning to Governor Christie: no one remembers anything Mr. Gramm said. What we do remember from the 1992 convention in Houston is the jeremiad delivered by Patrick J. Buchanan, the former speechwriter for Richard M. Nixon who won nearly a quarter of Republican primary votes that year. With his invocation of a "cultural war" for the "soul of America," Mr. Buchanan brought down the house.
His fulminations against abortion, homosexuality and other hot-button "cultural" issues exceeded tolerable political rhetoric and likely hurt President George Bush in the general election. But Mr. Buchanan nonetheless set the tone for the Clinton years, and "culture war" became shorthand for the battle between Red and Blue in the 1990s. 
With Mitt Romney trying to keep the focus on the economy, Mr. Buchanan's outrage is not the preferred Republican template for 2012. But the primary season and Mr. Romney's selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan as his running mate are evidence that the culture wars are still raging. Controversies over transvaginal ultrasound, birth control, Mr. Ryan's strict anti-abortion views and, perhaps most spectacularly, the notion of "legitimate rape" put forward by Representative Todd Akin, the Republican candidate for Senate in Missouri, indicate that cultural issues remain front and center.
This should come as no surprise. For liberals, government promises to support individuals and families economically. For conservatives, government promises to protect individuals and families morally. Nothing has divided our two political tribes in the last half century quite like that distinction.
But at least two things distinguish 2012 from 1992. First, 8 percent unemployment and the weak recovery suggest that the state of the economy might work in the Republicans' favor. Second, many single women have given up on the Republican Party; they identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party by a 2-to-1 margin.
In this environment, culture-war appeals can backfire as easily as they can succeed. That was evident last week as Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan spent precious time calling for Mr. Akin to end his campaign against Senator Claire McCaskill for a seat Republicans hoped to win.
But treating the economy, on one hand, and women and family, on the other, as if they are mutually exclusive is a fallacy. When Americans argue about gender, sex and family, they are arguing about equality, power and money - in essence, about the nature and role of government.
What we call the culture wars are only the tip of a historical iceberg, the visible part of a protracted and wrenching fight over American citizenship that dates from the 1960s (and beyond to the suffrage movement). The fight over feminism cannot be confined to a narrative about "culture wars." Indeed, the very idea of a culture war clouds what's really at stake.
Conventional wisdom has it that in politics there are values issues and economic issues, with "values" conservatives and "fiscal" conservatives to match. Yet this distinction obscures as much as it reveals. When we cast culture-war issues solely in terms of religious or moral values, we miss their deep entanglement with government power.
How people conceive of these issues - reproductive rights, say, or rape, or sexual harassment - says a great deal about how they view the social contract. The social contract is supposed to bind us together. It's everything from Medicare to the Americans With Disabilities Act to Social Security to the Equal Pay Act. It is the basic architecture of our collective responsibility to ensure that Americans share in a decent life. The social contract says that though our individual fates differ, we have a collective destiny, too. Many of us respond viscerally to comments from politicians like Mr. Akin because he leaves us wondering what place for women Republicans see in that collective future.
TO tease this out, let's go back to a moment that few remember today: the 1971 debate over child care. It may seem implausible, but that year Congress passed the Comprehensive Child Development Act, which would have established government-supported child care for middle-class families. Led by Marian Wright Edelman (who later founded the Children's Defense Fund), dozens of liberal organizations had lobbied relentlessly since the late 1960s for the bill. Ms. Edelman told Congress that child care was critical for "more than 12 million working women in this country."
For the liberals who pushed child care onto the national agenda, and for the Democrats who controlled Congress, it represented an addition to the social contract. Like Social Security and Medicare, it spread the cost of a social good across society.
President Nixon eventually vetoed the bill, but not before his inner circle gave government-supported child care a fairer hearing than did any subsequent Republican administration. Kevin Phillips, one of the architects of Nixon's famed "Southern strategy" for building a new Republican coalition, explained the administration's thinking: "Working mothers, a huge slice of the electorate, are extremely reachable on the subject of day care."
Nixon's veto message, in which, despite Mr. Phillips's insight, he called the bill "the most radical piece of legislation to emerge from the 92nd Congress," was among the first shock waves of a new kind of politics.
Nixon had actually been taken by surprise by the eruption of a small but vocal segment of his party over the bill. John G. Schmitz, a congressman from Orange County, Calif., predicted the "destruction of the basic family unit" if the bill passed. Senator James L. Buckley of New York insisted that it would "destroy parental authority and the institution of the family."
But Republicans like Mr. Schmitz and Mr. Buckley did not dominate the party as they do today. The most vocal opposition to new government initiatives came from the grass roots. A woman named Jaquie Davison founded an organization called Happiness of Womanhood - HOW - in her living room in Kingman, Ariz., to respond to feminism's rising popularity. Her blond bouffant hairstyle stood in proud defiance of the Gloria Steinem-inspired natural look popular among her feminist adversaries in the National Organization for Women. In 1971, Mrs. Davison embarked on what she called a "satin pillow" tour of the United States. "As real women, we want to defend our homes," she told reporters. Satin pillows - not work gloves and not government child care - were women's birthright.
The child care imbroglio was part of an emerging pattern. Mainstream feminists fought to ensure women's equality by revising the social contract to include protection of their standing in American life. Conservatives like Mr. Schmitz and Mrs. Davison responded with appeals to values. As Mrs. Davison revealingly saw it, women's homes were under assault not so much by the feminist vision of the family as by the government. On her tour, she ran through the list of government perfidies: child care, sex education, abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment (in 1971, Congress was debating the E.R.A., and Roe v. Wade had just landed on the Supreme Court's docket).
The threat to the family stalking the land was not women's liberation but an expansive government seeking to intrude upon and regulate the private sphere. What liberal women saw as routes to equality, conservatives saw as invasions of the private sphere of morality, an invasion only a huge, interventionist government could accomplish.
To Americans who saw things the way Mrs. Davison did, this threat had first become apparent some years earlier. By including "sex" in the employment section (Title VII) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress had committed the national government to advancing a vast array of women's rights. Nebulous at first, those rights gradually came into view as women in organizations as different as the National Welfare Rights Organization, led largely by poor women of color, and the A.C.L.U.'s Women's Rights Project, led by a young lawyer named Ruth Bader Ginsburg, spent two decades litigating on behalf of gender equality in the workplace.
Their efforts were not about values or culture; they were about the dollar. They wanted to fix the market, not the American family. They sought to strip the former of all the advantages law and custom had given to men.
The feminists who waged these battles may have overestimated government's capacity to adapt to a changing society, as many liberals of that era did. But their ambitions were not radical. They sought what many women still seek: to bring the law into alignment with how they actually live, to make it possible for women to raise families and to work for pay at the same time.
Before the Akin flare-up, the many fronts of the right's war on women might have seemed little more than attempts to inflame the passions of the conservative base, but Mr. Akin has done us a favor. He has drawn the curtain back on how central women are to a presidential campaign in which no women are actually running. This election is not about the gap between the economy and the culture wars. It's about how they collapse together, and in the candidates' views of women we catch a glimpse of how we will write the social contract over the next generation.

HEADLINE: How Mr. Romney Would Force-Feed the Pentagon

BYLINE: By CAROL GIACOMO

 BODY:
Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are portraying themselves as lionhearted budget-cutters, ready to slice out profligate spending in all sorts of government programs and services and lead America to lower taxes and lower deficits. Many experts say their numbers don't add up, even if they were to impose all the cuts they want.
Yet none of that philosophy seems to apply to the defense budget -- which accounts for roughly half of all federal discretionary spending. 
Instead of proposing sensible and necessary reductions, they would throw more money at a Pentagon that has had a blank check for more than a decade. The base budget for 2013 -- not including war-related costs -- is projected at $525 billion, up roughly 34 percent from 2001. By 2022, Mr. Romney's plan would increase annual spending to $986 billion, according to an analysis by Travis Sharp of the Center for a New American Security.
The centerpiece of Mr. Romney's proposal is a promise to spend at least 4 percent of gross domestic product on military personnel, procurement, operations and maintenance, and research and development. That would add as much as $2.3 trillion to the defense budget over 10 years from projected 2013 spending levels, according to Mr. Sharp's analysis.
And yet for all these extra trillions, there's no sense that this money would produce a more effective security strategy. Linking a budget to the G.D.P. is a bizarre way of addressing defense needs -- which rationally should be based on a disciplined analysis of threats and the nation's tolerance of risk. This certainly won't provide any incentive for reform in a Pentagon that spends with more waste and less economic bang for the buck than other federal departments. Some conservatives have advocated the G.D.P. metric, saying it would ensure military strength by guaranteeing increased defense spending as the nation's wealth rises. But others -- like the anti-tax guru Grover Norquist -- have urged Republicans to lead in reducing the military budget.
Mr. Romney is showing no restraint. Even though American forces are out of Iraq and withdrawing from Afghanistan by the end of 2014, his campaign Web site states that he would reverse President Obama's plan to cut the Army and Marine Corps by 100,000 troops. Doing that, according to Mr. Sharp, would cost at least $41 billion over five years. Just what mission the extra troops would perform is unspecified.
Mr. Romney wants the Navy to increase shipbuilding from 9 ships per year to 15, at a cost of billions more. His position paper speaks of expanding the naval presence in the Western Pacific to counter China, which Mr. Obama is already doing. A campaign spokeswoman said many of the extra 100,000 slots would be used to staff the new ships, but that doesn't begin to explain the need for sustained troop levels.
Mr. Romney also promises a ''robust, multilayered national ballistic-missile defense system'' to defend against nuclear attacks on the United States and its allies, even though the system has been under development for years and there is still no guarantee it will work.
And how would he pay for his huge new defense budgets? In an interview with Fortune, Mr. Romney spoke of ''enormous opportunities for finding efficiency and cost savings in the military.'' His targets, according to his campaign, would be the Pentagon's civilian work force and reforms of the weapons procurement process. Such reforms are necessary but not easy, given inter-service rivalries and the clout of Congress and a well-financed defense lobby.
The Obama administration has committed to similar reforms, which the Pentagon says will save $210 billion over six years. That's a start, but still just a fraction of what would be needed to offset the added cost of Mr. Romney's G.D.P.-linked budget. The truth is that the added military spending would have to come from savaging most other federal programs, including those serving the most vulnerable Americans.
Mr. Ryan, of course, is now on board with the Romney plan. But he voted for the 2011 Budget Control Act, which mandated $487 billion in defense cuts over a 10-year period beginning in 2012 and $500 billion more beginning in 2013 if Congress doesn't reach a deal on reducing the deficit. And the budget he produced as chairman of the House Budget Committee is less generous to the Pentagon. It would, however, make severe cuts in diplomacy and foreign aid. Such budgeting would lead to even greater overreliance on military might than already exists.
After a decade of unchecked spending growth, the Pentagon can prudently absorb significant reductions at a time when the country is under economic stress. President Obama has begun to put the brakes on spending by slowing the rate of growth. But billions more could be saved by cutting wasteful or unnecessary conventional and nuclear weapons programs.
Voters are entitled to an honest debate on defense priorities. They need to hear not just about weapons and troop levels, but about the threats the candidates see in the world and how diplomacy and other levers of power can also be used to keep the nation safe. So far, they've heard nothing more than generalities from Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan. Neither man has a background in national security, so it's not surprising that they're trying to prove their bona fides by embracing a profligate defense budget.

HEADLINE: Carbon Tax Silence, Overtaken by Events

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

 BODY:
DON'T expect to hear much about climate change at the Republican and Democratic conventions.
Yes, there will be plenty of speeches about unemployment, budget deficits and other immediate problems. But the threats posed by global warming are decades away -- or so we have been told repeatedly in recent years.
Many climate scientists, however, are now pointing to evidence linking rising global temperatures to the extreme weather we're seeing around the planet. The United States has just endured its hottest 12-month period on record. The worst drought in a generation has parched the nation's crop belt. Floods that happened once a century now occur every few years. 
With distressing images of weather-related disasters saturating the news media, climate change no longer seems such a distant and abstract worry -- except, perhaps, in Washington. In 2009, President Obama persuaded House Democrats, then in the majority, to pass a bill aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Facing a Republican filibuster in the Senate, however, the legislation died. And its prospects dimmed further when Republicans took control of the House in 2010. Mr. Obama has remained relatively silent on the issue since then.
Mitt Romney, for his part, has been equivocal about whether rising temperatures are caused by human action. But he has been adamant that uncertainty about climate change rules out policy intervention. ''What I'm not willing to do,'' he told an audience in New Hampshire last summer, ''is spend trillions of dollars on something I don't know the answer to.''
Climatologists are the first to acknowledge that theirs is a highly uncertain science. The future might be better than they think. Then again, it might be much worse. Given that risk, policy makers must weigh the potential cost of action against the potential cost of inaction. And even a cursory look at the numbers makes a compelling case for action.
According to the respected M.I.T. global climate simulation model, there is a 10 percent chance that average surface temperatures will rise by more than 12 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. Warming on that scale could end life as we know it. Smaller increases would be less catastrophic, but even the most optimistic projections imply enormous costs.
The good news is that we could insulate ourselves from catastrophic risk at relatively modest cost by enacting a steep carbon tax. Early studies by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that a carbon tax of up to $80 per metric ton of emissions -- a tax that might raise gasoline prices by 70 cents a gallon -- would eventually result in climate stability. But because recent estimates about global warming have become more pessimistic, stabilization may require a much higher tax. How hard would it be to live with a tax of, say, $300 a ton?
If such a tax were phased in, the prices of goods would rise gradually in proportion to the amount of carbon dioxide their production or use entailed. The price of gasoline, for example, would slowly rise by somewhat less than $3 a gallon. Motorists in many countries already pay that much more than Americans do, and they seem to have adapted by driving substantially more efficient vehicles.
A carbon tax would also serve two other goals. First, it would help balance future budgets. Tens of millions of Americans are set to retire in the next decades, and, as a result, many budget experts agree that federal budgets simply can't be balanced with spending cuts alone. We'll also need substantial additional revenue, most of which could be generated by a carbon tax.
If new taxes are unavoidable, why not adopt ones that not only help balance the budget but also help make the economy more efficient? By reducing harmful emissions, a carbon tax fits that description.
A second benefit would occur if a carbon tax were approved today but phased in gradually, only after the economy had returned to full employment. High unemployment persists in part because businesses, sitting on mountains of cash, aren't investing it because their current capacity already lets them produce more than people want to buy. News that a carbon tax was coming would create a stampede to develop energy-saving technologies. Hundreds of billions of dollars of private investment might be unleashed without adding a cent to the budget deficit.
SOME people argue that a carbon tax would do little good unless it were also adopted by China and other big polluters. It's a fair point. But access to the American market is a potent bargaining chip. The United States could seek approval to tax imported goods in proportion to their carbon dioxide emissions if exporting countries failed to enact carbon taxes at home.
In short, global warming has a fairly simple and cheap technical solution. Extreme weather is already creating enormous human suffering. If it continues, politicians will have a hard time ignoring the problem when the 2016 conventions roll around. If the recent meteorological chaos drives home the threat of climate change and prompts action, it may ultimately be a blessing in disguise.

HEADLINE: V&S

BYLINE: By JOHN JEREMIAH SULLIVAN

 BODY:
There's video that exists of Venus and Serena Williams playing tennis when they were kids -- 8 and 7, respectively -- in the late '80s, on unshaded but otherwise decent-looking public courts in California. This is not one of the clips you've maybe seen, taken from various news segments, but an earlier, stranger video, made by their father and longtime coach, Richard Williams, as a kind of audition tape for the tennis-instructional guru Vic Braden, ostensibly requesting an invitation to Braden's camp, although the real reason for it, you can't help feel in watching, simply was to let Braden know that greatness had arrived in the world. Richard's face in the film as he presents the girls to Braden seems, as it does so often, on the brink of laughter. This was in Compton, the low-income, gang-afflicted hub city outside Los Angeles, an area made infamous by many a rap song. Although they enjoyed about as stable an upbringing as you could have in Compton back then, its problems were no mere abstraction: they supposedly knew to lie down on the court when gunshots rang out in the park. 
And there's a story that Richard, when asked what he would do if his daughters ever won a Grand Slam, said he would go back and try to help the Crips who sometimes looked out for the girls during their practice sessions. ''Venus Williams Is Straight Outta Compton!'' read an early promotional poster their father made, to post on telephone poles. He billed the two as celebrities before they were even famous. That was how you did it. Not fake it till you make it. You decided what you were. First you had the belief, and then you had the training. ''Belief and training,'' Venus told me a couple of weeks ago when I met with her in Cincinnati, where she and Serena were playing in a tournament just days after returning from the Olympics. ''That was unconquerable.''
She sat at a round, empty table in the meeting room at the Hyatt, first messing with her dog, a little terrierlike creature, and then placing it inside a duffel bag, where it apparently liked to hang out, because it stayed completely silent there for the better part of two hours, not even receiving any treats or anything. ''He's unemployed,'' she said, forcing him with her fingers to make a face at me.
Because she's usually frowning and scowling on court, or squinting and chewing the inside of her mouth, or looking bummed in the changeover chair -- or finally at the end sometimes grinning and laughing maniacally -- it's easy to find yourself unprepared for her sheer prettiness, as witnessed when she's more or less at ease, 6-foot-1 in pale designer jeans, quietly flashing the smile that made her at one time the richest woman in sports (before Maria Sharapova came along).
I was trying to bring the person across the table into some kind of stereoscopic harmony with the girl on the tape, the one whose short, beaded braids hang like a fringe of tassels on the side of her head. It showed her hitting big, swinging volleys from midcourt at about the skill level of a decent college player, except that she was catching them up above her head, scything the fed balls out of the air with enough topspin to send them arcing down toward the lines. After an especially good shot, Richard would say, ''Good shot, Venus,'' and Venus would say, in dulcet tones that retained a trace of his Louisiana syrup, ''Thank you, Daddy.''
Richard addresses the camera directly. Venus and Serena stand on either side of him, taking shelter in the shadow of his legs as if the camera might not find them there. Richard reveals to Braden that they have been watching his popular tape, ''Tennis Our Way,'' quoting his fantastically optimistic slogan, ''You'll be famous by Friday.'' Richard can't remember the exact wording. ''You kept saying we'd be good by Friday,'' he tells Braden. ''We was good by Tuesday. We should be great by Friday.''
The remarkable thing about the tape, from the point of view of someone interested in tennis, isn't the almost voyeuristically candid preflight glimpse it gives of some soon-to-be superstars but simply the footage of Venus hitting. She doesn't bounce on her feet yet between every shot, she hasn't fully learned that readiness; she just stands there, in her jeans, waiting to be fed the next ball. Nor is it even the excellence of her technique, although her technique, it goes without saying, is ridiculous for an 8-year-old. It's more something that she doesn't even know she's doing, something having to do with the transfer of force, of mass, from the back of her body to the front, and the way that this transference is passed along into the shot, the way it enters her racket head at precisely the millisecond she hits the ball, resulting in a kind of popping sound, the distinctive pop in ball-striking that signals someone who can really play, the thing you simply cannot and will never learn to do if you are a hack or even a pretty good player who has hit that cruel ceiling, the limits of your own physical ability, beyond which you cannot progress, even after decades of lessons and work, but beyond which some 8-year-old girls can go and indeed beyond which they were born. It's the tyranny of talent. Watching this little girl do it, watching her have it, that lays it bare, undeniably evident, extracted from the game like the Higgs boson from those protons.
I asked Venus about this tape, if she remembered it at all. She did, she said (vaguely, I sensed), but in general she tries not to look back, preferring to remain ''at a continuum of moving forward.''
If Braden ever watched the tape, there survives no mention of it. He must have had parents trying to sell him on their little prodigies every day, and even if he had noticed -- as he could not have failed to -- that the girls, especially the older one, possessed the proverbial ''thing that can't be taught,'' there was plenty else in the tape to put him off. The father's boasting (relatively subdued, for this performance) has about it the whiff of slight insanity. The way he keeps mentioning the ''famous by Friday'' business, the way he talks about the girls not as promising youngsters but as celebrities, as princesses, as if he worships his own creation. His Southern accent verges at times on the unintelligible. ''Stay in touch with us,'' spoken pathetically, hopefully, toward the end of the tape, sounds like, ''Stain touch widders.''
Although he has been the subject of excellent profile writing (notably in Sports Illustrated, by S. L. Price and L. Jon Wertheim), Richard Williams remains an eternally elusive and evasive figure. I find him powerfully and movingly American somehow. His whole personality seems to have evolved as a complex reaction-structure to an insecurity so profound that it must remain secret, especially from him. Throughout his daughters' careers, he has gone about fanning a splendor of boxing-promoter language, of lies, half-truths, boasts, misstatements, non sequiturs, buffoonery, needless exaggerations, megalomania, paranoia -- as well as here and there genuinely wise, amusing lines -- all of which, you begin to feel, are designed (subconsciously, yes, but no less shrewdly) to deflect attention away from a still, small center, the place where he dwells and operates. It's there that he is who he is, whoever he is.
He came from a part of Shreveport, Lurr-zeeana, as he pronounces it, in a neighborhood whose school was called, amazingly, Little Hope. At various times he has told reporters or anyone who listened that he was a sports star there in his youth -- and certainly it seems plausible, given his height (6-4-ish) and what we realize to have been present at least in a nascent way in the genes -- but there are no records of these exploits, if they occurred. Perhaps he dreamed them. Perhaps he assigned them to himself the way a great novelist might give them to a character, as a necessary past for the Father of the Williams Sisters. Perhaps (most likely) he needed them in order to be the girls' father, to carry the necessary authority in their eyes. Listen to me, now. I was like you. I was a great athlete, too. That may have been useful.
The source that brings us closest to him, precisely because of its complete lack of objectivity, is an extraordinary documentary made just over a decade ago, ''Raising Tennis Aces: The Williams Story,'' by a black Englishman named Terry Jervis, who himself possesses, from what can be gauged, self-promotional instincts downright Richard Williams-like in aspect. The film is about Richard Williams, mainly, but also done in collusion with him.
Most of it takes place on the grounds of a Florida compound, near where the Williams family relocated in the mid-'90s to hide from the junior playing circuit (Richard's great stroke of genius -- when the other girls were burning themselves out playing the Young Ladies Lipton Cup or what have, his girls were hiding, practicing). In the film, Venus and Serena sit for interviews, under a patio awning, saying their half-meant teenage-athlete phrases, as Richard sits beside them, grim-faced, gripping his thighs, controlling the narrative.
Mainly he is the narrative. We watch him riding around the place on a clay-court-cleaning machine. We meet others -- the family lawyer, the family adviser -- who speak of Richard and his integrity and foresight. We meet, curiously, another man named Richard Williams, a tennis teacher back in Compton, who gave the sisters some of their first extrafamilial lessons. Williams generously acknowledges his influence. A civil rights activist appears, testifying to how hard Richard had it growing up.
We follow him back to Shreveport, where he pays a visit to his childhood home, the place he shared with his sisters and their mother, Julia Mae Williams. His shock at its dilapidation is such that he sits down and cries. He tells the story of his closest childhood friend, killed by a car that was driven by a white woman who barely stopped to see what she'd done. ''She went on her way, gracefully,'' Richard says.
It's not that the story is at all implausible for the South in the '50s. No reason to doubt it. But there's something about Richard's manner. We see him weaving the physical objects of his immediate surroundings into the tale. He puts his hand on a tree in the front yard and says that he planted it after his friend died, because in the wake of that loss, he needed something ''solid.'' But wouldn't the tree have been only a sapling at that time? He says the mere idea of its future growth gave him that solid feeling. But those don't sound like a boy's thoughts. Richard's drive to self-mythologize is total. All must be included, even the trees; all must contribute inevitably to what came later. The trauma of the black Southern past is recast by force of will and audacity, becoming prelude to the glory of the Williams present. ''Venus was born in '80,'' he says, with cryptic syntax, ''but she was . . . taught like a child who was being brought up in the '40s and the '50s, and that's why today if you see Venus and Serena, and we're at a tennis tournament, and you boo us, it doesn't hurt us, because we was taught for things like that many, many years ago, we came up in the '40s and the '50s.''
The mention of ''you boo us'' isn't random. Richard was referring, without mentioning it explicitly, to the notorious incident at Indian Wells, Calif., in 2001, still a recent memory when ''Raising Tennis Aces'' was shot. People argue about exactly what went down that day, but the flash point was that Venus withdrew from a semifinal match against Serena. She didn't feel well enough to play. Tendinitis. It's often reported that she did this with only minutes to go before the match, but in her book (''On the Line,'' a better-than-average entry in the genre of the co-written sports memoir), Serena wrote that Venus had been telling the trainer for hours she didn't think she could do it. That was the protocol: you were supposed to tell the trainer first. But the trainer kept stalling, no doubt hoping she would recover and change her mind. At one point during the day, Venus approached Serena in the locker room and said: ''I really don't know why they're not making some kind of announcement. I told them I couldn't play two hours ago.'' This game of chicken went on until, in the end, the stadium was full. A tournament official came on the loudspeakers and informed the crowd that the match had been canceled. Rumors of match-fixing began to swirl. A day before, the Russian player Elena Dementieva had joked-not-joked that Richard would decide which of his girls went on to the final.
(Just as an aside, I've never bought any of the match-fixing accusations regarding the sisters: yes, their matchups could be weird to watch, sort of hesitating, but is there any mystery to that? They've been playing together, more as practice partners than as opponents, practically since they were babies. Their style of play was about feeding each other, testing each other's strokes, not winning. That dynamic couldn't be changed overnight. Their matches grew in intensity and passion as their careers advanced, just as you would expect. Also, and perhaps most compellingly, the whole idea of Richard asking one of his daughters to lose to the other goes entirely against his style. It would have been more like him to set them against each other to strengthen them.)
Two days later, when the family returned to the court for Serena's match against the big-hitting Belgian Kim Clijsters, the crowd began to boo. Both Richard and Serena assert that they heard the word ''nigger.'' The booing continued throughout the match, which Serena won in a display of all but inexplicable poise -- or really something more like fearsomeness, when you witness it. But the most astonishing and little-remarked moment occurred before the match even started, when Richard and Venus walked down to their seats in the players' box. The booing intensified -- it was Venus, after all, who committed the sin, and Richard whom many despised for his frequently asinine Svengali persona (and darker tendencies too -- reportedly, a couple of years before the Indian Wells fiasco, he hurt his wife, Oracene, the girls' mother and co-trainer, badly enough to break a few of her ribs; Oracene later confirmed the reports; he denied them; either way, the marriage was crumbling just as the girls were making it). He turned and faced the crowd, as if to show them his lack of fear. He said a few things back, you can't hear what. And then he raised his left fist in the air, like John Carlos at the '68 Olympics. He held it there for a few seconds. The look in his face suggests that he did it almost with a kind of irony. Still, the boldness of the gesture stuns. Tennis had never seen anything like that.
In her postmatch remarks, Serena thanked her father for giving her strength, after first thanking, as she almost invariably does, Jehovah God. ''I want to thank those who supported me,'' she added. ''And if you didn't, I love you guys anyway.'' But not so much, as it turned out. It has been more than a decade since that day, and the Williams sisters have never returned to Indian Wells, one of the tour's bigger tournaments.
Richard Williams often receives an undue share of attention in discussions of the Williams sisters, their game and how they got started. Partly this is appropriate: he's their coach. Partly it's because, for many years, he demanded, or at least commanded, that attention with his bizarre pronouncements and antics. But all of this has led to a persistent distortion in the telling of the Williams story, which is, after all, a story of powerful women -- not just Venus and Serena, but the household of women who surrounded and nurtured them.
In the beginning, there were three sisters, none of whose names you may have heard: Yetunde, Isha and Lyndrea. They were Oracene Price's daughters from her first marriage. Oracene became Richard's second wife when they married in 1980. So Richard lived in the house in Compton with four women -- three girls and their mother -- just as he had grown up in Shreveport with three sisters and Julia Mae. He had recreated the dynamic of his childhood home.
When he and Oracene first began to talk and dream about founding some kind of tennis dynasty -- in the oft-heard tale, it happened after Richard watched a women's match on TV and heard that the victor, Virginia Ruzici of Romania, would receive $30,000 for her efforts, just for smacking a ball, as they say -- Richard first taught Oracene to play. He himself had taken up the game not long before, and he quickly became quite good. But Oracene, too, was an athlete. In her youth she played volleyball and played basketball with her brothers (''Till they got bigger than me'').
''It was like a family recreation early on,'' she told me. ''I myself learned to play in a year. I always wanted to learn and to learn the right way, like a professional. And Richard would show everyone my backhand.''
She explained that because she was pregnant with Venus when they first started hitting together, the traditional way of hitting a backhand -- turning to the side and twisting your torso -- didn't feel comfortable for her. ''I would hit the backhand open,'' she said. At the time, the shot was rare and barely existed at all in the women's game. ''I made it into a comfortable stroke. I knew I'd feel better if I was low, and then I'd just whack it.''
At first they began with Oracene's three children. Yetunde, the oldest -- who was shot and killed in 2003 in Compton -- wasn't especially athletic. But Isha, many people believe, could have been the third Williams sister, if not for her back problems, and Lyndrea went on to play at the college level. But although the two girls were good, they weren't great -- perhaps they hadn't been exposed early enough.
With Venus and Serena, Oracene said, ''it's almost like they were raised on the court.'' She remembers Serena as a toddler, off to the side while they played. Oracene noticed early that something was different about their game. ''They still weren't as athletic as me,'' she said -- a thing you learn quickly about Oracene is that she says exactly what she means and never says anything she doesn't mean, to a degree that can be intimidating and even seem aggressive until you realize that it isn't negatively charged, she's just very unto herself -- ''but I did notice one thing: they had a natural swing. That's what I looked for first.'' She didn't elaborate on that, but I knew what she meant -- the pop. It was the unquantifiable kinesiology of the pop. These two new daughters had it. (Richard would later claim that they were engineered for it, by an express and all but eugenical logic -- he saw Oracene's long, powerful gams and thought they would make great legs for a tennis player. Jehovah God knows if these things are true, but unlike the sturdy-tree story, it feels like something he might have thought.)
Richard and Oracene had become uncannily expert, if unavoidably eccentric, tennis coaches and analysts by the time Venus and Serena started hitting. Indeed, behind the minor miracle of there being two tennis virtuosos in this single family with no previous tennis background, there had been the previous miracle of both parents' understanding the game well enough to teach and guide the girls. ''I don't honestly know how that happened,'' Venus told me in Cincinnati. ''It's interesting. I don't know how my parents were able to learn the game so well.''
The story has been told so many times, of these early years, when Compton got used to the sight of the little girls who would always be playing tennis at the public park -- or riding around in their faded yellow VW bus with the middle seat taken out to accommodate the grocery cart full of balls -- but somehow the strangeness and drama of it retain a power to fascinate. The idea of this African-American family organizing itself, as a unit, in order to lay siege to perhaps the whitest sport in the world and pulling it off somehow. ''I remember even talking to my sisters and brothers,'' Oracene said, recalling a time before anyone had ever heard of the Williams sisters, ''and telling them: 'The girls are going to be professional. We're going to need a lawyer, and we're going to need an accountant.' ''
Isha, the middle daughter -- sharply funny and practical, fiercely loyal to the family -- told me: ''Life was get up, 6 o'clock in the morning, go to the tennis court, before school. After school, go to tennis. But it was consistency. I hate to put it [like this], but it's like training an animal. You can't just be sometimey with it.'' She still can't sleep past 6.
''For the most part,'' she said, ''Venus would be on my dad's court, Serena would be on my mom's court, and we'd jump. It was like this rotating system.'' All the sisters agree that Oracene's court was the toughest. Richard liked to play games and goof, but their mother was all business and was matter-of-fact in her criticisms. ''Even now,'' Serena wrote in her book, Oracene is ''one of the best at helping to break down my game.'' In conversation, Isha points out that it's always her mother who goes with Serena to the Australian Open, not her father. ''And she's won the Australian five times.''
Oracene did not grow up a Jehovah's Witness. She belonged to a religious family in Michigan but lacked a church to attend in L.A. Some Witnesses came to her door one day, and she liked their message, with its emphasis on their strict interpretation of the Bible. In 1984, just as Venus and Serena were picking up rackets for the first time, Oracene was baptized and began raising her girls in the faith. Richard never did convert. He read some of the teachings, but he was not and is not a Witness. As much power as he possessed in the family, there remained a kind of inner circle -- of women and faith -- of which he remained outside, which may go some way toward explaining how the girls can both revere him and roll their eyes at him. He's their father, but he's other. Among themselves, the women in the family maintain what Oracene, quoting Colossians, calls ''a perfect bond of union.'' When I spoke with Lyndrea, the youngest of the three older girls (and perhaps the most unforcedly sweet of all the sisters; about Lyn, as they call her, there was nothing forbidding or closed), she was in the car on her way to the Kingdom Hall in Los Angeles to give a talk. And when I asked Isha if the girls ever went around house to house, the way Jehovah's Witnesses do, she said yes, she had been ''out in service'' with Venus and Serena. ''It's a trip, too,'' she said, ''people be blown away.''
It's impossible not to feel that this fierce closeness of the Williams women -- strengthened by their shared faith, with its emphasis on separation from the world -- has had not a little to do with the tremendous psychological stability Venus and Serena have demonstrated over the nearly 17 years of their careers. It's amazing to think, but when this article was first in the planning stages, only a few months ago, it was conceived as a story that would mark the decline of their careers, the beginning of a conversation about their legacy. The word ''retirement'' had begun to appear in discussions of both sisters. This wasn't writing them off; it just seemed like an accurate read of the situation. Venus found out she had Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that often causes severe joint pain, among other symptoms. She'd fallen quite far back in the rankings, because of a lack of match play. The illness dogged her for years, until the doctors finally figured out what was wrong. It had been hard for her to accept that she was sick. ''I spent my whole life playing sports and training and pushing myself to the limits,'' she told me. ''When you get told that you have a disease, it's like: 'Really? Nah, it's all right. I don't believe that. It must be something else, I'm just making an excuse, let me push harder.' '' Serena, meanwhile, had cut a tendon in her foot with a piece of glass, requiring several operations, which led to a pulmonary embolism. She also suffered a giant hematoma, caused by one of the shots she took to prevent another embolism. Naturally their fitness suffered. It seemed, frankly, physically impossible that the sisters would ever regain the tip of the tennis pyramid. A good time to talk about what they had meant to the game, how they had changed it and been changed by it.
But last month, Serena won Wimbledon again. Then she won the Olympic gold medal in women's singles. Then she and Venus (Venus actually playing slightly better than Serena, according to Serena) won gold in women's doubles. The whole thing was a joke, a comedy. The Williams sisters were dominating tennis again. Serena, in her final match, machine-gunned her onetime rival Sharapova off the court so brusquely and efficiently, it looked as if she had an urgent appointment somewhere that she couldn't miss. Venus, in closing out the gold-medal doubles match, hit what she felt was the best shot of her career. Her description of it in Cincinnati was beautiful (it can be hard to get tennis players to talk about their game in an analytical way). ''I did a play that I normally don't do,'' she said. ''Something moved my body.
''Serena was serving from the ad court, and I don't really like to cross, to poach on the ad court, because I usually like to poach when I have a forehand. I'm thinking: I gotta help Serena out, because she always helps me on my serve. I'm not helping her enough.
''All this is going through my head. So my plan is like, I'm gonna go over, but I'm not gonna go too early; I don't want [the other player] to see me. But this is all subconscious almost. The next thing I know, I've left. I don't remember making my body move. I'm just hitting the shot. Now, I have a great one-handed backhand volley. But I hit it two-handed! I don't know what happened. It was like watching myself from above when that happened, and like I feel like, this is the best shot of my whole life.''
I asked Oracene what she felt, watching her daughters reclaim the heights after what they'd been through. ''Honestly?'' she said. ''I reflected on the fact that in the United States, you don't have many players that are doing well. And then you have these two old, black girls, up in age now, and they're still holding up America. That to me was remarkable.'' I thought about it. She was right. There isn't another American right now who's capable of really penetrating at a major. Or maybe, in fairness to Andy Roddick and a couple of other people, it's better to say that there isn't another player whose penetration at a Slam would not make your eyebrows jump. It's just these two girls, these two sisters. They're what America has right now.
I met Serena a couple of weeks ago in Paris, where she spends several months of each year. She lives in a quiet, pretty part of the Seventh Arrondissement, in a beautiful but not ostentatious apartment that she described as ''humble.'' It had black floors and big airy windows that let in the sound of children playing on the sidewalk below. Most of the furniture and art pieces were things she picked up at the outdoor markets in Paris. She showed me a binder full of her plans for the interior design.
There had been some mix-up about the time. I'd stood there buzzing for about 10 minutes. Suddenly the door bolted open. The assistant, I thought, maybe coming down to explain.But it was Serena. In purple spandex workout pants, a white top and sunglasses, her hair natural and a little wild, the way she's wearing it these days.
''You're early,'' she said.
''Really? I thought it was 7.''
''I thought 7:30.''
''I'm happy to hang out for a while.''
''No,'' she said. ''Walk with me.'' She needed something from the pharmacy.
As we walked, she moved back and forth between French and English. Her French was good. Even very good. I had always heard this about the Williams sisters, that they were into languages. But you know how it is with some people -- they take a Berlitz course and tell you they can speak Russian. She was expressing herself in the language, charming the Greek guys in the little takeout joint where we stopped, where she seemed to order one of every dish they had. They couldn't hold sample spoons out to her fast enough. I thought what I'd been thinking for months: that I knew more or less nothing about the Williams sisters. They like it that way, you get the sense. Not many people get very close. This of course warps the perception of them by the public and the media. It feeds the idea to many people that there's something weird and aggressively off-putting about them. They both seem conscious of the trade-off and O.K. with it.
When we returned to her apartment, she asked, ''Do you want a drink drink?'' She had just flown in, and there was nothing in the place but Jack Daniels, which she poured for me on the rocks, showing a nonshowy graciousness I didn't expect. ''That oughta get you going,'' she said with a laugh. She didn't have any herself. (Jehovah's Witnesses are allowed to drink in moderation, but whiskey wasn't part of her training regimen.)
After I moved through the congratulations and the how-are-you-feeling (she showed me the locations of her various scars, including a long and nasty one on her shin), I asked her about Indian Wells. ''I'm not going to ask you if you'll ever go back,'' I said, ''because I know you won't. I just want to know if that's your personal decision or a family decision.''
''It was my decision,'' she said, sounding not so much annoyed as saddened by the subject. The rest of her answer, reproduced here in its entirety, surprised me both with its eloquence and its confidence. It was a woman's answer, not a girl's. And not a diva's. She wasn't trying to be provocative. She was letting her yes be yes and her no be no, the way Oracene had taught her.
''I don't know if my dad said something. But I don't need to go back there. They don't like me. I don't need to be there. If you can boo a teenager, and you can be white and 60 years old, you know what? I'm cool on you. I can understand maybe if they were 20, 15. But like at the French Open, the crowd boos you, but they're young, they're kids, they're a younger crowd. It is what it is. You just know every time you go to Paris, you get booed, but you see so many kids in the crowd. At Indian Wells, everybody goes there when they're retired. It's like Palm Beach. I thought, People like Martin Luther King Jr. boycotted things. And this is nothing on that level. Look at Muhammad Ali, he didn't even play, he went to jail because he didn't want to go to war. The least I can do is stand up for my people and not go there. That's the very least I can do. It's not even that hard of a decision. I get a vacation on those two weeks. It's like the easiest decision of my career. They can penalize me to death, I'm never going back.''
She gave me a bit of a look, as if she were peering over the rims of her glasses, though she wasn't wearing glasses. Something along the lines of, ''Does that answer your question?'' She had a row of books on her shelf, the kind of beige, 19th-century books you find in the stalls along the Seine (which turned out to be where she found them). I asked if she read any of them. ''No, I just bought them for show,'' she said. They were beautiful; they made good décor. One faced out, on the end. It was a biography of Toussaint Louverture, the former slave who led the Haitian revolution near the end of the 18th century. The book's cover had a great old color illustration of him on horseback, brandishing a sword. His blue-and-red coat and gray-black face.
Because she seemed to be handling uncomfortable topics surprisingly well, I moved on to maybe the second-biggest oncourt scandal of her career -- her notorious outburst at a lineswoman who had made a questionable foot-fault call against her during the 2009 U. S. Open. To be fair, the call looked bogus in replay, and Serena has suffered enough bad calls at that tournament -- some that were almost surreally so, including one in a 2004 match against Jennifer Capriati -- to justify a little paranoia. Even so, she went over the line and said things that would have scared the living hell out of me if I'd been in that chair.
''How do you feel about that now?'' I asked.
''I was definitely stressed, and I was angry,'' she said. ''I don't foot-fault. Like, I have in the past, but this woman should never make a call in the semifinals of a Grand Slam on a person who doesn't foot-fault. She was totally wrong. I'm sorry. I'm not sorry. I looked at her like -- I tried to warn her. And then she did it again. And I'm thinking, This is ridiculous.''
''But you admit you went over the top?'' I said.
''What bothered me most was that I was representing my religion. I just felt like anyone who knew I was a Witness was stumbled. And I really don't want to stumble anybody.'' Indeed, Oracene had told me that the Witnesses called Serena in for a dressing-down. ''They had to have a talk with me,'' Serena said. ''And I knew it was coming. I just felt really bad, though, because it's like, that's not who I am.''
''How does that work?'' I asked. ''Were you summoned by a minister?''
''They just talk to you,'' she said. ''They show you Scriptures. Not ministers, they call them elders. It's almost like a reprimand, but it's not bad, because in the Bible it says God loves you, and if someone reprimands you, they love you.''
She went on, talking about how ''every year at the Open something happens. Like last year I got a point penalty because of a grunt. Meanwhile, I can name five girls who grunt way louder than I do, and the umpire didn't even give them a warning. And then I had the ball called out that was this far in. It's always something. I'm thinking, already, something's gonna happen this year at the Open. I'm just thinking, Serena, say your prayers, fall on your knees. It's frustrating, because it's my home country, you're playing for the home, but it's like, the way the umpires have been makes me not want to play there. I'd rather play in Australia, or I'd rather play at Wimbledon.''
The window behind us had an exquisite view of Paris in the twilight. Looking past me, she said: ''I love how the city's all even. I love how you can see the sky. You can't have too many tall buildings. I mean, there are a few, but for the most part, it's Old World. I like it.''
Something about her life there, the little I glimpsed of it -- she had told me how she liked being alone in this place, how she would ''come here just to be around nobody'' and how she liked the way people in this neighborhood didn't make a big deal out of her -- it gave me the sense that she was hiding there. From what, though? From America, probably, a country that couldn't decide if she was a goddess or a threat. And from her father. In the latter case, at least, she had been successful. His energy was nowhere in that apartment. This was what I was seeing, I realized, in meeting both Venus and Serena. They have quietly absconded from his shadow.
Venus had even joked about him in Cincinnati, when I asked her if he was still their coach. She rolled her eyes. ''Sometimes he'll send lengthy e-mails,'' she said. ''Sometimes they're really long, and I don't read them. I get the gist. He's very, very into it. I think he loves it most. Out of all of us, I think he loves tennis most.''
In fact, not even Oracene accompanied the girls to Cincinnati. ''They're probably tired,'' Venus said. ''They say, 'We're over it, we'll stay at home.' '' Her smile had levels I wasn't equipped to explore. It had coyness in it, it had irony in it, it even had some melancholy in it. ''We're on our own,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A New Guide To The Republican Herd

 BODY:
Six years ago, as the Republican Party was headed for a historic electoral drubbing, Republican voters belonged to a number of distinct, boisterous camps: several strains of social conservatives; broad anti-regulation and anti-tax blocs; hawks supporting the Afghan and Iraq wars; moderates who shunned the culture wars.
That motley crowd has morphed into a more unified and even more boisterous one. All are motivated foremost by disgust with the weak economy and an intense dislike of the man presiding over it, President Obama. 
There are still distinct camps, though fewer. They are charted here along a right-to-left continuum of party loyalty, based on the views of several political experts and strategists. The size of the elephant icons approximates the relative strength of each bloc. (Our 2005 G.O.P. chart is online at nytimes.com/ opinion.)
The biggest change, of course, is the arrival of the Tea Party. Although incited by alarm over debt, health care reform and bailouts, the Tea Party is largely in league with a newly monolithic bloc of social conservatives. Both groups share the same broad agenda.Voter unity comes with a price, however. The party suffers from a lopsided lack of diversity compared with the Democratic Party, according to surveys by the Pew Research Center.
Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, after their coronation in Tampa, Fla., hope to have the blocs shown here firmly onboard. Winning over voters outside the tent is their toughest task for the next two months.
Libertarian Voters
WHO The G.O.P.'s odd men out (two-thirds are male), Libertarians are not an easy fit in the party. Like Tea Party supporters, they are pro-business and anti-government, but less religious. They are more affluent and better educated than many Republicans.
STANDARD-BEARERS Ron Paul has been the most visible leader; son Rand occupies the same political ground. But they want government regulation of some private conduct: both oppose almost all abortions; most libertarians do not. Gary Johnson, once a G.O.P. presidential hopeful, is now the Libertarian candidate.
MOTIVATING ISSUES
The economy.
Slash deficit, taxes, regulations; repeal Obamacare.
Privacy rights; abortion rights.
Opposed to the drug war.
Gun owners' rights.
Fiercely isolationist.
THE DISAFFECTED
WHO The most economically wounded bloc, so named by Pew for their skepticism toward both big business and government. The system, they believe, is rigged for the rich. Least loyal to the party, and least likely to vote.
STANDARD-BEARERS They only lean Republican and thus lack similarly minded leaders. Voting for Democrats is unlikely but not impossible.
MOTIVATING ISSUES
The economy.
Concentration of economic power.
Anti-immigration.
Pro-safety net.
Vanishing Breeds
NORTHEAST MODERATES in Congress have dwindled to a handful of vestigial politicians like the retiring Senator Olympia Snowe as voters there have turned more Democratic. Even after the G.O.P. romped in the 2010 election, only 2 out of New England's 22 House districts were in Republican hands.
LIBERALS Hello? Anyone?
TEA PARTY VOTERS
WHO The populist, more radical Tea Party wing has a deep mistrust of experts, elites and even the G.O.P. establishment. Sees issues in stark black and white; has no appetite for compromise. They are conservatives first, Republicans second.
STANDARD-BEARERS Jim DeMint, Grover Norquist, Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin. Paul Ryan, though not in the House Tea Party Caucus, is a rock star.
MOTIVATING ISSUES
The economy.
Culture Warriors: The Great Overlap
There is broad agreement on the top social issues among the three big blocs. As a result, almost all major G.O.P. candidates are strongly anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage.
Slash deficit, taxes, regulations.
Repeal Obamacare.
Anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage.
Anti-environmental regulations.
Gun owners' rights.
Seal the border
MAIN STREET VOTERS
STANDARD-BEARERS Mitt Romney, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, John McCain.
MOTIVATING ISSUES
The economy.
Cut deficit, taxes, regulations.
Repeal Obamacare.
Gun owners' rights.
Anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage.
Pro-energy subsidies.
CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE VOTERS
WHO One bloc, rooted in religion, with two wings that see a decline in American values. Both care more about
their conservative agenda than fealty to the G.O.P.
WHITE EVANGELICAL WING, dominated by Southerners, is perhaps three-quarters of this bloc. Michele Bachmann, Tony Perkins and Mike Huckabee are standard-bearers.
CONSERVATIVE CATHOLIC WING Rick Santorum leads them.
An Endangered Breed
NEOCONSERVATIVES, advocates of a hawkish foreign policy, took a beating in 2006 amid broad opposition to the Iraq war. Their constituency has largely disappeared, but the agenda lives: Mitt Romney is offering an updated version to an electorate now less focused on foreign policy.

HEADLINE: Neil Armstrong 1930-2012: Made 'Giant Leap' as First Man to Step on Moon

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD; John Schwartz contributed reporting. Susan C. Beachy contributed research.

 BODY:
Neil Armstrong, who made the ''giant leap for mankind'' as the first human to set foot on the moon, died on Saturday. He was 82.
His family said in a statement that the cause was ''complications resulting from cardiovascular procedures.'' He had undergone heart bypass surgery this month in Cincinnati, near where he lived. His recovery had been going well, according to those who spoke with him after the surgery, and his death came as a surprise to many close to him, including his fellow Apollo astronauts. The family did not say where he died.
A quiet, private man, at heart an engineer and crack test pilot, Mr. Armstrong made history on July 20, 1969, as the commander of the Apollo 11 spacecraft on the mission that culminated the Soviet-American space race in the 1960s. President John F. Kennedy had committed the nation ''to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth.'' It was done with more than five months to spare. 
On that day, Mr. Armstrong and his co-pilot, Col. Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., known as Buzz, steered their lunar landing craft, Eagle, to a level, rock-strewn plain near the southwestern shore of the Sea of Tranquillity. It was touch and go the last minute or two, with computer alarms sounding and fuel running low. But they made it.
''Houston, Tranquillity Base here,'' Mr. Armstrong radioed to mission control. ''The Eagle has landed.''
''Roger, Tranquillity,'' mission control replied. ''We copy you on the ground. You've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.''
The same could have been said for hundreds of millions of people around the world watching on television.
A few hours later, there was Mr. Armstrong bundled in a white spacesuit and helmet on the ladder of the landing craft. Planting his feet on the lunar surface, he said, ''That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.'' (His words would become the subject of a minor historical debate, as to whether he said ''man'' or an indistinct ''a man.'')
Soon Colonel Aldrin joined Mr. Armstrong, bounding like kangaroos in the low lunar gravity, one sixth that of Earth's, while the command ship pilot, Michael Collins, remained in orbit about 60 miles overhead, waiting their return. In all, 12 American astronauts walked on the moon between then and the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.
The Apollo 11 mission capped a tumultuous and consequential decade. The '60s in America had started with such promise, with the election of a youthful president, mixed with the ever-present anxieties of the cold war. Then it touched greatness in the civil rights movement, only to implode in the years of assassinations and burning city streets and campus riots. But before it ended, human beings had reached that longtime symbol of the unreachable.
The moonwalk lasted 2 hours and 19 minutes, long enough to let the astronauts test their footing in the fine and powdery surface -- Mr. Armstrong noted that his boot print was less than an inch deep -- and set up a television camera and scientific instruments and collect rock samples.
After news of Mr. Armstrong's death was reported, President Obama, in a statement from the White House, said, ''Neil was among the greatest of American heroes.''
''And when Neil stepped foot on the surface of the moon for the first time,'' the president added, ''he delivered a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten.''
Charles F. Bolden Jr., the current NASA administrator, said, ''As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own.''
Mr. Bolden also noted that in the years after the moonwalk, Mr. Armstrong ''carried himself with a grace and humility that was an example to us all.'' The historian Douglas Brinkley, who interviewed Mr. Armstrong for a NASA oral history, described him as ''our nation's most bashful Galahad.'' His family called him ''a reluctant hero who always believed he was just doing his job.''
Indeed, some space officials have cited these characteristics, as well as his engineering skills and experience piloting X-15 rocket planes, as reasons that Mr. Armstrong stood out in the astronaut corps. After the post-flight parades and a world tour for the three Apollo 11 astronauts, Mr. Armstrong gradually withdrew from the public eye. He was not reclusive, but as much as possible he sought to lead a private life, first as an associate administrator in the space program, then as a university professor and director of a number of corporations.
Neil Alden Armstrong was born on Aug. 5, 1930, in the small town of Wapakoneta, Ohio, to Stephen Armstrong and the former Viola Louise Engel. His father was a state auditor, which meant the family moved every few years to a new Ohio town while Neil was growing up. At the age of 6, Neil and his father took a ride in a Ford Trimotor airplane, known as the Tin Goose. It must have made an impression, for by the time he was 15, he had learned to fly, even before he got his driver's license.
Neil became an Eagle Scout when the family later moved back to Wapakoneta, where he finished high school. (The town now has a museum named for Mr. Armstrong.) From there, he went to Purdue University as an engineering student on a Navy scholarship. His college years were interrupted by the Korean War, in which Mr. Armstrong was a Navy fighter pilot who flew 78 combat missions, one in which he was forced to eject after the plane lost one of its ailerons, the hinged flight-control panels on the wings.
In ''First Man: The Life of Neil Armstrong,'' James R. Hansen wrote that in Mr. Armstrong's first year at Purdue, Charles E. Yeager broke the sound barrier in the rocket-powered Bell X-1. It was exciting but bittersweet for the young student. He thought aviation history had already passed him by.
''All in all, for someone who was immersed in, fascinated by, and dedicated to flight,'' Mr. Armstrong told his biographer, ''I was disappointed by the wrinkle in history that had brought me along one generation late. I had missed all the great times and adventures in flight.''
During the Korean War, Mr. Armstrong was in the unit that the author James A. Michener wrote of in ''The Bridges at Toko-Ri.'' Back at Purdue after the Navy, Mr. Armstrong plunged more earnestly into aeronautical engineering studies, his grades rising and a career in sight.
By this time, he had also met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, a student in home economics from Evanston, Ill. Soon after his graduation, they were married, in January 1956.
They had two sons, Eric and Mark, who survive. A daughter, Karen, died of an inoperable brain tumor in 1962. The couple were divorced in 1994; Janet Armstrong lives in Utah. In 1999, Mr. Armstrong married Carol Knight, a widow 15 years his junior; she also survives. They lived in Indian Hill, a suburb of Cincinnati.
Other survivors include a stepson and stepdaughter; a brother, Dean; a sister, June Armstrong Hoffman, and 10 grandchildren.
After his first marriage, the newlyweds moved to California, where Mr. Armstrong had been hired as an experimental test pilot for the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, the forerunner of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, at Edwards Air Force Base. His first flight in a rocket plane was in the Bell X-1B, a successor to the plane Mr. Yeager had first flown faster than the speed of sound.
Mr. Armstrong impressed his peers. Milt Thompson, one of the test pilots, said he was ''the most technically capable of the early X-15 pilots.'' Another colleague, Bill Dana, said he ''had a mind that absorbed things like a sponge and a memory that remembered them like a photograph.'' He made seven X-15 flights at 4,000 miles per hour, reaching the edge of space, and piloted many more of the most innovative and dangerous aircraft ever developed.
In 1958, Mr. Armstrong was chosen as a consultant for a military space plane project, the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and was later named one of the pilots. But the young test pilot was attracted by another opportunity. NASA was receiving applications for the second group of astronauts, after the Mercury Seven. His reputation after seven years at the NASA flight center at Edwards had preceded him, and so he was tapped for the astronaut corps.
''I thought the attractions of being an astronaut were actually, not so much the Moon, but flying in a completely new medium,'' Mr. Armstrong told his biographer.
At Houston, the new astronaut began training for flights in the two-person Gemini spacecraft, the successor to the smaller Mercury capsules and forerunner to the three-person Apollos. Mr. Armstrong became the first American civilian astronaut to fly in space, as commander of Gemini 8. He and his co-pilot, David R. Scott, were launched on March 16, 1966. They performed the first successful docking of two vehicles in space, their Gemini linking with an unmanned Agena in an essential test for later operations on lunar flights.
Once docked, however, the joined spacecraft began to roll. Attempts to steady the vehicle were unavailing. On instructions from Mission Control, Mr. Armstrong separated Gemini from the Agena, but the rolling only increased, to the point that the astronauts were in danger of passing out. The problem was evidently in the Gemini itself. The astronauts turned the control thrusters off, switching to the re-entry control system. Stability was restored, but once the re-entry propulsion was activated, the crew was told to prepare to come home before the end of their only day in orbit.
Next, Mr. Armstrong was the backup commander for Apollo 8, the first flight to circumnavigate the Moon, doing so at Christmastime in 1968. It was the mission that put Apollo back on track after a cockpit fire during a launching pad rehearsal had killed three astronauts in January 1967. And it put Mr. Armstrong in position to command Apollo 11.
If everything went well with the lunar module test on Apollo 9 and with a shakedown flight to lunar orbit on Apollo 10, then Mr. Armstrong was in line to land on the Moon with Buzz Aldrin and with Michael Collins as the command module pilot. As the commander, NASA officials decided, Mr. Armstrong would be the first to walk on the Moon.
About six and a half hours after the landing, Mr. Armstrong opened the hatch of the four-legged lunar module and slowly made his way down the ladder to the lunar surface. A television camera followed his every step for all the world to see. A crater near the landing site is named in Mr. Armstrong's honor.
Mr. Armstrong and Colonel Aldrin left a plaque on the Moon that read: ''Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon. July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.''
After leaving the space program, Mr. Armstrong was careful to do nothing to tarnish that image or achievement. Though he traveled and gave speeches -- as he did in October 2007, when he dedicated the new Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering at Purdue -- he rarely gave interviews and avoided the spotlight.
In the biography ''First Man,'' Dr. Hansen noted, ''Everyone gives Neil the greatest credit for not trying to take advantage of his fame, not like other astronauts have done.'' To which Janet Armstrong responded: ''Yes, but look what it's done to him inside. He feels guilty that he got all the acclaim for an effort of tens of thousands of people.'' Then she added: ''He's certainly led an interesting life. But he took it too seriously to heart.''
For a time, he was an associate NASA administrator for aeronautics, but he tired of a Washington desk job. Ignoring many high-level offers in business and academia, he returned to Ohio as a professor of aeronautical engineering at the University of Cincinnati and bought a farm near Lebanon, Ohio. He also served as a director for several corporations.
''He remained an advocate of aviation and exploration throughout his life and never lost his boyhood wonder of these pursuits,'' his family said in the statement.
Mr. Armstrong re-entered the public spotlight a couple of years ago to voice sharp disagreement with President Obama for canceling NASA's program to send astronauts back to the Moon. Later, he testified to a Senate committee, expressing skepticism that the approach of relying on commercial companies would succeed.
Last September, Mr. Armstrong testified to a House committee that NASA ''must find ways of restoring hope and confidence to a confused and disconsolate work force.''
Almost as soon as the news of his death was announced, there was an outpouring of well wishes and fond memorials on Web sites and social media, a reflection of the extraordinary public acclaim that came to a very private man.
''As much as Neil cherished his privacy, he always appreciated the expressions of good will from people around the world and from all walks of life,'' his family said. ''While we mourn the loss of a very good man, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true, to be willing to explore and push the limits, and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves.''

 BODY:
AL GORE lives alone now, in a 10,000-square-foot colonial in Nashville, where magnolia trees shade the house and geothermal wells, buried beneath the driveway, cool and heat its 20 rooms.
Some weeks Mr. Gore heads to San Francisco, where he has a luxury apartment at the St. Regis tower, to work on venture capital projects or visit his new girlfriend. And some nights he checks into the Regency in New York, where three of his children live.
At 64, even after accumulating more than $100 million in wealth, Mr. Gore races like a man making up for lost time: blog posts to write, business deals to close, a global climate to save.
Tipper Gore lives alone now, too, and at a gentler pace -- the pace she wanted when the Gores separated in June 2010. 
She divides her time between their $9 million seaside villa near Santa Barbara, Calif., and her maternal family home in Arlington, Va., near her 89-year-old father. She, too, is in New York often and is also working (selling her photography through her Web site) and dating someone new.
The couple reunites a few times a year, most recently in June, for summer family vacations and Christmases in the Gore family seat of Carthage, Tenn.
They gather at the old farm and lake where Mr. Gore's father, a congressman and senator, had once dreamed about his son becoming president. Back then the Gores had the makings of a political dynasty, and the paterfamilias, Albert Gore Sr., certainly held that ambition.
But hard times happen. Reckonings occur. And dynasties require both continuity and a next generation. The four Gore children, having been raised in the hothouse of Washington, want nothing to do with it.
The oldest, Karenna Gore Schiff, an adviser to Mr. Gore during his 2000 presidential campaign, has struggled with personal troubles and is rebuilding her life after a separation from her husband. Kristin Gore weathered a divorce in 2009 and has found success as a novelist. Albert III, known mostly for youthful indiscretions with alcohol and marijuana, is an executive working on urban renewal. And Sarah, once in medical school, is now an artist and married in California.
No family member has moved on from the political world more than Al Gore, who, according to interviews with more than 40 family friends and associates, is mostly at peace these days with losing the presidency in 2000.
Several friends have even heard him muse about whether he would have gone into politics if not for his father; he might have continued his early career as a journalist, or become a professor.
As for rubbing shoulders with the Washington elite, it is so unappealing that Mr. Gore has chosen to skip the Democratic Party convention in Charlotte, N.C., and will instead spend the next two weeks on his cable channel, Current TV, leading the coverage of both major-party conventions from New York.
Offering color commentary in a television studio is a lifetime away from another August convention, just 12 years ago, just before the decline and fall of the House of Gore began. But for Mr. Gore, Current TV is about living in the present; the cut and thrust of politics is the past.
Still, several of his friends expect that on the final night of the Charlotte convention, as the other talking heads squawk to be heard, Mr. Gore's mind will wander back to another stage in another city.
THEY looked like the perfect American family. It was Aug. 17, 2000, and Vice President Al Gore had just accepted his party's presidential nomination at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Under red, white and blue confetti, Mr. Gore's purposeful poise melted away as he spotted Tipper entering from the wings. He strode over and gave her a deep, long, passionate kiss, their second in prime time that night.
The media made much of ''The Kiss,'' given Mr. Gore's usual stiffness, but friends of the couple simply saw classic Al and Tipper, the eternal lovestruck teenagers, who first locked eyes at his high school prom and had been swooning ever since.
Moments later their children appeared on stage. Sarah, the youngest, tapped Mr. Gore's back and threw her arms around him. Kristin, the middle daughter, beamed at their side. Albert, then in high school, went to Tipper, as he often did.
Hanging back a bit and waving to the delegates was Karenna, who by then had a political orbit of her own as a campaign adviser; some Gore aides saw her as the most primed to follow in the family business.
It was a Gore tableau worthy of framing: smiling, attractive, united. Theirs was a bond that would help them recover from the heartbreak of George W. Bush taking the oath of office. A bond that inspired Al and Tipper Gore, in 2002, to publish a book about family titled ''Joined at the Heart.'' A bond, as they wrote in that book's dedication, that they prayed would never be broken.
The bond endures, but the marital separation of Mr. and Mrs. Gore, and their desire to let go of electoral politics, have ended their role as a storied political family that figured in every presidential election from 1988 to 2008.
While Mr. Gore has never ruled out running again for president, close friends say that he has no desire to run and cannot conceive of another campaign. The main reason, they say, is that his devotion to environmental advocacy, which brought him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, has sharpened his own outlook on what he wants to do with his life.
Such perspective has been a long time coming for Mr. Gore. He was raised in the Washington power circles of his father and his political savvy mother, Pauline, then studied at the university of princelings -- Harvard -- and later attended Vanderbilt Law School, fulfilling a hope of his parents.
He dropped out to run for Congress, also at his parents' encouragement. He ran for president in 1988, even though he was known as a policy wonk who disdained the pettiness of politics. And in 2000 he ran and lost again, a crushing blow, but one that finally led to a life and career that he, and not his parents, wished for.
''Al Gore loved policy but he never really liked campaigning, making phone calls to donors, all the things you have to do running for office,'' said Tony Coehlo, who was chairman of Mr. Gore's presidential campaign in 2000. ''He was set on a course to the presidency at a very young age, by this father, and he came to appreciate public office. But politics and governing were foremost a family inheritance for him.''
Mr. Gore began to make peace with a life out of politics in 2002, when he decided not to challenge George W. Bush in 2004 -- a decision that Mr. Gore thought was sensible but also painful, friends say. Losing the presidency in 2000 had induced a kind of post-traumatic stress syndrome in him and other family members; some of the children had nightmares and anxiety dreams involving that campaign. Running for the White House again, Mr. Gore thought, might just prolong the pain and put off the possibility of catharsis and a state of grace.
He dealt with the trauma not by conducting a shadow presidency in his imagination; rather, at first, he grew a beard, ate too much and got fat, then found new ventures and preoccupations. He is not temperamentally inclined to walk around the house in a rage about the rightness of his policy prescriptions; he is more introverted, more of a brooder than a yeller, more likely to get lost in arcane data on the Internet.
If pressed, he uses gallows humor to deal with the pain, referring to himself as a ''recovering politician'' and saying he ''used to be the next president of the United States.'' Another joke, a bit more wistful and a bit closer to the bone, comes when people tell him that he would have governed differently than Mr. Bush. Mr. Gore usually replies, ''You know what: I would have just made different mistakes.''
A close friend of Mr. Gore's noted: ''I doubt he'll ever be totally-every-day-at-peace with losing in 2000. But he doesn't rant about the way he would have run the country. He doesn't let his anger take priority over his policy obsessions, where he still believes he can make a difference. What has helped him the most, I think, is that he is utterly convinced of two things: that he has finally found his true calling in life, and that he is finally free to be his own man.''
Redemption is the word used by Donna Brazile, Mr. Gore's campaign manager in the 2000 race.
''The story of Al Gore is that, whenever he is knocked around -- in '88, in 2000, at other moments in his life -- he has gotten back up because he believes in himself,'' Ms. Brazile said. ''His parents dreamed about him becoming president. He never won the White House, but he went on to find redemption with the Nobel for the work he cares most about.''
The last dozen years have also brought Mr. Gore enormous wealth from his roles as an adviser to Google, a board member at Apple and an investment partner at Kleiner Perkins, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. His net worth is believed to be more than $100 million .
Mostly splitting his time between Nashville and the three-bedroom 2,800-square-foot apartment at the St. Regis, Mr. Gore still spends hours most days on writing (he has a book set to come out in early 2013 on global economics and politics) and consulting about policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Just last week he helped train a San Francisco conference of 1,000 environmental advocates on spreading the word about the effects of climate change.
It was Tipper who, after the 2000 loss, encouraged Mr. Gore to dust off an old slide show he assembled years earlier on climate change and begin showing it to concerned citizens. His zeal grew so great that he started a nonprofit organization, now known as the Climate Reality Project, and evolved ''from a politician into a prophet,'' said Robert Shrum, another Gore friend and adviser from 2000.
Prophets can be scolds, of course, but Mr. Gore has mostly kept away from the bully pulpit so that caricatures of him as a partisan loon do not overshadow his policy concerns, friends say.
When he has sallied forth on climate change in a high-profile way, he has tried to take on members of both parties, as he did in a Rolling Stone article last year that sharply assailed the Obama White House, as well as Republicans. Friends of Mr. Gore say that he remains on good terms with President Obama, but that, from a policy perspective, the relationship is not as robust as Mr. Gore had hoped.
As for America's other reigning Democratic family, the Clintons, Mr. Gore and President Clinton began mending fences damaged by the 2000 campaign during time they spent together immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks.
They occasionally talk by phone or make an effort to see each other, friends say. Mr. Clinton spent a few hours with Mr. Gore at the Nashville house last year at the time of the funeral of Ned McWherter, a former governor of Tennessee, and they caught up last fall at a memorial service for Steve Jobs.
Mr. Gore has also spoken a couple of times to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on environmental issues, though the conversations were informal and Mr. Gore has not been involved in policy-making.
''The families aren't as close as they once were,'' a friend of Mr. and Mrs. Gore said. ''They all have other lives now. But there is a bond there that is meaningful to all of them as they get older.''
LEAVING the political stage invariably made it easier for Mr. and Mrs. Gore to separate. If the couple were still involved in politics, they probably would not have split up, several friends said. Politics prizes picture-perfect nuclear families; the Gores, in turn, felt free to pursue independent lives as their priorities diverged.
The decision to separate was mutual and did not involve a betrayal like infidelity, according to friends. Rather, they said, the 64-year-old Mrs. Gore had wanted their lives to ease up, more time to enjoy the fruits of their labors. (The Gores and their children declined to be interviewed for this article.)
In 2009, a year before the separation, they bought the Italian-style villa in Montecito, Calif., where Mrs. Gore hoped they would spend far more time relaxing and working on projects. Mrs. Gore also became increasingly passionate about her landscape and portrait photography, which, until recently, she had been selling at stores owned by her friends Mitchell Gold and Bob Williams.
Mr. Gold first met Mrs. Gore at a gay rights organization dinner in 2002, and a year later went to Arlington to help with her home makeover there. He encouraged her to hang several of her photos, which had been stored away in boxes, and later began holding small exhibits of her work in his stores.
In the spring of 2010 her photos went on sale in the stores, and he and Mr. Williams held a reception for her in Washington; Mr. Gold said that Mr. Gore did not attend the event, which was around the time that the Gores were preparing to announce their separation.
''Tipper wants a much more quiet life for herself -- we had to push her a little bit to put her photography on sale -- and I think she has found that now,'' Mr. Gold said. ''Her life, I think, is centered around being happy in life, being happy with her family and her photography and Santa Barbara.''
But for Mr. Gore, even winning the Nobel (as well as the Academy Award honor for the climate-change documentary ''An Inconvenient Truth'') was not enough for him to slow down. A workaholic since his days in politics, Mr. Gore's professional interests now include Current TV -- which he and his partners have struggled to turn into a leading news operation -- as well as Apple, Google, various ventures run out of offices in Silicon Valley and Mr. Gore's London-based Generation Investment Management.
He is traveling constantly, to conclaves at the Aspen Institute and speaking and consulting engagements overseas; last winter he led a trip to Antarctica under the auspices of the Climate Reality Project that included the British businessman Richard Branson, Ted Turner and several scientists.
''Al obsesses about what the world will end up becoming,'' said one friend of the Gores, ''and I know that was tiring for Tipper to be around. Al never really unplugs and just enjoys himself. He seems wired to always be thinking about what he could potentially do to save the world.''
A Democratic Party donor close to Mr. Gore, Orin Kramer, recalled attending a volunteer-training session a few years ago for Climate Reality, where he expected Mr. Gore to warm up the audience with a half-hour presentation of the environmental slide show that formed the basis for ''An Inconvenient Truth.''
''He stood up there on-and-off for eight hours, going through the slides, with the kind of intensity you'd expect if he was giving the slide show for the very first time,'' Mr. Kramer said. ''He doesn't adhere to anything close to a 40-hour workweek.''
Mr. Gore does do some fund-raising for longtime Democratic friends from time to time; he spoke not long ago at a Silicon Valley cocktail party for Florida Senator Bill Nelson, running for re-election this year.
''Gore has a new group of friends in the tech industry, Silicon Valley, from business ventures, who are less interested in politics than they are very, very loyal to him,'' said an adviser to Senator Nelson who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
There are few conspicuous examples of Mr. Gore's new wealth, beyond the Montecito villa and the St. Regis apartment. For all his traveling, Mr. Gore does not lease a plane; he flies commercially more than on corporate jets, often taking the budget airline Southwest to Nashville.
He did spend lavishly on his daughter Sarah's wedding (a guest recalled a wall at the reception covered with fresh roses), and he is said to be generous with relatives and staff members.
At the same time he has not become a big entertainer; several friends said that while he likes people dropping by the Nashville home, he does not have parties there or at the St. Regis. He does seem to have loosened up, though.
''The last time I saw Gore at the Regency, I was struck by how incredibly relaxed he looked,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who now has a talk show on MSNBC. ''He said to me, 'Who would have ever thought that Al Sharpton would be skinny and have a TV show?' And I said, 'Who would have ever thought Al Gore would have gotten chubby and own a TV channel?' That got a belly laugh out of him. He wasn't always that casual.''
IN their new lives, both Gores have also begun dating other people. Mr. Gore has been seeing a fellow environmental advocate and Democratic Party donor, Elizabeth Keadle, who lives in California, while Mrs. Gore has been seeing a fellow photographer and former editor of National Geographic, Bill Allen.
(Mr. Gore was in the news in 2010 over sexual harassment allegations made by a massage therapist in Oregon; Mr. Gore denied the claims. A county district attorney later announced that there was no basis for prosecution, citing contradictory evidence, lack of forensic evidence, conflicting witness statements and credibility issues.)
When Mr. and Mrs. Gore have come together again, it mostly has to do with their children. Last summer, for instance, they both showed up to a book party in Washington for their daughter Kristin.
Mrs. Gore arrived first -- punctuality is very important to her, Mr. Gold said -- and she reacted playfully when Mr. Gore showed up. ''Hi, honey!'' she called out in an exaggerated Southern twang, according to two guests. The two later chatted and posed for photos with their daughter.
''Tipper and Al may live in different parts of the country, and may be very happy with their own lives these days, but the children always bring them together,'' said Christine Leverone Orrall, a friend of the Gores in Nashville. ''I think they're showing how you can be happy and healthy apart while still focusing on their children and their life together as a family.''
Kristin, Karenna, and Albert -- who is now a business development executive at a real estate management firm -- all live in New York. Both their parents often visit the city, particularly to help Karenna Gore Schiff, the mother of three young children, in the aftermath of her separation in 2010 from Drew Schiff, a doctor.
Friends of Ms. Gore Schiff say that she has endured personal problems before and since the separation, and that her parents have helped boost her mood and have been an essential part of her support network. Ms. Gore Schiff and Dr. Schiff have an amicable joint custody arrangement, and she is said to be doing better these days.
Of the four children, Ms. Gore Schiff, a Columbia Law School graduate, had by far the highest public profile -- and of the four, questions have swirled the most around her, given her far lower profile today. There was talk over the years about her running for political office, but several friends of Ms. Gore Schiff said that her focus now was on raising her children and rebuilding her personal life. They also noted that her interests, like her father's, had shifted from the old family turf of elective politics.
''Karenna got very caught up with the 2000 race, seeing herself as one of the best messengers for her father, and she inserted herself with a pretty heavy hand into the politics and the policy,'' said one senior official on the 2000 Gore campaign who worked with her regularly. ''The vice president trusted her and appreciated her, especially when she took on events that Tipper was less inclined to do. A lot of us thought Karenna had the bug for public office, though her personality could be so intense, I'm not sure if that would wear well as a candidate herself.''
Ms. Gore Schiff is now a master's degree student at the Union Theological Seminary (her father was in divinity school before law school), and she is heavily involved with the Association to Benefit Children, a New York-based nonprofit, where she is now a board member. Tom Styron, the group's chairman, said that Ms. Gore Schiff and another board member, former Mayor David Dinkins, handled most of the outreach to elected officials and government agencies.
''Karenna and the mayor are usually our go-to people in terms of figuring out how to use political capital for our cause,'' said Dr. Styron, a clinical psychologist on the Yale Medical School faculty and son of the author William Styron.
''She is also a very private person, very protective of her family and her children,'' Dr. Styron said. ''To the extent that she has gone through difficult times personally, she keeps that to herself, while taking her responsibilities very seriously.''
The Gore family's move away from politics is a rare one, said Stephen Hess, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who has written extensively about American political dynasties. In recent decades, government has been replete with fathers and mothers and their grown children and grandchildren coming in and out of elected office. In the Gores, Mr. Hess sees a family that was set on a path to power by a patriarch, Albert Gore Sr., that his son and grandchildren took years to make a clean break from.
''I sometimes think that Al Gore would never have gone into politics if his father had not been a politician himself,'' Mr. Hess said. ''It makes you wonder about our political dynasties, and how many of them are defined by a love of service and how many are kept in place because the younger generations feel an obligation.''
Friends of the Gores are quick to point out that Al Gore was hardly unhappy as a congressman, senator or vice president, and that, for nearly 25 years, he and Mrs. Gore made the most of their lives in the Washington spotlight. Still, these friends said that the Gores now seem as content as they have ever been.
''Al and Tipper were the happily married couple of American politics for 30 years,'' Mr. Coehlo said. ''They packaged themselves that way for political consumption, and now they have unpackaged that image in the interest of their own happiness.
''They are still a family, but they have become the kind of family that they want to be.''

 BODY:
AL GORE lives alone now, in a 10,000-square-foot colonial in Nashville, where magnolia trees shade the house and geothermal wells, buried beneath the driveway, cool and heat its 20 rooms.
Some weeks Mr. Gore heads to San Francisco, where he has a luxury apartment at the St. Regis tower, to work on venture capital projects or visit his new girlfriend. And some nights he checks into the Regency in New York, where three of his children live.

What has helped him the most, I think, is that he is utterly convinced of two things: that he has finally found his true calling in life, and that he is finally free to be his own man.''
Redemption is the word used by Donna Brazile, Mr. Gore's campaign manager in the 2000 race.
''The story of Al Gore is that, whenever he is knocked around -- in '88, in 2000, at other moments in his life -- he has gotten back up because he believes in himself,'' Ms. Brazile said. ''His parents dreamed about him becoming president. He never won the White House, but he went on to find redemption with the Nobel for the work he cares most about.''
The last dozen years have also brought Mr. Gore enormous wealth from his roles as an adviser to Google, a board member at Apple and an investment partner at Kleiner Perkins, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. His net worth is believed to be more than $100 million .
Mostly splitting his time between Nashville and the three-bedroom 2,800-square-foot apartment at the St. Regis, Mr. Gore still spends hours most days on writing (he has a book set to come out in early 2013 on global economics and politics) and consulting about policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Just last week he helped train a San Francisco conference of 1,000 environmental advocates on spreading the word about the effects of climate change.
It was Tipper who, after the 2000 loss, encouraged Mr. Gore to dust off an old slide show he assembled years earlier on climate change and begin showing it to concerned citizens. His zeal grew so great that he started a nonprofit organization, now known as the Climate Reality Project, and evolved ''from a politician into a prophet,'' said Robert Shrum, another Gore friend and adviser from 2000.
Prophets can be scolds, of course, but Mr. Gore has mostly kept away from the bully pulpit so that caricatures of him as a partisan loon do not overshadow his policy concerns, friends say.
When he has sallied forth on climate change in a high-profile way, he has tried to take on members of both parties, as he did in a Rolling Stone article last year that sharply assailed the Obama White House, as well as Republicans. Friends of Mr. Gore say that he remains on good terms with President Obama, but that, from a policy perspective, the relationship is not as robust as Mr. Gore had hoped.
As for America's other reigning Democratic family, the Clintons, Mr. Gore and President Clinton began mending fences damaged by the 2000 campaign during time they spent together immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks.
They occasionally talk by phone or make an effort to see each other, friends say. Mr. Clinton spent a few hours with Mr. Gore at the Nashville house last year at the time of the funeral of Ned McWherter, a former governor of Tennessee, and they caught up last fall at a memorial service for Steve Jobs.
Mr. Gore has also spoken a couple of times to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on environmental issues, though the conversations were informal and Mr. Gore has not been involved in policy-making.
''The families aren't as close as they once were,'' a friend of Mr. and Mrs. Gore said. ''They all have other lives now. But there is a bond there that is meaningful to all of them as they get older.''
LEAVING the political stage invariably made it easier for Mr. and Mrs. Gore to separate. If the couple were still involved in politics, they probably would not have split up, several friends said. Politics prizes picture-perfect nuclear families; the Gores, in turn, felt free to pursue independent lives as their priorities diverged.
The decision to separate was mutual and did not involve a betrayal like infidelity, according to friends. Rather, they said, the 64-year-old Mrs. Gore had wanted their lives to ease up, more time to enjoy the fruits of their labors. (The Gores and their children declined to be interviewed for this article.)
In 2009, a year before the separation, they bought the Italian-style villa in Montecito, Calif., where Mrs. Gore hoped they would spend far more time relaxing and working on projects. Mrs. Gore also became increasingly passionate about her landscape and portrait photography, which, until recently, she had been selling at stores owned by her friends Mitchell Gold and Bob Williams.
Mr. Gold first met Mrs. Gore at a gay rights organization dinner in 2002, and a year later went to Arlington to help with her home makeover there. He encouraged her to hang several of her photos, which had been stored away in boxes, and later began holding small exhibits of her work in his stores.
In the spring of 2010 her photos went on sale in the stores, and he and Mr. Williams held a reception for her in Washington; Mr. Gold said that Mr. Gore did not attend the event, which was around the time that the Gores were preparing to announce their separation.
''Tipper wants a much more quiet life for herself -- we had to push her a little bit to put her photography on sale -- and I think she has found that now,'' Mr. Gold said. ''Her life, I think, is centered around being happy in life, being happy with her family and her photography and Santa Barbara.''
But for Mr. Gore, even winning the Nobel (as well as the Academy Award honor for the climate-change documentary ''An Inconvenient Truth'') was not enough for him to slow down. A workaholic since his days in politics, Mr. Gore's professional interests now include Current TV -- which he and his partners have struggled to turn into a leading news operation -- as well as Apple, Google, various ventures run out of offices in Silicon Valley and Mr. Gore's London-based Generation Investment Management.
He is traveling constantly, to conclaves at the Aspen Institute and speaking and consulting engagements overseas; last winter he led a trip to Antarctica under the auspices of the Climate Reality Project that included the British businessman Richard Branson, Ted Turner and several scientists.
''Al obsesses about what the world will end up becoming,'' said one friend of the Gores, ''and I know that was tiring for Tipper to be around. Al never really unplugs and just enjoys himself. He seems wired to always be thinking about what he could potentially do to save the world.''
A Democratic Party donor close to Mr. Gore, Orin Kramer, recalled attending a volunteer-training session a few years ago for Climate Reality, where he expected Mr. Gore to warm up the audience with a half-hour presentation of the environmental slide show that formed the basis for ''An Inconvenient Truth.''
''He stood up there on-and-off for eight hours, going through the slides, with the kind of intensity you'd expect if he was giving the slide show for the very first time,'' Mr. Kramer said. ''He doesn't adhere to anything close to a 40-hour workweek.''
Mr. Gore does do some fund-raising for longtime Democratic friends from time to time; he spoke not long ago at a Silicon Valley cocktail party for Florida Senator Bill Nelson, running for re-election this year.
''Gore has a new group of friends in the tech industry, Silicon Valley, from business ventures, who are less interested in politics than they are very, very loyal to him,'' said an adviser to Senator Nelson who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
There are few conspicuous examples of Mr. Gore's new wealth, beyond the Montecito villa and the St. Regis apartment. For all his traveling, Mr. Gore does not lease a plane; he flies commercially more than on corporate jets, often taking the budget airline Southwest to Nashville.
He did spend lavishly on his daughter Sarah's wedding (a guest recalled a wall at the reception covered with fresh roses), and he is said to be generous with relatives and staff members.
At the same time he has not become a big entertainer; several friends said that while he likes people dropping by the Nashville home, he does not have parties there or at the St. Regis. He does seem to have loosened up, though.
''The last time I saw Gore at the Regency, I was struck by how incredibly relaxed he looked,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who now has a talk show on MSNBC. ''He said to me, 'Who would have ever thought that Al Sharpton would be skinny and have a TV show?' And I said, 'Who would have ever thought Al Gore would have gotten chubby and own a TV channel?' That got a belly laugh out of him. He wasn't always that casual.''
IN their new lives, both Gores have also begun dating other people. Mr. Gore has been seeing a fellow environmental advocate and Democratic Party donor, Elizabeth Keadle, who lives in California, while Mrs. Gore has been seeing a fellow photographer and former editor of National Geographic, Bill Allen.
(Mr. Gore was in the news in 2010 over sexual harassment allegations made by a massage therapist in Oregon; Mr. Gore denied the claims. A county district attorney later announced that there was no basis for prosecution, citing contradictory evidence, lack of forensic evidence, conflicting witness statements and credibility issues.)
When Mr. and Mrs. Gore have come together again, it mostly has to do with their children. Last summer, for instance, they both showed up to a book party in Washington for their daughter Kristin.
Mrs. Gore arrived first -- punctuality is very important to her, Mr. Gold said -- and she reacted playfully when Mr. Gore showed up. ''Hi, honey!'' she called out in an exaggerated Southern twang, according to two guests. The two later chatted and posed for photos with their daughter.
''Tipper and Al may live in different parts of the country, and may be very happy with their own lives these days, but the children always bring them together,'' said Christine Leverone Orrall, a friend of the Gores in Nashville. ''I think they're showing how you can be happy and healthy apart while still focusing on their children and their life together as a family.''
Kristin, Karenna, and Albert -- who is now a business development executive at a real estate management firm -- all live in New York. Both their parents often visit the city, particularly to help Karenna Gore Schiff, the mother of three young children, in the aftermath of her separation in 2010 from Drew Schiff, a doctor.
Friends of Ms. Gore Schiff say that she has endured personal problems before and since the separation, and that her parents have helped boost her mood and have been an essential part of her support network. Ms. Gore Schiff and Dr. Schiff have an amicable joint custody arrangement, and she is said to be doing better these days.
Of the four children, Ms. Gore Schiff, a Columbia Law School graduate, had by far the highest public profile -- and of the four, questions have swirled the most around her, given her far lower profile today. There was talk over the years about her running for political office, but several friends of Ms. Gore Schiff said that her focus now was on raising her children and rebuilding her personal life. They also noted that her interests, like her father's, had shifted from the old family turf of elective politics.
''Karenna got very caught up with the 2000 race, seeing herself as one of the best messengers for her father, and she inserted herself with a pretty heavy hand into the politics and the policy,'' said one senior official on the 2000 Gore campaign who worked with her regularly. ''The vice president trusted her and appreciated her, especially when she took on events that Tipper was less inclined to do. A lot of us thought Karenna had the bug for public office, though her personality could be so intense, I'm not sure if that would wear well as a candidate herself.''
Ms. Gore Schiff is now a master's degree student at the Union Theological Seminary (her father was in divinity school before law school), and she is heavily involved with the Association to Benefit Children, a New York-based nonprofit, where she is now a board member. Tom Styron, the group's chairman, said that Ms. Gore Schiff and another board member, former Mayor David Dinkins, handled most of the outreach to elected officials and government agencies.
''Karenna and the mayor are usually our go-to people in terms of figuring out how to use political capital for our cause,'' said Dr. Styron, a clinical psychologist on the Yale Medical School faculty and son of the author William Styron.
''She is also a very private person, very protective of her family and her children,'' Dr. Styron said. ''To the extent that she has gone through difficult times personally, she keeps that to herself, while taking her responsibilities very seriously.''
The Gore family's move away from politics is a rare one, said Stephen Hess, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who has written extensively about American political dynasties. In recent decades, government has been replete with fathers and mothers and their grown children and grandchildren coming in and out of elected office. In the Gores, Mr. Hess sees a family that was set on a path to power by a patriarch, Albert Gore Sr., that his son and grandchildren took years to make a clean break from.
''I sometimes think that Al Gore would never have gone into politics if his father had not been a politician himself,'' Mr. Hess said. ''It makes you wonder about our political dynasties, and how many of them are defined by a love of service and how many are kept in place because the younger generations feel an obligation.''
Friends of the Gores are quick to point out that Al Gore was hardly unhappy as a congressman, senator or vice president, and that, for nearly 25 years, he and Mrs. Gore made the most of their lives in the Washington spotlight. Still, these friends said that the Gores now seem as content as they have ever been.
''Al and Tipper were the happily married couple of American politics for 30 years,'' Mr. Coehlo said. ''They packaged themselves that way for political consumption, and now they have unpackaged that image in the interest of their own happiness.
''They are still a family, but they have become the kind of family that they want to be.''

HEADLINE: As Protests Loom, Videographers Gather in Tampa

BYLINE: COLIN MOYNIHAN


HIGHLIGHT: An effort to document the protests by video to keep an eye on police behavior. 

 BODY:
The white and blue bus sat near the edge of downtown Tampa, on a small plot that had recently been named "Romneyville" as protesters from around the country gathered to pitch tents and unroll sleeping bags.
Blue lettering spelled out the words Mobile Broadcast News on the side of the bus. Inside, the vehicle was outfitted with bunks, sconce lights and a ventilation fan. 
Working in the cramped interior were Chappell Howard and Flux Rostrum, who sat at wooden tables where three laptops displayed images that had been recorded on video earlier that day.
Mr. Rostrum, who has traveled the country for years filming protests, said that the bus, a 1995 International Bluebird that runs on recycled vegetable oil, would be a headquarters for people documenting rallies, marches and other street actions during both the Republican and Democratic conventions. 
As protesters trickled into Tampa before the convention, videographers were joined by another sort of documentarian, called livestreamers, who broadcast events on the Web in real time. 
That sort of immediate dissemination of raw footage, Mr. Rostrum said, had provided a potent tool to show interactions between police and the public and to create a record of fleeting, sometimes chaotic moments that otherwise might be lost to conflicting memories.
"They can't say you're editing it and twisting the story," he said on Friday. "It's live, happening right in front of you."
During the convention, he said, he and others would be broadcasting their footage on the Mobile Broadcast Web site.
Video has played a significant role during recent conventions and large-scale protests. Mr. Rostrum was among a group of people who contributed footage from the 2004 convention in New York to a collective called I-Witness Video. After the convention, video assembled by the group was used to refute testimony by police officers in a court case involving the mass arrests of hundreds of protesters.
Four years later, during the Republican gathering in St. Paul, officers surrounded a house where about a dozen I-Witness members were staying, handcuffed them and held them for hours. None of the collective members were arrested but they said that the authorities looked through their computers and cameras.
Livestreaming was widely used by people connected to the Occupy Wall Street protests that began in New York last fall and then spread to dozens of other cities.
Mr. Rostrum said that he was running a 24-hour livestream from the bus showing "Romneyville," which was organized by a group called the Poor People's Economic Human Rights campaign. He said the stream showed the evolution of the encampment, which sprung up on Aug. 20 on a lot rented from an Army-Navy surplus store that stands about a mile from the Tampa Bay Times Forum where the Republican delegates will gather.
Mr. Rostrum said that before arriving in Florida he had been in West Virginia with his bus documenting conflicts between police officers, miners and people protesting strip mining.
Others in the slowly growing camp had also arrived from far-flung spots. There were people who had hitchhiked from places like Maryland, New York and North Carolina. There was a group that had traveled on a bus from Gainesville and a woman who had ridden a motorcycle about 100 miles from Orlando.
By Friday night about 30 tents had been pitched between the Army-Navy store and a ramp leading onto Interstate 275. As a breeze blew through the camp some of the inhabitants gathered under a black plastic tarp that stretched between Mr. Rostrum's bus and a nearly identical bus that housed a mobile kitchen that had last been used at the Rainbow Gathering, an annual utopian assembly that was held this year at Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee.
Those beneath the tent said that they had traveled to Tampa to exchange ideas, air opposition to the Republican platform and to try to grapple with what they described as disturbing realities that gripped the nation.
"I think a movement of ordinary people can mitigate some of the problems we have," said Tom Over, 44, an independent journalist who had arrived from Columbus, Ohio. "There's so much money in politics it's undermining our democracy."
Diamond Dan Whitaker, 74, from San Francisco, recited a short poem that he said "came to me like a revelation, like a voice in my head."
Some people ate rice and beans. Somebody scrubbed a kettle that had been used to prepare the meal. People sitting at a small wooden table stacked with fliers for upcoming protest marches listened to a jazz radio station as cars whizzed past toward the interstate. A helicopter with green and red lights made a few passes overhead.
Surveying the scene, Charlie Meyers, from Little Rock, Ark., said it reminded him of his first days at the Occupy Wall Street encampment last fall in New York.
"It's a lot like Zuccotti Park," Mr. Meyers, 22, said, "Except here we are allowed to have a kitchen."

HEADLINE: Golden Instability

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A very bad, no good, truly awful idea. 

 BODY:
Say this for the GOP: by resurrecting the very bad, no good, truly awful idea of a gold standard, they've given us something to talk about.
Matthew O'Brien makes one obvious point: anyone who believes that the gold standard era was marked by price stability, or for that matter any kind of stability, just hasn't looked at the evidence. The fact is that prices have been far more stable under that dangerous inflationist Ben Bernanke than they ever were when gold ruled.
I'd like to offer a different take. There is a remarkably widespread view that at least gold has had stable purchasing power. But nothing could be further from the truth. Here's the real price of gold -- the price deflated by the consumer price index -- since 1968:
That's a pretty huge range of variation. What's going on?
Well, there may be bubble aspects, but there's also a pretty clear (and economically understandable) relationship between the real price of gold and the real interest rate: when real rates are low, real gold prices are high. 
And when are real rates low? High inflation can do that, as it did in the late 1970s; but so can a severe economic slump due to a deleveraging shock, as in recent years.
What does that tell us about how a gold standard would work? Faced with the kind of shock we've just experienced, the real price of gold would "want" to rise. But under a gold standard, the nominal price of gold would be fixed, so the only way that could happen would be through a fall in the general price level: deflation.
So if we'd had a gold standard operating in this crisis, there would have been powerful deflationary forces at work; not exactly what the doctor ordered.
Now, the gold bugs will no doubt reply that under a gold standard big bubbles couldn't happen, and therefore there wouldn't be major financial crises. And it's true: under the gold standard America had no major financial panics other than in 1873, 1884, 1890, 1893, 1907, 1930, 1931, 1932, and 1933. Oh, wait.
The truth is that returning to gold is an almost comically (and cosmically) bad idea.

HEADLINE: In Canada, the Impact of America's New Patent Law Is Seen

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: The United States passed new patent legislation last fall and key provisions are scheduled to take effect early next year. New research analyzing the experience in Canada, after it made a similar legal change, suggests that small inventors will be hurt. Patents awarded to individual inventors dropped by 15 percent after the legislative change in Canada. 

 BODY:
In an article published in Monday's New York Times and available now online, I wrote about a lawsuit that challenges the constitutionality of the nation's new patent law, the America Invents Act. 
Opponents of the law say it would hurt small inventors and American innovation. Supporters of the legislation, which passed by large majorities in both the House and the Senate, say the constitutional critique is misguided. They also assert that the fears of small inventors are greatly exaggerated, and that the new law will streamline the patent system and thus invigorate the nation's innovation ecosystem as a whole.
Reasonable people -- and others -- can disagree. But a research paperscheduled for publication in the current volume of the Stanford Law Review takes a look at a similar law change in Canada in 1989 and analyzes the impact.
The research, by David S. Abrams, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and R. Polk Wagner, a professor at the law school, concludes that patents awarded to individual inventors dropped by 15 percent after the legislative change in Canada.
"Our findings," the authors write, "do not augur well for small inventors in the United States."
Under the new law, the United States, beginning in March of next year, would move from a first-to-invent system to first-to-file. Opponents of the law say the switch would favor large corporations, whose big legal staffs will likely win the paper chase to the patent office. 
The American law is not a mirror image of the Canadian legislation. But the authors say they tried to factor those differences out, as well as economic cycles. In the years after 1989, through 1993, the share of Canadian patents granted to small inventors fell from 10.7 percent of all patents to 7.8 percent. In the United States, the comparable share slipped slightly from 17.4 percent to 16.5 percent.
America's current patent system, according to Adam Mossoff, a professor at George Mason University School of Law, is intentionally biased toward small upstarts, the "new innovators that disrupt and destroy existing companies and industries."
There is debate among economists about the role of small inventors and companies in innovation and job growth. The drift of research is that a tiny percentage of fast-growing small companies that quickly become bigger companies -- sometimes called "gazelles" -- account for most of the job generation and disruptive innovation.
The paper by the University of Pennsylvania professors has a provocative headline, "Poisoning the Next Apple? How the America Invents Act Harms Inventors." They write that the new law "will surely simplify and streamline the patent system -- but at a cost."
But the economic question is whether it will be a "net" cost. Laws and regulations always have costs, but they can also bring benefits. The professors' research does not reach a conclusion on whether the new patent law will help or harm innovation in the economy overall. 
"The bottom-line question is whether this will be good or bad for the nation," Mr. Abrams said in an interview. "I don't think the answer is clear on that score."

HEADLINE: Has 'Europe' Failed?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS SAMBANIS. 
Nicholas Sambanis is a professor of political science and the director of the Program in Ethics, Politics and Economics at Yale.

 BODY:
New Haven
LAST week, European leaders met in Berlin amid new signs of an impending recession and an emerging consensus that Greece could leave the euro zone within a year -- a move that would have dire consequences for the currency's future.
There are many reasons behind the crisis, from corruption and collective irresponsibility in Greece to European institutional rigidities and the flawed concept of a monetary union without a fiscal union. But this is not just a story about profligate spending and rigid monetary policy. The European debt crisis is not just an economic crisis: it is an escalating identity conflict -- an ethnic conflict. 
The European Union was a political concept, designed to tame a bellicose Germany. Strong economic interdependence and a common European identity, it was thought, would be cultivated by the institutions of the union, as Europeans benefited from the economic prosperity that integration would create.
Elites could sell that concept to their publics as long as Europe prospered and had high international status. But the union has lost its shine. It is slowing down and aging. Its longtime ally, the United States, is shifting attention to East Asia. Its common defense policy is shallow.
As Europe's status declines, the already shaky European identity will weaken further and the citizens of the richer European nations will be more likely to identify nationally -- as Germans or French -- rather than as Europeans. This will increase their reluctance to use their taxes for bailouts of the ethnically different Southern Europeans, especially the culturally distant Greeks; and it will diminish any prospect of fiscal integration that could help save the euro.
The result is a vicious circle: as ethnic identities return, ethnic differences become more pronounced, and all sides fall back on stereotypes and the stigmatization of the adversary through language or actions intended to dehumanize, thereby justifying hostile actions. This is a common pattern in ethnic conflicts around the world, and it is also evident in Europe today.
The slide to ethnic conflict in Europe is not violent, but it can nonetheless be destructive, both economically and politically. Take the roiling tensions between Greece and Germany. A recent survey finds that a majority of Germans want Greece out of the euro if it doesn't reform quickly, even though most analysts say that a Greek exit would have incalculable costs for Germany. Clearly something deeper is motivating the German public.
A recent study by the political scientists Michael Bechtel, Jens Hainmueller and Yotam Margalit found that German voters' attitudes toward the bailouts are explained by their degree of ''cosmopolitanism,'' or the extent to which they identify with geographically or culturally distant groups. More cosmopolitan individuals are more likely to support bailing out Germany's southern neighbors.
Unfortunately, cosmopolitanism can be the first casualty of rising ethnic tensions, as populations react negatively to escalating political demagogy, strengthening the hand of extremists. Examples of such stigmatization in Europe abound, from the disparaging acronym PIGS, used to refer to the troubled economies of Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain, to the tired medical analogies of an infection of the North by the contagious South. Germans tell the Greeks how to live; the Greeks reply by calling them Nazis.
This is not just the result of economic weariness or fear. It is the predictable re-emergence of hard-edged national identities, which the European Union hoped to banish. True, many Greeks, especially those living abroad, still toe the European line about ''taking the medicine'' prescribed by the European ''doctors,'' no matter how painful.
Why? Some fear the social upheaval that a transition to the drachma would cause. Others worry that populist politicians would abandon all structural reforms without European oversight. But social psychology suggests that many Greeks might be desperately clinging to the last shreds of their European identity, because that gives them more self-esteem than the alternative -- the Near Eastern or Balkan identity they have been trying to shed for decades. Greece's wounded reputation makes some Greeks cling to their European identity. But even that may not last long.
Germans must have a frank public discussion about what it means to be European, how good European citizens should behave toward other Europeans and why a strong Europe is good for German interests in a world dominated by the United States, China and emerging powers like India and Brazil. Without such a discussion, and real concessions to Greece, a Greek exit is inevitable -- and with it the triumph of parochialism in Europe.

HEADLINE: For G.O.P. Congressmen in Arizona, a Fierce Primary in a Redrawn District

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- The news, emerging as his campaign hit the homestretch, landed like a gift to Representative David Schweikert, a Republican who is locked in a feisty primary fight against Representative Ben Quayle: a Congressional fact-finding trip to Israel last year, drinks by the Sea of Galilee and a dip in its waters by inebriated lawmakers, one of whom stripped off his clothes.
Mr. Quayle had been on the trip, and Mr. Schweikert quickly worked to capitalize on it in a blast of ''robocalls'' to potential voters that tried to link Mr. Quayle to the overseas follies. 
''If he's trying to make me guilty by association,'' Mr. Quayle said in an interview, ''then he's guilty, too, because he was also there.''
The race between Mr. Quayle, 35, and Mr. Schweikert, 50, is one the nastiest and most competitive in Arizona: ''liar'' is one of the most benign words each candidate has used in statements and whispers to describe the other. It is also the costliest among the state's Congressional contests in memory. Each man has spent roughly $1.5 million, much of it in television ads and mailers highlighting political records and beliefs that show how similar they really are.
Both are first-time incumbents, running against each other for a new Congressional seat created through redistricting. Both are conservative (and invest a lot of time arguing over who is more conservative) and aspire, if re-elected, to reform the tax code and derail President Obama's health care overhaul.
Unlike Mr. Quayle, though -- and, for that matter, all other Republicans in Arizona's delegation -- Mr. Schweikert voted to extend the payroll tax holiday, saying that in a recession he would vote for anything that kept more money in the taxpayers' pockets.
The argument is part of Mr. Schweikert's common-man persona and part of the discourse he has employed to distinguish himself from his opponent in an insurgent-versus-establishment strategy. Mr. Schweikert was born in a home for unwed mothers in Los Angeles, then put up for adoption, which is how he ended up in Arizona. Since turning to politics, he has climbed his way up party ranks -- state legislator, county treasurer and, on his third attempt, congressman.
Mr. Quayle is the son of former Vice President Dan Quayle and the beneficiary of his family's name, political connections and money; his father and paternal grandmother are among his most consistent donors. He ran for office for the first time in 2010, beating nine primary opponents, then defeating a Democratic challenger in a district long considered a Republican stronghold.
''I can't tell you how many calls I make where people think I'm running against Dan Quayle, not Ben Quayle,'' Mr. Schweikert said. ''I'm running against political aristocracy.''
Ben Quayle is still regarded as an outsider in Republican political circles here. Jason Rose, a consultant who worked for one of his Republican primary challengers in 2010, said, ''If it was not for his name, he would have never been elected.'' Others use the endorsement he got from Senator John McCain of Arizona as evidence of his institutional ties.
''I have to be willing to put up with the arrows I knew would come since I have a big target on my back,'' Mr. Quayle said.
Some of the criticism he has received is, in some ways, of his own making. When the lines were redrawn, most of the constituents Mr. Quayle currently represents -- as well as Mr. Schweikert -- ended up in the new Sixth Congressional District, which is dominated by Republicans.
But Mr. Quayle ended up living outside the redrawn district and was left in a competitive swing district that Democrats have a clear chance of winning. He decided to move to the new Sixth Congressional District, trading his home in Phoenix for one in Paradise Valley, an exclusive enclave.
Mr. Schweikert's camp has accused Mr. Quayle of ''carpetbagging'' into the new district, which encompasses parts of Phoenix, most of Scottsdale and other communities to the north. Mr. Quayle said he moved because he wanted to represent voters who ''share my values.''
Nearly half of the more than three million registered voters in Arizona have signed up to have ballots mailed to them at home, according to Matt Roberts, the spokesman for Arizona's secretary of state, Ken Bennett. Many send them in early; the Schweikert campaign estimates that 70 percent of all voters in the new district have already cast their ballots, meaning that the race may have already been decided.
As the clock ticks toward the primary on Tuesday, both candidates are hard at work. Mr. Schweikert said he began his day at 4 a.m. on Thursday, stuffing copies of a letter from his wife, Joyce, into envelopes he later dropped off at the post office.
Mr. Quayle devoted much of his time last week to explaining what he did and did not do in the Sea of Galilee, an episode first reported by Politico.
''I went in the water. I had shorts on,'' he said. His wife, Tiffany, who was eight months pregnant at the time, waited for him on the shore, he said. He also said he was able to take home some of the water in a vial he will use in the baptism of his daughter, Evie, who is now 11 months old.
Questioning Mr. Quayle's truthfulness, Mr. Schweikert, who said he had not gone in the water, brought up a story that came out during Mr. Quayle's campaign two years ago. At that time, Mr. Quayle denied, but later confirmed, that he had been behind some of the comments posted to a gossip Web site chronicling the night life in Scottsdale.
Then, as now, Mr. Quayle characterized the stories as a ''smear campaign,'' saying last week, ''I've been truthful, just like I was last time.''
Of his dip in the Sea of Galilee -- a holy site to Christians, like him, who believe that many of the miracles of Jesus occurred on its shores -- Mr. Quayle said, ''It's a shame that they've taken my memories, my wife's memories, all of those things that are important to our faith, and tried to use it for political purposes.''

HEADLINE: Compared With Cubs, White Sox Can't Win for Winning

BYLINE: By BEN STRAUSS

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- The first-place White Sox, in the thick of a pennant race, hosted the Seattle Mariners at U.S. Cellular Field on Saturday on a gorgeous 86-degree evening. A crowd announced at 27,562 was on hand as the home team won, 5-4. Earlier in the day, eight miles north at Wrigley Field, a crowd announced as 35,296 watched the fifth-place Cubs lose to the equally bad Colorado Rockies.
With both of Chicago's major league teams home over the weekend, a season-long -- decades-long, for that matter -- trend was on full display: at the box office, the White Sox, despite being a contending team, are no match for even a cellar-dwelling Cubs squad. Through Saturday, the White Sox, sporting a 70-55 record, were 24th in attendance, averaging 24,568 fans. The Cubs, 27 ½ games out of first place, were 10th at 36,826. 
''It's baffling,'' said Bob Verdi, who covered both during 42 years at The Chicago Tribune. ''You've got a Triple-A team on one side of town and a very likable, very good team on the other.''
It is no fluke, though. The last time the White Sox outdrew the Cubs was in 1992, U.S. Cellular's second season. Even after the White Sox won the World Series in 2005, the Cubs outdrew them the next year despite finishing 30 games below .500. The White Sox have never drawn three million fans; the Cubs have done it eight straight seasons.
There is no shortage of theories about this puzzle, which is part of the fabric of the city. As many explanations are rooted in psychology, geography and socioeconomics as in baseball. The Cubs play on the tony North Side, the Sox on the grittier South Side. Slick bars and restaurants surround Wrigley, while the not so affectionately nicknamed Cell is nestled among parking lots and the Dan Ryan Expressway. Or there are just a lot more Cubs fans than White Sox fans.
Conventional wisdom holds that the fan split in a metropolitan area of 9.5 million is around 60-40 in favor of the Cubs. Even if the disparity is greater, that still leaves plenty of White Sox fans, and according to Comcast SportsNet Chicago, while the numbers are close, White Sox broadcasts have generated higher ratings than the Cubs' this season.
''Sox fans are a very passionate group,'' said Steve Stone, a current White Sox broadcaster, who pitched for both teams and has served as a television and radio analyst for each. ''Unfortunately, for a number of reasons -- some of them economic -- they don't come out as much.''
It was not always like this. From 1951 to 1967, the White Sox outdrew the Cubs in 16 of 17 seasons. The White Sox, in 1983, were the first Chicago team to draw two million fans.
''Believe it or not, I covered the Cubs when they used to close the upper deck because they couldn't get anybody up there, '' Verdi said. ''It's unthinkable today.''
Stone pointed to the early 1980s as the period of the seismic shift, when the Cubs were bought by the Tribune Company and the iconic announcer Harry Caray left the White Sox for the Cubs. Both moves came just a few years after WGN became a national ''superstation,'' putting the Cubs on television across the country (the Sox pulled themselves off WGN in 1968). The Cubs then made a playoff run in 1984 -- their first since 1945.
''Kids came home from school, and as my old producer used to say, we were the only thing on not starring a doctor,'' Stone said. ''Harry was the greatest salesman of baseball I've ever seen; then the Cubs won. It was a perfect storm.''
When the Sox threatened to move to Florida during contentious negotiations for a new stadium in the late '80s, their public relations director remarked, ''Between the mystique of Wrigley Field and the marketing power of the Tribune Company, it's like sword-fighting with Zorro.''
The neighborhood surrounding Wrigley has also blossomed. The average home price last year was near $1 million, compared with $255,000 in Bridgeport, where the Sox play. And with new ballparks popping up around the country, Wrigley's quaint antiquity has increased its popularity. It is now the third most-visited tourist attraction in Illinois.
As Cubs Manager Dale Sveum said: ''We have an experience here. That stays the same, win or lose.''
The White Sox have not rolled over. They cut ticket prices this season, with the average dropping below $30, according to Team Marketing Report, versus nearly $47 at Wrigley.
And after complaints about the White Sox stadium, which opened in 1991, renovations have made it a more comfortable place to watch a game. New in-stadium bars have been opened to help offset the scarcity of entertainment in the neighborhood.
The White Sox are also consistently competitive, with payrolls regularly near the top of the league. But while Cubs fans are often caricatured as hopeless romantics, White Sox fans are commonly regarded as a skeptical group, even profoundly negative.
''We call them unique,'' said Brooks Boyer, a White Sox vice president and chief marketing officer. ''There are layers of fandom here. There's 'I'll go when they're good,' and sometimes that becomes 'I'll go when they're good and the weather's nice.' ''
But sometimes even that is not enough. Last week, with the first-place Yankees in town, the series averaged just more than 26,000 over three pleasant summer nights -- and it was a White Sox sweep, no less. Yankees announcers noticed, as Michael Kay and Ken Singleton were incredulous at the small crowds.
''I scratch my head, and the Sox must, too,'' Verdi said. ''I don't know what else they can do.''

HEADLINE: At Summit Meeting, Iran Has a Message for the World

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- At the entrance to the convention hall where Iran is sponsoring an international summit meeting are the crumpled wreckage of three cars driven by Iranian nuclear scientists who have been killed or hurt in bomb attacks. Placards with the photos of the scientists and their children stand alongside.
The message is clear. As Iran plays host to the biggest international conference the Islamic republic has organized in its 33-year history, it wants to tell its side of the long standoff with the Western powers, which are increasingly convinced that Tehran is pursuing nuclear weapons. 
Tehran, which denies that it is after the bomb, believes the scientists were killed by Israeli agents, an assertion that Israel has not acknowledged but never fully disputed.
The meeting of the so-called Nonaligned Movement, a group formed during the cold war that considers itself independent of the major powers, has so far proven to be something of a public relations success for Iran.
Last week, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, decided to attend despite pressure from the United States and Israel. Egypt's new president also said he would come to the conference, although his country has long been estranged from Iran, and India's prime minister plans to bring a delegation of 250 people in an attempt to advocate for more trade with Tehran.
The announcements were seen as setbacks for efforts by the United States to isolate Iran and cripple it with sanctions.
''Two-thirds of the world's nations are here in Tehran,'' Mohammad Khazaee, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters on Sunday. ''Clearly this conference will be effective for us.''
Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, opened the meeting's early sessions on Sunday with a plea for the 120 countries in the movement to oppose the sanctions imposed on his country, and he asked them to stand against terrorism, saying Iran is the biggest victim of terrorist attacks in the world. An exhibition in the convention hall echoed his assertions, including pictures of victims of what Iran said were opposition bombings in the 1980s, soon after the Islamic Revolution, and of the downing of an Iranian passenger jet by a missile fired from a United States Navy ship in 1988, in what American officials say was an accident.
He also said the United States had ''exploited'' the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to further its ''hegemonic goals.''
Given that history, Iran says it has decided not to take any chances and has launched a comprehensive security operation. More than 110,000 security forces are controlling the streets, the deputy national police commander, Ahmad Radan, told the Fars news agency over the weekend.
They are supported by 30 helicopters and nearly 3,000 patrol cars. There are roadblocks on all highways leading into Tehran, and at night there are checkpoints throughout the city.
''Despite the evil intentions of our enemies, our secret service has taken all necessary measures in order to hold the nonaligned meeting in an absolute secure environment,'' Iran's minister of intelligence, Heydar Moslehi, told state news agency IRNA.
But the tight security might have another goal: to ensure Iran's narrative is not spoiled by its domestic political difficulties, three years after the country was convulsed by antigovernment protests that followed a disputed election and were quashed in a harsh crackdown.
Foreign-based opposition Web sites called for renewed rallies against the government during the summit meeting.
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is expected to address the conference this week. And in an effort to prove that its nuclear program is peaceful, Iran is offering special tours of some of its nuclear sites.
Like most countries given a chance at worldwide exposure -- witness London's Olympics -- Iran is taking other steps to present its best face.
An army of gardeners and street cleaners have been sprucing up main thoroughfares. One billboard reads: ''Nonaligned Movement represents the struggle against racism, colonialism, hegemony and foreign oppression.'' Floating above the city's main Haft-e Tir square was a balloon carrying a message: ''Iran, a peaceful and kind nation.''
The government even took the unusual step of subsidizing trips out of town for Tehran residents, to clear the city's always-congested roads. Despite the economic pain of recent sanctions, the government offered those with fuel-subsidy cards an extra 30 liters of gasoline at reduced rates so they could leave the city. Tehran's 12 million residents will also enjoy a five-day official holiday starting Tuesday, when the leaders begin gathering.
State television has presented the meeting as a ''turning point,'' after which Iran's importance will grow.
The vice president for international affairs, Ali Sa'idloo, told state television that ''Zionist'' media had been censoring news about the event because it was too positive.
Many Iranians said they were impressed with the fresh paint jobs on buildings. But in an indication of the country's economic setbacks, some said they wished they had not been given five days off.
''I need money, so I need to work, but now we must stay home,'' said Ali Kamali, a bookbinder.
For Iran's most hard-line officials, such suggestions were unrealistic. They hailed the summit meeting as a sign that the end of Western dominance was near.
''Electing Iran as leader of the Nonaligned Movement shows that a global resistance against America and the Zionists has taken shape,'' Mohammad Reza Naghdi, the commander of a paramilitary group, told the semiofficial Fars news agency. ''America better give up, as this is yet another sign of its collapse.''
It is clear that the conference is helping Iran gets its message out.
On Sunday, some delegates were shown on state TV denouncing terrorism as they stood in front of the nuclear scientists' mangled cars.

HEADLINE: Adventure As a Cure For Ailing Love Lives

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
STRATFORD, Ontario -- It may take a little while for audiences to stop waiting for the band to strike up during ''The Matchmaker,'' the 1954 farce by Thornton Wilder that has been given a rare and loving revival at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. Wilder's confectionary comedy was the most popular of his plays on Broadway, where the original production ran for more than a year. But the fame of ''The Matchmaker'' has since been eclipsed both by the enduring greatness of Wilder's two masterworks, ''Our Town'' and ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' -- each a Pulitzer Prize winner -- and by the huge commercial success and undeniable charm of the musical version of the play, ''Hello, Dolly!'' 
When the general-store clerk Cornelius Hackl, played with ebullient innocence by Mike Shara, turns to his younger assistant and urges him, ''Get into your Sunday clothes, Barnaby! We're going to New York,'' your ears perk up for the opening strains of the jaunty song from the musical inspired by this bit of dialogue. And when the milliner Irene Molloy (Laura Condlin) observes that women in New York will be wearing ribbons down their backs this summer, once again you may find yourself inwardly serenading the stage with the reflective tune that accompanies this observation in the musical.
But soon enough the band in your head playing those irresistible Jerry Herman tunes puts down its instruments as the natural delights of Wilder's comedy assert themselves. A throwback to classical forms even when it was new -- Brooks Atkinson, in a jubilant review for The New York Times, frankly admitted that the woolly farce had by then been ''dismissed as obsolete'' -- ''The Matchmaker'' shakes off the air of quaint antiquity that hovers at its edges when the ingenious mechanics of Wilder's plot shift into high gear: young men dive under tables and into closets, while flustered young women attempting to hide them dither and stammer and scramble.
The play's history dovetails with that of the Stratford festival. It was at the suggestion of Tyrone Guthrie, the festival's first artistic director, that Wilder decided to take another look at ''The Merchant of Yonkers,'' a play that had flopped on Broadway in 1938 under the heavy hand of Max Reinhardt. Guthrie invited Wilder to Stratford to work on revisions, and Guthrie's production of the resulting play, rechristened ''The Matchmaker,'' went on to debut at the Edinburgh Festival before taking London and then New York by storm, with Ruth Gordon as the title character, Dolly Levi, giving a performance described by Atkinson as ''epochally funny.''
With the permission of the Wilder estate, Chris Abraham, the director of Stratford's production, has interpolated some small bits from ''The Merchant of Yonkers'' and Guthrie's prompt script into the published text. These minor emendations are not particularly significant, though I did wonder if they extended the play's running time to its detriment. A farce that stretches to 2 hours 40 minutes is in danger of collapsing like an ill-cooked soufflé.
Mr. Abraham's production builds slowly in the opening scene and wraps up in a similarly slightly dilatory fashion, with a scene that will be entirely new to those who know the material only from ''Hello, Dolly!'' But the production bustles along merrily for most of the evening, as the romantic shenanigans orchestrated by Dolly (Seana McKenna) arrange themselves into satisfying patterns culminating in two blissfully silly scenes of knockabout comedy -- one in Irene Molloy's hat shop and the other at the Harmonia Gardens restaurant -- where all the play's characters find themselves frantically at odds.
The amiably interfering Dolly, whose role in the play is less dominant than in the musical, is given a pert, appealingly brisk interpretation by Ms. McKenna, a festival mainstay often seen in classical roles. (Last season she played Richard III.) It's nice to see Ms. McKenna at such ease in the frothier waters of farce. Tom McCamus, his bristles of whiskers amusingly signifying his prickly personality, plays the man Dolly's commissioned to find a wife for: the wealthy shopkeeper Horace Vandergelder, a widower determined to take a new wife without going to any great expenditure, emotional or monetary.
As the 17-year-old shop apprentice Barnaby Tucker, Josh Epstein exudes an awe-struck wonder as he finds himself tearing through the wild streets of New York City in the throes of the ''adventure'' he and Cornelius are determined to experience, if only just this once in their lives. Their romantic counterparts -- Ms. Condlin as Irene and Andrea Runge as her squealing assistant, Minnie Fay -- bring energy and spirit.
Geraint Wyn Davies, a veteran actor I'm always happy to see at Stratford, plays Malachi Stack, a cheerful drifter looking for work who finds himself caught in the confusion, and Mr. Davies infuses his scenes with sly doses of Irish wit. The other major role excised from ''Hello, Dolly!'' is Miss Flora Van Huysen (Nora McLellan, hamming merrily), the aunt of Horace's niece Ermengarde (Cara Ricketts). Flora's home is where the play's somewhat overelaborate final scene takes place.
Designed as an affectionate tribute to the classical models of farce, ''The Matchmaker'' is nonetheless gently inflected with the warm humanity and wry wisdom that characterized much of Wilder's writing. Among America's great playwrights he was perhaps the most down to earth, the most keenly attuned to the humble but sustaining pleasures of life, as well as its unavoidable sorrows. All the major characters in ''The Matchmaker'' address the audience directly, and some of their reflections have surprisingly sharp relevance in today's economic climate.
In Dolly's intimate address to her dead husband, Ephraim Levi, in which she tells him (and us) her reasons for remarrying, she observes that happiness requires a little money. ''Not much, but a little,'' she says. ''The difference between a little money and no money at all is enormous, and can shatter the world; and the difference between a little money and an enormous amount of money is very slight, and that, also, can shatter the world.'' Words worth pondering, Dolly, at a time when the uneven distribution of wealth has become a major topic of global import.
Nor does Dolly alone bring us piquant observations on the matter of money. The evening's standout performance comes from Mr. Shara as a movingly human but boisterously funny Cornelius, who tells Barnaby in the play's first scene that they had better grab their chance at adventure while they can, before they ossify into facsimiles of their dour, money-obsessed employer:
''Listen, everybody thinks when he gets rich he'll be a different kind of rich person from the rich people he sees around him. Later on he finds out there's only one kind of rich person. And he's it.''

 BODY:
In Silicon Valley, Apple just won big against Samsung in the patent lawsuit of the year, after trading claims and counterclaims of pilfered product ideas. Across the country, in a federal court in Florida, an inventor named Mark Stadnyk is waging a different kind of patent warfare -- an ambitious and perhaps quixotic legal foray.
Mr. Stadnyk, who holds a patent on a motorcycle windshield, is suing the United States government, aiming to head off a patent law that he says will favor big companies and hurt lone inventors like himself.
Represented by a prominent Washington lawyer, Mr. Stadnyk filed a suit last month that challenges the constitutionality of legislation that Congress passed last fall, the America Invents Act. Mr. Stadnyk and his lawyer -- along with some academics, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists -- assert that the legislation is a triumph of corporate lobbying power over the founders' wishes, and that it threatens America's stature as the world's leading innovator. 
The present system, one of the nation's oldest patent principles and called ''first to invent,'' relies on lab notebooks, e-mails and early prototypes to establish the date of invention. The impending law would overturn that by awarding patents to the inventors who are ''first to file'' with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Mr. Stadnyk, 48, a garage inventor who stumbled into the world of patents after he bought a powerful new motorcycle and wanted to avoid being battered by the wind when riding at 60 miles an hour, even with a windshield. He devised a system of brackets and gears to adjust the height and angle of the windshield and the gap between it and the motorcycle. With his system, he says, the rider feels a flutter of breeze instead of jolting winds and turbulence.
Mr. Stadnyk, who describes his invention style as ''rough hacking with chunks of metal,'' founded his company, MadStad Engineering, in 2006, and as sales picked up, he stopped working as a computer consultant to devote himself to the business.
Today, MadStad employs eight people, including Mr. Stadnyk and his wife, Patty. His adjustable windshield systems, priced from $100 to $320, are now used on dozens of makes and models of motorcycles, and are sold through dealers in Australia, Britain and Spain, as well as the United States. Yearly sales, he said, are more than $500,000 and growing briskly.
Mr. Stadnyk holds three patents, and he speaks of a patented idea as a uniquely human property right. ''It came out of your mind,'' he explained. ''It's not property you bought or inherited.''
Mr. Stadnyk became interested in the patent legislation as it proceeded. He says he studied the proposals and the law, read blogs and reached out to Washington lawyers and academics who raised the issue of its constitutionality. A grass-roots activist, he even made a couple of YouTube videos.
The shift to a first-to-file system, scheduled to take effect next March, is intended to simplify and streamline the current system, which can invite protracted litigation between competing inventors. The switch would also put the United States in harmony with patent offices in Europe, Japan and elsewhere, allowing them to share information and potentially ease the strain on overburdened patent examiners worldwide.
The efficiency argument is the mainstream view of corporate America and Washington policy makers. President Obama declared that the new law would cut ''the red tape that stops too many inventors and entrepreneurs from quickly turning new ideas into thriving businesses -- which holds our whole economy back.''
But opponents say it will give big companies a huge advantage over start-ups and small inventors. Large corporations have deep pockets and armies of lawyers to write up and file patents, they say, and the new law will touch off a paper chase to the patent office instead of a race to innovate.
Yet the opponents are in the minority. And there is genuine debate about how much garage inventors and fledgling companies contribute to innovation and economic growth these days.
Mr. Stadnyk sees his courtroom quest as the intellectual property equivalent of the recent constitutional challenge to the Obama administration's health insurance overhaul, in legislation that was narrowly upheld by the Supreme Court.
''Others took on Obamacare, and this is my fight,'' said Mr. Stadnyk, who lives in Ridge Manor, Fla. ''Somebody's got to do something.''
Mr. Stadnyk, who says he is a conservative, warns of the danger of the patent legislation in populist, antigovernment terms. ''My property would be given away by the government under this new law,'' he said.
Yet there are liberals among the law's critics as well. Mr. Stadnyk's Washington-based lawyer in the suit is Jonathan S. Massey. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Mr. Massey was a clerk for the liberal Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr., and is a protégé of Laurence H. Tribe, a leading professor of constitutional law at Harvard. Mr. Massey worked on the case presented to the Supreme Court on behalf of former Vice President Al Gore in Bush v. Gore, an appeal that lost and effectively settled the 2000 presidential election.
The America Invents Act was a byproduct of years of lobbying and eventual compromise, especially by major technology and pharmaceutical companies. The new patent law was approved overwhelmingly in both the House and the Senate. Few focused on the potential of a constitutional problem.
Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, was an exception. Speaking on the Senate floor last year, she said, ''I strongly disagree with changing the core principle of our patent system -- awarding a patent to the true inventor -- for the sake of perceived administrative ease.''
Ms. Boxer went on to say that the Constitution singles out and grants exclusive rights to individuals with new, useful ideas. ''We are the only country in the world,'' she said, ''whose Constitution specifically mentions 'inventor.' ''
Mr. Massey says he became involved in the legislative debate and this suit because of his background in constitutional law. The new patent law, he said, ''violates the text and the original understanding of the Constitution.''
In the suit, the government has until Thursday to reply. Mr. Massey declined to say who would provide financial support if the case proceeded through appeals and higher courts. As a matter of confidentiality and courtroom tactics, he said he did not want to let ''the other side know the size of my resources.''
The suit, according to some legal experts, faces long odds. The courts, they say, have treated the section of the Constitution that concerns intellectual property rights as utilitarian doctrine subject to Congressional interpretation. ''Congress is fairly free to do as it sees fit to promote innovation,'' said Arti K. Rai, a professor at Duke University School of Law and a former senior official in the patent office.
Mark A. Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School, said the constitutional challenge ''is the legal equivalent of fringe science.''
''There are people who didn't like the outcome of the patent legislation, and they may be right in not liking the outcome,'' he said. ''But that doesn't make it unconstitutional.''
In Silicon Valley, Stephen G. Perlman, a high-tech inventor and entrepreneur, worries about the law's practical effect. His invention factory, Rearden, has produced a series of innovations and spinoff companies, including ones that make the technology for fine-grain computer-generated facial imagery used in Hollywood, and another company whose data-handling software generates photo-realistic, high-speed play for online gamers on tablet computers.
The new law, he said, with its emphasis on speed, could well make it more difficult to wait before filing an application, to take the time to experiment over years, and to confidentially show early concepts to investors to raise money.
''I'm scared that this law is a threat to the survival of our species -- people who do fundamental, long-term invention,'' Mr. Perlman said.
Gary Lauder, a venture capitalist, said the new law had the logic of trying to make the patent system more efficient and less prone to litigation. But he is a critic.
''This law favors large companies at the expense of small ones,'' Mr. Lauder said. ''There wasn't enough advocacy for unborn companies. And partly as a result of our current patent system, we do have a huge amount of innovation in America.''

HEADLINE: These Days, It's Back to School, Then Shopping

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Samantha Paradise is starting eighth grade in Manhattan next week, but she won't be decked out in all new gear on the first day.
At 13, Samantha doesn't want to be stuck with untrendy items, so she will wait to see if the Superga sneakers that were cool at summer camp are still in fashion, and whether her classmates choose JanSport backpacks or revive the Longchamp and LeSportsac bags from last year. ''I don't want to be the only one wearing a different kind of backpack,'' she said.
In a shift that is upending retailers' plans, many children, teenagers and their parents are delaying their school purchases. A desire to get the trends right accounts for some of the hesitation. But retailers and analysts say the sluggish economy and unusually hot weather have also made for a surprisingly slow start to the back-to-school spending season, one that was expected to be the strongest since before the recession. 
If people do not go to stores once schools start, it will be bad news for an economy heavily dependent on consumer spending to stay afloat. And the postponed spending is complicating how stores stock, promote and sell their back-to-school items, some of which have been on the shelves for almost two months.
Charles M. Holley Jr., chief financial officer of Wal-Mart, said stores were seeing customers ''wait until school starts, and they don't buy things until they absolutely have to.'' Office Depot's head of retail, Juan Guerrero, said many shoppers were even holding off on buying staples like pens and notebooks.
''People are waiting for deals to occur,'' Mr. Guerrero said.
The consequences could be serious if sales do not rebound. The back-to-school season is the second-largest sales period for retailers, after the winter holiday period, and it offers a spate of new designs and a firm reason for shoppers to head to stores. Beyond the profits retailers make from back-to-school sales, what is popular and what is not provides an important barometer as they prepare for the holidays.
This month, when the National Retail Federation surveyed consumers with school-age children, less than 8 percent had completed their back-to-school shopping, the lowest figure in four years. More than a quarter of respondents said they had not done any shopping, and by that point, school had already started in cities from Georgia to Arizona.
J. C. Penney is trying to cope by adding styles that will go on the racks in early September. Adrienne Tennant, an analyst with Janney Capital Markets, said Abercrombie & Fitch, Old Navy and American Eagle Outfitters had extended sales to attract later shoppers. Looking to next year, the teenage store Hot Topic is rethinking its back-to-school timing.
''The post-back-to-school numbers are up, and the pre-back-to-school numbers are down a little bit,'' said Lisa Harper, chief executive of Hot Topic. ''Next year, we'll probably delay.''
Liz Sweney, J. C. Penney's chief merchant, said that while the back-to-school season had been slipping into late August and early September for a couple of years, the trend was more pronounced this year.
''A few weeks into school, a couple things happen,'' she said. ''Weather happens -- it gets cooler -- and kids obviously see what their friends are wearing, particularly for teens, and then they go back to the stores.''
J. C. Penney has been running a free-haircut promotion since the beginning of August to attract early shoppers, but it is also stocking up for later shoppers. Ms. Sweney said the retailer had ordered a wider selection of merchandise to arrive in early September than it did last year. And as the fall goes on, it will emphasize layering pieces, like hoodies and varsity-style jackets, that students can add to what they have already purchased.
But not all retailers have been as nimble.
John D. Morris, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said the too-early arrival of wintry gear at Abercrombie & Fitch was among the reasons the company performed poorly in the quarter that ended July 28, with sales at stores open for at least a year falling 10 percent.
''Abercrombie in July was flowing in heavier-weight goods -- down vests when it's 95 degrees out, sweaters, outerwear, jackets,'' Mr. Morris said.
Ms. Tennant, the Janney analyst, said retailers that extended their August sales were most likely reacting to a slower start to August than they expected.
Later school start dates are one possible explanation. Mr. Guerrero of Office Depot and Ms. Harper of Hot Topic said that a number of school districts near where they had stores were starting later this year than last.
But students may also be waiting to shop this year in part because trends are so definite that there is little room for error, Ms. Tennant said. (No one wants to show up in high-top sneakers and a chartreuse sweatshirt on the first day of school when everyone else has left the '80s trend behind.)
Older students, especially, seem to be waiting until after Labor Day, most likely so they can see what their friends are wearing, said Cathy Beaudoin, president of fashion for Amazon.
Ms. Tennant and Mr. Morris said colored jeans (which became ubiquitous in the spring but are still selling well), printed denim, pleated skirts and dots and floral patterns were currently popular among teenagers.
''Especially when you have a momentous change in fashion,'' Ms. Tennant said, ''with young girls, when you're going into a big trend season, the early adopters will certainly be there, but the fashion followers will buy some stuff to start themselves off with, but go back to school and make sure they got the right color, the right fit and the right trend.''
Samantha Paradise, the Manhattan eighth grader, said that while she liked a lot of the trends she had seen in magazines and online, that was not enough to get her into stores before classes started.
''I'm looking to wait,'' she said.

 BODY:
8 P.M. (Link TV) BORGEN The second installment of this award-winning Danish drama from the producers of ''The Killing'' picks up a year after the Season 1 finale, as Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborg (Sidse Babett Knudsen, above) visits soldiers in Afghanistan, when a deadly strike hits their encampment. Now she must choose between sending the troops home or staging a counterattack. At 9 she must appoint a new European Union commission and offers the position to her old mentor, Bent Sejro (Lars Knutzon). But he assumes she wants to get rid of him and declines, leading to a power play with serious consequences. 
8 A.M. (IFC) AWAY FROM HER (2007) Fiona and Grant, a long-married couple played by Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent, left, confront Alzheimer's disease in this feature directorial debut of Sarah Polley, who received an Oscar nomination for her screenplay, based on an Alice Munro short story. ''Ms. Polley, rather remarkably for someone still in her 20s, shows an intuitive grasp of this wisdom and a welcome, unsentimental interest in the puzzles and pleasures of a long, imperfect marriage,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''I can't remember the last time the movies yielded up a love story so painful, so tender and so true.''
7:30 P.M. (MSG Plus) THE GAME 365 Justin Tuck, a defensive end for the New York Giants, talks with Fran Healy about his career, his college days at Notre Dame and his childhood in Alabama, where he was a star high school basketball player and waited until the 10th grade to take football seriously. Now a two-time Super Bowl champion, he says that he will look back on the wins once he retires.
8 P.M. (Fox) HOTEL HELL Gordon Ramsay helps the owners of the Keating, a boutique hotel in San Diego whose problems include the décor, the room and laundry service, and the restaurant. In ''Hell's Kitchen,'' at 9, the four remaining chefs must demonstrate their ability to lead.
8 P.M. (Ovation) WHAT TO DO WHEN SOMEONE DIES A young wife (Anna Friel) searches for the truth behind the death of her husband (Marc Warren) after he is killed in a late-night car crash with another woman in the seat beside him. She begins to worry about her own safety in Episode 2 of this three-part mini-series, directed by Tim Fywell and adapted from the novel by Nicci French, the pseudonym for the writing partnership of Nicci Gerrard and Sean French.
8:20 P.M. (Sundance) THE BANGER SISTERS (2002) Susan Sarandon plays Lavinia, a conservative housewife whose carefully camouflaged past as a '70s rock groupie threatens to resurface when her partner in adventure, Suzette (Goldie Hawn, right), unexpectedly shows up for a visit, and a handout. Geoffrey Rush plays a failed screenwriter in town to kill his father. He hasn't had sex in a decade, but Suzette will take care of that. ''For all the charm effused by its stars, 'The Banger Sisters,' written and directed by Bob Dolman, emerges as a pallid, unconvincing pipe dream,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The Times.
9 P.M. (Logo) THE BABY WAIT Mark and Paul, a New York couple who have been together for six years and are hoping to adopt a child, find themselves matched with Genavieve, a pregnant 18-year-old. But her home state, Connecticut, gives birth mothers 30 days to terminate an adoption.
9 P.M. (CNBC) THE DIAMOND RUSH Bob Pisani reports on the popularity of diamonds as an investment. His journey begins at a De Beers diamond mine, one of the world's richest, in Botswana, before he heads to Las Vegas for the largest jewelry expo in the United States; to the Diamond Dealers Club on Fifth Avenue at 47th Street in Manhattan; and to Arkansas, where the public can pay to dig for gemstones.
11:30 P.M. (HBO2) GOING THE DISTANCE (2010) Justin Long and Drew Barrymore play lovers trying to maintain a bicoastal romance -- she's an aspiring newspaper reporter in San Francisco; he's a record-label grunt in New York -- amid lowered romantic and professional expectations in this comedy from Nanette Burstein. The film, A. O. Scott wrote in The Times, ''acknowledges both the difficulty and the comic potential of the arrangement, and does so with enough insight and charm to make you wonder why frequent-flier love is not a more popular theme in romantic comedies.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Arms Sales Make Up Most of Global Market

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Weapons sales by the United States tripled in 2011 to a record high, driven by major arms sales to Persian Gulf allies concerned about Iran's regional ambitions, according to a new study for Congress.
Overseas weapons sales by the United States totaled $66.3 billion last year, or more than three-quarters of the global arms market, valued at $85.3 billion in 2011. Russia was a distant second, with $4.8 billion in deals.
The American weapons sales total was an ''extraordinary increase'' over the $21.4 billion in deals for 2010, the study found, and was the largest single-year sales total in the history of United States arms exports. The previous high was in fiscal year 2009, when American weapons sales overseas totaled nearly $31 billion. 
A worldwide economic decline had suppressed arms sales over recent years. But increasing tensions with Iran drove a set of Persian Gulf nations -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman -- to purchase American weapons at record levels.
These Gulf states do not share a border with Iran, and their arms purchases focused on expensive warplanes and complex missile defense systems.
The report was prepared by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress. The annual study, written by Richard F. Grimmett and Paul K. Kerr and delivered to Congress on Friday, is considered the most detailed collection of unclassified arms sales data available to the public.
The agreements with Saudi Arabia included the purchase of 84 advanced F-15 fighters, a variety of ammunition, missiles and logistics support, and upgrades of 70 of the F-15 fighters in the current fleet.
Sales to Saudi Arabia last year also included dozens of Apache and Black Hawk helicopters, all contributing to a total Saudi weapons deal from the United States of $33.4 billion, according to the study.
The United Arab Emirates purchased a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, an advanced antimissile shield that includes radars and is valued at $3.49 billion, as well as 16 Chinook helicopters for $939 million.
Oman bought 18 F-16 fighters for $1.4 billion.
In keeping with recent trends, most of the weapons purchases, worth about $71.5 billion, were made by developing nations, with about $56.3 billion of that from the United States.
Other significant weapons deals by the United States last year included a $4.1 billion agreement with India for 10 C-17 transport planes and with Taiwan for Patriot antimissile batteries valued at $2 billion -- an arms deal that outraged officials in Beijing.
To compare weapons sales over various years, the study used figures in 2011 dollars, with amounts for previous years adjusted for inflation to provide a consistent measurement.
A policy goal of the United States has been to work with Arab allies in the Persian Gulf to knit together a regional missile defense system to protect cities, oil refineries, pipelines and military bases from an Iranian attack.
The effort has included deploying radars to increase the range of early warning coverage across the Persian Gulf, as well as introducing command, control and communications systems that could exchange that information with new batteries of missile interceptors sold to the individual nations.
The missile shield in the Persian Gulf is being built on a country-by-country basis -- with these costly arms sales negotiated bilaterally between the United States and individual nations.

HEADLINE: Staying Cool in the Developing World

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Cost of Cool'' (Sunday Review, Aug. 19), about the exorbitant -- and rapidly rising -- costs of air-conditioning in the increasingly crowded cities in the tropics, where cool living and working conditions appear to be a prerequisite to economic development, points to an urgent need for family planning.
Three inexorable global trends -- climate change, resource depletion and population growth -- are on a catastrophic collision course. Although substituting clean energy sources -- solar, wind, tidal -- for reliance on fossil fuels may have promise in some undefined future, the only practical immediate course is to limit population growth. 
It's worth noting that of the 23 hottest metro areas -- those with more than 1,000 annual cooling degree days -- only three are in the Western Hemisphere, which has about one-seventh of the total global population.
So family planning primarily needs to target the planet's most densely populated regions in the Eastern Hemisphere -- in Asia and Africa. This will be characterized by some as racist or chauvinist, but the reality is that those regions will suffer the most.
MICHAEL JORRIN Ridgefield, Conn., Aug. 20, 2012
To the Editor:
Your article highlights the divergent, accelerated demand of the developing world for an air-conditioned environment in the face of a much slower growth of supply of electricity in emerging economies.
It is likely that the next major breakthrough in air-conditioning technology will involve the development of an affordable portable unit with compatible clothing for personal control of one's own microenvironment.
STEVEN FELD Lufkin, Tex., Aug. 19, 2012
To the Editor:
While your description of the transnational costs of air-conditioning is highly cautionary, California's experience with engaging consumers to help avoid power outages offers a usefully positive counterpoint to the article's cold blast of reality.
Two weeks ago, in the middle of soaring summer heat, with two major state power plants down, Californians responded fully and faithfully to urgent requests to endure thermostats set to 78 degrees or more -- saving more than 1,000 megawatts on multiple occasions (enough for one million homes per hour, a huge difference in grid stability terms).
The implication: People will move beyond ''my air-conditioned home is my air-conditioned castle'' if the message is compelling and makes it clear that sweating it out is a shared burden. While that doesn't obviate the energy economics of cooling, it does offer one useful tool to address this shared global responsibility.
JEF LOEB San Francisco, Aug. 19, 2012
To the Editor:
Added to the difficulty of using less air-conditioning is our resistance to cooling our buildings more efficiently.
We're too in love with glass towers and architectural dream shapes to churn out the squat, boxy, highly insulated shelters with minimal surface area given to windows that if constructed would enable us to dramatically reduce our energy needs for heating as well as air-conditioning.
BARRY REHFELD New York, Aug. 19, 2012
The writer is the author of ''Home Sweet Zero Energy Home.''
To the Editor:
Your article did not mention the obvious solution: solar energy! Its potential is abundant in places like India. It can generate the most electricity at the very same time that air-conditioning is needed. Its fuel is free, and making it does not produce greenhouse gases.
All it takes to collect it is to cover the roofs of single-family homes with solar panels, and they become self-sufficient. If India, instead of making immense investments in building more fossil and nuclear plants, used solar, it would save money, create jobs and provide both comfort and a permanent solution that is clean and safe.

HEADLINE: Should the United States Export Natural Gas?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Case for Natural Gas Exports'' (Op-Ed, Aug. 16), Michael A. Levi lumps together exports by pipeline to Canada and Mexico and overseas exports of liquefied natural gas. However, the economic and environmental distinctions are huge. 
Pipeline exports, especially using the existing transmission network, are relatively simple. But liquefying natural gas is energy-intensive and requires substantial capital investment. A natural gas-fueled gas liquefaction plant consumes nearly as much gas as it liquefies, essentially doubling the carbon footprint of L.N.G. compared with pipeline gas.
The L.N.G. infrastructure (liquefaction plants, special ships) can only be justified by gas supplies and market prices that will remain stable for the decade or more necessary to recoup investments. Today, neither the economic lifetime of shale gas wells nor the extent to which such wells will be developed outside the United States is clear enough to support belief in supply and market stability.

To the Editor:
For years we've been hearing complaints about dependence on foreign oil. Now comes Michael A. Levi to make ''The Case for Natural Gas Exports.''
We finally have an alternative to foreign oil in the form of natural gas, and Mr. Levi wants to ship it overseas. I'm confused. Why don't we keep this resource here? Use it here? If we don't need it now, let's keep it in the ground for later use.
I've never understood the aversion to foreign oil anyway; let's burn others' oil first. Ours will still be here in the future.
BOB BAILEY Silver Spring, Md., Aug. 16, 2012
To the Editor:
Michael A. Levi makes a good free trade argument supporting export of United States natural gas. But he and other advocates neglect to mention that shale gas production technology is not restricted to the United States.
In a few years we are likely to see shale gas production from countries with onshore conventional gas fields. The liquefied natural gas market will then favor producers close to gas consumers. In that market, United States gas exports will often be at a disadvantage.

HEADLINE: Election 2012: Livestreaming the Show, From 'Romneyville'

BYLINE: By COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
The white and blue bus sat near the edge of downtown Tampa, on a small plot that had recently been named "Romneyville" as protesters from around the country gathered to pitch tents and unroll sleeping bags.
Blue lettering spelled out the words Mobile Broadcast News on the side of the bus. Inside, the vehicle was outfitted with bunks, sconce lights and a ventilation fan.
Working in the cramped interior were Chappell Howard and Flux Rostrum, who sat at wooden tables where three laptops displayed images that had been recorded on video earlier that day. 
Mr. Rostrum, who has traveled the country for years filming protests, said that the bus, a 1995 International Bluebird that runs on recycled vegetable oil, would be a headquarters for people documenting rallies, marches and other street actions during both the Republican and Democratic conventions.
As protesters trickled into Tampa before the convention, videographers were joined by another sort of documentarian, called livestreamers, who broadcast events on the Web in real time.
That sort of immediate dissemination of raw footage, Mr. Rostrum said, had provided a potent tool to show interactions between police and the public and to create a record of fleeting, sometimes chaotic moments that otherwise might be lost to conflicting memories.
"They can't say you're editing it and twisting the story," he said on Friday. "It's live, happening right in front of you."
During the convention, he said, he and others would be broadcasting their footage on the Mobile Broadcast Web site.
Video has played a significant role during recent conventions and large-scale protests. Mr. Rostrum was among a group of people who contributed footage from the 2004 convention in New York to a collective called I-Witness Video. After the convention, video assembled by the group was used to refute testimony by police officers in a court case involving the mass arrests of hundreds of protesters.
Four years later, during the Republican gathering in St. Paul, officers surrounded a house where about a dozen I-Witness members were staying, handcuffed them and held them for hours. None of the collective members were arrested but they said that the authorities looked through their computers and cameras.
Livestreaming was widely used by people connected to the Occupy Wall Street protests that began in New York last fall and then spread to dozens of other cities.
Mr. Rostrum said that he was running a 24-hour livestream from the bus showing "Romneyville," which was organized by a group called the Poor People's Economic Human Rights campaign. He said the stream showed the evolution of the encampment, which sprung up on Aug. 20 on a lot rented from an Army-Navy surplus store that stands about a mile from the Tampa Bay Times Forum where the Republican delegates will gather.
Mr. Rostrum said that before arriving in Florida he had been in West Virginia with his bus documenting conflicts between police officers, miners and people protesting strip mining.
Others in the slowly growing camp had also arrived from far-flung spots. There were people who had hitchhiked from places like Maryland, New York and North Carolina. There was a group that had traveled on a bus from Gainesville and a woman who had ridden a motorcycle about 100 miles from Orlando.
By Friday night about 30 tents had been pitched between the Army-Navy store and a ramp leading onto Interstate 275. As a breeze blew through the camp some of the inhabitants gathered under a black plastic tarp that stretched between Mr. Rostrum's bus and a nearly identical bus that housed a mobile kitchen that had last been used at the Rainbow Gathering, an annual utopian assembly that was held this year at Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee.
Those beneath the tent said that they had traveled to Tampa to exchange ideas, air opposition to the Republican platform and to try to grapple with what they described as disturbing realities that gripped the nation.
"I think a movement of ordinary people can mitigate some of the problems we have," said Tom Over, 44, an independent journalist who had arrived from Columbus, Ohio. "There's so much money in politics it's undermining our democracy."
Diamond Dan Whitaker, 74, from San Francisco, recited a short poem that he said "came to me like a revelation, like a voice in my head."
Some people ate rice and beans. Somebody scrubbed a kettle that had been used to prepare the meal. People sitting at a small wooden table stacked with fliers for upcoming protest marches listened to a jazz radio station as cars whizzed past toward the interstate. A helicopter with green and red lights made a few passes overhead.
Surveying the scene, Charlie Meyers, from Little Rock, Ark., said it reminded him of his first days at the Occupy Wall Street encampment last fall in New York.
"It's a lot like Zuccotti Park," Mr. Meyers, 22, said, "Except here we are allowed to have a kitchen."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Party of Factions Gathers, Seeking Consensus

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Mitt Romney arrives here this week to accept his nomination from the increasingly disparate coalition of factions known as the Republican Party, confronting the challenge of unifying them behind him and -- should he win -- exerting his own authority over a party that is in many ways still forging a post-Bush identity.
In interviews, Republican leaders said they were united and energized by the prospect of defeating President Obama and enacting bedrock Republican principles: shrinking the government and reducing spending and taxes.
At the same time, many said they were concerned about the crosscurrents that have churned the party, particularly since the emergence of the Tea Party movement three years ago. And on Sunday, thousands who supported the presidential campaign of Representative Ron Paul of Texas rallied here to challenge what they view as business as usual among Republicans. 
Some leaders expressed worry that the turn to contentious social issues in the days leading up to the Republican National Convention, where the party platform is likely to embrace a tough anti-abortion stance and strict curbs on immigration, could undercut the party's need to broaden its appeal. Many of them said they feared it was hastening a march to becoming a smaller, older, whiter and more male party.
''The Republican Party needs to re-establish its philosophy of the big tent with principles,'' said Dan Quayle, the Republican former vice president. ''The philosophy you hear from time to time, which is unfortunate, is one of exclusion rather than inclusion. You have to be expanding the base, expanding the party, because compared to the Democratic Party, the Republican Party is a minority party.''
George E. Pataki, the Republican former governor of New York, said he agreed with the Tea Party's principle of reducing taxes and the size of the government. But he said he was concerned that antigovernment sentiments advocated by some Tea Party activists could push the it out of the political mainstream.
''What I fear is that that very positive desire to limit the power and the role of the federal government could turn into a philosophy that is antigovernment,'' Mr. Pataki said. ''Sometimes, those who I fear have that antigovernment view, as opposed to the limited-government view, rise to the center of the nominating process. I think that is not a good thing for the Republican Party.''
It is common for parties out of power to suffer an extended identity crisis. The Democrats struggled for 12 years until Bill Clinton emerged to unite left and center in an uneasy alliance to capture the White House. It has been happening to Republicans for at least four years as different conservative factions have competed for dominance and as outside forces, from the grass-roots Tea Party activists to ''super PACs'' and other groups financed by wealthy conservatives, have to some degree undercut the party establishment.
But in some ways, the Republican Party today appears more factionalized -- ideologically, politically and culturally -- than Republican leaders said they could remember in recent history.
There are evangelicals, Tea Party adherents, supply-siders who would accept no tax increases and a dwindling band of deficit hawks who might. There are economic libertarians who share little of the passion that social conservatives hold on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage. There are neoconservatives who want a hard line against Iran and the Palestinians, and realists who are open to diplomatic deal-cutting.
More than anything, the party is racked by the challenge to the establishment from Tea Party outsiders, who are demanding a purge of incumbents who play by a set of rules that many of these Republicans reject.
''The party itself is in a transition time,'' said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 3 Republican in the House. Highlighting a shift in the House to a younger and less traditional generation of conservative leaders, he said, ''My theory is the Senate is like a country club and the House is much like having a breakfast at a truck stop.''
Representative Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican running for the Senate, said that if Republicans won in November, the magnitude of the country's fiscal problems -- and the general agreement among Republicans about addressing them by reducing spending -- would overcome any jockeying among factions.
''I think the fiscal issues we face are so big and so overwhelming that there's little reason to focus on the other things,'' Mr. Flake said. ''That makes it by definition easier to manage, because those issues are so big and require so much work.''
It may not be easy. When Republican leaders sought to push the party's nominee, Representative Todd Akin, out of the Senate race in Missouri, for saying women who are victims of ''legitimate rape'' rarely get pregnant, Mike Huckabee, the conservative talk-show host and 2008 presidential candidate, came to his defense.
''In a party that supposedly stands for life, it was tragic to see the carefully orchestrated and systematic attack on a fellow Republican,'' Mr. Huckabee wrote in an e-mail to supporters.
And the Tea Party's success in unseating establishment candidates who are willing to compromise has produced fissures between some of the party's older members and this new guard.
''For some folks in the party these days, it's not only the Washington establishment they're running against. They're opposed to anything that is perceived as being any kind of establishment, even if they are conservative,'' Mr. Quayle said. ''To me, that is craziness. The party has got some real challenges coming down the pike. It's a minority party, and we've got to realize that it's a game of addition, not subtraction.''
Dick Armey, a former House majority leader who leads FreedomWorks, an advocacy group that helped organize the Tea Party, rejected that sentiment.
''There's a tendency by a lot of folks that says, 'We have been doing business in the way we have for so many years here, we shouldn't be burdened by the election of so many people who want to make it difficult to continue doing business as usual,' '' he said.
''There's not a politician alive in the history of the world who doesn't say, 'If you'll elect me, I'll change the way I'll do business,' '' Mr. Armey said. ''The problem the establishment guys have is we're getting a bunch of guys elected who really mean what they say.''
Frank Keating, a former governor of Oklahoma, said the push by the Tea Party had a positive influence on his party.
''The Tea Party's presence in the Republican Party is healthy for this reason: It moves the debate to the right,'' he said. ''The Republican Party, my party, needs to move in the direction of fiscal sanity.''
Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican who defeated the party's incumbent, Bob Bennett, in 2010, said his victory reflected voter frustration with the way both parties had dealt with spending and taxes. He pointed to upsets this year in Indiana, where Senator Richard G. Lugar was defeated in the Republican primary by Richard E. Mourdock, a challenger supported by conservatives and Tea Party groups, and Texas, where Ted Cruz, a Tea Party candidate, won the Republican nomination for Senate by beating the candidate backed by Gov. Rick Perry, a conservative Republican.
''A lot of that has resulted from the fact that the federal government has grown so much just in the last two years at an outstanding rate,'' Mr. Lee said. ''That caused a lot of voters to ask questions that they might not have been so inclined to ask a few years ago.''

HEADLINE: Neil Armstrong Dies at 82; Made 'Giant Leap' as First Man on the Moon

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD; John Schwartz contributed reporting. Susan C. Beachy contributed research.

 BODY:
Neil Armstrong, who made the ''giant leap for mankind'' as the first human to set foot on the Moon, died on Saturday. He was 82.
His family said in a statement that the cause was ''complications resulting from cardiovascular procedures.'' He had undergone heart bypass surgery this month in Cincinnati, near where he lived. His recovery had been going well, according to those who spoke with him after the surgery, and his death came as a surprise to many close to him, including his fellow Apollo astronauts.
The family did not say where he died.
A quiet, private man, at heart an engineer and crack test pilot, Mr. Armstrong made history on July 20, 1969, as the commander of the Apollo 11 spacecraft on the mission that culminated the Soviet-American space race in the 1960s. President John F. Kennedy had committed the nation ''to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth.'' It was done with more than five months to spare. 
On that day, Mr. Armstrong and his co-pilot, Col. Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., known as Buzz, steered their lunar landing craft, Eagle, to a level, rock-strewn plain near the southwestern shore of the Sea of Tranquillity. It was touch and go the last minute or two, with computer alarms sounding and fuel running low. But they made it.
''Houston, Tranquillity Base here,'' Mr. Armstrong radioed to mission control. ''The Eagle has landed.''
''Roger, Tranquillity,'' mission control replied. ''We copy you on the ground. You've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.''
The same could have been said for hundreds of millions of people around the world watching on television.
A few hours later, there was Mr. Armstrong bundled in a white spacesuit and helmet on the ladder of the landing craft. Planting his feet on the lunar surface, he said, ''That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.'' (His words would become the subject of a minor historical debate, as to whether he said ''man'' or an indistinct ''a man.'')
Soon Colonel Aldrin joined Mr. Armstrong, bounding like kangaroos in the low lunar gravity, one-sixth that of Earth's, while the command ship pilot, Michael Collins, remained in orbit about 60 miles overhead, waiting their return. In all, 12 American astronauts walked on the Moon between then and the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.
The Apollo 11 mission capped a tumultuous and consequential decade. The '60s in America had started with such promise, with the election of a youthful president, mixed with the ever-present anxieties of the cold war. Then it touched greatness in the civil rights movement, only to implode in the years of assassinations and burning city streets and campus riots. But before it ended, human beings had reached that longtime symbol of the unreachable.
The moonwalk lasted 2 hours and 19 minutes, long enough to let the astronauts test their footing in the fine and powdery surface -- Mr. Armstrong noted that his boot print was less than an inch deep -- and set up a television camera and scientific instruments and collect rock samples.
After news of Mr. Armstrong's death was reported, President Obama, in a statement from the White House, said, ''Neil was among the greatest of American heroes.''
''And when Neil stepped foot on the surface of the Moon for the first time,'' the president added, ''he delivered a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten.''
Charles F. Bolden Jr., the current NASA administrator, said, ''As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own.''
Mr. Bolden also noted that in the years after the moonwalk, Mr. Armstrong ''carried himself with a grace and humility that was an example to us all.'' The historian Douglas Brinkley, who interviewed Mr. Armstrong for a NASA oral history, described him as ''our nation's most bashful Galahad.'' His family called him ''a reluctant hero who always believed he was just doing his job.''
Indeed, some space officials have cited these characteristics, as well as his engineering skills and experience piloting X-15 rocket planes, as reasons that Mr. Armstrong stood out in the astronaut corps. After the postflight parades and a world tour for the three Apollo 11 astronauts, Mr. Armstrong gradually withdrew from the public eye. He was not reclusive, but as much as possible he sought to lead a private life, first as an associate administrator in the space program and then as a university professor and director of a number of corporations.
Neil Alden Armstrong was born on Aug. 5, 1930, in the small town of Wapakoneta, Ohio, to Stephen Armstrong and the former Viola Louise Engel. His father was a state auditor, which meant the family moved every few years to a new Ohio town while Neil was growing up. At the age of 6, Neil took a ride with his father in a Ford Trimotor airplane, known as the Tin Goose. It must have made an impression, for by the time he was 15 he had learned to fly, even before he got his driver's license.
Neil became an Eagle Scout when the family later moved back to Wapakoneta, where he finished high school. (The town now has a museum named for Mr. Armstrong.) From there, he went to Purdue University as an engineering student on a Navy scholarship. His college years were interrupted by the Korean War, in which Mr. Armstrong was a Navy fighter pilot who flew 78 combat missions, one in which he was forced to eject after the plane lost one of its ailerons, the hinged flight-control panels on the wings.
In ''First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong'' (2005), James R. Hansen wrote that in Mr. Armstrong's first year at Purdue, Charles E. Yeager broke the sound barrier in the rocket-powered Bell X-1. It was exciting but bittersweet for the young student. He thought aviation history had already passed him by.
''All in all, for someone who was immersed in, fascinated by, and dedicated to flight,'' Mr. Armstrong told his biographer, ''I was disappointed by the wrinkle in history that had brought me along one generation late. I had missed all the great times and adventures in flight.''
During the Korean War, Mr. Armstrong was in the unit the author James A. Michener wrote about in ''The Bridges at Toko-Ri.'' Back at Purdue after the Navy, Mr. Armstrong plunged more earnestly into aeronautical engineering studies, his grades rising and a career in sight.
By this time he had also met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, a student in home economics from Evanston, Ill. Soon after his graduation, they were married, in January 1956.
They had two sons, Eric and Mark, who survive. A daughter, Karen, died of an inoperable brain tumor in 1962. The couple were divorced in 1994. In 1999, Mr. Armstrong married Carol Knight, a widow 15 years his junior; she also survives. They lived in Indian Hill, a suburb of Cincinnati.
Other survivors include a stepson and stepdaughter; a brother, Dean; a sister, June Armstrong Hoffman; and 10 grandchildren.
After his first marriage, the newlyweds moved to California, where Mr. Armstrong had been hired as an experimental test pilot for the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, the forerunner of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, at Edwards Air Force Base. His first flight in a rocket plane was in the Bell X-1B, a successor to the plane Mr. Yeager had first flown faster than the speed of sound.
Mr. Armstrong impressed his peers. Milt Thompson, one of the test pilots, said he was ''the most technically capable of the early X-15 pilots.'' Another colleague, Bill Dana, said he ''had a mind that absorbed things like a sponge and a memory that remembered them like a photograph.'' He made seven X-15 flights at 4,000 miles per hour, reaching the edge of space, and piloted many more of the most innovative and dangerous aircraft ever developed.
In 1958, Mr. Armstrong was chosen as a consultant for a military space plane project, the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and he was later named one of the pilots. But the young test pilot was attracted by another opportunity. NASA was receiving applications for the second group of astronauts, after the Mercury Seven. His reputation after seven years at the NASA flight center at Edwards had preceded him, and so he was tapped for the astronaut corps.
''I thought the attractions of being an astronaut were actually, not so much the Moon, but flying in a completely new medium,'' Mr. Armstrong told his biographer.
At Houston, the new astronaut began training for flights in the two-person Gemini spacecraft, the successor to the smaller Mercury capsules and forerunner to the three-person Apollos. Mr. Armstrong became the first American civilian astronaut to fly in space, as commander of Gemini 8. He and his co-pilot, David R. Scott, were launched on March 16, 1966. They performed the first successful docking of two vehicles in space, their Gemini linking with an unmanned Agena in an essential test for later operations on lunar flights.
Once docked, however, the joined spacecraft began to roll. Attempts to steady the vehicle were unavailing. On instructions from Mission Control, Mr. Armstrong separated Gemini from the Agena, but the rolling only increased, to the point that the astronauts were in danger of passing out. The problem was evidently in the Gemini itself. The astronauts turned the control thrusters off, switching to the re-entry control system. Stability was restored, but once the re-entry propulsion was activated, the crew was told to prepare to come home before the end of their only day in orbit.
Next, Mr. Armstrong was the backup commander for Apollo 8, the first flight to circumnavigate the Moon, doing so at Christmastime in 1968. It was the mission that put Apollo back on track after a cockpit fire during a launching pad rehearsal had killed three astronauts in January 1967. And it put Mr. Armstrong in position to command Apollo 11.
If everything went well with the lunar module test on Apollo 9 and with a shakedown flight to lunar orbit on Apollo 10, then Mr. Armstrong was in line to land on the Moon with Buzz Aldrin, with Michael Collins as the command module pilot. As the commander, NASA officials decided, Mr. Armstrong would be the first to walk on the Moon.
About six and a half hours after the landing, Mr. Armstrong opened the hatch of the four-legged lunar module and slowly made his way down the ladder to the lunar surface. A television camera followed his every step for all the world to see. A crater near the landing site is named in Mr. Armstrong's honor.
Mr. Armstrong and Colonel Aldrin left a plaque on the Moon that read: ''Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.''
After leaving the space program, Mr. Armstrong was careful to do nothing to tarnish that image or achievement. Though he traveled and gave speeches -- as he did in October 2007, when he dedicated the new Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering at Purdue -- he rarely gave interviews and avoided the spotlight.
In the biography ''First Man,'' Dr. Hansen noted, ''Everyone gives Neil the greatest credit for not trying to take advantage of his fame, not like other astronauts have done.'' To which Janet Armstrong responded: ''Yes, but look what it's done to him inside. He feels guilty that he got all the acclaim for an effort of tens of thousands of people.'' Then she added: ''He's certainly led an interesting life. But he took it too seriously to heart.''
For a time he was an associate NASA administrator for aeronautics, but he tired of a Washington desk job. Ignoring many high-level offers in business and academia, he returned to Ohio as a professor of aeronautical engineering at the University of Cincinnati and bought a farm near Lebanon, Ohio. He also served as a director for several corporations.
''He remained an advocate of aviation and exploration throughout his life and never lost his boyhood wonder of these pursuits,'' his family said in the statement.
Mr. Armstrong re-entered the public spotlight a couple of years ago to voice sharp disagreement with Mr. Obama for canceling NASA's program to send astronauts back to the Moon. He later testified to a Senate committee, expressing skepticism that the approach of relying on commercial companies would succeed.
Last September, Mr. Armstrong testified to a House committee that NASA ''must find ways of restoring hope and confidence to a confused and disconsolate work force.''
Almost as soon as the news of his death was announced, there was an outpouring of well wishes and fond memorials on Web sites and social media, a reflection of the extraordinary public acclaim that came to a very private man.
''As much as Neil cherished his privacy, he always appreciated the expressions of good will from people around the world and from all walks of life,'' his family said. ''While we mourn the loss of a very good man, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true, to be willing to explore and push the limits, and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves.''

HEADLINE: Right Rules, but Centrists Lead Tickets

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Ever since Ronald Reagan, the Republican Party has moved steadily to the right. Yet in Tampa, Florida, this week, for the seventh consecutive time, Republicans will nominate a mainstream presidential candidate after rejecting movement conservatives.
No one would confuse Willard Mitt Romney with a populist or movement conservative; he oozes establishment. So did the other nominees since Mr. Reagan: George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, George W. Bush and John McCain.
Like those predecessors, Mr. Romney calculated the formula for winning the nomination, says Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in California, and an academic authority on the Republican Party: ''Just conservative enough to get moderate traditionalists and a chunk of movement conservatives.'' 
That, he recalls, was the model George H.W. Bush inaugurated in 1988. In fact, Mr. Pitney said, ''Romney reminds me a lot of that President Bush, minus the war heroism.''
Is this formula permanent or is it ephemeral?
Vin Weber, a former congressman from Minnesota and a Republican luminary, believes it may be more deeply ingrained. ''Reagan believed in a mixed system, conservative but with an appreciation of the safety net, a coherent governing philosophy,'' he said. ''What most Americans want is an activist, limited government.''
Not so, says Richard Viguerie, one of the oldest veterans of the far-right movement. ''This is the last time the establishment will have operational control of a convention,'' the 78-year-old activist proclaimed. The grass-roots, ideologically driven base typified by the Tea Party movement, he says, is maturing into full control.
The establishment Republicans generally hold more moderate views, some having grown up in the party, others coming from business, and all with a general appreciation of an ''activist, limited government.''
Movement conservatives are motivated by ideology -- sometimes small-government economics, other times the religious social agenda. They range from Paul D. Ryan, the small-government, economic-policy-savvy vice-presidential candidate, to Todd Akin, the Missouri Senate contender who suggested last week that it is rare for women to become pregnant as a result of rape.
From Washington to the state capitals to the local level, the movement conservatives are in the ascendancy. For years, the Republican base was divided; it's now dominated by the movement types.
A comparison of Mr. Reagan's last year in office to today illustrates the dramatic change. Then, more than one-third of Senate Republicans were either genuine liberals like Mark Hatfield, Lowell Weicker and Arlen Specter or moderates like Bill Cohen, Bob Packwood and Nancy Kassebaum. With the retirement of Olympia Snowe of Maine, there will be no more than two or three moderate Republicans in the Senate next year.
A quarter-century ago, there were dozens of moderate Republicans in the House. Today there are very few House Republicans who break with conservative orthodoxy.
The changes are equally dramatic at the state and local level. Moderate Republican governors are relics. In Kansas this month, the far right, led by the state's conservative governor, drummed a number of the Bob Dole-type centrist Republicans out of the party.
Yet movement conservatives have never been able to rally behind a single strong contender in the race for the presidential nomination. Pat Robertson, Patrick Buchanan and Steve Forbes aroused passions in part of the base. None possessed broad appeal. The one who might have come the closest was Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, who was the runner-up to Mr. McCain in 2008. Religious conservatives loved Mr. Huckabee and, though he was suspect to supply-side economic conservatives, he had some draw beyond his core constituency.
Mr. Huckabee would most likely have been the strongest rival to Mr. Romney in 2012. He decided, however, not to run. Thus, the moderate former Massachusetts governor faced the weakest primary field in modern memory.
The candidacy of the businessman Herman Cain, who led the field at one stage, was a joke; former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania was too angry and too narrow, and a former House speaker, Newt Gingrich, never held consistent conservative convictions. The one with the best chance, Governor Rick Perry of Texas, proved to be a disastrous candidate, making Mr. Romney's task relatively simple.
More than a few movement conservatives who want to defeat President Barack Obama see the Promised Land ahead, win or lose in November. They believe there is a core of ideologically driven younger Republicans who will replace the party's congressional leaders and will be positioned to nominate one of their own the next time. At the top of that list might be Mr. Romney's chosen running mate, Mr. Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin whom many of these politicos on the right see as a younger Mr. Reagan.
He would turn Mr. Pitney's maxim upside down and galvanize the movement conservatives while getting a chunk of the moderate traditionalists.

HEADLINE: The Last Bipartisan

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
WHEN I first encountered Ron Wyden in 1974, he was setting up the Oregon outpost of the Gray Panthers, a lobby group founded by the liberal activist Maggie Kuhn with a broad agenda but an emphasis on empowering the elderly. Wyden, who was 25, seemed improbably boyish to be a champion of senior citizens. But he radiated a winning, wonky exuberance. He was clearly bound for a life in politics. He won an insurgent campaign for a House seat in 1980, graduated to the Senate in 1996 -- and now, at age 63, has spent almost exactly half his life on Capitol Hill. 
If the name rings a bell, it's probably because Senator Wyden -- without really deserving it -- has become a bumper sticker in the Republican presidential campaign. Wyden, an Obama Democrat, co-authored a Medicare reform proposal with Paul Ryan last year, a precursor to the Ryan budget plan that Democrats have pilloried as a heartless effort to throw grandma and grandpa off the train. When Romney and Ryan refer to their Medicare thinking as ''bipartisan,'' as they do ceaselessly, they mean Ron Wyden. In truth, Wyden never subscribed to the most draconian aspects of the Ryan blueprint, but the fact that the Romney-Ryan ticket uses his name as cover has not endeared Wyden to his own party. Charles Pope, the Washington correspondent for Wyden's hometown paper, The Oregonian, began a thoughtful analysis of the senator's predicament this way: ''Trail blazer or traitor?''
We'll get back to Medicare in a moment, but let's linger a bit on what this episode tells us about the decline of the honorable craft of lawmaking.
Back in the day, when Wyden was young and Congress was held in slightly higher esteem, it was common and respectable for lawmakers who disagreed about most things to meet up on a patch of common ground. Ted Kennedy, the iconic liberal, and Orrin Hatch, an uberconservative, often joined forces to expand health care for children or to protect the rights of the disabled. John McCain -- an earlier, less cynical version of John McCain -- was an aisle-crosser of the first order on issues like immigration. A willingness to forge such alliances used to be taken as evidence that one put the country's business above party conformity. It let Republicans show they had a heart and Democrats show they could be hardheaded. Nobody embraced this tradition more enthusiastically than Ron Wyden.
What happened? For one thing, the Newt Gingrich/Tom DeLay/Karl Rove/Eric Cantor school of constant, never-give-an-inch partisan combat happened. The Tea Party happened, purging moderates and putting the fear of compromise into the Orrin Hatches. The permanent re-election campaign happened: members of Congress now regard Capitol Hill as a place they drop by on breaks from fund-raising and town meetings, so that instead of forging constructive relationships, Congress is often about striking poses. And our broader political culture became a cluster of echo chambers. ''I never envisioned a day,'' Wyden told me recently, ''when, from an ideological standpoint, people would have their own television stations'' -- Fox for the right, MSNBC for the left, news that keeps us apart.
Nowadays, Wyden is like the Amur tiger or the ivory-billed woodpecker -- if not the last of his breed, at best a very endangered species. Still, he persists in cornering colleagues who would disagree with him 95 percent of the time -- Judd Gregg, Dan Coats, Darrell Issa, Marco Rubio, Scott Brown, Paul Ryan -- and engaging them on the 5 percent where they might get something done. On tax reform, copyright protection, Internet freedom, education and especially health care, Wyden has found unlikely partners from the other side. These joint ventures rarely get adopted wholesale, but interesting elements find their way into the debate, and into the law. A fairly typical example: Wyden and Brown, the Massachusetts Tea Party favorite, designed an amendment to the Affordable Care Act that lets states opt out if they can provide equivalent benefits and quality of care some other way. After much Democratic harrumphing, President Obama bought it. (Coming as he does from a relatively progressive and inventive state, Wyden is more open than many Democrats to treating the states as laboratories for new ideas, as long as the federal government enforces minimum standards.)
I once asked a Wyden aide whether the senator ever showed signs of despair at the increasingly toxic climate. ''You know,'' the aide replied, ''I've been trying to figure the guy out for about six years now and I honestly think that while the stuff that goes on here makes the rest of us tired, angry and cynical, it just makes him that much more determined to find a way to fix it. Seriously, after taking a three-year beating trying to push bipartisan health reform, he walks into my office and says, 'Great, now we're going to do bipartisan tax reform.' I admire the hell out of him for it, but sometimes I want to throw things at him.''
When I reached him in Oregon the other day, Wyden was preparing to fly up to Alaska to see if he and Lisa Murkowski, a drill-baby-drill Republican senator, could work through the gridlock on energy policy.
For evidence that legislative odd-coupling can be a thankless exercise, let's return to Wyden's attempt to tackle Medicare.
Last year Wyden and Ryan held a news conference to release their plan. It would leave Medicare intact for anyone 55 and over, but give the next wave of retirees a menu of options including traditional Medicare and private insurance plans that would compete in local auctions. (The system resembles the insurance exchanges envisioned in the Affordable Care Act, a k a Obamacare.) By introducing a measure of choice and competition Wyden hoped to prod health care providers toward more efficient practices and reap savings that could be used to ensure the long-term survival of Medicare.
The Ryan-Wyden proposal tasked the federal government to enforce basic protections for the vulnerable. It made Medicare more progressive, by requiring that the wealthy pay higher premiums. But, as Wyden says, the plan ''put Medicare on a budget,'' allowed to grow only 1 percent faster than G.D.P. unless Congress intervened.
Many in his own party saw this as sacrilege, or at least a slippery slope. Liberals complained that the plan, by diverting some beneficiaries into private plans, would weaken Medicare's power to bargain for lower prices. Wyden's response: ''Folks, 10,000 people are going to turn 65 every day for the next 20 years. Those of us who care about protecting the Medicare guarantee, we're going to have to find a way to make some tough decisions.''
When Ryan drafted the budget that has become the Republican Party's manifesto, he moved the goal posts. The Republican plan, unlike Ryan-Wyden, slashes Medicaid for the poor. By repealing Obamacare, it discards that law's attempts to rein in health care costs, which Wyden rightly says are insufficient but represent a start. The budget bill was in these essential ways a repudiation of the Ryan-Wyden exercise in bipartisanship. The Oregon senator decried them and voted against them. But Wyden's reward for collaborating with Ryan is that the Republicans treat him as a trophy and his own party treats him as a patsy. (The Gray Panthers aren't very happy with him either.)
Wyden has already told Ryan he hopes to work with him again, and he declines to say an unkind word about the vice-presidential hopeful, which is pretty generous given the plausible suspicion that Ryan just wanted him along for window dressing.
''Bipartisanship is not for the fainthearted,'' says Wyden, who seems to be disillusion-proof.
But this episode may well shrink the already diminished pool of lawmakers who are willing to buck party orthodoxy, and that is sad. Whatever the outcome in November, a president and Congress will return to Planet Washington in desperate need of some solutions -- not least on Medicare. They will need all the Ron Wydens they can get.

HEADLINE: The Comeback Skid

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
There will be two big stars at the Republican National Convention, and neither of them will be Mitt Romney. One will, of course, be Paul Ryan, Mr. Romney's running mate. The other will be Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, who will give the keynote address. And while the two men could hardly look or sound more different, they are brothers under the skin.
How so? Both have carefully cultivated public images as tough, fiscally responsible guys willing to make hard choices. And both public images are completely false. 
I've written a lot lately deconstructing the Ryan myth, so let me turn today to Mr. Christie.
When Mr. Christie took office in January 2010, New Jersey -- like many other states -- was in dire fiscal straits thanks to the effects of a depressed economy. Unlike the federal government, states are required by their constitutions to run more or less balanced budgets every year (although there is room for accounting gimmicks), so like other governors, Mr. Christie was forced to engage in belt-tightening.
So far so normal: while Mr. Christie has made a lot of noise about his tough budget choices, other governors have done much the same. Nor has he eschewed budget gimmicks: like earlier New Jersey governors, Mr. Christie has closed budget gaps in part by deferring required contributions to state pension funds, which is in effect a form of borrowing against the future, and he has also sought to paper over budget gaps by diverting money from places like the Transportation Trust Fund.
If there is a distinctive feature to New Jersey's belt-tightening under Mr. Christie, it is its curiously selective nature. The governor was willing to cancel the desperately needed project to build another rail tunnel linking the state to Manhattan, but has invested state funds in a megamall in the Meadowlands and a casino in Atlantic City.
Also, while much of his program involves spending cuts, he has effectively raised taxes on low-income workers and homeowners by slashing tax credits. But he vetoed a temporary surcharge on millionaires while refusing to raise the state's gasoline tax, which is the third-lowest in America and far below tax rates in neighboring states. Only some people, it seems, are expected to make sacrifices.
But as I said, Mr. Christie talks a good (and very loud) game about his willingness to make tough choices, making big claims about spending cuts -- claims, by the way, that PolitiFact has unequivocally declared false. And for the past year he has been touting what he claims is the result of those tough choices: the ''Jersey comeback,'' the supposed recovery of his state's economy.
Strange to say, however, Mr. Christie has told reporters that he won't use the term ''Jersey comeback'' in his keynote address. And it's not hard to see why: the comeback, such as it was, has hit the skids. Indeed, the latest figures show his state with the fourth-highest unemployment rate in the nation. Strikingly, New Jersey's 9.8 percent unemployment rate is now significantly higher than the unemployment rate in long-suffering Michigan, which has had a true comeback thanks to the G.O.P.-opposed auto bailout.
Now, state governors don't actually have much impact on short-run economic performance, so the skidding New Jersey economy isn't really Mr. Christie's fault. Still, he was the one who chose to make it an issue. And even more important, he's still pushing the policies the state's recovery was supposed to justify.
You see, all that boasting about the Jersey comeback wasn't just big talk (although it was that, too). It was, instead, supposed to demonstrate that good times were back, revenue was on the upswing, and it was now time for what Mr. Christie really wants: a major cut in income taxes.
Even if the comeback were real, this would be a highly dubious idea. By all accounts, New Jersey still has a significant structural deficit, that is, a deficit that will persist even when the economy recovers. Furthermore, the Christie tax-cut proposal would do very little for the middle class but give large breaks to the wealthy.
But in any case, the good times are by no means back, and neither is the revenue boom that was supposed to justify a tax cut. So has the very responsible Mr. Christie accepted the idea of at least delaying his tax-cut plan until the promised revenue gains materialize? Of course not.
Which brings me back to the comparison with Paul Ryan. Mr. Ryan, as people finally seem to be realizing, is at heart a fiscal fraud, boasting about his commitment to deficit reduction but actually placing a much higher priority on tax cuts for the wealthy. Mr. Christie may have a different personal style, but he's playing the same game.
In other words, meet the new boaster, same as the old boaster. And pray that we won't get fooled again.

HEADLINE: The Amtrak Option

 BODY:
Helped by the high cost of gasoline and airline tickets, Amtrak is doing very well. The railroad recently announced that when given a choice between air or rail, three-quarters of travelers between New York and Washington take the train. Between New York and Boston, more than half prefer the rails. One of the biggest impediments to further growth is the pair of 100-year-old tunnels under the Hudson River -- one going in each direction between New Jersey and New York City. The tunnels operate at capacity, creating a bottleneck that will only grow worse as the metropolitan area's population grows. It's obviously time for a new tunnel complex. 
Overall rail ridership is expected to reach 43 million a year across the nation by 2040. To improve service in the Northeast, Amtrak officials are envisioning a ride of about three hours between Boston and Washington on high-speed rail with sustained maximum speeds of 220 miles per hour, comparable to trains in Europe and Japan, all of which have substantial government support.
While some leaders understand the need for new investment, many Republicans are speeding in the wrong direction. Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, scrapped the most recent proposal in 2010, in the process forfeiting billions of dollars in federal aid mainly to burnish his political credentials as a cost-cutting Republican. That proposal was budgeted at about $9 billion. The cost is now estimated at $14.7 billion.
The Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, has promised that, if elected, he would cut Amtrak's $1.5 billion annual federal subsidy. That is no way to run a railroad, especially one whose popular East Coast route is vital to the region's economic prosperity and, of course, to the state Mr. Romney served as governor.
Mr. Romney, Mr. Christie and their Republican colleagues in Washington should be doing everything in their power to improve train service, not stand in the way.

HEADLINE: Two Campaigns With Styles as Similar as Red and Blue

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
BETTENDORF, Iowa -- Mitt Romney's campaign events are an homage to patriotism and Americana, draped with flags large enough to be hung 70 feet high from a crane and drenched in Rodney Atkins country music so loud that the speakers throb.
They rouse audiences to their feet with Mr. Romney's promises to repeal President Obama's health care law (''on Day 1!'') and build the Keystone XL pipeline (''if I have to do it myself!''). 
They are a place for voters, mostly white and older, to channel their economic apprehensions about big government into homemade bumper stickers denouncing ''O-bum-a'' and T-shirts declaring ''I am pro-America, anti-Obama.''
What they are not: subtle.
At his rally here a few days ago, Mr. Romney wanted to lampoon the president for saying that small businesses rely on government infrastructure to succeed. ''If you've got a business -- you didn't build that,'' Mr. Obama had said at the time.
Mr. Romney's aides scheduled a rally on the factory floor of a small family-owned aluminum manufacturing company, hoisted a banner on two forklifts that blared ''We Did Build It,'' outfitted employees with navy blue T-shirts that read ''Government Didn't Build My Business -- I Did,'' and introduced the company's founder as ''someone that did build that.''
Get the message?
A year into his run for the White House, Mr. Romney remains something of a mystery to many Americans, polls show. But there may be no better encapsulation of Mr. Romney as a candidate, a communicator and a leader than the hundreds of small-town rallies, speeches and pizza parlor drop-ins that he has presided over since last spring.
Like him, they are highly polished and hyper-scripted, earnest, and efficient, and they tell the story of a man who sees himself as a Captain Turnaround, prepared to pull off his biggest rescue operation yet.
In Hobbs, N.M., on Thursday, a pair of 18,000-watt floodlights bathed Mr. Romney in a camera-ready glow, even though he was standing outdoors, in the middle of the day.
A Romney rally frequently feels like a movie version of a campaign event. In many ways, it is. His events are designed, above all, for a television audience, which may explain why hundreds of people are packed into sometimes uncomfortably warm factories, where they fan themselves with any available object.
And they also must beware of the cameras: aides routinely tap parents on the arm and gently ask them to remove the children perched on their shoulders, who are blocking the camera's view of Mr. Romney.
Aides hand out small flags, posters and handmade signs with messages that sometimes feel less than organic: ''America's Greatest Generation Needs the Comeback Team'' of Mr. Romney and Paul D. Ryan, read one in Goffstown, N.H.
Holes in the crowd are stamped out like brush fires. ''I don't want to see those empty seats,'' an aide warned volunteers at the New Hampshire rally on Monday. In minutes, they were filled.
The show almost always starts on time. Mr. Romney loathes being late. When snowy weather put him behind schedule in Johnstown, Colo., Mr. Romney insisted on videoconferencing himself in to apologize to the crowd: ''How late are we? Fifteen, 20 minutes late?'' he asked, then delivered a mini-speech to tide the audience over.
The ideal Romney speech is about 1,900 words and 20 minutes, shorter than a Bill Clinton talk but longer than the Gettysburg Address.
Strip away the obligatory tributes to local officials and the odes to his wife, Ann, and the message is this: Mitt Romney stands for freedom, free markets and economic recovery, Barack Obama for government, regulation and broken promises.
In Mr. Romney's telling, the president ''doesn't understand how the economy works'' and has ''tried to substitute government for free people.''
The most commonly used word in a Romney speech, after ''the'' and ''Obama,'' is undoubtedly ''free'' or ''freedom.'' (''It is free men and women that drive our economy,'' he says, followed by ''freedom is what makes America work.'')
If Mr. Romney is the leading man in his quest for the White House, his hands are best supporting actors.
He uses them, high school teacher style, to count each of the five points of his economic plan. He uses them to emphasize a comment shouted from the crowd, offering a thumbs up or a pumped fist. His hands become restless tools of emphasis, plunging down as he talks about lowering taxes and surging up as he assails the president for higher deficits.
When Mr. Romney pauses on the stage or at the lectern, he stands ramrod straight, chest out, arms fully extended downward at his side, tilting slightly forward -- a habit, projecting stiffness and formality, that his aides find a bit off-putting.
At the end of every event, Mr. Romney walks offstage to greet voters, sometimes for longer periods than he has actually spoken. He works the rope line methodically, diligently and perfunctorily. He powers his way through, shaking with one hand and using the other to half-clasp or half-pat the forearm. He rarely pauses for lengthy exchanges -- even when offered up colorful stories, like a voter recalling Mr. Romney's father. He holds babies aloft but does not kiss them.
Finishing his speech in Hobbs, N.M., Mr. Romney started at the far end of the rope line, following the contours of the metal barriers, smiling and shaking and signing. Just over 15 minutes later, with a final wave, he disappeared inside a warehouse.

HEADLINE: Is a Youth Revolution Brewing in India?

BYLINE: SAMBUDDHA MITRA MUSTAFI


HIGHLIGHT: India's combination of young population and older leaders may spark major upheaval in the near future. 

 BODY:
Among the world's major countries, India has the youngest population, and the oldest leaders. A startling four-decade gap between the median age of India's people and that of its government officials most recently reared its head with a heavy-handed and widely-maligned crackdown on free speech on the Internet.
History shows us that generations with an exceptionally high youth ratio create political movements that shake up their systems and leave a profound impact on history. America's baby boomers - the 79 million people born between 1946 and 1964 - led the charge in the civil rights movement and the sexual revolution.

In China, out of the stormy Cultural Revolution emerged the country's current crop of leaders, who have taken it to remarkable heights of prosperity and power. More recently, in the Arab Spring there is evidence of a strong correlation between the ratio of the population under 25 and the urge to overthrow unresponsive governments.
Whether India will follow the same path may become apparent in the very near future.
There are some signs that the beginnings of India's own youth revolt are stirring - the "India Against Corruption" protests, which swept Delhi on Sunday, involved a about a thousand protesters, mostly young men, who broke through barricades meant to protect their elder politicians' homes and battled with the police.
The India Against Corruption political movement unleashes youth disenchantment against the establishment, using new means of communication like Twitter and Facebook as its fuel. Still, it is headed by an iconic 75-year-old Gandhian - call it shades of a youth movement, with the structure of a traditional Indian family.
India now has around 600 million people who are younger than 25, and nearly 70 percent of its 1.2 billion population is under 40. It is an unprecedented demographic condition in the history of modern India, and in absolute numbers it is unprecedented anywhere in the world. It also comes at a time when much of the developed world and China have aging populations.
The country's median age of 25 is in sharp contrast to the average age of its cabinet ministers, 65, which is a far bigger gap than in any other country - Brazil and China are next with age gaps just under 30 years. In the United States the gap is 23 years, and in Germany it is less than 10.
Beyond the Internet crackdown, there are other disturbing signs that the age and thought gap between the majority of India's citizens and their aging leaders is stifling India's teeming youth.
We see this at play when the chairwoman of the National Commission for Women tells women to "be careful about how you dress," after a young woman was sexually assaulted in public by a group of men in Guwahati.
We see it when a police officer wielding a hockey stick cracks down on Mumbai's buzzing night life, and is defended by the state's home minister. We see it in the inability to overhaul the country's jaded bureaucracy that stifles fresh ideas.
Most tellingly, perhaps, we see it in the lack of political will to open up key sectors of the economy like retail to foreign competition, under the populist pretense of protecting existing jobs. This protectionism is far removed from the economic realities of the past two decades - India has been one of the clear winners of globalization. But as one writer put it, "The decision-makers in the Indian political class are still stuck in the mental framework of the 1970s, which is when they were blooded in politics."
Because of these protectionist policies, millions of young Indians risk losing out on new jobs and technology that could substantially improve their lives.
Some may dismiss these as mostly urban issues, issues that do not affect India's vast rural youth. But the increasingly aspirational rural youth crave the lifestyle of their urban counterparts - and if they are not given the opportunity to get there quickly, they will have the incentive to rebel. The elite youth have the money, but crave the higher living standards of developed nations. And both groups care about jobs.
"The future of our country is today's youth and it is our responsibility to work for our country. It's a need for our country to elect right government. Educated youth are desperately needed in our politics" Neha a member of "Youth ki Awaaz" or voice of the youth posted on the online forum.
India's youthful population can be viewed as a double-edged sword - capable of bringing great benefit to the country in the decades ahead, but with extensive demands that, under current economic conditions, the country looks unable to fulfill.
A recent IMF report suggests that India's demographic dividend alone could contribute two percentage points to its annual G.D.P. growth for the next two decades, if the country adopts the right policies. A surge in the labor force with the right age structure, higher productivity due to urbanization, a low ratio of dependent people and an increased number of women joining the work force all add to this demographic dividend.
A 2010 Goldman Sachs paper projected that India's industry would need to create nearly 40 million jobs by the end of this decade to absorb this huge increase in the labor force. Aided by the demographic dividend, India could clock economic growth of 7 to 9 percent until 2030, possibly wiping out absolute poverty as we know it today, though the poverty line would then be readjusted.
Projections like this are dependent on several internal conditions - in India's case, that means changing its archaic land and labor laws, creating better trade opportunities and making huge investments in education and skills training. The state of the global economy will be a key external variable.
Another study shows that India will have 12 percent of the world's college graduates by 2020, more than the United States, and second only to China, which will have a staggering 29 percent share. These graduates, their innovations and their patents will be the main drivers of the knowledge economy.
In simple terms, India's huge working-age population could be its biggest economic strength going forward.
Yet if you look at the pace of economic and social changes in India, you begin to wonder if the country's geriatric political elite have grasped the enormous opportunities and challenges that the country's youth represent.
Some commentators now fear that India's much touted demographic dividend is on the verge of going horribly wrong - that the economy may not produce enough jobs to absorb the fast-growing labor force, leaving millions of young people feeling bitter and betrayed.
Until now, most of India's young people have preferred to be silent bystanders or armchair critics of the political system, rather than actively participating in the process. A big turnoff has been the entitlement culture in the country's politics - of the 38 youngest members of Parliament, 33 have parents who are also politicians. But then, this entitlement culture is not restricted to politics - you see it in every profession, in every Indian household to an extent.
While India's affluent parents are as well-meaning as any in the world, critics say the easy inheritance they give their children breeds smug, conformist individuals, under constant pressure to live up to a legacy, rather than chart their own course and fulfill their own potential.
The most glaring example today may be Rahul Gandhi, heir apparent of the governing Congress party, who at the age of 42 is still struggling to step out of his mother's immense political shadow.
Between the 1960s and 1990s, East Asia went through a demographic transition similar to that we are seeing in India now. Aided by the opening up of their economies, the Asian tigers and China registered high growth, rapid poverty reduction and social development.
In spite of this "miracle," many of these countries saw violent student movements against autocratic regimes, especially when faced with financial shocks.
India's demographic equation puts the ball firmly in the court of its young majority.
Faced with the prospect of a bleak future, will youthful energy challenge its sworn enemy - the status quo? Will India's younger generation strike back to install its own leaders and ideas? Or will it still remain aloof or just give up, and fall in line with the elders?

HEADLINE: Our Dis-Integrated Economy

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Outsourcing continues to grow and hampers job creation in the United States, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
During Mitt Romney's time at its helm, Bain Capital cleverly invested in, and made enormous profits from, companies that The Washington Post describes as "pioneers in the practice of shipping work from the United States to overseas call centers and factories making computer components."
Where pioneers have gone, settlers have followed. Today, outsourcing by the country's largest multinational corporations has become routine. 
The consequences for American workers and taxpayers have become increasingly visible. President Obama's television campaign ads now dramatize job loss resulting from relocation of investment to other countries. Regardless of whether these ads prove politically effective, they are likely to raise public awareness of an important economic trend. 
Globalization has been under way for centuries, in fits and starts. The process included the development of new trade routes and vast migratory flows to what Europeans termed a New World. For many years national policies shaped globalization's impact by restricting immigration. Today, however, technological agility threatens to render national borders almost irrelevant. 
The result is a process of strategic investment that often yields high profits without generating employment or tax revenues in the United States.

Many American companies rely heavily on subcontractors in other countries, minimizing both their production costs and their tax liabilities. 
As Professor Gerald Davis of the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan put it in a recent book, "Managed by the Markets," production has literally become dis-integrated. 
The very qualities that American capitalism prizes most - innovation, flexibility and single-minded pursuit of profits - have set it increasingly free of regulatory constraint. Paradoxically, this very freedom makes it increasingly hard for ordinary Americans to get a grip on the benefits.
In a paper presented at the recent meetings of the American Sociological Association in Denver, Professor Davis illustrated this point with a tongue-in-cheek guide to an instant start-up based on a marketing plan to sell imaginary (to date, at least) iPhone-based Remote Drone Assassins to neo-mercenary companies and other interested parties. 
A bright student could follow this seven-step guide using a laptop computer from the back seat of a large lecture hall while pretending to listen to an introductory economics lecture: 
1. Rent a desk in a shared office and garner a great-sounding business address at a "global accelerator," like the Plug and Play Tech Center (no need to actually sit there). 
2. Incorporate in Liberia by e-mail for $713.50 (further details at the Low Tax Global Tax and Business Portal). 
3. Crowd-source funding on a platform such as Kickstarter.
4. Hire programmers at an agency like ODesk to develop the application software. 
5. Contract with an overseas drone manufacturer using a service such as Alibaba.com. 
6. Set up a payment system with a company like Square.
7. Arrange shipping through a company like Shipwire (which describes itself as specializing in "outsourced e-commerce order fulfillment and logistics services for business"). 
I would add one more step: 
8. Renounce American citizenship and move to Singapore, as did the Facebook co-founder Eduardo Savarin. That would end your obligation as a citizen to pay income tax to the United States. 
Perhaps we should admire the brilliant entrepreneurs who are creating this brave new world. 
But we shouldn't depend on them for job creation, and it seems unlikely that the recent Jump-start Our Business Start-ups Act will have much employment impact. 
What we really need is some new economic software that could link technical innovation to decent jobs, investment in the next generation and environmental sustainability. 
Maybe we should try outsourcing a plan for economic reintegration, since we don't seem to be able to come up with one on our own.

Sales of new residential homes (PDF) also rise, and the housing recoveryappears to inch forward. Growth in the chemical industry is expected to remain slow through the end of the year. Carbon emissions drop, and Brad Plumer explains what trash tells us about the economy.
Cash Flow: Lending Problems 
Capital One says small-business finances improved in the last quarter, but an Irish-American pub owner is one of many entrepreneurs who have faced challenges securing a loan. Minorities have also struggled to get small-business recovery loans. Sian Phillips offers some tips for saving money at your office and your business.

Your landing page should not only contain a similar design aesthetic, but it should also contain the same value proposition and feature any offers mentioned on your display ad."
Red Tape Update: Costs and Benefits
The Postal Service versus Amtrak: which is more wasteful? A survey finds most small-business (PDF) respondents want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Edward Aldean says government regulations have both costs and benefits: "The burden of federal regulation has grown substantially over the past three decades, with real costs to U.S.-based manufacturing, and continues to grow. But the most costly regulations are those designed to improve air quality, reduce energy consumption and ensure safe working conditions - goals the public generally favors." This great graph shows marginal tax rates through history.

Tweets of the Week
@garyvee: I have no interest in making the most money in the world. I have an interest in having the most people at my funeral.
@PFripp: Shameless self-promotion is not only desirable, it's essential. Advertise yourself!
@ValaAfshar: Managers who are first interested, second interesting, will be successful with social media.
The Week's Bests
Steve Cooper says that one of the eight ways fantasy football can boost your business acumen is by teaching you not to draft Raiders: "Why? Because I really, really don't like the franchise. What this means in the business world is, don't go into business with a company or person that you don't like."
Anthony K. Tjan says that lack of guts may be the most common barrier to entrepreneurial success: "Guts are about having the courage to initiate, endure and evolve around an idea. This trait can be absolutely influenced, amplified or acquired over time - and building up guts may thus be the most important way in which entrepreneurs can be developed."

HEADLINE: Washington in Disarray

BYLINE: RICHARD SLOTKIN


HIGHLIGHT: As the Union retreated from Virginia, Lincoln faced the biggest crisis of his administration. 

 BODY:
Capt. Charles Francis Adams Jr., grandson and great-grandson of presidents and son of the current minister to Britain, arrived in Washington on Aug. 27, 1862. His regiment, the 1st Massachusetts Cavalry, had been hastily snatched from its operations on the South Carolina coast and shipped north to meet the emergency created by Gen. Robert E. Lee's stunning counteroffensive after the failure of the Union's Peninsula campaign. Adams knew the capital city well, and was appalled by its "atmosphere of treason, jealousy, and dissension" - more than usual, given the recriminations pouring forth as federal forces retreated.
Thirty miles to the southwest, Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia was beginning its disastrous struggle against Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in what would be known as the Second Battle of Bull Run. But what appalled Adams was not the impending defeat, but the deep and bitter antagonism between the officers of the Army of the Potomac and the Lincoln administration. 
The officers, under Gen. George B. McClellan, told Adams that Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, and the Radicals who supported him, had deliberately tried to sacrifice the Army to destroy or discredit their commander and boost Pope as his successor. Administration supporters responded in kind, accusing McClellan and his clique of deliberately stalling the war effort out of sympathy with the South. Stanton and Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase were circulating a petition among members of the cabinet calling for McClellan's court-martial - Chase thought McClellan should be shot as a conscious traitor. 
"The air of this city seems thick with treachery; our army seems in danger of utter demoralization," Adams wrote to his father. "Everything is ripe for a terrible panic, the end of which I cannot even imagine." It requires, he said, "good courage not to despair of the republic."
The crisis had begun early in July, when Lincoln realized that the war could not be won without a radical change of strategy. The South's willingness and ability to maintain the conflict could not be broken without larger and more energetic military offensives. Nor could the war be won without a direct attack on the institution of slavery, which was the basis of the South's political cohesion and economic strength. Indeed, as Lincoln saw it, the long, bloody war that was now in prospect could not be justified unless slavery, the root cause of the conflict, were removed. 
Lincoln had therefore decided to issue a proclamation emancipating all slaves in rebel-held territory. But he could not act until his armies won a military victory - otherwise his deeply principled decision would seem merely an act of desperation. By that summer, it seemed clear to him that one of the obstacles to that victory was McClellan, commander of the Army of the Potomac - and also the symbolic leader of the political opposition. 
McClellan was notoriously averse to rapid, aggressive action. Despite repeated orders from the president and General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck, he refused to advance against Lee's army defending Richmond, Va. McClellan's popularity with his soldiers made it difficult to remove him from command. So Lincoln and Halleck chose to transfer his army piecemeal back to Washington, mostly by transporting them by ship, leaving control of the front to General Pope and his Army of Virginia. McClellan, though still the titular head of the Army of the Potomac, was relegated to the operational sidelines. It was a terrible blunder. While McClellan's troops were at sea, Lee was able to concentrate his whole force against the hapless Pope. 
From his first appointment to high command, McClellan had toyed with the idea of a "dictatorship," albeit one not seized by coup but granted by an act of Congress. When that possibility faded, he politicked incessantly to force Lincoln to fire Secretary Stanton and accept McClellan as the dominant voice in military affairs. He considered himself the one man chosen by Divine Providence to save the republic: "I have no choice," he told his wife, "the people call upon me to save the country - I save it & cannot respect anything that stands in the way." He took pleasure in telling his wife, "I have commenced receiving letters from the North urging me to march on Washington & assume the Govt!!"
While Lee's campaign was developing, McClellan waged a war in the press against Stanton and Pope. He looked forward to the destruction of Pope's army as a judgment of God against those "dolts at Washington" who are "bent on my destruction." Once Pope was defeated, McClellan thought Halleck would have to restore him to full command. "I that with God's help I can save them," but he would refuse to do so unless they granted him "full & entire control." If his "coup," as he called it, was successful, "everything will be changed in this country so far as we are concerned & my enemies will be at my feet. It may go hard with some of them in that event, for I look upon them as the enemies of the country & of the human race . . . [If] I succeed my foot will be on their necks." Fitz-John Porter, McClellan's closest confidant, wrote to a friend: "Would that this army was in Washington to rid us of incumbents ruining our country."
From Aug. 27 to 30, while Pope's army was fighting and dying at Manassas, McClellan was in the Washington area, in charge of the two corps just arrived from Virginia. Despite repeated orders from Halleck, he refused to send reinforcements to Pope. He caviled, he stalled, he gave orders and then recalled them; at one point he declared it was better to "let Pope get out of his scrape as best he can" and save his own troops to defend Washington. Chase and Stanton called his actions treason. Even Lincoln thought them "unforgiveable." 
As Pope's defeated troops filtered back into Washington, the Lincoln administration faced its worst crisis yet. The choices were grim. Pope's defeat forced Lincoln to delay the Emancipation Proclamation indefinitely. Worse, the only general who could pull the Union Army together was the one man most adamantly opposed to everything Lincoln wanted - a man who would do things his own way, or not at all - a man who continually flirted with the idea of dictatorship. And to put him in command, Lincoln would have to defy his strongest cabinet ministers, Chase and Stanton, who thought McClellan should be shot as a traitor. But he did so on Sept. 2, by putting he put McClellan in charge of a reorganized Army of the Potomac that incorporated the remnants of Pope's Army of Virginia. The next day, Washington learned that Lee's forces had invaded Maryland. McClellan set off to confront them.
Lincoln ran the gravest risks by reappointing McClellan to command. If McClellan failed to repel Lee's invasion, the administration might be repudiated by voters in the coming mid-term elections. If McClellan succeeded, his prestige would be enormous, and he was bound to use it to overthrow Secretary of War Stanton and gain control of military policy. 
Even as his army was advancing toward its confrontation with Lee at Antietam, McClellan's officers were using leaks to selected reporters to demand Stanton's removal and threaten a "countermarch on Washington" if Lincoln did not give way to McClellan. As it happened, the Emancipation Proclamation provoked such anger at McClellan's headquarters that one reporter believed "a fearful revolution" was imminent, "that will startle the Country and give us a Military Dictator" and "a change of dynasty."
Lincoln's decision to put McClellan in command required immense moral courage, and an intelligent recognition of military necessity. He accepted the risks and the political blowback because he understood that McClellan was the only general who could lead the army against Lee, with a chance to win the victory he needed in order to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. As he would later say to another would-be Napoleon, "What I now ask of you is military success, and I will risk the dictatorship." The risk was serious. But Lincoln did not (as Captain Adams feared) "despair of the republic." He trusted the strength of the nation's republican institutions, its people's commitment to the Constitution - and his own ability to use those strengths effectively. 
Lincoln had also taken the measure of his opponent. Experience had taught him that, when faced with the necessity of battle, McClellan "became nervous and oppressed with the responsibility and hesitated to meet the crisis." When it came to staging a coup, such a man might load the gun, but he would never pull the trigger.

HEADLINE: The Dirty Little Secret of Nursing Homes

BYLINE: PAULA SPAN


HIGHLIGHT: In an era when fierce infections like MRSA and Clostridium difficile haunt nursing homes and hospitals, the percentage of nursing homes cited for deficiencies in "hand hygiene" has been rising. 

 BODY:
This sounds like common sense: If you work in a nursing home, you wash your hands when you start your shift and again before you leave. You wash your hands (or, in some cases, use an alcohol-based antimicrobial) before and after any direct contact with residents. Before you help someone with tooth-brushing, bathing, eating or using the toilet. Before and after handling a catheter or taking a finger-stick blood sample or changing a dressing. Or handling used bed linens. Or blowing your own nose.
In fact, these are not only common-sensical habits; they're prescribed by guidelines from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, part of the process by which the nation's nursing homes are inspected and certified.
Yet the percentage of nursing homes cited for deficiencies in "hand hygiene" has been rising in recent years. Inspectors found such deficiencies in fewer than 7.4 percent of nursing homes from 2000 to 2002, but by 2009 found them in close to 12 percent. Some states did better: Hand hygiene citations in Pennsylvania in 2009 came from just 6 percent of facilities. Some fared much worse: Michigan that year was at 15 percent.
One reason cited by the University of Pittsburgh gerontologist Nicholas Castle, a veteran nursing home researcher whose team uncovered this trend, was the growing emphasis on infection control, which means that "surveyors are probably looking harder than they used to" -- not a bad thing.
But the study, published in the Journal of Applied Gerontology, also indicated that understaffing and insufficient training played a part. "Most facilities understand the importance of hand washing," Dr. Castle said in an interview. "It's a question of having the staff and resources to implement what they know they should be doing."
In an era when fierce infections like MRSA and Clostridium difficile haunt nursing homes and hospitals (patients in one often become patients in the other, and around again), this represents a dispiriting trend. Usually very elderly, and sick and frail almost by definition, nursing home residents are particularly vulnerable to infection. Infections picked up in health care settings represent their single greatest cause of sickness and death, the reason underlying a quarter of all hospitalizations from long-term care facilities.
So why the decline in hand washing? Dr. Castle's analysis of Medicare data points to staff members that are stretched thin: hand hygiene deficiencies show up significantly more often in nursing homes with proportionately fewer nurses, both R.N.s and L.P.N.'s, and aides. Facilities where many residents need a more hands-on help, or have dementia, have more hand-washing lapses, too.
But external factors also come into play: Nursing homes in states with lower Medicaid reimbursement rates, for example, are significantly more likely to be cited for hand hygiene deficiencies.
The real rate of unwashed hands may actually be higher than the data shows, Dr. Castle added. When would staffers be more likely to comply with Medicare guidelines than when inspectors are prowling the halls with clipboards and checklists? "You'd think they'd be on their best behavior," he said.
You would also think the most direct route to improvement would be to add more staff and raise Medicaid reimbursements for nursing homes. But in the current economic and governmental climate, Dr. Castle noted, "they're unlikely to get either and they have to do more with less," which may be the most dispiriting element of all.
Still, he pointed out, "many facilities do get this right," even though aides may have to wash their hands 100 times or more each workday. The Centers for Disease Control and other organizations provide educational materials and training programs, and management approaches should probably also play a role.
His team's next study will look at how nursing homes without hand-washing deficiencies -- the great majority -- pull that off.
In the interim, staff members aren't the only source of infections entering (or leaving) nursing homes and threatening residents' well-being. When you and your family visit, wash your hands.

HEADLINE: What Do Democrats and Republicans Agree On?

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: While they often differ on how to get there, there are several areas in which the two parties have common economic goals. 

 BODY:
In the next two weeks, during the Republican and Democratic conventions, we'll hear a lot about the differences between the parties. How great we are. How terrible the other guy is. How we're better on Medicare, on Social Security, on foreign policy, on defense, on education, on taxes. How they're awful in policy realms you never even thought of.
That left me thinking: Where are the two parties closest together? What goals do they have in common that will likely go unmentioned in Tampa and Charlotte?
At least in the realm of economic policy, the best answer is: Not much. The parties have a foundational disagreement on the size and scope of government. They have bitter fights over when to start winnowing the deficit, whether to raise taxes, how much to cut government spending and where to cut it. They have stark differences on most major programs, including Social Security and housing subsidies.
Moreover - and more importantly - the parties have little interest in supporting the other side's policy proposals, no matter how much they might agree with them in private.
Even still, I thought of a few areas where the parties have common objectives. Here's a rundown, and if I have forgotten anything, throw it in the comments. 
Tax simplification. Both parties agree on the absolute necessity of reforming the addled, inefficient American tax code. That means eliminating much of the underbrush of credits, loopholes and expenditures and then reducing marginal tax rates.Of course, the devil is in the details. Just about every tax expenditure has a powerful interest group behind it. That is part of the reason why neither party has gotten specific about what they would put on the chopping block, and both anticipate a drawn-out fight during the tax reform process.
Regulatory simplification. Democrats and Republicans both support simplifying the regulatory code as well: Looking through the books, making rules simpler and clearer for businesses to follow and getting rid of outdated or duplicative regulations. To that end, the Obama administration has initiated a "look back" effort, requiring different governmental departments and agencies to scrub their regulatory codes. It has won applause from many thinkers on the right.
Fannie and Freddie. Both parties want them gone and a smaller government role in the mortgage market in the future. How to do it? Expect the parties to solidify their disagreements on that in the coming years.
Avoiding the fiscal cliff. On Jan. 1, according to current law, a host of tax breaks expire and huge, across-the-board budget cuts go into effect. In Washington, it's called the "fiscal cliff," or, colloquially, "taxmageddon." According to the Congressional Budget Office, it would throw the economy right back into recession. Neither party wants that, so expect an agreement on some combination of short-term spending increases and short-term tax cuts after the election - though expect bitter fights on the means, if not the end. Many in Washington think that Congress will merely kick the can six months or a year down the road to leave time for negotiations.
Son of Debt Ceiling. Shortly after "taxmageddon," perhaps sometime in February, the American government will exhaust its borrowing authority - meaning some unprecedented form of government default. It almost happened in the summer of 2011 and resulted in a credit downgrade. Neither party wants to go back there. Expect some agreement to lift the debt ceiling to come along with the deal to delay or otherwise soften the blow of the fiscal cliff.
Drill, baby, drill. The White House has approved new drilling in the Gulf and the Arctic. That's something Republicans broadly support and would go even further on.
Start-ups. Propose a bill to help start-ups, see your legislation win bipartisan support and the president's signature. Small businesses, and young businesses: Everybody loves them.
Iran sanctions. The White House has imposed stringent new economic and financial sanctions on Iran, with the aim of ending the country's nuclear ambitions. They have won broad bipartisan support, and the American and European sanctions added in the last year have slashed the regime's oil revenue.

HEADLINE: Open Tickets Are in Demand

BYLINE: KEN BELSON


HIGHLIGHT: The average price of U.S. Opem tickets for resale are up 7.6 percent this year compared to the same time last year. 

 BODY:
 The economy may be sluggish, but demand for tickets at the U.S. Open remains strong. The average price of tickets for resale are up 7.6 percent this year compared to the same time last year, and 49 percent higher than in 2010.
Tickets to matches at Arthur Ashe Stadium that are advertised on ticket reselling Web sites are averaging $335.87, up from $312.27 before the U.S. Open began last year, according to data from TiqIQ, which tracks ticket resellers.
The average offer price of tickets for the day sessions is $357.73, 14.1 percent higher than night sessions. Ticket prices for day sessions the first week tend to be higher than the second week of the tournament.
The average price for the men's final, however, is $641.38, down 14.3 percent from last year, perhaps because of the absence of Rafael Nadal, who is sitting out the tournament with an injury.

HEADLINE: Wealth, Taxes and Public Opinion

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: As the tax burden of the rich has fallen, so has the share of Americans who think the wealthy pay too little. Not so for attitudes toward the poor. 

 BODY:
Last week I wrote about a new Pew Research Center report on the ailing middle class. Today, Pew has come out with a comparable report about the wealthy and how Americans feel about this upper-income class.
When respondents were asked how much a family of four would need to earn to be considered wealthy "in your area," the median response was $150,000. The responses varied by geographic region, though, with people in the Northeast (where the cost of living is higher) giving a median response of $200,000.
The survey also included a pointed question about whether upper-income people pay their "fair share" in taxes. About 26 percent of respondents said they did, with another 8 percent saying the rich paid too much in taxes and 58 percent saying the rich paid too little.
If that sounds like a lot of people complaining that the wealthy don't contribute enough to Uncle Sam, note that Americans' attitudes toward the tax obligation of the rich have become much less demanding over the last two decades.
When this question was first asked by Gallup, in March 1992, 77 percent of respondents said upper-income Americans paid too little in taxes. Yet the average income tax burden of the wealthy was actually then.

In 1992, when more than three-quarters of Americans said that rich people should be paying more, a family of four earning twice the median household income paid an average federal income tax rate of 14.79 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center.
As of 2011, the average tax burden for a family of four earning twice the median income (which came to $151,296) was 12.93 percent.
Over the same period, Americans have become much more demanding about how much the poor pay, however.
In 1992, 8 percent of Americans said lower-income people paid "too little" in taxes. Today that share has risen to 20 percent.
As with that of the wealthy, the tax burden of the poor has also fallen considerably in the last two decades; in 1992, a family earning half the median income paid an average tax rate of 4.55 percent, whereas last year a family in that position had a negative tax burden of 6.84 percent (that is, the family received money from the federal government equaling 6.84 percent of their income, thanks to refundable tax credits).
For whatever reason, Americans have become much less tolerant of lower tax rates for the poor than they have for the rich.
: Pew's survey was done through telephone interviews conducted July 16-26, 2012, with a nationally representative sample of 2,508 adults ages 18 and older. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

HEADLINE: Protests Muted as Convention Gears Up

BYLINE: COLIN MOYNIHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Protests get off to a slow start, just like the convention, in Tampa. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- The storm that caused Republican officials to cancel the bulk of the first day of their convention is also dampening the protests, as fewer demonstrators than were expected turned out for the first day of rallies.
A morning gathering that organizers had said they thought would include at least 5,000 people drew only a couple hundred people who rallied and marched in a drizzle that sometimes yielded to baking heat. 
And later in the afternoon, a tense standoff between protesters and the riot police ended as a heavy downpour sent some protesters racing for cover under awnings, while others danced in the rain.
The rain was a looming presence even when it was not falling, as one of the organizers of a morning march and rally acknowledged from a stage at Perry Harvey Sr. Park.
 "We all know the affect the weather has had on the turnout of this rally," said the organizer, Mick Kelly, adding, "It's a lot lower."
The small crowds that took to the streets on Monday were in contrast to the thousands who marched during the opening days of previous conventions in St. Paul, New York and Philadelphia. But the events in Tampa also included less friction between the police and protesters. During the two marches on Monday, it appeared that only one man was arrested.
Just before noon a few hundred people left Perry Harvey Sr. Park and embarked on what organizers said was a permitted march, chanting, blowing horns and waving signs criticizing Republican stances on various issues as they headed toward a designated protest area near that the Tampa authorities had set up in a lot near the convention center.
Among those who watched the crowd was the Tampa police chief, Jane Castor, who told reporters that everything appeared to be going well.
A few minutes later, as the marchers streamed into the large fenced lot that had been set aside for protesters, some began loudly shouting that the protest area was a "cage." Soon, several dozen younger people, some dressed in black or tying bandannas over their faces left the area, chanting: "Whose streets? Our streets. Tear up the concrete."
The police followed them, and after several blocks one of the marchers was arrested in a parking lot near the intersection of Scott Street and Morgan Street. A police chief said that the man had been wearing a mask, something that was forbidden by a special ordinance adopted in preparation for the convention.
"They asked him to take it off and he resisted," said the chief, J.A. Bennett.
One of the man's friends said that he had been arrested without being given a chance to remove a bandanna tied over his face.
"The cop tackled him," said the friend, Keith Cutter, adding that his friend had not struggled.
Many of the protesters reassembled on Monday afternoon at the encampment that has come to be known as Romneyville near the edge of downtown Tampa. They then set off on a permitless march organized by the Poor People's Economics Human Rights Campaign that was meant to address the problems caused by poverty.
One of the marchers, Jennifer Sullivan, 58, a mail carrier from Spring Hill, Fla., said that both major political parties were delinquent in addressing many issues that affect the poorest Americans.
"They both talk about the middle class," Ms. Sullivan said. "But they both go to K Street to the lobbyists."
After several blocks, most of the marchers left the street and entered Lykes Gaslight Square Park on Kennedy Boulevard. But several dozen remained in the street and faced off against a line of officers who blocked an intersection on Kennedy Boulevard.
After several minutes those protesters moved onto sidewalks, and large detachments of officers equipped with plastic shields and a few rifles with orange stocks labeled "less lethal" arrived and stood in ranks.
As protesters scoffed from sidewalks and accused the police of overreacting, heavy rain poured from the sky. Most marchers took cover in doorways and under building overhangs, but some, followed by police officers on bicycles, marched down the center of North Tampa Street until they got back to their encampment, where they sought shelter under tents and tarpaulins.

HEADLINE: Deal Helps a Bank Catch Up in Capital

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The acquisition of Hudson City Bancorp sheds light on M&#038;T Bank's effort to bring its capital levels closer to the standards favored by regulators. 

 BODY:
One of the nation's bigger regional banks, M&T Bank, has had a hectic few days of deal-making.
Last week, M&T Bank paid back the government its bailout money, and on Monday, it announced the acquisition of Hudson City Bancorp, a struggling mortgage lender.
The transactions appear to affirm M&T Bank's reputation as a hardy institution that has sought since the financial crisis to avoid hurting the interests of its shareholders.
But the deals also show M&T, based in Buffalo, as a bank in need of more capital.
M&T Bank is paying roughly $3.7 billion for Hudson City, which is based in Paramus, N.J., and was held up as paragon of sound residential mortgage lending in the midst of the financial crisis. In the last two years, however, Hudson City's earnings have declined as interest rates have fallen and demand for its mortgages has diminished.
On a conference call on Monday, analysts asked M&T executives how the bank's business, which focuses heavily on commercial real estate and lending to companies, fits with Hudson City's, which is dominated by residential mortgages.
The executives said the Hudson City branches would help M&T attract business borrowers in new areas. They also said M&T could sell wealth management products to Hudson City customers.
Analysts say M&T has managed to successfully integrate recent big acquisitions.
"This acquisition is pretty consistent with M&T's strategy of buying troubled institutions and turning them round," said Todd Hagerman, an analyst with Sterne Agee.
But another key to understanding the acquisition may lie in M&T's capital.
Since the crisis, regulators have cared most about Tier 1 common equity because it focuses on a high-quality measure of capital. On that measure, M&T Bank scores well below regional peers. Its Tier 1 common equity capital was 7.15 percent of its assets in the second quarter. Regional banks of a similar size are typically well above 9 percent.
Investors so far have not worried too much about M&T's lower ratio because of the bank's relatively low losses after the financial crisis.
Bank regulators, however, may be harder to win over. To do well in annual Federal Reserve stress tests, M&T Bank may want to increase its Tier 1 common ratio substantially.
The Hudson City deal helps on that score. On Monday, M&T said the deal could add 0.3 to 0.4 of a percentage point to its Tier 1 common ratio.
There is another capital ratio that M&T may lag behind on. It is the so-called Basel III common ratio, which comes from the international banking standards that United States banks must begin complying with at the start of next year. Deutsche Bank analysts estimate that M&T's Basel III ratio is 5.4 percent. That is well below the 7.9 percent that U.S. Bancorp gives as its estimated Basel III ratio.
M&T has not given out its own estimate of Basel III capital. The bank's chief financial officer, Rene F. Jones, said on Monday that it was still trying to calculate the ratio, saying the bank had "lots of M.B.A.'s trying to figure out how the rule works."
But Mr. Hagerman, the analyst, said, "It's frustrating; I am assuming they know what the number is, and it's like M&T to provide limited information and limited transparency."
M&T executives on Monday emphasized the strategic importance of the Hudson City acquisition. The deal will allow M&T to bolster its presence in important markets, particularly New Jersey. In all, M&T will add 135 branches and $25 billion in deposits. Based on the terms of the deal, M&T is paying a premium of roughly 17 percent on Hudson City's closing share price on Friday.
"It's a very strategic deal," said Michael P. Pinto, M&T's vice chairman. "You couldn't draw the map any prettier."
The deal comes after M&T's exit last week from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Large regional banks that were not crippled by the financial crisis chose to pay off all their TARP investments as soon as they could, often issuing large amounts of common shares to do so. M&T, however, held off on repaying all its TARP investment. It said it wanted to avoid issuing common equity because that could hurt the value of shares held by existing shareholders.
M&T's repayment of $382 million to the Treasury Department had a twist. The bank first negotiated a change in the terms of preferred shares with the Treasury Department, which then sold the modified shares in the market to recoup its initial investment. The preferred shares originally had a provision whereby the dividend would rise to a 9 percent return after November 2013 from 5 percent. M&T was also able to buy back the original preferred shares at will.
The new preferred shares will pay out 6.375 percent after November 2013, and M&T cannot choose to pay them off until November 2018. Without the changes, the Treasury might have had to sell the preferred shares at a slight loss, preventing it from recovering all its investment in M&T. As it is, M&T paid the expenses of the preferred sale, ensuring that the Treasury recouped 100 percent of its money.
But the TARP deal may not assuage concerns about capital. M&T keeps the new preferred shares on its balance sheet as capital, but they do not count toward the ratios that investors and regulators care most about.
"Their common equity remains below peer averages," said Mr. Hagerman, the analyst.

HEADLINE: Making the Election About Race

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: The latest ads for the Romney-Ryan ticket suggest that under President Obama money goes from the deserving to the undeserving. 

 BODY:
The Republican ticket is flooding the airwaves with commercials that develop two themes designed to turn the presidential contest into a racially freighted resource competition pitting middle class white voters against the minority poor.
Ads that accuse President Obama of gutting the work requirements enacted in the 1996 welfare reform legislation present the first theme. Ads alleging that Obama has taken $716 billion from Medicare - a program serving an overwhelmingly white constituency - in order to provide health coverage to the heavily black and Hispanic poor deliver the second. The ads are meant to work together, to mutually reinforce each other's claims.
The announcer in one of the Romney campaign's TV ads focusing on welfare tells viewers:
In 1996, President Clinton and a bipartisan Congress helped end welfare as we know it by requiring work for welfare. But on July 12, President Obama quietly announced a plan to gut welfare reform by dropping the work requirement. Under Obama's plan, you wouldn't have to work and wouldn't have to train for a job. They just send you a welfare check. And welfare-to-work goes back to being plain old welfare. Mitt Romney will restore the work requirement because it works.
The ad includes the following text and photograph:
Web sites devoted to examining the veracity of political commercials have sharply criticized the ad.
The Washington Post's fact checker, Glenn Kessler, gave the welfare ads his lowest rating, four Pinocchios. The Tampa Bay Times's Politifact was equally harsh, describing the ads as "a drastic distortion" warranting a "pants on fire" rating. The welfare commercial, according to Politifact, "inflames old resentments about able-bodied adults sitting around collecting public assistance."
Sharp criticism has done nothing to hold back the Romney campaign from continuing its offensive - in speeches and on the air - because the accuracy of the ads is irrelevant as far as the Republican presidential ticket is concerned. The goal is not to make a legitimate critique, but to portray Obama as willing to give the "undeserving" poor government handouts at the expense of hardworking taxpayers.
Insofar as Romney can revive anti-welfare sentiments - which have been relatively quiescent since the enactment of the 1996 reforms - he may be able to increase voter motivation among whites whose enthusiasm for Romney has been dimmed by the barrage of Obama ads criticizing Bain Capital for firing workers and outsourcing jobs during Romney's tenure as C.E.O. of the company.
The racial overtones of Romney's welfare ads are relatively explicit. Romney's Medicare ads are a bit more subtle.
"You paid into Medicare for years - every paycheck. Now when you need it, Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare," the ad begins, with following picture on the screen:
The ad continues:
Why? To pay for Obamacare. The money you paid for your guaranteed health care is going to a massive new government program that is not for you.
In essence, the ad is telling senior voters that the money they paid to insure their own access to Medicare after they turn 65 is going, instead, to pay for free health care for poor people who are younger than 65.
The Romney Medicare ads have a dual purpose. The first is to deflect the Obama campaign's attack on the Romney-Ryan proposal to radically transform the way medical care for those over 65 is provided. The Associated Press succinctly described the Romney-Ryan proposal:
Starting in 2023, new retirees on the younger side of the line [those younger than 55 in 2012] would get a fixed amount of money from the government to pick either private health insurance or a federal plan modeled on Medicare.
Those going on Medicare after 2022 would have to choose between "premium support" - in other words, a voucher program - to pay for private health care coverage or an option to enroll in a program similar to existing Medicare but without specified funding levels - which means an end to the guaranteed medical coverage currently provided for those over 65.
The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities sums up the likely future of health care for seniors under the Ryan proposal for reform:
The C.B.O. estimates that by 2030 the House Budget Committee plan would increase the out-of-pocket share of health care spending for a typical Medicare beneficiary from the current 25-to-30% range to 68%. By 2050, the House plan would cut federal health care spending by approximately two thirds. Both plans would place substantial administrative burdens on the most vulnerable and infirm of Medicare's enrollees. And both would surrender the considerable leverage that Medicare can bring to bear on providers to reduce spending and improve quality.
Polls in key swing states and nationally show that, at present, voters trust Obama more than Romney to deal with Medicare, and strongly prefer to leave the Medicare program as is.
Asked whether "Medicare should continue as it is today" or "should be changed to a system in which the government would provide seniors with a fixed amount of money toward purchasing private health insurance or Medicare insurance" voters in Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin decisively chose to keep Medicare unchanged - by 62-28 in Florida, by 64-27 in Ohio, and by 59-32 in Wisconsin.
When asked whom they trust more to handle the Medicare issue, Florida voters in a Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll, reported on August 23, picked Obama over Romney by a 50-42 margin. In Ohio, Obama's margin was 51-41; in Wisconsin, it was 51-42.
A separate Pew Research Center survey released on August 21 found that 72 percent of voters had heard "a little" or "a lot" about what Pew described as "a proposal to change Medicare into a program that would give future participants a credit toward purchasing private health insurance coverage." Of those familiar with the proposal, a plurality, 49 percent, opposed it, while 34 percent favored it.
The bipartisan Battleground Poll conducted August 5-9 by the Tarrance Group, a Republican firm, and Lake Research Partners, a Democratic firm, found that voters trusted Obama over Romney to handle Medicare and Social Security by a 49-45 margin. The same survey found that voters trusted Congressional Democrats over Congressional Republicans to handle Medicare and Social Security by a 48-40 margin.
Romney's Medicare ad is designed to undermine that relatively modest but potentially crucial advantage. It is artfully constructed to turn the issue of health care into a battle over limited tax dollars between a largely white population of seniors on Medicare and a disproportionately minority population of the currently uninsured who would get health coverage under Obamacare.
Medicare recipients are overwhelmingly white, at 77 percent; 10 percent of recipients are black; and 8 percent Hispanic, with the rest described as coming from other races and ethnicities.
Obamacare, described in the Romney ad as a "massive new government program that is not for you," would provide health coverage to a population of over 30 million that is not currently insured: 16.3 percent of this population is black; 30.7 percent is Hispanic; 5.2 percent is Asian-American; and 46.3 percent (less than half) is made up of non-Hispanic whites.
Politifact described the Medicare ad as "half true":
Romney's claim gives the impression that the law takes money that was already allocated to Medicare and funds the new health care law with it. In fact, the law uses a number of measures to try to reduce the rapid growth of future Medicare spending. Those savings are then used to offset costs created by the law - especially coverage for the uninsured - so that the overall law doesn't add to the deficit. We rate his statement Half True.
Politifact also rated a claim Romney made later on the stump - that "there's only one president that I know of in history that robbed Medicare, $716 billion to pay for a new risky program of his own that we call Obamacare" - as "mostly false."
The Romney campaign's shift of focus toward welfare and Medicare suggests that his strategists are worried that just disparaging Obama's ability to deal with the struggling economy won't be adequate to produce victory on November 6.
The importance to the Romney-Ryan ticket of two overlapping constituencies - whites without college degrees and white Medicare recipients - cannot be overestimated. Romney, continuing the Republican approach of 2010, is banking on a huge turnout among key white segments of the electorate in order to counter Obama's strengths with minority voters as well as with young and unmarried female voters of all races.
There is extensive poll data showing the depth of Republican dependence on white voters.
On August 23, Pew Research released its latest findings on partisan identification, and the gains that the Republican Party has made among older and non-college whites since 2004 are remarkable.
Just eight years ago, Pew reports, whites 65 and over were evenly split in their allegiance, 46 percent Democratic, 46 percent Republican. In the most recent findings, these voters are now solidly in the Republican camp, 54-38, an eight point Republican gain. Elderly women were 9 points more Democratic than Republican in 2004, 50-41, the opposite of where they are now, 51-42 Republican. Older men, who were 51-41 Republican in 2004, are now 59-33 Republican.
Similarly, white voters without college degrees, of all ages, have gone from 51-40 Republican in 2004, to 54-37 in 2012, according to Pew.
Most importantly, the Pew surveys show that 89% of voters who identify themselves as Republican are white. Faced with few if any possibilities of making gains among blacks and Hispanics - whose support for Obama has remained strong - the Romney campaign has no other choice if the goal is to win but to adopt a strategy to drive up white turnout.
The Romney campaign is willing to disregard criticism concerning accuracy and veracity in favor of "blowing the dog whistle of racism" - resorting to a campaign appealing to racial symbols, images and issues in its bid to break the frustratingly persistent Obama lead in the polls, which has lasted for the past 10 months.
The result is a campaign run at two levels. On the trail, Paul Ryan argues that "we're going to make this about ideas. We're going to make this about a positive vision for the future." On television and the Internet, however, the Romney campaign is clearly determined "to make this about" race, in the tradition of the notorious 1988 Republican Willie Horton ad, which described the rape of a white woman by a convicted African-American murderer released on furlough from a Massachusetts prison during the gubernatorial administration of Michael Dukakis and Jesse Helms's equally infamous "White Hands" commercial, which depicted a white job applicant who "needed that job" but was rejected because "they had to give it to a minority."
The longer campaigns go on, the nastier they get. Once unthinkable methods become conventional.
"You can tell they" - the welfare ads- "are landing punches," Steven Law, president of the Republican super PAC American Crossroads, told the Wall Street Journal. Law's focus group and polling research suggest that the theme is not necessarily going to work. "The economy is so lousy for middle-income Americans that the same people who chafe at the rise of welfare dependency under Obama don't automatically default to a 'get-a-job' attitude - because they know there are no jobs."
As the head of a tax-exempt 501(c)4 independent expenditure committee, Law cannot coordinate campaign strategy directly with the Romney campaign. Nonetheless, he is sending a warning. The welfare theme, Law said, "needs to be done sensitively. Right now it may be more of an economic issue than a values issue: In other words, more people on welfare is another disturbing symptom of Obama's broken-down economy, rather than an indictment of those who are on welfare or the culture as a whole."
Will the Romney campaign heed Law's advice to keep it subtle? The principal media consultant for the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future, which will be running many of the anti-Obama ads over the next ten weeks, is Larry McCarthy, who produced the original Willie Horton ad.
Thomas B. Edsall, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, is the author of the book "The Age of Austerity: How Scarcity Will Remake American Politics," which was published earlier this year.

 BODY:
After Long Pursuit, Hertz to Buy Dollar Thrifty for $2.3 Billion | Two giants of the rental car industry agreed to merge late on Sunday, as Hertz Global Holdings announced a deal valued at $2.3 billion for the Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group.
The agreement caps a multiyear pursuit by Hertz, one that survived a rival bid by the Avis Budget Group and a rejection by Dollar Thrifty shareholders of an earlier, lower offer.
Under the terms of the transaction, Hertz will pay $87.50 a share in cash through a tender offer for Dollar Thrifty stock. That represents an 8 percent premium to Dollar Thrifty's closing price on Friday.
In an important component of the deal, Hertz said it would sell its Advantage Rent a Car discount unit to Franchise Services of North America, a car rental franchiser, and Macquarie Capital. DealBook »

The New York Times reports: "The circle of perpetrators could also include the fickle bond investors who underpriced the risk of Greek debt before 2010 and whose volatile reaction to even minor events has lately been wreaking havoc with Spanish and Italian borrowing costs and, by extension, those countries' economies."

HEADLINE: M&T Bank to Buy Hudson City Bancorp for $3.7 Billion

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: The M&#038;T Bank Corporation has agreed to buy Hudson City Bancorp for $3.7 billion in cash and stock, expanding M&#038;T's reach on the East Coast. 

 BODY:
The M&T Bank Corporation has agreed to buy Hudson City Bancorp, expanding M&T's reach on the East Coast. 
Under the terms of the deal, M&T will pay roughly $3.7 billion in cash and stock. The price represents a premium of about 16 percent to Hudson City's market value on Friday. 
With the acquisition, M&T will bolster its presence in important markets including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. In all, M&T will add 135 branches and $25 billion in deposits.
 "As a thrift, Hudson City focused primarily on deposits and mortgages," Robert G. Wilmers, M&T's chief executive, said in a statement. "M&T will build on Hudson City's loyal customer base to create a comprehensive community banking franchise."
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, M&T Bank has been an active deal maker, capitalizing on the weakness in the industry. In 2009, it bought Provident Bankshares and Bradford Bank. Two years later, it purchased Wilmington Trust. 
Hudson City has struggled in recent years. Its shares closed at $6.44 on Friday, compared with nearly $9 in the depths of the financial crisis.
As part of the deal, M&T will pay off roughly $13 billion of Hudson City's debt. M&T expects the acquisition to bolster its overall capital and earnings. 
"This merger creates tremendous opportunities to build on the successes that each company has achieved individually in its own markets," Hudson City's chief executive, Ronald E. Hermance Jr., said in a statement.
Hudson City will become part of an M&T subsidiary. Once the deal is complete, Mr. Hermance is to be appointed to the M&T board. JPMorgan Chase and Sullivan & Cromwell advised Hudson City on the deal. M&T worked with Evercore Partners and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.

HEADLINE: Romney Says 'Dishonest' Attacks Have Had an Impact

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: In two interviews, Mitt Romney says that while the president's attacks had succeeded in tarnishing his image, he is confident he can overcome that, starting this week. 

 BODY:
BOSTON - Mitt Romney said President Obama's attacks on him have been "dishonest" but acknowledged that they had succeeded in tarnishing his image as he heads to a convention intended to reintroduce him to the American people.
In interviews published Monday, Mr. Romney grappled with the challenges awaiting him as Republicans gather in Tampa, Fla., to seal his nomination. After a summer of relentless attacks, Mr. Romney finds himself on the defensive on his taxes, record in business and economic plans. But he expressed confidence that he could overcome that, starting this week.
"I do think that the president's campaign of personal vilification and demonization probably draws some people away from me," Mr. Romney told USA Today. In the end, he said, "people will recognize those attacks for what they are, and they'll make a decision based on who can do a better job creating jobs and providing more take-home pay for the middle class of America. I believe I am that person."
In a separate interview with , Mr. Romney said: "Certainly their ads have some impact or they wouldn't be running them. But there would be an opportunity for people to get to know me better during the debates and during the time in the campaign season when people are actually paying a lot of attention to the candidates."
Mr. Romney's complaints about his opponent's attacks mirror those of Mr. Obama, who has criticized his challenger for what he considers distortions and negativity.
Mr. Romney spent Sunday night at his home in Wolfeboro, N.H., and was spending Monday out of sight to work on his acceptance speech. He plans to fly to Tampa on Thursday, the final day of the convention when he will deliver his address.
The interviews underscored one of the liabilities Mr. Romney faces -- the notion that he is not as likable or as attuned to regular people as Mr. Obama is. Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, agreed that that perception exists but attributed it to the Obama ad campaign and said voters would get a better sense of him this week.
"I was voted the president of my fraternity," he noted. "They don't call them fraternities at Brigham Young University. They're called service clubs. It was the Cougar Club. But you don't get voted to be head of your group if you don't get along with people, if you don't connect with people."
He expressed surprise at the issues Mr. Obama has focused on in attacking him. "There are plenty of weaknesses that I have, and I acknowledge that," Mr. Romney said. "But the attacks that have come have been so misguided, have been so far off target, have been so dishonest, that they surprised me. I thought they might go after me on things that were accurate that I've done wrong, instead of absurd things."
Asked what those accurate weaknesses would be, he laughed and declined to say.

HEADLINE: Crist to Speak at Democratic Convention

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: His former party is gathering near his hometown, but Charlie Crist is now preparing to speak at the Democratic convention next week after endorsing President Obama. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor of Florida who ran for the Senate as an independent, will speak at the Democratic National Convention next week, taking yet another step away from his erstwhile party.
Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman, confirmed Mr. Crist's role just a day after he endorsed the president for re-election. The chairman of the Florida Republican Party, Lenny Curry, derided that endorsement as Mr. Crist's effort to "shed his skin for a political comeback."
Mr. Crist, who hails from nearby St. Petersburg, was once seen as a rising Republican star whose endorsement was sought by several of the party's presidential candidates in 2008. But he fell out of favor in 2009 when he embraced President Obama's economic stimulus efforts, and he ran for the Senate as an independent in 2010 after it appeared he would lose the Republican primary to Marco Rubio, the Tea Party-backed candidate. Mr. Rubio, now the junior senator from Florida, is scheduled to introduce Mitt Romney at the Republican National Convention here on Thursday.
Convention speakers from the opposite party are common trophies, and have been sought more aggressively in recent years as the parties try to highlight their broad appeal.
Mr. Crist was viewed as a contender to be Senator John McCain's running mate in 2008, but he is still not the most high-profile poaching in modern convention history. That title belongs to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who ran as Al Gore's running mate in 2000. After losing the Democratic primary in Connecticut in 2006, Mr. Lieberman then succeeded where Mr. Crist failed by winning his Senate race as an independent.
Mr. Lieberman's further split with Democrats over foreign policy led him to address the Republican convention in 2008.

HEADLINE: Goldman Executive Is Said to Buy $27 Million Luxury Apartment

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: J. Michael Evans, a Goldman Sachs vice chairman and a leading candidate to become the bank's next chief, is said to have bought an entire floor at 995 Fifth Avenue for $27 million. 

 BODY:
It is an apartment fit for a king, or, perhaps, a Goldman Sachs chief executive. 
J. Michael Evans, a Goldman Sachs vice chairman and a leading candidate to become the bank's next chief, bought an apartment at 995 Fifth Avenue for $27 million, according to a person with direct knowledge of the purchase. 
Spanning the entire 16th floor, the 14-room apartment is 8,360 square feet and has 10-foot ceilings. There is a six-room master-bedroom suite, and nine-and-a-half bathrooms, according to the real-estate Web site StreetEasy. 
 Who needs that much space? Well, if anyone does -- and has the money to afford it -- it's Mr. Evans. He and his wife, Lise Evans, have eight children (each has three children from prior marriages, and they have two children together). 
The apartment is in the former Stanhope Hotel across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mr. Evans paid $27,376,940, about 9 percent less than the $30 million listing price, according to real estate records. Extell Development converted the Stanhope into a residential building several years ago. 
Nikki Field, an executive at Sotheby's International Realty who had the listing, declined to comment. The New York Post reported earlier on Mr. Evans's purchase. 
Mr. Evans, who for many years was based in Hong Kong, where he led the bank's push into Asia, recently moved back to New York. Last year, he was given the newly created post running the bank's emerging-markets business across the globe. He joined Goldman in 1993 from Salomon Brothers and was named partner the following year. 
Mr. Evans and his twin brother, Mark, rowed on the Canadian men's eights team that won the gold medal at the 1984 Olympics. Mark was also a partner at Goldman but retired shortly after the bank's 1999 initial public offering. 
Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's current chief, has run the firm since 2006. Living comfortably across the park from Mr. Evans at 15 Central Park West, said he has no plans to step aside. 
But he has begun to bump up against the average tenure for Goldman's chiefs, leading to speculation about his successor. One logical candidate is Gary D. Cohn, the bank's president who is close to Mr. Blankfein. 
Another possibility is Mr. Evans, who recently served as co-chairman of Goldman's business standards committee, which the bank formed after it came under criticism for its conduct during the financial crisis. One of four vice chairmen at the bank, Mr. Evans owns about 700,000 Goldman shares, which, at the bank's current stock price, are worth about $75 million.

HEADLINE: When the Vice Presidency Was a Job for New Yorkers

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: Some historians say that as other states grew and political power shifted toward the south, New York's importance waned, accounting for the dearth of vice-presidential candidates it has produced in recent years. 

 BODY:
If Virginia used to be the mother of presidents, as schoolchildren there were taught for generations, New York used to be the mother of vice presidents. But what happened in the 20th century? There has not been an elected vice president from New York in nearly 100 years.
Those decidedly New York-centric thoughts came to mind as the Republican National Convention prepared to make Mitt Romney's choice of a running mate official this week by nominating Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.
New York has produced 11 vice presidents, and two figure in important footnotes: Nelson A. Rockefeller, a former governor of New York, was vice president for 25 months in the 1970s - but he was appointed, not elected. And in 1984, Geraldine A. Ferraro, a congresswoman from Queens, became the first woman to run for vice president. She and Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic nominee for president, lost to Ronald W. Reagan in a landslide. 
Here is another footnote: The last New Yorker before Ms. Ferraro to seek the office also lost big. That was William E. Miller, a congressman from upstate New York who was Barry Goldwater's running mate in 1964. 
All those footnotes demand another: Ms. Ferraro was not the last New Yorker to run for vice president. Jack F. Kemp, a former congressman from western New York, ran on the Republican ticket headed by Senator Bob Dole in 1996.
 Aside from Rockefeller, the last New Yorker who was actually a heartbeat away was James S. Sherman, elected vice president under William H. Taft in 1908. But Sherman died in office, less than a month before the election of 1912. (Yet another footnote: If Taft had won the three-way race against Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt, New York might have held onto the vice presidency. The Republican Party designated Nicholas Murray Butler, the president of Columbia University, as the candidate to receive Sherman's votes in the Electoral College.)
Has New York been in a kind of vice-presidential eclipse since then? Some historians say that as other states grew and political power shifted toward the south, New York's importance waned. 
"In the 19th century, New York was especially attractive because upstate New York was the Silicon Valley of America," said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy at New York University. "It was the heartland of industrial America. The great American companies were located along the tier where General Electric was, and Carrier and Kodak. And upstate New York was an incubator for Republican nominees in the 19th century. Teddy Roosevelt was the last vice president who was born and raised in New York City."
And then there are those who wonder why anyone would want to be No. 2. In the beginning, vice presidents were candidates who wanted to be No. 1 but lost. The vice presidency was, according to the vice-presidential historian Steve W. Tally, "a consolation prize" And the first New Yorker to win it was Aaron Burr, who lost to Thomas Jefferson in 1800.
David O. Stewart, in his biography of Burr, "American Emperor," argued that Burr had too little to do as vice president. That may or may not explain why he went to Weehawken, N.J., one morning in the summer of 1804 and shot Alexander Hamilton in a duel that all but ended Burr's political career. (Burr's problems continued after he left office in 1805. He was tried for treason in 1807 but was acquitted.)
George Clinton, who had been a governor of New York, followed Burr as vice president. Clinton was the first vice president elected under the 12th Amendment, which separated the mandate for president and vice president. "The vice presidency became a second-rate office, something to which only second-rate men would aspire," Mr. Tally wrote in "Bland Ambition: From Adams to Quayle," and he said that Clinton led the parade of mediocrity. 
New York also gave the nation one vice president who was a drunkard with financial problems and another who, according to Mr. Tally, was so out of touch with the Gilded Age that he lacked "any conspicuous connections to the railroad robber barons." Yet another New Yorker pounded the ceremonial first rivet into the Statue of Liberty. And Mr. Tally quotes Woodrow Wilson describing still another New York vice president, Chester A. Arthur, as "a nonentity with side-whiskers." (The nonentity moved into the White House, side whiskers and all, after President James Garfield was assassinated in 1881.) 
The New Yorkers who served as No. 2 all followed Clinton, who served during Jefferson's second term and again in James Madison's first term. 
Clinton, according to the historians Evan Cornog and Richard Whelan, "had been one of the national leaders of opposition to the Constitution in 1788." By the time Madison was elected 20 years later, Clinton had been on the political stage for so long, he felt he deserved high office. "Clinton didn't want elected officials," Mr. Tally wrote. "As the most powerful man in the most powerful state of the original 13, Clinton hoped that New York would become its own country - and, of course, he would be king."
When that did not happen, Mr. Tally wrote, "impending senility and failing health didn't mean that he should quit politics." And so Clinton became vice president. 
He did not like the job and was renominated even though he did not want to be, so he voted against renewing the Bank of the United States. "As a result of this final fit of pique," Mr. Tally wrote, "the United States had no means to finance the War of 1812."
Clinton did not live to see the rockets' red glare. He died in office before the war began. And the bank debacle contributed to the problems that engulfed the next New Yorker to serve as vice president, Daniel D. Tompkins, the Scarsdale-born vice president under James Monroe. Tompkins had raised money for the war - some $4 million, by Mr. Tally's tally.
When bankers were reluctant to extend any more credit to the government, Tompkins guaranteed the loans himself. And when that was still not enough, Tompkins self-financed the war: "He mixed his own funds into the pot," Mr. Tally wrote.
Monroe's "era of good feelings" was not that good for Tompkins. He was uncomfortable in Washington and was often preoccupied with straightening out his financial headaches. That, among other troubles, kept him in New York so much that some historians refer to him as an absentee vice president. 
As for his money troubles, the State Assembly - led by Martin Van Buren, himself a future vice president - eventually approved what would now be called a reimbursement package. Tompkins said it was not enough. Congress eventually voted a more generous settlement. Tompkins got $95,000, equivalent to roughly $1.79 million in today's dollars.
The City Room column in some editions on Tuesday about vice presidents from New York misstated the years that two of those vice presidents were elected. James S. Sherman was elected vice president under William H. Taft in 1908, not in 1909. And Aaron Burr was elected vice president under Thomas Jefferson in 1800, not 1801.

HEADLINE: Before the Convention, a Hometown Rally for Ryan

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Paul D. Ryan appears in Janesville, Wis., where he grew up and still lives. 

 BODY:
JANESVILLE, Wis. -- Here where the first sparks of his political career were struck with his election as class president, Representative Paul D. Ryan returned for a boisterous rally at Joseph A. Craig High School on Monday, before flying to the Republican National Convention to accept his party's vice-presidential nomination -- a trip now delayed by a day, until Tuesday, because of Tropical Storm Isaac.
Mr. Ryan, who lives with his family on Courthouse Hill around the corner from where he grew up, walked to the stage between a line of pom-pom-waving cheerleaders with his wife, Janna, and their three young children, one in a yellow cheese-head hat. His mother, Betty Ryan Douglas, and his father-in-law, Dan Little, were also on hand. 
"I think I recognize every face in this room,'' Mr. Ryan said, visibly moved. "This gym means so much, it's so familiar.''
Mr. Ryan described how he was a fifth-generation Janesville resident with 60-odd cousins in town, who traced their roots to Irish immigrants in the 1850s. 
"Our family's story is not that much different than most Americans' family stories,'' he said.
Friends credit Mr. Ryan's rootedness - he returns here from Washington three or four days a week - as keeping him down to earth and approachable. "Paul is Janesville,'' said Joe Knilans, a state assemblyman. "He's the guy in the Packers hat in the supermarket when you walk down the aisle.''
Republican strategists are hoping that same quality will enhance the appeal of the Republican ticket to middle-class voters, balancing Mitt Romney's image of youthful privilege and business wealth.
Mr. Ryan struck the same note here by embracing President Obama's disparagement of Rust Belt voters in 2008 as clinging to guns and religion. "Guilty as charged,'' he said, speaking as a hunter "whose tree stand is about six miles in that direction.'' 
"We have a big choice to make, not just picking the next president for a few years," Mr. Ryan told supporters. "We're picking the pathway for America for a generation."
In response, the Obama campaign said the Republican ticket's economic proposals would undermine the middle class. "They'd raise taxes for middle-class families with kids by an average of $2,000, turn Medicare into a voucher system and slash critical investments in education and infrastructure," a spokesman, Danny Kanner, said in a statement. "And they'd do it all to pay for massive tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires."
An adviser to Mr. Ryan said that the hullabaloo that had attended him since he was named Mr. Romney's running mate two weeks ago - Secret Service motorcades, people fainting in large crowds, supporters on rope lines saying they pray for him - had been "an out-of-body experience" for Mr. Ryan. 
"He's perplexed about it,'' the adviser said. "'Is all this for me?' He can't believe all this is going on around him. He has a very healthy perspective.''
A city of 64,000 in southern Wisconsin, Janesville is like many cities in the industrial Midwest, where a high school diploma once secured a middle-class job but no longer does. The closing of a General Motors plant in 2008 swept away 6,000 jobs. The 2012 race may, in part, come down to which campaign is best able to appeal to voters in places like Janesville in Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. 
Although Mr. Ryan spoke beneath a banner that said "Paul Ryan: The Pride of Janesville,'' he does not enjoy universal support in his hometown. About 30 protesters gathered beneath their own banner outside, which said, "Paul Ryan Is Not On Our Side.''
His Congressional district, which stretches from Janesville east to the shore of Lake Michigan, is a swing district that George W. Bush won in 2004 and President Obama in 2008. (That same year, Mr. Ryan won re-election a fifth time in a 29-percentage-point landslide.)
In downtown Janesville on Sunday evening, voters expressed a wide variety of views on Mr. Ryan. Kevin Warnecke, 40, a deputy sheriff, displayed a cellphone photo of himself with Mr. Ryan and recalled hearing him at a town-hall-style meeting a year ago. "He's phenomenal,'' he said. "There's not a man in the United States government who knows numbers like Paul Ryan knows numbers.''
Thomas Lee, 58, a registered nurse who once taught middle school art in Janesville, disagreed. "His methods don't solve the problems for low-income people, for middle-class people,'' he said. "Coming from the health world, I've seen people suffer when things get cut.''
Ken Kemler, 55, a restaurant owner, said that he could not afford health insurance for his employees, including two grown sons, and that he hoped that the president's health care law would allow him to do so. "When Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney talk about business, they're not talking about me with 30 part-time employees," he said. "They're talking about the Koch brothers.''
Laura Cleansby, 51, a warehouse clerk, said that she had voted for Mr. Obama but that, if the election were held today, she would choose the Republican ticket out of disappointment with high unemployment.
"I always thought Republicans were more for the rich,'' she said. "Paul Ryan seems to be more for people like us, the middle class. He seems to know more about us, what we're thinking.''

HEADLINE: Boehner Sees G.O.P. Victory, but Not Necessarily a Mandate on Medicare

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: "I think the American people are going to vote with their wallets on Election Day," said John A. Boehner, the Republican House speaker. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- The House speaker, John A. Boehner, on Monday cautiously predicted victory for Republicans up and down the ticket in November, but he avoided saying that a Republican victory would mean a mandate for the sweeping changes to Medicare that Mitt Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan have proposed.
At a lunch with reporters, Mr. Boehner said that the nation's dire fiscal position, driven by health care spending, would confront Washington next year "regardless of who wins the election." But he was cautious about predicting a mandate for the House Republican plan to end the government guarantee for Medicare, replacing the program with fixed contributions that older Americans would use to buy private health insurance or pay into the government plan.
Instead, he said, the 2012 election would be won on jobs, the economy and Republican assertions that President Obama's policies have failed.
"I think the American people are going to vote with their wallets on Election Day," the speaker said.
Mr. Boehner's caution reflects the fears that Republicans have long held when approaching changes to Social Security and Medicare, a caution that Mr. Ryan has tried to move beyond.
After President George W. Bush's re-election in 2004, he claimed a mandate to partially privatize Social Security by diverting some payroll taxes into personal investment accounts. But after a full-throated presidential push on the issue, Congressional Republicans never even drafted legislation to put it into place.
The speaker did not distance himself from the proposal itself.
"We have a big menu," he said. "We know what needs to be done. It's just a matter of having elected officials with enough courage of their convictions to do it."
But he kept his focus on the president's economic policies, which he said the House's 89 freshman Republicans had used to shore up their re-election prospects. 
In April, Mr. Boehner said that "there's a one-in-three chance" Republicans could lose control of the House in November.
This time, he was more optimistic, raising his goal beyond maintaining the Republican majority to expanding it. "Many of them are in better shape than I would have guessed," he said of the Republican candidates.
Republicans seem poised to firm up their grip on power with a relentlessly negative take on the economy under Mr. Obama. Guy Harrison, executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said on Monday that a "good night" in November should net Republicans four to eight extra seats.
The speaker acknowledged his party's problems with minority voters, but he said the economy would depress their turnout on Election Day for both sides.
"They might not show up to vote for our candidate, but I'd suggest to you they won't show up for the president either," he said.
Mr. Boehner would not weigh in on whether the Republican convention here should be further truncated if Tropical Storm Isaac hits the Gulf Coast hard. He did suggest that the days of the four-day political convention might be over. The Democrats have cut theirs down to three days next week in Charlotte, N.C., and for the second year in a row, weather has lopped a day off the Republican gathering.
"I'm not sure having a four-day convention for the future makes sense," he said.

HEADLINE: As Convention Opens, Debt Clock Ticks

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: A vivid reminder of the nation's growing debt as Republicans gather in Tampa. 

 BODY:
As Republicans gather in Tampa, Fla., for their convention, party leaders want to drive home a message to voters: The federal debt is hurtling toward $16 trillion, and it is President Obama's fault.
That's the gist of what the party chairman, Reince Priebus, said as he banged a gavel to open the convention Monday afternoon. The banging activated a "debt clock" in the convention hall that tallies the amount the debt accumulating during the four-day event. A second ticker that started running earlier displays the total national debt.
Mr. Priebus said the clocks served to draw attention to the "unprecedented fiscal recklessness of the Obama administration." A day earlier, he said the clocks highlighted what is at stake in November.
"This clock reminds every delegate and every American of why we are here in Tampa - because American can and must do better," he said. "Every American's share of the national debt has increased by approximately $16,000 during the current administration."
He said Mitt Romney and Paul D. Ryan would "turn this fiscal mess around, get people back to work and set our country on a strong foundation for generations to come."
The clock will hang over Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey as he delivers the keynote speech on Tuesday and Mitt Romney when he accepts the presidential nomination at the convention's close on Thursday.
For Republicans, the debt clocks represent efforts draw attention back to the economy after a week in which social issues dominated the political back-and-forth. The move plays to concerns that the federal debt is rising at an unsustainable pace, threatening the economic recovery and national security.
But by drawing attention to the nation's ballooning debt, Republicans are of course not mentioning their own role in its growth during the Bush administration.

HEADLINE: Willard C. Butcher, Former Chief of Chase Manhattan, Dies at 85

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Butcher oversaw the bank's international expansion and its merger with Chemical Banking after succeeding David Rockefeller Sr. as chairman. 

 BODY:
Willard C. Butcher, the former chairman and chief executive of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, who led the bank during a period of international growth in the 1980s, died on Saturday at his home in Hobe Sound, Fla. He was 85.
The cause was kidney cancer, said Fraser P. Seitel, a former spokesman for Chase.
Mr. Butcher joined Chase National, the predecessor to Chase Manhattan, in 1947, starting as a junior executive in the bank's Midtown Manhattan retail branches. In 1969 he moved to international operations, which he eventually ran. In 1972, David Rockefeller Sr., then Chase's chief executive, named him the bank's president and chief operating officer.
He succeeded Mr. Rockefeller as chief executive in 1980 and became chairman the next year. At the time, Chase was the country's third-largest bank in assets, behind Citicorp and the Bank of America.
Mr. Butcher had big shoes to fill, replacing a man who personified the aristocratic banker-statesman. "Two weeks from now, the institution that came to be known as 'David's Bank' will become 'Bill Butcher's Bank,' " said an article in The New York Times just before he took over.
Under Mr. Butcher's leadership, Chase started operations in more than 50 countries, including China, Egypt and the Soviet Union.
Mr. Rockefeller, 97, said in a statement that Mr. Butcher was "a close friend and valued colleague, who, when he succeeded me as chairman of The Chase, worked tirelessly to enhance the bank's position around the world."
Chase's push into foreign markets came at a cost. By 1990, the bank was saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars in losses from bad loans made in less developed countries like Brazil. He faced other challenges during his tenure, as large corporations began to raise money through the securities markets and shun the more traditional route of borrowing from banks.
A burly man with a booming voice, Mr. Butcher became a leading critic of the hostile takeovers and junk-bond financing that had come to characterize that era on Wall Street.
"A lot of these 'leveragers' and 'greenmailers' are undermining the fundamental structure of our economy," he said in a 1985 interview. "Other than maximizing short-term profits for the speculators, these activities don't add any intrinsic wealth to the country."
After Mr. Butcher's retirement in 1991, Chase began an aggressive expansion through mergers, combining with the Chemical Banking Corporation in 1996 and then J.P. Morgan in 2000.
Willard Carlisle Butcher was born on Oct. 25, 1926, in Bronxville, N.Y., and grew up in nearby Scarsdale. His father was an executive at Consolidated Edison, his mother a Greek and Latin teacher.
Mr. Butcher started his college studies at Middlebury College before a stint in the Navy. After his military service, he enrolled at Brown University, graduating in 1947 and later serving for many years on its board.
After stepping down, Mr. Butcher continued his involvement at Chase, serving as vice chairman of the Chase International Advisory Committee. He was also on the boards of several organizations and companies, including the American Enterprise Institute, the Museum of Modern Art, Firestone Tire and Rubber, International Paper and Texaco.
Twice widowed, Mr. Butcher is survived by his wife of 33 years, Carole McMahon Butcher, who was working in Chase's special events department when they met; two sons, John and Willard Jr.; three daughters, Sarah Garonzik, Helen Bennet and Barbara Uboe; and 11 grandchildren.
An American history buff, Mr. Butcher once likened his fierce devotion to Chase to Robert E. Lee's undying loyalty to the South. "No one should go into the chairman's role," he said, "unless he is willing to devote his life to the organization."

HEADLINE: Obama, D'Souza and Anti-Colonialism

BYLINE: STANLEY FISH


HIGHLIGHT: A new film about the president ultimately disappoints because it resorts to the rhetoric of demonization. 

 BODY:
I've never before had the experience of seeing a movie based on the ideas of a friend who is also the film's producer, writer, co-director and on-camera star. The friend is Dinesh D'Souza and the movie is "2016: Obama's America." It's a bit less than 90 minutes long and for the most part it follows the path of D'Souza's 2010 book "The Roots of Obama's Rage." 
That path is at once psychological and historical. D'Souza tells us that he wants to understand Obama's actions, which do not, he contends, follow either from the American dream of the founding fathers or from the civil rights story of Selma, Birmingham, Brown v. Board of Education and Martin Luther King's "I have a dream" speech. Instead, according to D'Souza, the dream Obama is intent on realizing is the dream of his anti-colonialist father, Barack Obama Sr., whose influence on his son's life is, perhaps paradoxically, all the greater because he was absent; the two met only once, when the future president was 10 years old.

Anti-colonialism, as D'Souza defines it, is underwritten by a conviction that "colonialism is a system of piracy in which the wealth of the colonized countries is systematically stolen by the colonizers" and that at the present time the United States, originally a colony itself, is the chief neo-colonial power, continuing its flawed history of subjugating native Americans, Mexicans, Hawaii and the Philippines into the 21st century. "My argument," says D'Souza in "The Roots of Obama's Rage," "is that it is the anti-colonial ideology of his African father that Barack Obama took to heart." Once we understand that ideology - once we really know Obama - we will understand a set of policies that, under any other explanatory model, seem contradictory and disunified.
D'Souza doesn't hit the viewer over the head with this argument in the movie. Instead he eases into it by musing on the quite extraordinary parallels between his life and Obama's - two men of mixed race and comparable skin color who were born in the same year, entered Ivy League colleges in the same year, graduated in the same year and went on to enjoy improbable successes (D'Souza is a college president as well as a best-selling author of multiple volumes, a notable culture warrior, and now an auteur), given their differently modest beginnings.
But then the two diverge. At Dartmouth, D'Souza becomes an enthusiastic proponent and admirer of American-style entrepreneurial capitalism and a believer in American exceptionalism. Unlike the once glorious but fallen empires he recalls reading about as a child in India, America, he declares, is an "empire of ideals" - individual rights, freedom of choice, upward mobility limited only by your willingness to work hard; and the fact that the nation has not always lived up to its ideals is a testament to the power they exert even as they are being breached. 
In contrast, Obama, first at Columbia and later at Harvard, is influenced by leftist teachers like Edward Said and Roberto Unger, immerses himself in texts by Marxist, feminist and ant-colonialist authors, and thus fleshes out the lineaments of "his father's third world collectivism." 
And so the immigrant and the native-born American, alike in so many ways, end up holding ideologically opposed positions that lead them to have different views on any number of issues - debt, oil drilling, health care, the Middle East, Egypt, Libya, nuclear disarmament, global warming, financial regulation, Supreme Court appointments, you name it. In each instance Obama's view is explained by D'Souza as a logical extension of an anti-colonialist desire to take funds, goods and weapons away from the haves - the United States and its allies - and give them to the have-nots, to poor countries in general and Muslim countries in particular. Rather than laboring to maintain and increase American dominance, Obama, says D'Souza, is busy leveling the playing field so that no nation will have control of the world's resources and be in a position to call the tune. 
For example, Obama (D'Souza explains) attributes the energy crisis to America's "addiction" to oil, and his response to that addiction - to our consuming a disproportionate share of the world's energy reserves - is to propose "cap and trade policies aimed at taxing America and using some of that money to subsidize the wretched of the earth." It is an effort, D'Souza complains, to raise "the cost of doing business for the colonizers in order to give an economic advantage to the colonized" ("The Roots of Obama's Rage"). (In short, a geopolitical form of affirmative action.)
, someone might ask, and D'Souza would have answers: you're giving away the store rather than being a steward of it, and you're giving it to people who are less able than we are to make good use of it. In the movie, Obama's half brother George gratifies D'Souza by saying that he believes it would have been better if the British had stayed longer in Kenya, for then the nation would have been more developed and better equipped to go its own way than it now is. Being colonized, D'Souza is suggesting, is not all that bad a thing.
It's easy to imagine strong objections to that argument, but it's not the argument D'Souza puts front and center; it's an aside. The argument he does put front and center will provoke even stronger objections and will be received by many as objectionable because it is not an argument at all, but an accusation: Obama's policies are not simply counterproductive, they are un-American. 
This accusation has been implicit in much that has been said along the way, but 25 minutes before the end of the movie, it takes over. The hinge assertion is D'Souza's declaration that Obama's ideology is "remote to America." By that he could mean simply that he got some of his ideas from places outside this country, from Kenya (his father) or Palestine (Said) or Brazil (Unger). 
But that observation, which is also true of the founding fathers, who got many of their ideas from Locke, Diderot, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Spinoza, Milton and Aristotle, is relatively anodyne. (The place or tradition from which you draw your ideas is independent of the uses to which they are put.) By "remote," D'Souza means something more seriously damning: Obama's ideas are remote in the sense that they are foreign; they grew in other soil and do not belong in America; they are antithetical to the American spirit. Indeed, they are anti-American, a judgment expressed in the movie by Daniel Pipes, who says flatly that Obama "doesn't think well of America"; the president's ideas, echoes D'Souza, are "separate from American thought."
So we have a choice, D'Souza tells us in conclusion, between "America's dream and Obama's dream," or, more precisely, between America's dream and Obama's anti-American dream. We made that choice in 2008 without knowing that it was anti-Americanism we were choosing. Now we know (because D'Souza has told us), and we had better act quickly in 2012 because if we don't the world "could be a scary place in 2016."
This is disappointing. While a viewer could certainly disagree with D'Souza's analysis of the genesis and emergence of Obama's views, it is nevertheless an analysis to which one could respond in the usual spirit of intellectual debate by saying things like "you've left something out" or "you draw your conclusion too quickly." But as the movie picks up polemical speed, philosophy, political theory and psychology are left behind and replaced by name-calling, and by a name-calling that brings D'Souza close to positions he rejects. For instance, he rejects birtherism, the contention that Obama was born in Kenya and is hence not an American citizen; but he replaces it with a back-door, or metaphorical, birtherism when he characterizes Obama as an alien being, as a fifth-column party of one who has pretended to be an American, and technically is one, but really is something else.
The argument founders on the fallacy of assuming that the adjective "American" has a fixed meaning with which everyone, or everyone who is right-thinking and patriotic, agrees. But the meaning of America is continually contested in essays, books, backyard conversations, talk shows and, most of all, in elections. It is often said, and it is true, that the opposing parties in an election have "different visions for America." There are many ways of describing the alternative visions offered to us in a year like this; but describing one of them as un-American and its proponent as a foreign intruder is not to further discussion but to foreclose it and to replace the contest of ideas with the rhetoric of demonization. (Democrats have been as guilty of this as anyone.) Obama may have a vision for America that you don't like, but it is a vision for America put forward by an American. If you don't like it, vote against him, not in the name of Americanism but in the name of the ideas and outcomes you, also an American, prefer.
D'Souza is going to vote against him, and that is what goes wrong with the final third of his movie. The partisan desire to score points and fashion slogans ("America's dream or Obama's dream") overwhelms the effort to explain and elucidate. As the movie ends, the title flashes on the screen and underneath it we read "Love him/hate him. Now you know him." The suggestion is that D'Souza has given us the information we may have lacked and now we can decide what we think. That was in fact the way my wife responded to the book. She told D'Souza - he was bemused - that reading it had allowed her to see more clearly what she liked about Obama; she was the person who said, in effect, what's wrong with that? 
That kind of response is not encouraged by what the movie turns into - a long and elaborately produced campaign ad. As an ad it is doing very well, outperforming some summer blockbusters. (Democrats take note!) All to the good from a partisan perspective, but still a disservice both to the questions D'Souza has legitimately raised and to the film itself, which deserved better at the hands of its one and only begetter.

HEADLINE: A Campaign With Brawn to Combat Dropout Rate

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
United Way has created a group of college-educated National Football League players, featured in a new public service advertising campaign, to help it recruit volunteer readers, tutors and mentors.
The latest collaboration between United Way and the N.F.L. -- which have worked together since 1973 -- is meant to help United Way meet its goal of cutting the number of high school dropouts in the United States in half by 2018. To that end, United Way is trying to recruit one million volunteer readers, tutors and mentors by 2014.
Although the United States had the world's highest rate of high school and college graduation in 1970, today, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, it is No. 21 in completion of high school and No. 15 in college completion. Part of the United Way's volunteer recruitment effort is the creation of ''Team N.F.L.,'' made up of one player representative from each of the 32 N.F.L. teams; each is college-educated, civic-minded and an actively involved United Way volunteer. Each player has pledged to personally recruit at least 3,000 volunteers by 2014; their efforts are being tracked online. Leading ''Team N.F.L.'' is Nnamdi Asomugha, cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles, who has actively volunteered with United Way since 2009. 
Five ''Team N.F.L,'' players -- Mr. Asomugha; Brandon Carr, cornerback for the Dallas Cowboys; Josh Cribbs, wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns; Chris Canty, defensive tackle for the New York Giants; and Cam Newton, quarterback for the Carolina Panthers -- are featured in the new campaign's TV spot. The spot was created by the New York office of McCann Erickson, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and is being distributed by the Advertising Council. United Way, the N.F.L., the Ad Council and McCann also worked together on a previous campaign introduced in 2009.
The new TV spot -- available in 30- and 60-second versions -- is the first one created by McCann for United Way to feature multiple N.F.L. players.
The voice-over on the spot, by Mr. Asomugha, says, ''N.F.C., A.F.C., offensive linemen, defensive tackles, quarterbacks and cornerbacks are all working with United Way. For a million little reasons. The kids of our communities. To ensure their academic success, all the way to graduation day. It takes about 12 years to create a graduate. It takes the same time to create a dropout. And the difference could be you. So become a United Way volunteer reader, tutor or mentor. Make a difference in the life of a child.''
A 60-second radio spot, also featuring Mr. Asomugha, offers a similar message. There is also outdoor advertising customized to each N.F.L. market, featuring the player representative from the local team. For example, one ad features D'Brickashaw Ferguson, an offensive tackle for the New York Jets, who wears a white T-shirt that says, ''Live United.'' Copy here reads, ''Join Team D'Brickashaw. You could be part of a team that keeps a kid in school, alongside some of your favorite N.F.L. players. Become a volunteer reader, tutor or mentor in your community. Suit up and take the pledge today at Unitedway.org/TeamDBrickashaw.''
Gib Marquardt, a group creative director of McCann Erickson New York, called the T-shirt ''the centerpiece of the launch advertising, and it becomes a perfect bit of equity as we tell the N.F.L. story.''
Although N.F.L. players are often rivals on the field, playing ''on different teams, in different conferences and possessing different areas of expertise, they and the N.F.L. are united to help kids of our communities become graduates,'' he added.
Tracey Holmes, N.F.L. partnership director for the United Way, said, ''There are 182 million N.F.L. fans. We believe many of those fans care as much about the community and the success of our kids as they do about their teams.'' Anna Isaacson, director of community relations for the N.F.L., said the league was participating in the newest United Way effort because it had ''taken a stand to give back to communities. We also know we provide a huge platform that can make a difference.''
The Ad Council will distribute the new advertising in time for the start of the 2012 football season on Sept. 5; the TV advertising also will run on the N.F.L. Network.
Mr. Canty, who was born in the Bronx and works with United Way programs for boys and girls ages 8 through 16 throughout New York City, said, ''The platform of football allows me to reach kids and drive home the message about the importance of education, that without it they limit their opportunities.''
''It's one thing to hear it from your parents, it's another to hear it from an N.F.L. player you see on TV,'' he said.
The Advertising Council, which has worked with United Way on various public service campaigns since 2004 -- not all involving the N.F.L. -- said total donated media for all United Way-related campaigns was worth close to $400 million through the first quarter of 2012.

HEADLINE: News Analysis: Deal Helps A Bank Catch Up In Capital

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
One of the nation's bigger regional banks, M&T Bank, has had a hectic few days of deal-making.
Last week, the Buffalo-based M&T Bank paid back the government its bailout money, and on Monday, it announced the acquisition of Hudson City Bancorp, a struggling mortgage lender.
The transactions appear to affirm M&T Bank's reputation as a hardy institution that has sought since the financial crisis to avoid hurting the interests of its shareholders. 
But the deals also show M&T Bank as a lender in need of more capital.
M&T Bank is paying roughly $3.7 billion for Paramus, N.J.-based Hudson City, which was held up as paragon of sound residential mortgage lending in the midst of the financial crisis. In the last two years, however, Hudson City's earnings have suffered as interest rates have fallen and demand for its mortgages has diminished.
On a conference call on Monday, analysts asked M&T Bank executives how the bank's business, which focuses heavily on commercial real estate and lending to companies, fits with Hudson City's, which is dominated by residential mortgages.
M&T Bank executives said the Hudson City branches will help M&T attract business borrowers in new areas. They also said M&T can sell wealth management products to Hudson City customers.
Analysts say M&T Bank has managed to successfully integrate recent big acquisitions.
"This acquisition is pretty consistent with M&T's strategy of buying troubled institutions and turning them round," said Todd Hagerman, an analyst with Sterne Agee.
But another key to understanding the acquisition may lie in M&T Bank's capital.
Since the crisis, regulators have cared most about Tier 1 common equity because it focuses on a high-quality measure of capital. On that measure, M&T Bank scores well below regional peers. M&T Bank's Tier 1 common equity capital was 7.15 percent of its assets in the second quarter. Regional banks of a similar size are typically well above 9 percent.
Investors so far have not worried too much about M&T's lower ratio because of the bank's relatively low losses after the financial crisis.
Bank regulators, however, may be harder to win over. To do well in annual Federal Reserve stress tests, M&T Bank may want to increase its Tier 1 common ratio substantially.
The Hudson City deal helps on that score. On Monday, M&T Bank said the deal could add 0.3 to 0.4 of a percentage point to its Tier 1 common ratio.
There is another capital ratio that M&T Bank may lag on. It is the so-called Basel III common ratio, which comes from the international banking standards that United States banks must start complying with at the start of next year. Deutsche Bank analysts estimate that M&T Bank's Basel III ratio is 5.4 percent. That is well below the 7.9 percent that U.S. Bancorp gives as its estimated Basel III ratio.
M&T Bank has not given out its own estimate of Basel III capital. M&T Bank's chief financial officer, Rene F. Jones, said on Monday that it was still trying to calculate the ratio, saying the bank had "lots of M.B.A.'s trying to figure out how the rule works."
But Mr. Hagerman, the analyst, said, "It's frustrating; I am assuming they know what the number is, and it's like M&T to provide limited information and limited transparency."
M&T Bank executives on Monday stressed the strategic importance of the Hudson City acquisition. The deal will allow M&T Bank to bolster its presence in important markets, particularly New Jersey. In all, M&T will add 135 branches and $25 billion in deposits. Based on the terms of the deal, M&T Bank is paying a roughly 17 percent premium on Hudson City's closing share price on Friday.
"It's a very strategic deal," said Michael P. Pinto, M&T Bank's vice chairman. "You couldn't draw the map any prettier."
The deal follows M&T Bank's exit last week from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Large regional banks that were not crippled by the financial crisis chose to pay off all their TARP investments as soon as they could, often issuing large amounts of common shares to do so. M&T Bank, however, held off on repaying all its TARP investment. It said it wanted to avoid issuing common equity because that can hurt the value of shares held by existing shareholders.
M&T Bank's repayment of $382 million to the Treasury Department had a twist. M&T Bank first negotiated a change in the terms of preferred shares with the Treasury Department, which then sold the modified shares in the market to recoup its initial investment. The preferred shares originally had a provision whereby the dividend would rise to a 9 percent return after November 2013 from 5 percent. M&T Bank was also able to buy back the original preferred shares at will.
The new preferred shares will pay out 6.375 percent after November 2013, and M&T Bank cannot choose to pay them off until November 2018. Without the changes, the Treasury might have had to sell the preferred shares at a slight loss, preventing it from recovering all its investment in M&T Bank. As it is, M&T Bank paid the expenses of the preferred sale, ensuring the Treasury recouped 100 percent of its money.
But the TARP deal may not assuage concerns about capital. M&T Bank keeps the new preferred shares on its balance sheet as capital, but they do not count toward the ratios that investors and regulators care most about.
"Their common equity remains below peer averages," Mr. Hagerman, the analyst, said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Mainframe Evolves to Serve the Digital World

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. is introducing on Tuesday a new line of mainframe computers, adding yet another chapter to a remarkable story of technological longevity and business strategy.
The new model, the zEnterprise EC12, has strengthened the traditional mainframe's skill of reliably and securely handling vast volumes of transactions. That is why the mainframe is still the digital workhorse for banking and telecommunications networks -- and why mainframes are selling briskly in the emerging economies of Asia and Africa.
The new models have added capabilities for computing chores that are growing rapidly, like analyzing torrents of data from the Web and corporate databases to predict consumer behavior and business risks. Name a trend in corporate computing -- cloud computing, data center consolidation, flash-memory storage, so-called green computing -- and I.B.M. executives point to tailored features in its mainframe that deliver the goods. 
The death of the mainframe has been predicted many times over the years. But it has prevailed because it has been overhauled time and again. In the early 1990s, the personal computer revolution took off and I.B.M., wedded to its big-iron computers, was in deep trouble. To make the mainframe more competitive, its insides were retooled, using low-cost microprocessors as the computing engine.
Like any threatened species that survives, the mainframe evolved. It has been tweaked to master new programming languages, like Java, and new software operating systems, like Linux.
''The mainframe is the most flexible technology platform in computing,'' said Rodney C. Adkins, I.B.M.'s senior vice president for systems and technology.
That flexibility is a byproduct of investment. The new I.B.M. mainframe, according to the company, represents $1 billion in research and development spending over three years.
I.B.M. has also invested beyond its corporate walls. Nearly a decade ago, fearing that its mainframe business would wither if retiring mainframe engineers were not replaced, I.B.M. went out to universities, advocating for mainframe courses and offering support. Today, more than 1,000 schools in 67 countries participate in I.B.M.'s academic initiative for mainframe education.
The sale of mainframe computers accounts for only about 4 percent of I.B.M.'s revenue these days. Yet the mainframe is a vital asset to I.B.M. because of all the business that flows from it. When all the mainframe-related software, services and storage are included, mainframe technology delivers about 25 percent of I.B.M.'s revenue and more than 40 percent of its profits, estimates A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
The I.B.M. mainframe story offers a glimpse of why manufacturing can be crucial to an American company -- and to the economy as a whole -- even though high-end manufacturing does not employ large numbers of factory workers.
Over the last 15 years, I.B.M. has aggressively globalized its operations and work force, and pulled out of manufacturing businesses including personal computers and disk drives.
But I.B.M. held on to its core mainframe business, whose development is supported by thousands of engineers and scientists. Mainframe parts are produced in I.B.M. facilities in the United States, in Endicott, N.Y., and Fishkill, N.Y., and in Germany and elsewhere. The final assembly work is done in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where I.B.M. opened a $30 million mainframe plant in 2010.
A mainframe costs more than $1 million, and higher-performance models with peripheral equipment often cost $10 million or more. Yet even young companies and emerging nations, analysts say, find the expense worth it for some tasks.
Comepay, for instance, is a fast-growing company that says it operates more than 10,000 self-service payment kiosks in Russia, where consumers pay for products and services ranging from Internet service and cellphones to electric bills. Comepay handles millions of transactions a day, and the volume is rising. The Russian company bought an I.B.M. mainframe in 2010.
''Mainframes are extremely reliable,'' said Ruslan Stepanenko, chief information officer of Comepay. ''It keeps working even when the transaction load is very high.''
Last year, the Senegal Ministry of Finance bought two I.B.M. mainframes to help monitor all the imports, exports and customs duties at the African country's 30 border checkpoints.
Performance, security and reliability were the main reasons for selecting the mainframe, said Momar Fall, a manager and mainframe technical specialist in CFAO Technologies, an I.B.M. partner in Senegal. But another advantage in a developing nation, he said, is that the mainframes are constantly communicating over the Internet with a remote I.B.M. support center.
''So seven days a week, 24 hours a day, I.B.M. is looking after them,'' Mr. Fall said.
Longtime mainframe customers say the technology has done a good job keeping up with the times. Last year, Primerica, a financial services company, purchased its 19th mainframe in 30 years.
David Wade, chief information officer, has worked for Primerica, based in Duluth, Ga., since its first mainframe arrived. With more than four million life insurance customers and more than two million investment-account clients, he said the company needs the reliable processing technology of the mainframe. ''It works like nothing else,'' Mr. Wade said.

HEADLINE: Willard Butcher, 85; Led Chase Manhattan

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Willard C. Butcher, the former chairman and chief executive of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, who led the bank during a period of international growth in the 1980s, died on Saturday at his home in Hobe Sound, Fla. He was 85.
The cause was kidney cancer, said Fraser P. Seitel, a former spokesman for Chase. 
Mr. Butcher joined Chase National, the predecessor to Chase Manhattan, in 1947, starting as a junior executive in the bank's Midtown Manhattan retail branches. In 1969 he moved to international operations, which he eventually ran. In 1972, David Rockefeller Sr., then Chase's chief executive, named him the bank's president and chief operating officer.
He succeeded Mr. Rockefeller as chief executive in 1980 and became chairman the next year. At the time, Chase was the country's third-largest bank in assets, behind Citicorp and the Bank of America.
Mr. Butcher had big shoes to fill, replacing a man who personified the aristocratic banker-statesman. "Two weeks from now, the institution that came to be known as 'David's Bank' will become 'Bill Butcher's Bank,' " said an article in The New York Times just before he took over.
Under Mr. Butcher's leadership, Chase started operations in more than 50 countries, including China, Egypt and the Soviet Union.
Mr. Rockefeller, 97, said in a statement that Mr. Butcher was "a close friend and valued colleague, who, when he succeeded me as chairman of The Chase, worked tirelessly to enhance the bank's position around the world."
Chase's push into foreign markets came at a cost. By 1990, the bank was saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars in losses from bad loans made in less developed countries like Brazil. He faced other challenges during his tenure, as large corporations began to raise money through the securities markets and shun the more traditional route of borrowing from banks.
A burly man with a booming voice, Mr. Butcher became a leading critic of the hostile takeovers and junk-bond financing that had come to characterize that era on Wall Street.
"A lot of these 'leveragers' and 'greenmailers' are undermining the fundamental structure of our economy," he said in a 1985 interview. "Other than maximizing short-term profits for the speculators, these activities don't add any intrinsic wealth to the country."
After Mr. Butcher's retirement in 1991, Chase began an aggressive expansion through mergers, combining with the Chemical Banking Corporation in 1996 and then J. P. Morgan in 2000.
Willard Carlisle Butcher was born on Oct. 25, 1926, in Bronxville, N.Y., and grew up in nearby Scarsdale. His father was an executive at Consolidated Edison, his mother a Greek and Latin teacher.
Mr. Butcher started his college studies at Middlebury College before a stint in the Navy. After his military service, he enrolled at Brown University, graduating in 1947 and later serving for many years on its board.
After stepping down, Mr. Butcher continued his involvement at Chase, serving as vice chairman of the Chase International Advisory Committee. He was also on the boards of several organizations and companies, including the American Enterprise Institute, the Museum of Modern Art, Firestone Tire and Rubber, International Paper and Texaco.
Twice widowed, Mr. Butcher is survived by his wife of 33 years, Carole McMahon Butcher, who was working in Chase's special events department when they met; two sons, John and Willard Jr.; three daughters, Sarah Garonzik, Helen Bennet and Barbara Uboe; and 11 grandchildren.
An American history buff, Mr. Butcher once likened his fierce devotion to Chase to Robert E. Lee's undying loyalty to the South. "No one should go into the chairman's role," he said, "unless he is willing to devote his life to the organization."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: To Preserve Regional Tradition, Flanders Subsidizes Horse Breeding

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
MERCHTEM, BELGIUM -- In less than a century, Belgian draft horses have gone from being one of the country's most valuable exports to a vanishing breed in their own homeland, prompting waves of concern in communities like this small Flemish town.
To blunt the trend, the top politician in Flanders said this month that he would offer to subsidize their breeding. His idea is to preserve regional identity and mark the contribution made by animals that once hauled cargo and logs in ports and fields from Russia to the United States. 
Belgian draft horses are ''part of the valuable cultural inheritance of Flanders,'' Kris Peeters, the minister-president of Flanders, said in an e-mail message. ''By providing this bonus, I want to stimulate Flemish breeders, and thus secure a beautiful future for our Belgian draft horses.''
Breeders who gathered here last week for an annual competition to judge the quality and comportment of Belgian draft horses said the support, while modest, still would make a significant difference.
Annelies De Brabander, 23, one of the contestants, said the new subsidy should enable her to keep 35 draft horses rather than cut back. That in turn would help her to keep touring with a troupe that uses the horses for acrobatics and other displays.
''We need more horses for our shows, and if we don't have more we can't keep doing what we do,'' said Ms. De Brabander, who also works as a nurse in Ghent.
Breeders are receiving &#x20ac;150, or $188, for each foal born from the start of this year until next March, up to a total of &#x20ac;90,000.
Eddie De Block, 45, the mayor of Merchtem, said the Flemish subsidy was worth every euro despite the prospect of tougher times as the debt crisis in Europe grinds on and the Belgian economy shows signs of contracting.
''It's better to give the money now than to let the situation reach such a low level where you have to import the animals or use in-vitro fertilization to keep the stocks up,'' said Mr. De Block.
Many believe the horses were bred in the Middle Ages to be strong enough to carry knights weighed down with armor into battle. But experts say the present-day Belgian draft was bred in the mid-19th century for work in transport and to enable more efficient farming.
During the early years of the 20th century, one of the most important markets for the horses was the United States, where demand for the muscular animals was driven by rapid industrialization. Germany, Russia and Scandinavia were also significant importers.
Some Amish communities and some farmers in countries like Hungary and parts of South America still use the horses for agricultural work. In Antwerp, the horses pull tourist carriages around the city center.
Meat from the stocky Belgian breed remains in demand in countries like Poland and Italy, and people with allergies seek out milk from Belgian mares because of its low fat and its composition, which makes it more suitable for some people than milk from cows.
But widespread mechanization made the heavy horses superfluous decades ago.
Most people breeding the horses, which are known for their gentle temperaments and easy handling, do so for recreational purposes with no profit in mind. The numbers had continued declining in Belgium because of the costs of insemination, veterinary fees, medicines, and care and feed.
About 700 foals are born each year in Belgium, down from a high of about 15,000 during the interwar years, according to Monique Beullens, 53, a professor of biology at the University of Leuven and a breeder of draft horses.
Such a precipitous drop could eventually lead to inbreeding and weak horses, Ms. Beullens warned. She said the subsidy should increase the numbers of horses by allowing breeders with four or five mares to afford making three or four of them pregnant, rather than fewer, as is currently the case.
''The biggest problem at the moment is that the horses really have no economic value,'' she said.
Even so, there could be more demand for horses in the future, according to Jan De Boitselier, the president of the Royal Society for the Belgian Draft Horse. His organization lobbied for the reintroduction of the subsidy, which was last offered in 2005, and which broadly matches what Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, has offered its breeders since the mid-1990s.
Mr. Boitselier said a new generation of draft horses could be put to work in Flanders hauling logs and maintenance equipment as an eco-friendly alternative to tractors and trucks.
A promising model, he said, is De Winning, a social and agricultural project in Limburg Province, where adults with disabilities and from disadvantaged backgrounds are using draft horses to maintain and cultivate difficult-to-access areas of forest and grassland while creating minimum disturbance to the soil and surroundings.

HEADLINE: A Youthful Populace Helps Make the Philippines an Economic Bright Spot in Asia

BYLINE: By FLOYD WHALEY

 BODY:
MANILA -- In the upscale business district of Manila, a midweek crowd spills out into the street. The New York-themed Borough restaurant is pulsating to the beat of a Bon Jovi song, while young, hip Filipinos take shots of tequila from a passing tray and sing in unison.
''Whoa-oh, we're halfway there!'' the crowd sings. ''Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer!''
The revelers have reason to celebrate. Times are pretty good in the Philippines if you are young, skilled and live in the city. Young urban workers are helping to give the country its brightest prospects in decades, economists say. 
With $70 billion in reserves and lower interest payments on its debt after recent credit rating upgrades, the Philippines pledged $1 billion to the International Monetary Fund to help shore up the struggling economies of Europe.
''This is the same rescue fund that saved the Philippines when our country was in deep financial trouble in the early '80s,'' said Representative Mel Senen Sarmiento, a congressman from Western Samar.
The Philippines has certainly had a steady flow of positive economic news recently. On July 4, Standard & Poor's raised the country's debt rating to just below investment grade, the highest rating for the country since 2003 and equivalent to that of Indonesia.
The Philippines is the 44th-largest economy in the world today, according to HSBC estimates. But if current trends hold, it can leap to the No. 16 spot by 2050. The Philippine stock market, one of the best performers in the region, closed at a record high after the recent S.& P. rating upgrade, and the country's currency, the peso, reached a four-year high against the dollar at about the same time.
The gross domestic product of the Philippines grew 6.4 percent in the first quarter, according to the country's central bank, outperforming all other growth rates in the region except China's. Economists expect similarly strong growth in the second quarter.
''We have made a very bold forecast for the Philippines, but I think justifiably so,'' said Frederic Neumann, a senior economist at HSBC in Hong Kong.
A high population growth rate, long considered a hindrance to prosperity, is now often seen as a driving force for economic growth. About 61 percent of the population in the Philippines is of working age, between 15 and 64. That figure is expected to continue increasing, which is not the case for many of its Asian neighbors, whose populations are aging.
''There are a number of countries in Asia that will see their working-age populations decline in the coming years,'' Mr. Neumann said. ''The Philippines stands out as the youngest population. As other countries see their labor costs go up, the Philippines will remain competitive due to the sheer abundance of workers joining the labor force.''
Many of those workers are feeding the country's robust outsourcing industry. The Philippines, where English is widely spoken, surpassed India last year as the world's leading provider of voice-based outsourcing services like customer service call centers.
According to the country's Board of Investments, offshore call centers employed 683,000 Filipinos in 2011 and generated about $11 billion in revenue, a 24 percent increase from the previous year. The government is seeking to expand the industry and has said it hopes it will generate $25 billion in revenue by 2016.
The Philippines' growing prosperity has also been driven by the 9.5 million Filipinos -- almost 10 percent of the population -- who work outside the country and who sent home about $20 billion in 2011. That is up from $7.5 billion in 2003.
Trinh D. Nguyen, an economist with HSBC in Hong Kong, said the Philippines had benefited from an increase in government efficiency and revenue collection, as well as aggressive actions to address corruption, like the impeachment of the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the arrest of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on suspicion of accepting kickbacks and of misusing government lottery money.
''It is not only short-term growth that draws investors to the Philippines,'' Ms. Nguyen said. ''The fundamentals are there.''
But there are also real weaknesses in the country. Recent flooding, which by some estimates submerged 50 percent of Manila, illustrates a shortage of modern infrastructure that makes the Philippines highly vulnerable to disasters.
''The Philippines is hit with several deadly and devastating natural disasters every year,'' Ms. Nguyen said.
But government officials have said that the recent flooding might actually help economic growth, because reconstruction will require an increase in public spending and the country will have to put into place programs to make it more resistant to the effects of natural disasters.
Another hurdle is the fact that the Philippines has traditionally underexploited its natural resources. The government estimates that there are 21.5 billion tons of metal deposits in the country, including large deposits of nickel, iron, copper and gold. But they have never been a significant driver of economic growth because extraction has been mismanaged, Mr. Neumann said.
In the shorter term, there are concerns that the country's newfound prosperity has not sufficiently eradicated poverty.
Other countries in the region, most notably China and Japan, but also Thailand and Vietnam, have successfully developed export-driven manufacturing, bringing millions of people out of poverty and increasing the size of their middle classes. Manufacturing typically draws workers away from agriculture, which pays less. But many of the large foreign companies that financed such transitions to manufacturing in Asia have avoided the Philippines because of periods of political instability.
The service sector -- including the young call center workers who were recently reveling in Manila -- are helping drive an economic boom in the cities.
But that type of outsourcing still provides only about 1 percent of jobs in the country, according to data from the Asian Development Bank. And the strong sector does not create jobs accessible to farmers or to millions of other Filipinos in rural areas who seek a way out of poverty.
''While the Philippines' business process outsourcing industry has grown impressively, it still employs a very small portion of the country's work force,'' noted Rajat M. Nag, a managing director of the Asian Development Bank. ''It needs to aggressively develop its manufacturing sector to create more jobs.''
On Emerald Avenue in the Ortigas business district of Manila, where hundreds of call center workers pour out of skyscrapers to gossip and smoke, Mika Santos, 18, does not have much to say about the national economy. But she is very happy with her own situation.
After completing a two-year information technology course and passing an exam in English proficiency, she started handling customer service calls for a United States mobile phone company. She earns a comparatively high salary for an entry-level job, and her employer offers incentive bonuses, free meals and shuttle service.
Had she been born a generation earlier, she would most likely have worked as a low-income farmer or gone overseas to find work. ''My parents didn't have any opportunity like this,'' she said.

HEADLINE: New Book In Battle Over East Vs. West

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
In 1988 Pankaj Mishra was a recent university graduate in the northern Indian city of Benares with big literary ambitions he had little idea how to fulfill. But when he heard that a local library was going to be auctioning back issues of The New York Review of Books as waste paper, he knew exactly what to do.
''I convinced a friend of mine who was a student to pose as a paper recycler,'' Mr. Mishra recalled recently. ''He put in a very high bid and brought a whole bunch of stuff over in a rickshaw.''
It's an anecdote that might seem plucked from the pages of a novel by Balzac by way of V. S. Naipaul -- or, for that matter, from the essays and reportage that, in the years since, have made Mr. Mishra, 43, a regular presence in the pages of not just The New York Review, but also The New Yorker, The London Review of Books, The Guardian and seemingly every other prestigious publication in the Anglo-American literary world. 
Mr. Mishra's flair for the grace note is matched by a sometimes ferocious instinct for the jugular. In 1999 a denunciation of Salman Rushdie's novel ''The Ground Beneath Her Feet'' as ''an alarming new kind of anti-literature'' helped establish him as a force to be reckoned with in India's fractious literary scene. More recently, a blistering takedown of the historian Niall Ferguson in The London Review last November prompted extensive coverage in the British news media -- and threats of a libel suit from Mr. Ferguson.
Now Mr. Mishra seems poised for a fresh round of intellectual battle. His latest book, ''From the Ruins of Empire: The Intellectuals Who Remade Asia,'' has already been greeted by some in Britain as a fuller, footnoted riposte to Mr. Ferguson's sunny view of Western imperialism, with the historian Mark Mazower, writing in The Financial Times, praising its ''power to instruct and even to shock.''
Some on the right have dismissed the book as a polemic, but Mr. Mishra brushes aside the term. ''If your writing collides with the conventional wisdom, there's going to be some kind of friction,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in London. And when it comes to the mainstream media, he added, ''there are still very few people presenting perspectives other than that of the West.''
''From the Ruins of Empire,'' to be published in the United States next Tuesday by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, is a richly detailed account of late 19th- and early-20th-century Asian intellectuals' often bitter responses to what one Japanese scholar quoted in the book called ''the White Disaster.''
Mr. Mishra's own story, however, suggests a young man who fell hard for Western literature but was sometimes too shy to consummate the affair.
He grew up in the northern city of Jhansi, the son of a railway worker whose prosperous Brahmin family had been impoverished by India's 1951 land reform. At Allahabad University Mr. Mishra studied commerce but nursed dreams of publishing a novel in English, ''a language that no one around me spoke well, if at all,'' as he put it. He sent pages of a novel in progress to Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, a poet on the English faculty, who later sought him out at his student hostel for what Mr. Mishra recalled as ''the first literary conversation I had ever had.''
Even then, Mr. Mehrotra said in a phone interview, Mr. Mishra struck him as bound for big things. ''I told my wife: 'I must meet this person. We will hear about him later,' '' he said, adding, ''He was someone who needed to know everything.''
Which isn't to say that Mr. Mishra embraces the narrative of the young provincial who moves to the center of the literary world by sheer force of talent, at least not geographically.
''I still hesitate to say I've moved to London,'' he said, noting that until his marriage in 2005 to Mary Mount, a book editor and the daughter of Ferdinand Mount, the former editor of The Times Literary Supplement, he was at best a ''frequent visitor.'' The arrival of the couple's daughter, now 4, has curtailed his travels somewhat, but Mr. Mishra still spends several months a year writing in a rented cottage in Mashobra, a sleepy Himalayan town of 2,000.
His rise to prominence, however, does seem studded with lucky breaks and chance encounters that Mr. Mishra himself regards with wonder. The first came in 1994, when he was scraping by in Mashobra writing book reviews for Indian newspapers in the morning and reading and ''filling notebooks like a crazy person'' in the afternoon.
One day he got a letter from David Davidar, the publisher of Penguin India, asking if he'd like to do a book for the princely advance of $125.
''Butter Chicken in Ludhiana,'' a travelogue about small-town India based on six months of very bumpy bus travel, appeared in 1995 to good reviews and respectable sales. Next came a six-month stint as an editor at HarperCollins India in New Delhi, where Mr. Mishra quickly made a mark by acquiring Arundhati Roy's ''God of Small Things.''
His next big break came in 1997, after he'd moved back to Mashobra to start writing again. One day he noticed that Barbara Epstein, an editor at The New York Review of Books, would be giving a lecture in Delhi, and he sent her a note asking to meet.
After a friendly dinner Ms. Epstein invited him to submit a piece. His essay ''Edmund Wilson in Benares,'' about discovering Wilson's books in the local library and finding curious echoes of his own chaotic world, appeared the next year, followed by a check for $4,000 -- nearly 40 times the advance for ''Butter Chicken.''
Next came a deal for a novel, ''The Romantics,'' about a shy young Indian man's encounter with Western spiritual seekers, published in 2000 by Random House to strong reviews. Mr. Mishra seemed to be riding the global vogue for Indian fiction, but he turned his attention instead to nonfiction, filing long pieces of reportage for The New York Review, along with investigative pieces about suspected human rights abuses by the Indian Army that did not endear him to Hindu nationalists at home.
''Pankaj was one of the first people to write serious nonfiction from India at a time when everyone else was writing fiction,'' said Akash Kapur, the author of ''India Becoming: A Portrait of Life in Modern India.'' ''His work was a harbinger of the nonfiction boom we're seeing right now.''
Mr. Mishra, who has contributed articles and reviews to The New York Times, also began writing increasingly about non-Indian subjects, filing dispatches from Afghanistan, China and beyond, some of which appeared in the 2006 collection ''Temptations of the West.''
But even as he has spent less time in India, he can still raise hackles there. In a 2010 speech to the Indian Parliament, the prominent pro-globalization economist Jagdish N. Bhagwati denounced Mr. Mishra's harsh critiques of India's economic liberalization as ''fiction masquerading as nonfiction.'' And last year the writer Patrick French, whose ''India: A Portrait'' had been dismissed by Mr. Mishra, published a riposte in the Indian magazine Outlook, charging him with self-righteously attacking any writer who dares to praise capitalism, even cautiously.
As for the fracas with Mr. Ferguson, Mr. Mishra professes continued puzzlement. ''I don't know why he took it so personally,'' he said. The review's provocative comparison between Mr. Ferguson and Theodore Lothrop Stoddard, the author of the 1920 best seller ''The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy,'' Mr. Mishra insisted, was not meant to imply that Mr. Ferguson was a racist, as Mr. Ferguson charged in a long reply to The London Review, accusing him of ''character assassination.''
In his new book Mr. Mishra -- an ardent critic of the American-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- has disdainful words for unnamed ''pundits'' who substitute ideological certainties for the messiness of experience. And while he writes a regular column for Bloomberg News, he doesn't want to hang the label on himself.
''It's a frightening, frightening word,'' he said.
For all his success, Mr. Mishra still retains a bit of what, in ''Edmund Wilson in Benares,'' he called ''the furious intensity of a small-town boy for whom books are the sole means of communicating with, and understanding, the larger world.''
''My dominant feeling every day is one of great ignorance,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Expect Fewer Seats, Even for Overseas Flights

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WHERE are we going?
That's a basic question about air travel, of course. It reminds me of a true story from the 1980s about a man in the Los Angeles Airport who was headed home to Oakland, Calif., but ended up instead halfway around the world, in Auckland, New Zealand, because of a gate agent's confusion over pronunciation -- back when air travel was a lot more casual.
But I digress. The question today is, now that the summer travel season is ending and the peak business-travel periods approach, what kind of an air-travel system are we going to be looking at? 
Short term, expect more of the same, except maybe worse, for passengers. While raising fares and adding fees, airlines have cut domestic capacity -- by about 11 percent since 2005 -- reducing service in many midsize and smaller markets and stuffing more people than ever into airplanes. And as they evaluate fall bookings, airlines have given every indication that they will cut even more capacity if necessary to maintain a profitable balance of supply and demand.
Companies are also evaluating costs compared with potential returns. Corporate managers are ''more quick on the trigger than they were in the past'' to cut back on travel when the economy slows, J. Scott Kirby, the president of US Airways, said recently.
Shocked by record jet-fuel prices that peaked around $3 a gallon in early 2008, domestic airlines have significantly revised their business models. We have seen mergers (Delta and Northwest, United and Continental, Southwest and AirTran) and rumors of mergers (American and US Airways).
At the same time, the network carriers have bolstered dependence on their international alliance partners and joint ventures on specific routes. That trend has been called ''metal neutral'' -- that is, to the airline, it matters less than ever whether you are flying on their plane or a partner's brand, because they are all sharing the money and cooperating on the schedules.
Domestically, the main effect will most likely be more capacity cuts, especially in smaller markets that airlines have decided do not provide enough revenue to fit in with evolving international strategies.
''They are very disciplined now,'' said Savanthi Syth, an airline analyst at Raymond James. ''Capacity discipline'' has become a mantra in airline executive offices.
And there are indications that capacity discipline, which has so fundamentally reshaped the domestic market, is now being applied more assiduously to international markets.
''The cuts that United and Delta talked about for the second half of this year, they were coming from the trans-Atlantic market,'' said Ms. Syth, who is sanguine about airline fortunes mainly because companies have been so agile in trimming flights and routes. ''That's exactly what capacity discipline is supposed to do, take seats away from markets that are weak,'' she said.
American Airlines, which is working its way through bankruptcy reorganization while US Airways presses relentlessly for a merger, devised one template for the current industry strategies when it announced what it called its ''cornerstone'' business model in September 2009.
American said it would focus its domestic efforts on feeding ''high-value fliers'' -- read business travelers, especially those traveling internationally or on its international partners the Oneworld alliance -- into and out of five ''cornerstone'' markets: Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York, Los Angeles and Miami.
''Our objective is to be the best-positioned airline in those markets that matter most to our customers and that complement the strength of our partner airlines in Oneworld, and our joint business partners,'' American said.
That generated a lot of skepticism at the time. But American's troubles aside, the strategy did essentially outline a continuing industrywide evolution, in which lesser markets languish because they do not generate enough revenue per flight, while attention is lavished on markets that feed higher-revenue customers to and from international networks.
In the long term, the industry changes are ''structurally fundamental and permanent,'' said Michael Boyd, the president of the airline forecasting company the Boyd Group International.
For an indication of how important new global routes are, look again at some recent moves by American, even in bankruptcy.
On Monday, American announced new weekly nonstop service between Miami and Honduras, a distance of 740 miles, starting in November, using the newer 160-seat Boeing 737-800s it is buying to replace its old MD-80 fleet. American also plans to start four-day-a-week service between Miami and Asuncion, Paraguay, in November, using Boeing 757s. In June, American started daily service between Miami and Manaus, Brazil, also using 737-800s.
In every case, those routes are being flown by airplanes that are more customarily flown on medium- or long-haul domestic flights.

HEADLINE: Caution Among Buyers of Luxury Constrains Tiffany's Results

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Tiffany & Company lowered its outlook for the year on Monday as the wealthy cut back on buying jewelry and other luxury goods in an uncertain economy.
But Tiffany's shares rose more than 7 percent as revenue in established stores, an important measure for retailers, declined less than analysts had expected in its fiscal second quarter. Investors may also have been encouraged that Tiffany is planning stores in new cities despite its challenges. 
Starting late last year, Tiffany's customers began trimming their spending on jewelry amid stock market volatility and growing worry about the debt crisis in Europe.
''Not surprisingly, sales growth has been affected by economic weakness in a number of markets,'' said Michael J. Kowalski, Tiffany's chief executive. He added, ''We think it is only prudent to maintain a cautious near-term outlook about global economic conditions and the effects on customer spending.''
Tiffany earned $91.8 million, or 72 cents a share, for the period ended July 31, up 2 percent from $90 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts expected earnings of 74 cents a share.
Revenue for Tiffany rose 2 percent to $886.6 million. Wall Street forecast $891.1 million.
Over all, revenue at stores opened at least a year fell 1 percent. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected a 4 percent drop.
Tiffany plans to open 28 company-operated stores this year compared with the previously planned 24. In the second half, Tiffany plans a store in SoHo in Manhattan. a second store in San Francisco, a shop in the La Jolla area of San Diego, a store in Rio de Janeiro and a third store in Toronto.
Tiffany said that it now expects 2012 earnings of $3.55 to $3.70 a share, down from $3.70 to $3.80 a share. Analysts predict $3.65 a share.
It also trimmed its revenue forecast to growth of 6 to 7 percent for the year, or about $3.86 billion to $3.89 billion. Its prior guidance was for a 7 to 8 percent increase. Analysts expect revenue of $3.87 billion.
Tiffany's stock gained $4.21, or 7.2 percent, to $62.71.

HEADLINE: Running on Algae, Drawing Anger

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
When the Navy put a Pacific fleet through maneuvers on a $12 million cocktail of biofuels this summer, it proved that warships could actually operate on diesel from algae or chicken fat.
''It works in the engines that we have, it works in the aircraft that we have, it works in the ships that we have,'' said Ray Mabus, secretary of the Navy. ''It is seamless.''
The still-experimental fuels are also expensive -- about $27 a gallon for the fuel used in the demonstration, compared with about $3.50 a gallon for conventional military fuels.
And that has made them a flash point in a larger political battle over government financing for new energy technologies. 
''You're not the secretary of energy,'' Representative Randy Forbes, a Republican from Virginia, told Mr. Mabus as he criticized the biofuels program at a hearing in February. ''You're the secretary of the Navy.''
The House, controlled by Republicans, has already approved measures that would all but kill Pentagon spending on purchasing or investing in biofuels. A committee in the Senate, led by Democrats, has voted to save the program. The fight will heat up again when Congress takes up the Defense Department's budget again in the fall.
The naval demonstration -- known as the Great Green Fleet -- was part of a $510 million three-year, multiagency program to help the military develop alternatives to conventional fuel. It is a drop in the ocean of the Pentagon's nearly $650 billion annual budget.
But with the Defense Department facing $259 billion in budget cuts over the next five years, some lawmakers argue that the military should not be spending millions on developing new fuel markets when it is buying less equipment and considering cutting salaries.
This phase of the military's exploration of alternative fuels began under President George W. Bush and grew out of a task force that Donald Rumsfeld, then the secretary of defense, convened in 2006 to explore ways to reduce dependence on petroleum. If the military had less need to transport and protect fuel coming from the Middle East, the thinking went, the fighting forces could become more flexible and efficient, with fewer lives put at risk.
In addition to biofuels, early efforts included developing liquid fuels from coal and natural gas for the Air Force, the largest energy user of the armed services. But the gas and coal fuels would not meet cost or environmental requirements, officials said. The Defense Department focused on advanced biofuels, which are generally made from plant and animal feedstocks that don't compete with food uses, which is a concern with common renewable fuels like the corn-based ethanol used in cars.
The federal Renewable Fuel Standard, which sets targets for renewable fuel production and requires a certain amount to be blended into conventional gasoline and diesel, has been the main catalyst for the growth of several companies exploring new technologies.
Investors, however, have been leery of the enormous amounts of cash it can take to bring the fuels from the lab to the gas tank. Industry officials say that having a large, steady customer like the military could attract other investors to help finance large refineries that would bring costs down through economies of scale. Military officials say that their purchases of small amounts for testing has already helped reduce the cost. In 2009, the Pentagon spent roughly $424 a gallon on algae oil from Solazyme.
''Finding a user like the military can rapidly help to scale technologies that then are used in the civilian marketplace -- it becomes a catalyst,'' said Bob Johnsen, chief executive of Primus Green Energy, which is developing fuels from biomass and natural gas. ''If the military becomes a buyer, that becomes a means by which the production facilities can be financed.''
The Defense Department is always vulnerable to charges of overspending -- remember the $7,600 coffee maker? -- but military leaders argue that what they are putting into biofuels is a blip given the potential benefits of reducing their need for Middle Eastern oil, with all its volatilities.
''Our primary rationale is not economic,'' said Sharon E. Burke, assistant secretary of defense for operational energy plans and programs. ''Our job is to defend the country.''
She said biofuel spending was just 7 percent of the $1.6 billion budget the military was requesting for efforts to improve energy usage in field operations in the next fiscal year. Most of the measures are aimed at reducing the need for fuel in the first place, including using diesel electricity generators more efficiently, putting greener engines into vehicles and aircraft, and using hybrid solar generators and batteries in the field.
The Defense Department is also running several demonstration projects on its bases, testing ways to produce and distribute electricity better. And the Army recently put out a request for proposals for $7 billion in renewable energy projects, part of reaching its goal of getting a gigawatt of its electricity -- enough to power roughly 250,000 American homes -- from renewable sources by 2025.
In Congress, there is little apparent opposition to the overall military push toward renewable power generation or energy efficiency.
But the biofuel program has struck a nerve among Republicans who, ever since the government's failed investment in the solar panel maker Solyndra, have been wasting few opportunities to hammer their message that the government should not risk taxpayer money to bolster favored technologies.
Representative Mike Conaway, a Texas Republican who introduced House legislation that would limit biofuel purchasing and production and has been critical of the Great Green Fleet, said Democrats were using the military to pursue an environmental agenda. ''We just want to require the Department of Defense to do exactly what every other American does when they buy fuel: they try to get the best price they can,'' he said.
Many of the lawmakers objecting to the biofuels program -- including some Democrats who crossed the aisle to support new limits -- represent coal country or take money from those in the coal and natural gas industries. Mr. Conaway, who introduced a measure that would open the door for the military to pursue alternative fuels made from coal and natural gas, gets a large share of his campaign contributions from oil and gas interests, according to OpenSecrets.org.
For Senator James Inhofe, who led a similar charge in the Senate, three of his top five contributors, including Koch Industries, make their money from fossil fuels. Although Mr. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, has argued that the biofuels are too expensive, he has helped steer several military contracts to Syntroleum, based in Tulsa, Okla., to develop a liquid natural gas fuel for the Air Force, including one that paid the company roughly $22 a gallon. Syntroleum is still pursuing coal- and natural gas-based fuels, but is also in a partnership with Tyson Foods that supplied the Navy with biofuel made from waste animal fat for the Green Fleet demonstration.
What happens to the military biofuels program could hinge on the fall elections. The Obama administration has opened the government's purse to provide the kinds of stable contracts and investments that companies say are necessary to raise financing to develop and build commercial biofuel production facilities.
While Mitt Romney's position on the military biofuels program is unclear, he has signaled that the Pentagon's emphasis on using more clean energy would not be a priority in his administration. ''When the biggest announcement in his last State of the Union address on improving our military was that the Pentagon will start using more clean energy,'' Mr. Romney said at the V.F.W. convention this summer, ''then you know it's time for a change.''
Should that view prevail, the industry's already slow development could stagnate, with many of the smaller companies potentially going out of business.
''Our dream was to build a renewable fuels company,'' said Jonathan Wolfson, Solazyme's chief executive. Without the military as a guaranteed customer, he said, it will be harder to get there. ''Is it going to stop us?'' he added. ''No.''

HEADLINE: Huggability And Helium

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla.
My favorite Mitt Romney story comes not from his current campaign, though it has certainly yielded a bounty of priceless Mitticisms, but from his 1994 Senate race against Ted Kennedy.
He's at a convenience store near Boston, pressing the flesh, when he spies a woman about a dozen feet away. She exhibits no evident interest in his advance. He hustles toward her nonetheless, fleet of step and silver of tongue.
''Don't run away!'' is his smooth come-on. 
She lifts her left hand, a gesture that could be a tepid, dismissive wave or, maybe, an attempt to cover her face.
''I know,'' he says, sympathizing with her standoffishness. ''You haven't got your makeup on yet.''
She corrects him: she does.
''You do! You do!'' he chirps, shaking her right hand with an almost manic vigor. ''Good to see you!''
As she slips away, it's not at all clear that she returns the sentiment.
And nearly two decades later, as the stage here in Tampa is readied for Romney's coronation, it's not at all clear that the electorate does, either.
Romney's political ascent and presidential campaign tell the remarkable tale of a suitor profoundly ill suited to the seduction at hand, a salesman whose enthusiasm has seldom been instantly or expansively reciprocated.
He has somehow managed to pull within inches of the most powerful office on earth -- the job that should be harder to get than any other -- despite an inability and even unwillingness to connect, and despite the fact that most of his supporters, including most Republicans, aren't so much swooning as settling for him. That's worth remembering over the next few days, when hard-partying partisans here will do a pantomime of true passion.
As often as not, a convention is a communal lie, during which speakers and members of the audience project an excitement 10 times greater than what they really feel and a confidence about the candidate that they only wish they could muster. It's balloons and ginned-up fervor and manufactured swagger and more balloons.
And in Tampa, the helium and revelry obscure a great deal of doubt. While Republicans certainly prefer Romney to President Obama and rightly believe that he has a shot at the White House, they also suspect that a more likable nominee with a defter touch would be the heavy favorite to win, given Americans' apprehensions about a persistently weak economy. And they cringe at Romney's clumsiness, diligently reminding themselves that their other options were lesser ones: Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain. You bake your cake with the ingredients you have.
Romney's a strange cake. He has racked up impressive accomplishments in both the private and the public sectors, including his Massachusetts health care reforms. He's a man of serious abilities. But he seems unable to accept that a presidential campaign demands more than a résumé. It demands an audible heartbeat, a palpable soul.
His are kept firmly under wraps. In the prelude to the convention, talented journalist after talented journalist set off in search of them, looking for the eureka anecdote, the tear-streaked epiphany. It was a quest as pointless and poignant as any I can recall. You can't add a John Williams score to a corporate balance sheet. You can't turn venture capital into ''Terms of Endearment.''
At times Romney and his intimates do their awkward best to serve up the desired emotional goods.
''I love tithing,'' Ann Romney told Parade magazine, referring to donations to the Mormon Church. ''When Mitt and I give that check, I actually cry.''
At other times Romney just throws up his hands and seeks to turn his aloofness into a badge of honor. ''I am who I am,'' he said three times in a 30-minute interview with Politico for an article published Monday. He used the same line on Sunday with Fox News, naming the inspiration for it: Popeye. You know, the spinach-loving sailor man.
In a confessional era, Romney is stilted. At a time of increased worry about the distribution of wealth, gobs of it have been distributed his way. He's a font of precisely the sorts of gaffes that a 140-character news universe spotlights. His timing, all in all, could be better.
And his latest reaction is to suggest, as he did in the Politico interview, that the whole likability thing is overrated. So what if he's not so huggable or compelling? Doesn't mean he's not competent. Doesn't mean he won't be effective.
That's not the most stirring of pitches. Then again he's not the most stirring of politicians. And the triumphant oddity of this convention is that its purpose and atmospherics compel everyone here, including him, to pretend otherwise.

HEADLINE: Keynoter Christie Is a Skilled Speaker and Tea Party Pleaser

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
You could set a watch to the cadence of the town hall-style meetings that have helped make Chris Christie a Republican favorite in his 2 ½ years as the governor of New Jersey.
There are the flashes of self-deprecation (''You didn't elect me for my good looks and charm''). The Jersey guy routine (''If today is the day you decided that you want to take your governor out for a walk, let me remind you that we are all from New Jersey, and if you give it, you are getting it right back'').
He will acidly insult Democrats, and then offer humanizing glimpses of his bond with his late mother (''Be yourself, Christopher, because if you are, you are never going to have to worry tomorrow about remembering who you pretended to be yesterday'').
It is a performance so disciplined that you can predict the moment -- just before he takes the first question -- when Mr. Christie will strip off his suit jacket and toss it to an aide, who disappears behind a curtain. 
There are any number of reasons Mr. Christie was not going to be Mitt Romney's vice-presidential pick: his state's unemployment rate is among the highest in the nation, his occasional off-the-cuff outbursts have caused many voters to brand him a bully, and even he jokes that his girth is not made for television.
But few would deny that he is a masterly speaker, and the ideal one to deliver the keynote speech at the Republican National Convention, the first at which the establishment will join the Tea Party insurgents who have both lifted the party and thrown it for a loop.
Mr. Christie, a former United States attorney appointed by George W. Bush, comes from the establishment. But no politician speaks the unvarnished vernacular of the Tea Party better -- pointing fingers at public sector unions, speaking of the need to make what he calls ''the hard choices.''
While few politicians are better at staying on message, Mr. Christie also manages to seem unscripted, thrilling the Tea Party faithful who demand a leader who will not sugarcoat the truth.
A sunny pitchman, he dismisses those who differ with him as ''rooting for failure,'' seeming genuinely offended that someone would doubt his hopeful vision. He talks of strolling ''the boulevard of compromise,'' which might appeal to moderates and independents leery of Mr. Romney's No. 2, Paul D. Ryan, a disciple of the libertarian economist Friedrich A. Hayek.
And he lends a casual style to the proceedings. If Mr. Romney looks as if he might want to dust the lint off your lapel, Chris Christie looks like he would buy you a beer.
Mr. Christie was surrounded by admirers on Monday when he toured the convention floor in Tampa, Fla. In his keynote address on Tuesday, he is set to assail President Obama's economic record to help drive home the Republican theme of the day, ''We Built It.'' It is a dig at Mr. Obama's recent assertion that businesses do not succeed alone, but it is also intended to build up Mr. Romney's business record.
Mr. Christie, who will be 50 on Sept. 6, has mostly been mum about what he will say in the address, allowing only that he will not talk about the ''Jersey comeback'' he has been promoting since January. (Democrats back home question the comeback, noting that state revenue is below the governor's goals and unemployment is above the national average.)
Pressed by a questioner at a town hall-style meeting last week -- his 90th -- Mr. Christie demurred, but promised he would talk a lot about himself and how he got to where he is.
So when he takes the stage on Tuesday night, his history suggests that he will start, as he did with his questioner last week, with the story of his father, who grew up poor in Newark and, after getting out of the Army, took a job at a Breyers plant, where the man next to him urged him to do something better for himself. He went to Rutgers University at night on the G.I. Bill and became the first person in his family to get a college degree.
Mr. Christie will probably mention his mother -- the Sicilian in him -- who told him ''You can be anything you want if you're willing to work hard enough,'' and taught him fiscal responsibility at a young age by suggesting, any time he wanted a toy she could not afford, that he go shake the money tree in the backyard.
And he will almost inevitably talk about what he faced when he came into office: a state that was, as he described it in a speech at the Brookings Institution this summer, ''troubled, broke and despondent,'' and at risk of not making the next month's payroll.
As partisan a fighter as they come, Mr. Christie also likes to say that Democrats raised taxes and fees in New Jersey once every 25 days in the eight years before he took office. But he also tells the story of what he has managed to get done despite having a Legislature controlled by the opposite party: he has overhauled teacher tenure laws, and pensions and benefits for state employees, and has imposed a property tax cap. (He may not mention that some of these were Democrats' ideas.)
The speech will mark a high point in a dizzying rise for the governor: a Republican who won in a blue state and within months was courted for a presidential run himself, then talked about for the vice-presidential spot.
Mr. Romney has had trouble connecting with the Tea Party wing, with its suspicion of the health care plan he passed as the governor of Massachusetts and his earlier positions on social issues like abortion. Choosing Mr. Christie to give the keynote address allows him to connect with that wing. It also allows Mr. Romney to tap the best of Mr. Christie, seizing on his ability to deliver a message without risking the potential dangers of his more unscripted moments.
Keynote speeches are often seen as a launching pad for future runs: most famously, Barack Obama was an obscure Senate candidate when he delivered the keynote for the Democrats in 2004; four years later, he was the nominee.
So Mr. Christie will be expected to praise Mr. Romney's leadership. But he will also be selling his own.

HEADLINE: Obama's Team of Idolizers

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- When Barack Obama was on the presidential campaign trail the first time, he used the title of Doris Kearns Goodwin's Lincoln biography, ''Team of Rivals,'' to describe the entourage he would seek at the White House, a combative group from across the political spectrum who would challenge his every idea.
(He also compared himself to Abraham Lincoln in announcing his candidacy at the Illinois State capitol: ''The life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible.'') 
Well, four years have passed and Obama has adroitly steered the bankrupted United States he inherited away from the precipice but has not provided a ''different future'' worthy of the hope invested in him; and that imagined team of rivals became a team, or rather a coterie, of idolizers.
There is only one star in the galaxy at this White House and his name is Barack Obama. Everyone in the Sun King's court has drunk the Kool-Aid.
The failure of hope, the absence of profound change, has much to do with the Republican obstructionism that has helped keep unemployment above 8 percent. But it is also related to Obama's refusal to entertain a real team of rivals, to place around him big characters with big ideas who would challenge his instinct for cautious politics and foreign policy. And so a transformative election failed to produce a transformative president.
In the end the trust of a cool man who had sublimated abandonment into a singular willfulness was limited. The sense of a controlling leader, unable to provide connective tissue to fire the economy, lies behind the fact that many Obama voters will cast their ballot in November with more grudging respect than enthusiasm.
Nixon, like Obama, was a loner, but he had Kissinger generating ideas. Carter had Brzezinski. Reagan had Shultz. The first Bush had Baker. Obama has Tom Donilon as national security adviser. Donilon is an affable pro who has been described as a one-client lawyer. It is clear who the client is.
Then there is Hillary Clinton, a superb secretary of state. But for various reasons (her future is very much ahead of her), she has generally acquiesced to the White House being the locus of major foreign-policy decisions (salvaging things where necessary, as in Pakistan.)
The Obama inner circle remains a group of tough political tacticians: David Axelrod, David Plouffe and Valerie Jarrett. The White House national security team does not boast a single name of strategic stature. Anyone outside Washington would be hard pressed to name one.
The policy upshot has been predictable: cerebral, cool, and with one big exception, cautious. Obama has corrected big mistakes -- abandoning the unwinnable global war on terror and pulling out of Iraq. To his immense credit he took a big gamble on killing Osama Bin Laden. But elsewhere he has been cautious to a fault, eyeing the political calendar.
He held out a hand to Iran but promptly reverted to tired old carrots and sticks; his response to the great popular uprising of 2009 was slow. He took half-steps on Israel and Palestine -- criticizing Israeli settlements, saying the ore-1967 lines were the basis for a two-state peace -- only to offer zero follow-through. Nothing changed.
On Egypt, he toyed with preserving Mubarak ad interim before the tide became irreversible. On Syria, he has in essence dithered. On Afghanistan, domestic politics dictated the agenda, at a cost in American lives.
One citizen inspired to stand outside the Illinois State Capitol back in 2007 was John Kael Weston, then a State Department officer coming out of a harrowing assignment alongside U.S. Marines in Fallujah, Iraq, and headed for Afghanistan.
This month, troubled by events in Afghanistan, Weston wrote to the president: ''When you ordered tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan, I personally did not agree with your decision from my Helmand Province vantage point. I believe Afghanistan remains a marathon, not a sprint -- and the short-term escalation sent our forces into non-strategic terrain and complicated our transition strategy. I knew, however, that our troops -- especially our Marines -- would fight hard in Helmand. And they did. You subsequently awarded the Marine Expeditionary Brigade the Presidential Unit Citation (PUC). It is well deserved. Their effort came at a cost. Ninety Marines were killed, including friends of mine, with many more wounded.
''Next month, Marines will gather at Camp Lejeune, N.C., to receive the PUC award. Secretary of the Navy Mabus is set to present it. While an honor, I know Marines hope you opt not to delegate the day's special gathering to someone else. I feel the same way given ongoing Marine and troop sacrifice in Afghanistan.''
Weston added: ''Please pardon my bluntness: I believe it is simply the right thing to do.''
Obama needed more people in the Situation Room saying, ''Please pardon my bluntness.'' Having sent the Marines in (and concluded a Camp Lejune speech in 2009 with ''Semper Fi'') he should indeed present the award himself.
But the president's semper wary political operatives, focused on votes, may well calculate otherwise.

HEADLINE: On Slow Day of Trading, Apple Keeps Soaring

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Shares of Apple hit another record on Monday to keep the Nasdaq composite index afloat in the lightest full day of trading of the year, with investors looking ahead to a speech on Friday by Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Apple reached a record high of $680.87 during the day. It won more than $1 billion in damages late Friday in a patent lawsuit against Samsung Electronics of South Korea. 
Samsung said it would contest the verdict. Apple, the world's most valuable company, ended up $12.46, or 1.9 percent, at $675.68.
Friday's verdict jolted shares of Google. The case could change the dynamics of the market for mobile devices because companies using Google's Android system might have to consider design changes. Google shares declined $9.41, or 1.4 percent, to $669.22.
Otherwise, investors mostly cooled their heels before Mr. Bernanke's remarks to central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Friday. Data showed volume was 4.46 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and others. The year-to-date average was about 6.6 billion.
Expectations are that the Fed will start another round of bond purchases next month, but Mr. Bernanke will probably keep markets guessing about the timing.
''The big upswing in the equity market that we've seen is based on the belief the Fed is going to do something and that Bernanke is going to say sooner rather than later that he's willing to commit to further easing,'' said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates. ''But I don't think he's got the policy support within the Fed to do that, so the markets are set for some more correction here.''
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 33.30 points, or 0.25 percent, to close at 13,124.67. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dipped 0.69 points to 1,410.44. The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 3.40 points to 3,073.19.
Stocks have rallied in recent weeks on growing expectations for a third round of quantitative easing from the Fed, as well as possible action by the European Central Bank. News from Jackson Hole could determine whether the rally will be sustained.
Investors will be faced with other potentially market-moving events in the next few weeks. The European Central Bank will meet on Sept. 6 and is expected to take some action to support the region's sputtering economy and tackle the debt crisis. And Germany's constitutional court is expected to rule on the legality of the euro zone bailout fund on Sept. 12.
The Dow was led down by shares of I.B.M., which agreed to buy Kenexa for $1.3 billion. Shares of I.B.M. dropped $2.08, or 1.1 percent, to $195.69. Shares of Kenexa gained $13.40, or 41.4 percent, to $45.79.
In other deal news, Hertz Global Holdings said it would buy its smaller rival, the Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, for about $2.3 billion, ending years of an off-and-on takeover battle. Shares of Hertz climbed $1.06, or 8.1 percent, to $14.21, while Dollar Thrifty gained $6.08, or 7.5 percent, to $87.08.
Hudson City Bancorp's stock jumped $1.01, or 15.7 percent, to $7.45 after the company agreed to be acquired by the M&T Bank for $3.7 billion in cash and stock. M&T shares advanced $3.95, or 4.6 percent, to $89.82.
The bond market moved higher on Monday. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 10/32, to 99 24/32, while its yield fell to 1.65 percent, from 1.69 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: A Misstep on Foreclosures

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Cautious Moves on Foreclosures Haunting Obama'' (''A Measure of Change'' series, front page, Aug. 20): 
President Obama's insistence that the government should help only ''responsible borrowers,'' underscored by the statement that ''Mr. Obama and his advisers were convinced that even in the depths of an unyielding crisis, most Americans did not want their neighbors rescued at public expense,'' has had devastating consequences for the economy and an ironic effect on homeowners who shared that attitude.
Borrowers who were current in their mortgage payments saw their homes lose value partly as a result of mortgage foreclosures. It's a great example of shooting yourself in the foot, motivated by the intent to be punitive.
If for no other reason than self-interest, we should support efforts to sustain property values rather than worsen the situation through foreclosures.
The administration's reaction was quite different when it came to bailing out the banks.

Re ''Romney Adopts Harder Message for Last Stretch'' (front page, Aug. 26):
The Romney campaign's turn to a more combative message to attract a wider range of disgruntled voters signals the final chapter in the Republican strategy to recapture control of government.
After Republicans ran against the health care law in the 2010 midterm elections and won control of the House and gained seats in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, candidly declared, ''Our top political priority over the next two years should be to deny President Obama a second term.'' 
Dutifully following orders, Congressional Republicans have frustrated every major administration effort to improve the economy. Successful in this policy of obstruction, they are now ready to shift blame to the president for the weak economy.
In November we will learn who will be held accountable for the hard times.

To the Editor:
Re ''Paul Ryan's Social Extremism'' (editorial, Aug. 27): I support abortion rights and gay marriage. So why will I vote for the Romney-Ryan ticket on Nov. 6? Well, I recognize that it's possible for people of good will to be morally opposed to abortion, and that not everyone who doesn't support gay marriage is an anti-homosexual bigot.
More important, I know that the Supreme Court took abortion out of legislative politics some 40 years ago and that, should it ever be returned to the electoral arena, it will, like gay marriage, be an issue for the states. And in the hands of American voters, I am confident those issues will be resolved consistent with their fundamental decency and moderation.
I also know that rather than heeding cautions to slow down on the fiscal road we are on -- which leads inexorably to Athens -- President Obama has stepped on the gas. Since that is something the president can do something about, I will not be swayed by what President Obama might call ''distractions,'' or by editorials that embody the very extremism and intolerance they purport to condemn.

To the Editor:
The word ''fantasy'' has been used prominently in the past few days in columns by David Brooks, Paul Krugman and Gail Collins to describe the approach of our political parties and candidates to vital matters of public policy. These columns give voice to a fact that is already familiar to so many of us: Our nation's greatest problem is not the economy or the environment or Medicare; it's our wholesale avoidance of reality.
Our politics today contain as much reality as reality TV. When will we shut down the multibillion-dollar industry of political theater and elect people to do the practical, modestly paid and unglamorous work of dealing with real problems?
RON MEYERS New York, Aug. 25, 2012
To the Editor:
After reading ''What the G.O.P. Platform Represents'' (editorial, Aug. 22), I must say I am confused. Republicans say they want government out of everything and are for ''personal responsibility.'' Why then can we not be trusted to take ''personal responsibility'' for our most intimate and personal choices: for whom we choose to marry, for the health decisions we make with our doctors and for what religious practices we choose to follow?
Can someone explain this to me?
HANNAH BANKS Newton, Mass., Aug. 23, 2012
To the Editor:
I certainly applaud the Republican Party leaders for their common-sense ban on weapons and weapon look-alikes within the security perimeter at the G.O.P. convention in Tampa (''Banned Items: For Tampa's G.O.P. Visitors, What to Be Sure to Leave Behind,'' The Caucus, Aug. 25).
But I'm wondering why the G.O.P. leaders have instituted the ban. Are they afraid for their safety? Do they believe that allowing attendees the right to bear arms in a crowd is not a good idea? If so, I hope the party platform's position on gun rights will reflect such deep concern for safety for all of us.

HEADLINE: Election 2012 | Debt Clock: A Reminder That Time Is Money

BYLINE: By ASHLEY SOUTHALL

 BODY:
As Republicans gather in Tampa, Fla., for their convention, party leaders want to drive home a message to voters: The federal debt is hurtling toward $16 trillion, and it is President Obama's fault. 
That's the gist of what the party chairman, Reince Priebus, said as he banged a gavel to open the convention Monday afternoon. The banging activated a "debt clock" in the convention hall that tallies the amount the debt accumulating during the four-day event. A second ticker that started running earlier displays the total national debt.
Mr. Priebus said the clocks served to draw attention to the "unprecedented fiscal recklessness of the Obama administration." A day earlier, he said the clocks highlighted what is at stake in November.
"This clock reminds every delegate and every American of why we are here in Tampa - because American can and must do better," he said. "Every American's share of the national debt has increased by approximately $16,000 during the current administration."
He said Mitt Romney and Paul D. Ryan would "turn this fiscal mess around, get people back to work and set our country on a strong foundation for generations to come."
The clock will hang over Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey as he delivers the keynote speech on Tuesday and Mitt Romney when he accepts the presidential nomination at the convention's close on Thursday.
For Republicans, the debt clocks represent efforts draw attention back to the economy after a week in which social issues dominated the political back-and-forth. The move plays to concerns that the federal debt is rising at an unsustainable pace, threatening the economic recovery and national security.
But by drawing attention to the nation's ballooning debt, Republicans are of course not mentioning their own role in its growth during the Bush administration.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Election 2012 | Shifting Sands: Crist Lends Voice to Democrats

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor of Florida who ran for the Senate as an independent, will speak at the Democratic National Convention next week, taking yet another step away from his erstwhile party. 
Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman, confirmed Mr. Crist's role just a day after he endorsed the president for re-election. The chairman of the Florida Republican Party, Lenny Curry, derided that endorsement as Mr. Crist's effort to "shed his skin for a political comeback."
Mr. Crist, who hails from nearby St. Petersburg, was once seen as a rising Republican star whose endorsement was sought by several of the party's presidential candidates in 2008. But he fell out of favor in 2009 when he embraced President Obama's economic stimulus efforts, and he ran for the Senate as an independent in 2010 after it appeared he would lose the Republican primary to Marco Rubio, the Tea Party-backed candidate. Mr. Rubio, now the junior senator from Florida, is scheduled to introduce Mitt Romney at the Republican National Convention here on Thursday.
Convention speakers from the opposite party are common trophies, and have been sought more aggressively in recent years as the parties try to highlight their broad appeal.
Mr. Crist was viewed as a contender to be Senator John McCain's running mate in 2008, but he is still not the most high-profile poaching in modern convention history. That title belongs to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who ran as Al Gore's running mate in 2000. After losing the Democratic primary in Connecticut in 2006, Mr. Lieberman then succeeded where Mr. Crist failed by winning his Senate race as an independent.
Mr. Lieberman's further split with Democrats over foreign policy led him to address the Republican convention in 2008.

HEADLINE: Elections 2012: Hometown Gives Ryan A Rah-Rah Farewell

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
JANESVILLE, Wis. -- Here where the first sparks of his political career were struck with his election as class president, Representative Paul D. Ryan returned for a boisterous rally at Joseph A. Craig High School on Monday, before flying to the Republican National Convention to accept his party's vice-presidential nomination -- a trip now delayed by a day, until Tuesday, because of Tropical Storm Isaac.
Mr. Ryan, who lives with his family on Courthouse Hill around the corner from where he grew up, walked to the stage between a line of pom-pom-waving cheerleaders with his wife, Janna, and their three young children, one in a yellow cheese-head hat. His mother, Betty Ryan Douglas, and his father-in-law, Dan Little, were also on hand. 
"I think I recognize every face in this room,'' Mr. Ryan said, visibly moved. "This gym means so much, it's so familiar.''
Mr. Ryan described how he was a fifth-generation Janesville resident with 60-odd cousins in town, who traced their roots to Irish immigrants in the 1850s.
"Our family's story is not that much different than most Americans' family stories,'' he said.
Friends credit Mr. Ryan's rootedness - he returns here from Washington three or four days a week - as keeping him down to earth and approachable. "Paul is Janesville,'' said Joe Knilans, a state assemblyman. "He's the guy in the Packers hat in the supermarket when you walk down the aisle.''
Republican strategists are hoping that same quality will enhance the appeal of the Republican ticket to middle-class voters, balancing Mitt Romney's image of youthful privilege and business wealth.
Mr. Ryan struck the same note here by embracing President Obama's disparagement of Rust Belt voters in 2008 as clinging to guns and religion. "Guilty as charged,'' he said, speaking as a hunter "whose tree stand is about six miles in that direction.''
"We have a big choice to make, not just picking the next president for a few years," Mr. Ryan told supporters. "We're picking the pathway for America for a generation."
In response, the Obama campaign said the Republican ticket's economic proposals would undermine the middle class. "They'd raise taxes for middle-class families with kids by an average of $2,000, turn Medicare into a voucher system and slash critical investments in education and infrastructure," a spokesman, Danny Kanner, said in a statement. "And they'd do it all to pay for massive tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires."
An adviser to Mr. Ryan said that the hullabaloo that had attended him since he was named Mr. Romney's running mate two weeks ago - Secret Service motorcades, people fainting in large crowds, supporters on rope lines saying they pray for him - had been "an out-of-body experience" for Mr. Ryan.
"He's perplexed about it,'' the adviser said. "'Is all this for me?' He can't believe all this is going on around him. He has a very healthy perspective.''
A city of 64,000 in southern Wisconsin, Janesville is like many cities in the industrial Midwest, where a high school diploma once secured a middle-class job but no longer does. The closing of a General Motors plant in 2008 swept away 6,000 jobs. The 2012 race may, in part, come down to which campaign is best able to appeal to voters in places like Janesville in Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Although Mr. Ryan spoke beneath a banner that said "Paul Ryan: The Pride of Janesville,'' he does not enjoy universal support in his hometown. About 30 protesters gathered beneath their own banner outside, which said, "Paul Ryan Is Not On Our Side.''
His Congressional district, which stretches from Janesville east to the shore of Lake Michigan, is a swing district that George W. Bush won in 2004 and President Obama in 2008. (That same year, Mr. Ryan won re-election a fifth time in a 29-percentage-point landslide.)
In downtown Janesville on Sunday evening, voters expressed a wide variety of views on Mr. Ryan. Kevin Warnecke, 40, a deputy sheriff, displayed a cellphone photo of himself with Mr. Ryan and recalled hearing him at a town-hall-style meeting a year ago. "He's phenomenal,'' he said. "There's not a man in the United States government who knows numbers like Paul Ryan knows numbers.''
Thomas Lee, 58, a registered nurse who once taught middle school art in Janesville, disagreed. "His methods don't solve the problems for low-income people, for middle-class people,'' he said. "Coming from the health world, I've seen people suffer when things get cut.''
Ken Kemler, 55, a restaurant owner, said that he could not afford health insurance for his employees, including two grown sons, and that he hoped that the president's health care law would allow him to do so. "When Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney talk about business, they're not talking about me with 30 part-time employees," he said. "They're talking about the Koch brothers.''
Laura Cleansby, 51, a warehouse clerk, said that she had voted for Mr. Obama but that, if the election were held today, she would choose the Republican ticket out of disappointment with high unemployment.
"I always thought Republicans were more for the rich,'' she said. "Paul Ryan seems to be more for people like us, the middle class. He seems to know more about us, what we're thinking.''

HEADLINE: Romney Seen Pulled 2 Ways Over Economy

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Mitt Romney declared during his unsuccessful campaign for the Senate in 1994 that the federal minimum wage should rise with inflation, a break with Republican doctrine, both Democrats and Republicans accused him of pandering to Massachusetts voters.
Mr. Romney has now maintained that position for almost two decades, qualifying his stand as he sought the Republican presidential nomination but never relinquishing the view that inflation adjustments would be good for workers, good for employers and good for the broader economy.
As he prepares to accept his party's nomination this week, his steady support for an idea vigorously opposed by conservatives and business groups underscores the complexity of predicting how he might manage the national economy.
During the current campaign, Mr. Romney has embraced the conservative view that government can best help the economy by getting smaller, and he has selected as his running mate Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who is a standard-bearer for fiscal conservatism. But a review of the positions that Mr. Romney has taken on economic issues during his two decades in politics reveals a recurring tension between his political commitments and his private sector experience at Bain Capital, which he often cited earlier in his political career in advocating a larger government role in the economy. 
Mr. Romney has propounded the benefits of expanding and enforcing regulations, including the minimum wage and environmental laws. He has argued that government spending, including public investments in private companies, can stimulate the economy and create jobs. And he has advocated tax penalties to shape public behavior, as in his successful campaign to penalize Massachusetts residents who do not obtain health insurance.
In recent years he has modified or abandoned some of these positions as he courted Republican support. But the minimum wage is an example of an issue on which he has held constant.
And some people who have known him in both of his careers say that he still sees government through the pragmatic eyes of a businessman.
''I think his basic philosophy is, whether you're running a for-profit business, a nonprofit or a government agency, at the end of the day one should evaluate how one is doing, and continually evaluate success, and the right criteria is the level of customer satisfaction,'' said Thomas G. Stemberg, the founder of Staples and a friend and adviser to Mr. Romney since the mid-1980s.
The looming showdown over the federal budget would provide one of the first tests of how Mr. Romney would balance these influences as president. He has said during the campaign that the deficit should be reduced solely through spending cuts, and that less spending would stimulate growth. Mr. Ryan is a leading proponent of both views. But in Massachusetts, Mr. Romney worked with the Democratic-controlled legislature to close budget deficits through a combination of spending cuts and increased revenues from higher fees for public services and the elimination of some corporate tax deductions.
A Lost Investment
In 1985, Mr. Romney and his colleagues at Bain Capital made one of their first investments in Sanborn Industries, a Massachusetts company that made recycling systems for industrial coolants. The Environmental Protection Agency had just proposed a rule encouraging such recycling. But the agency delayed enactment, potential customers waited and Bain lost its money.
The lesson that Mr. Romney took, which he described 25 years later in his book ''No Apology'' was that the regulation was a good idea but that the government should have moved more quickly. ''The regulations ultimately led to better machining industry practices,'' he wrote, ''but because they weren't enforced for almost a decade, we lost our investment.''
His support for minimum wage increases reflected the same principle, that government enforcement of minimum standards is economically valuable -- ''I wish more Republicans and Democrats alike understood that important truth,'' he wrote -- and that businesses benefit when that enforcement is predictable.
When he endorsed inflation indexing during his 2002 campaign for governor, he said it would let businesses plan better than they could with intermittent minimum wage increases at the whim of politicians. ''I do not believe that indexing the minimum wage will cost us jobs,'' he said. ''I believe it will help us to retain jobs.''
He said that again in 2008, during his first presidential campaign, and in January while campaigning in New Hampshire.
But under fire from conservatives, he modified his position, saying that automatic increases in the minimum wage should be suspended in some circumstances, like periods of high unemployment.
Mr. Romney has also stopped talking about the benefits of regulation, focusing instead on its costs. His campaign platform includes proposals to curtail rule making, like capping the total cost of regulation at the current level, without adjusting for inflation.
''For every regulation, there are unintended consequences, underestimated costs and unwanted influence from special interests,'' Mr. Romney said in a speech in March at the University of Chicago. ''When the heavy hand of government replaces the invisible hand of the market, economic freedom is the inevitable victim.''
A few weeks after taking office in 2003, Mr. Romney visited a solar panel factory in Lowell, a run-down mill town north of Boston, to announce that a state trust fund would invest $9 million in five companies developing clean energy technology and place an additional $15 million in a privately managed fund to make further investments.
During the current campaign, he has said that the government should not invest in individual companies, criticizing the Obama administration for doing so in cases like that of Solyndra, a bankrupt solar panel maker.
But in 2003, he extolled the potential economic benefits. The fund, he said, ''can become a major economic springboard for the commonwealth by focusing on job creation in the renewable energy sector.''
Mr. Romney's predecessor, Jane M. Swift, had proposed that the state should take $81.6 million from the Renewable Energy Trust, about half of its financing, to pare the state's budget deficit.
Rob Pratt, who ran the fund, said that Mr. Romney's staff called shortly after the inauguration to ask about investments that were ready to be announced. ''It was very encouraging that he wanted to put his imprint on it,'' Mr. Pratt said in an interview. ''After that, I never felt that they were going to take a run at gutting the trust.''
A month later, in February, when the State Senate proposed draining $35 million from the fund, Mr. Romney argued for spending cuts instead. He ultimately agreed to take $17 million from the trust, but he immediately announced legislation requiring the state to buy a comparable amount of renewable energy, maintaining support for the industry by other means.
Mr. Romney's current opposition to such investments has placed him at odds with many business interests. ''I know that not everyone is happy with my discourse on this,'' he told the Business Roundtable, an association of executives, in June. ''But I don't think the government should be investing in individual companies to try and promote individual companies.''
It has also disappointed some of those he worked with in Massachusetts. William Osborn, a private manager selected to help the state invest $15 million through the spinoff Green Energy Fund, said Mr. Romney had liked the idea of combining the strengths of government, including a longer investment horizon, with private sector discipline.
''He's altogether a different person now,'' Mr. Osborn said, ''but back then there was no complaint that he wasn't supportive of this stuff.''
Shunning a Tax Pledge
Barbara Anderson spent more than half an hour in March 2002 fruitlessly trying to persuade Mr. Romney, then seeking the Republican nomination for governor, to sign the pledge for no new taxes that the last three governors, all Republicans, had signed.
Ms. Anderson, executive director of Citizens for Limited Taxation, an influential group in the small world of Massachusetts conservatives, met with Mr. Romney in a hotel conference room north of Boston with a copy of the pledge printed on parchment-style paper ''that looked a little businesslike,'' she said.
''What I remember is that he never stopped smiling,'' Ms. Anderson said in an interview. ''He listened and gave us all the time we needed to make our case, and then he said what he was going to say: 'I'm just not going to sign it. It's not necessary. I'm not going to raise taxes.' ''
But Mr. Romney would soon anger conservatives with a tax proposal that was not intended to raise any new money. In October 2002, he called for Massachusetts to shift from a flat-rate annual tax on automobiles to a tax based on emissions. Mr. Romney was careful to describe the plan as ''revenue neutral.'' It was meant to change behavior. Owners of low-emission vehicles would pay less; owners of high-emission vehicles would pay more.
Ms. Anderson told The Boston Globe that it was an example of ''big mama government telling us how to lead our lives.''
The idea found little support in the legislature, but it was representative of Mr. Romney's broader view that government could improve the economy not just through tax cuts but also through penalties -- as in his landmark plan to penalize people who do not carry health insurance.
''Experience proves again and again that incentives are more effective than controls,'' he wrote in his book.
As Mr. Romney sought to close the state's budget deficit, he also sought to raise revenues by invoking what he described as the conservative principle of personal responsibility, cutting corporate tax deductions and raising fees for things like ice rink rentals and business licenses.
He invoked the same idea in a deal with the legislature to replenish the state's unemployment fund through a combination of benefit cuts and higher fees on businesses, with most of the burden falling on companies that had most frequently dropped workers onto the dole. All states use a version of this ''experience rating'' to set unemployment taxes; Massachusetts under Mr. Romney moved from a modest adjustment to one of the steepest slopes.
''It was kind of hard to argue against those changes,'' said Bill Vernon, Massachusetts state director for the National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business trade group.
Mr. Romney has indicated, however, that he would not replicate the Massachusetts approach nationally. He has said that the federal government's revenues are sufficient, and that he would focus on spending cuts.
He has also backed away from the use of tax penalties. In early 2006, he proposed what he later described as a ''similar but more palatable'' plan to offer a tax break for buyers of fuel-efficient vehicles, with no attempt to recover the lost revenues from owners of other vehicles.
And in December 2006, while preparing for his first presidential bid, Mr. Romney signed his name to a national version of the pledge for no new taxes.

HEADLINE: To Fill Out The Ticket, It Was Once New Yorkers

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
If Virginia used to be the mother of presidents, as schoolchildren there were taught for generations, New York used to be the mother of vice presidents. But what happened in the 20th century? There has not been an elected vice president from New York in nearly 100 years.
Those decidedly New York-centric thoughts came to mind as the Republican National Convention prepared to make Mitt Romney's choice of a running mate official this week by nominating Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.
New York has produced 11 vice presidents, and two figure in important footnotes: Nelson A. Rockefeller, a former governor of New York, was vice president for 25 months in the 1970s - but he was appointed, not elected. And in 1984, Geraldine A. Ferraro, a congresswoman from Queens, became the first woman to run for vice president. She and Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic nominee for president, lost to Ronald W. Reagan in a landslide.
Here is another footnote: The last New Yorker before Ms. Ferraro to seek the office also lost big. That was William E. Miller, a congressman from upstate New York who was Barry Goldwater's running mate in 1964. 
All those footnotes demand another: Ms. Ferraro was not the last New Yorker to run for vice president. Jack F. Kemp, a former congressman from western New York, ran on the Republican ticket headed by Senator Bob Dole in 1996.
Aside from Rockefeller, the last New Yorker who was actually a heartbeat away was James S. Sherman, elected vice president under William H. Taft in 1908. But Sherman died in office, less than a month before the election of 1912. (Yet another footnote: If Taft had won the three-way race against Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt, New York might have held onto the vice presidency. The Republican Party designated Nicholas Murray Butler, the president of Columbia University, as the candidate to receive Sherman's votes in the Electoral College.)
Has New York been in a kind of vice-presidential eclipse since then? Some historians say that as other states grew and political power shifted toward the south, New York's importance waned.
"In the 19th century, New York was especially attractive because upstate New York was the Silicon Valley of America," said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy at New York University. "It was the heartland of industrial America. The great American companies were located along the tier where General Electric was, and Carrier and Kodak. And upstate New York was an incubator for Republican nominees in the 19th century. Teddy Roosevelt was the last vice president who was born and raised in New York City."
And then there are those who wonder why anyone would want to be No. 2. In the beginning, vice presidents were candidates who wanted to be No. 1 but lost. The vice presidency was, according to the vice-presidential historian Steve W. Tally, "a consolation prize" And the first New Yorker to win it was Aaron Burr, who lost to Thomas Jefferson in 1800.
David O. Stewart, in his biography of Burr, "American Emperor," argued that Burr had too little to do as vice president. That may or may not explain why he went to Weehawken, N.J., one morning in the summer of 1804 and shot Alexander Hamilton in a duel that all but ended Burr's political career. (Burr's problems continued after he left office in 1805. He was tried for treason in 1807 but was acquitted.)
George Clinton, who had been a governor of New York, followed Burr as vice president. Clinton was the first vice president elected under the 12th Amendment, which separated the mandate for president and vice president. "The vice presidency became a second-rate office, something to which only second-rate men would aspire," Mr. Tally wrote in "Bland Ambition: From Adams to Quayle," and he said that Clinton led the parade of mediocrity.
New York also gave the nation one vice president who was a drunkard with financial problems and another who, according to Mr. Tally, was so out of touch with the Gilded Age that he lacked "any conspicuous connections to the railroad robber barons." Yet another New Yorker pounded the ceremonial first rivet into the Statue of Liberty. And Mr. Tally quotes Woodrow Wilson describing still another New York vice president, Chester A. Arthur, as "a nonentity with side-whiskers." (The nonentity moved into the White House, side whiskers and all, after President James Garfield was assassinated in 1881.)
The New Yorkers who served as No. 2 all followed Clinton, who served during Jefferson's second term and again in James Madison's first term.
Clinton, according to the historians Evan Cornog and Richard Whelan, "had been one of the national leaders of opposition to the Constitution in 1788." By the time Madison was elected 20 years later, Clinton had been on the political stage for so long, he felt he deserved high office. "Clinton didn't want elected officials," Mr. Tally wrote. "As the most powerful man in the most powerful state of the original 13, Clinton hoped that New York would become its own country - and, of course, he would be king."
When that did not happen, Mr. Tally wrote, "impending senility and failing health didn't mean that he should quit politics." And so Clinton became vice president.
He did not like the job and was renominated even though he did not want to be, so he voted against renewing the Bank of the United States. "As a result of this final fit of pique," Mr. Tally wrote, "the United States had no means to finance the War of 1812."
Clinton did not live to see the rockets' red glare. He died in office before the war began. And the bank debacle contributed to the problems that engulfed the next New Yorker to serve as vice president, Daniel D. Tompkins, the Scarsdale-born vice president under James Monroe. Tompkins had raised money for the war - some $4 million, by Mr. Tally's tally.
When bankers were reluctant to extend any more credit to the government, Tompkins guaranteed the loans himself. And when that was still not enough, Tompkins self-financed the war: "He mixed his own funds into the pot," Mr. Tally wrote.
Monroe's "era of good feelings" was not that good for Tompkins. He was uncomfortable in Washington and was often preoccupied with straightening out his financial headaches. That, among other troubles, kept him in New York so much that some historians refer to him as an absentee vice president.
As for his money troubles, the State Assembly - led by Martin Van Buren, himself a future vice president - eventually approved what would now be called a reimbursement package. Tompkins said it was not enough. Congress eventually voted a more generous settlement. Tompkins got $95,000, equivalent to roughly $1.79 million in today's dollars.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Did the U.S. 'Lose' Ho Chi Minh to Communism?

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: The historical question continues to nag: Was Ho Chi Minh a communist from his very beginnings, or was he a nationalist freedom fighter whom the United States "lost" to communism? A new pre-history of the Vietnam War offers some clues. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - The principal architect of Vietnam's military victories over France and the United States turned 102 the other day, and the old general, Vo Nguyen Giap, while frail, is said to be holding his own. 
He had a firm handshake and a ready smile when I interviewed him 10 years ago in Hanoi, and he talked easily about the "American War," about his legendary battles at Dien Bien Phu and Khe Sanh, and about Ho Chi Minh. 
It was hard for foreign journalists to get an audience with General Giap, but he agreed when I said I brought greetings from Maj. Allison Kent Thomas - the American major who had parachuted into General Giap's jungle camp in 1945 to help train his fledgling Viet Minh guerrilla army. The major's younger son and I were friends from university, and I had been allowed to read his father's diaries and personal wartime letters.
All three men - Thomas, Giap and Ho - receive detailed and scholarly attention in a new account (published last week) of the beginnings of the Vietnam War, "Embers of War: The Fall of an Empire and the Making of America's Vietnam," by the Cornell University professor and historian Frederik Logevall.
A review by Lawrence D. Freedman in Foreign Affairs calls the book "magisterial."
Mr. Logevall addresses the nagging historical question: Was Ho Chi Minh a resolute communist from his very beginnings, or was he a nationalist and freedom fighter who eventually moved toward socialism? The subtext to the question, of course, is whether the United States, with some more prescient diplomacy, might have struck an alliance with Ho and avoided the horrific quagmire of the Vietnam War.
Mr. Logevall, in a recent interview with Jeff Glor of CBS, said that Ho "saw communism as the best path of development for his country, but it was always ." Independence from Japanese invaders and French colonialists was his original intent, highest priority and enduring goal. 
"Ho emerges as an unexpected hero in this balanced book, first seen trying to buttonhole Woodrow Wilson at the Paris peace conference of 1919," says a new review in The Economist. 
"But gradually he and his fellow North Vietnamese were viewed as agents of international communism, not admirable rebels against colonialism. Mr. Logevall bemoans the fact that Ho's admiration for American political ideals and French culture did not lead to a life-sparing compromise."
Ho was clearly admiring of the Americans in 1945, and he actively sought their help. As a sweetener, he had allowed some of the men under General Giap to rescue downed American pilots. 
Major Thomas, then working for the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the C.I.A., was the leader of a unit called the Deer Team, which helped General Giap to organize his "army" of 200 peasant recruits at their Tan Trao redoubt in northern Vietnam. 
The major (who was later promoted to lieutenant colonel) got hung up in a banyan tree while parachuting into the camp, but he was quickly freed and greeted with a banner that said "Welcome to Our American Friends." The date was July 16, 1945 - the same day that the United States tested the first atomic bomb, in New Mexico. World War II was nearly over.
Major Thomas's private journal says he arrived to find Ho very weak and suffering from chills and fever. (The major refers to him as "Mr. Hoo" in his earliest entries. So much for bit of intel.) A medic with the American team treated Ho for dysentery and malaria, and he quickly improved.
General Giap's account was different. He said a local herbalist, an ethnic Tay man, had dug up a root in the forest, burned it and sprinkled the ashes into a bowl of rice soup. After Ho ate the soup, General Giap said, "the miracle occurred" and "the president emerged from his coma." 
Major Thomas, who died in 2005 after a long career as an attorney in Lansing, Michigan, radioed his O.S.S. superiors based in Kunming, in southwestern China, that they needn't worry about Ho's political leanings. 
"Forget the Communist Bogy," he wrote. "Viet Minh League is not Communist. Stands for freedom and reforms from French harshness."
Mr. Logevall's appraisal, in his book, said Major Thomas got it "wrong, or at least incomplete."
"If the Viet Minh stood for independence and against French repression, its core leadership that summer also remained staunchly Communist. But Ho in particular among top strategists wore the ideology lightly, so much so that even Soviet officials questioned his Communist credentials. In Mao Zedong's Chinese Communist Party, too, analysts wondered where the Viet Minh, should it win the right to rule a free Vietnam, would take the country."
While offering the proviso that "history by analogy is a treacherous business," Mr. Logevall also draws a political parallel between the Indochina wars of yesteryear and the current conflict in Afghanistan. From his interview with Mr. Glor:
"Both in Indochina - the French and the Americans - and now in Afghanistan, we were supporting governments that did not have broad popular support, that were riven by infighting, by intrigue, were corrupt in many respects. And it's very, very difficult, Indochina teaches us, to succeed in that kind of environment."
General Giap has sometimes been criticized for losing huge numbers of troops in any number of battles, including at Khe Sanh, even though the victories he directed were crucial to Vietnam's eventual independence. Here is Mr. Logevall on the defeat of the French in 1954:
"The Battle of Dien Bien Phu was over. The Viet Minh had won. Vo Nguyen Giap had overturned history, had accomplished the unprecedented, had beaten the West at its own game. For the first time in the annals of colonial warfare, Asian troops had defeated a European army in fixed battle."

HEADLINE: Indianapolis Colts, 2012 N.F.L. Season Preview

BYLINE: ANDY BENOIT


HIGHLIGHT: The Colts will certainly be better than they were last season, and they have Andrew Luck in place, but there is still a lot of work ahead. 

 BODY:
Sometimes the best thing to do is tap Control-Alt-Delete twice and move forward. There's no shame in doing that after a disastrous 2-14 season when, for 12 years before that, you ran one of the sharpest programs in your industry. The Indianapolis Colts' owner, Jim Irsay, can be proud of what his club accomplished during the Peyton Manning Era, and he can be proud of the all-in approach he has taken in starting what he hopes will one day come to be known as the Andrew Luck Era.
Luck, the Stanford star whom many have described as the best pure quarterback prospect to enter the league in two decades, is the centerpiece of Indy's rebuilding effort, but he's far from the piece. Irsay recalibrated the front office, replacing 69-year-old stalwart Bill Polian with 40-year-old up-and-comer Ryan Grigson. Grigson, a former director of college scouting and player personnel with the Eagles, is expected to wield less power than his predecessor, though that will change if he proves to have his predecessor's eye for talent.
What really made Polian special was the clarity with which he constructed his team. Polian knew exactly how to build around his star quarterback (which, of course, is why everything fell apart as soon as the star quarterback became unavailable). Building 100 percent around your star quarterback is smart. It allows you to cut the right corners and economize. It clarifies most of the inherent minutia for your coaching staff and allows your scouts to be more precise in the players they target.
Grigson figures to have the same level of commitment building around Luck that Polian had to building around Manning, but his methods of operation will be different. The man Grigson hired to coach the team, 51-year-old Chuck Pagano, is a career-long defensive assistant who subscribes to a physical 3-4 scheme. That's virtually the antithesis of the Tony Dungy Tampa-2 that Indy ran for most of Polian's tenure. Pagano has brought in a new staff (save for incumbent running backs coach David Walker and offensive coordinator-turned-quarterbacks coach Clyde Christensen). The man hired to coordinate his offense, Bruce Arians, runs a motion-based system that's vastly different from Manning's standstill scheme. To accommodate these new philosophies, the Colts have overhauled about half of their starting personnel on both sides of the ball. And more changes are likely to come.
While doesn't have to mean , the Colts aren't making any bones about the magnitude of their current endeavors. Expectations are tempered for 2012 and TBD for the immediate future after this season. You can't help but root for a club like this. Isn't a little self-perspective and realism refreshing amid the bravado and hyperbole throughout the rest of pro football?
OFFENSE
It's somewhat surprising that so many are championing Andrew Luck as the best quarterback prospect since John Elway considering Luck doesn't, by N.F.L. standards, have a big-time arm. Luck certainly has a arm, but he wasn't asked to make a lot of difficult downfield throws at Stanford. Some respected experts have noted that he has a few quirks in his mechanics that prevent him from effectively driving the ball.
Where Luck thrived at Stanford was in diagnosing defenses and making adjustments before the snap (sound familiar, Colts fans?). He operated primarily out of condensed, tight-end-heavy formations, where he could set up timing-and rhythm-based throws in the short and intermediate areas. That's Luck's game in a nutshell.
Ultimately, if Luck is going to fulfill expectations and make the most of Bruce Arians's scheme, he'll have to improve his arm strength and downfield prowess. Good quarterbacks can do that after arriving in the N.F.L. (Manning did; so did Drew Brees.) Still, Ryan Grigson recognizes what Luck is, and like Polian was with Manning, Grigson seems fully committed to building around his quarterback's . That's why he took Luck's Stanford teammate, tight end Coby Fleener, with the 34th overall pick and used his third-round selection on Clemson tight end Dwayne Allen. Both will assume prominent roles right away in Arians's two-tight-end base offense. Fleener is the more fluid receiver, cut from the Owen Daniels cloth. Allen is a superb all-around athlete but doesn't have the speed to consistently stretch the seams. He'll get plenty of work as a motion-based blocker, especially since Arians uses a two-tight-end base and doesn't believe in fullbacks.
The frequent single-back sets could make things challenging for Colts running backs. Donald Brown and Delone Carter are more effective runners when working behind a lead blocker. Of course, neither is a particularly effective runner in the bigger picture. Brown, a former first-round pick, finally showed signs of life last season after doing next to nothing his first two years. Down the stretch he was able to consistently gain yards after contact for the first time, and he flashed a "next gear" when reaching the second level. Still, Brown is not a natural downhill runner, and he lacks decisiveness and physicality.
As for Carter, slow feet and a propensity for mental gaffes marred his rookie season. It's hard to forecast a role for the fourth-rounder given that he's not especially powerful and can't contribute on third down. If the new regime were intrigued by Carter, they probably wouldn't have drafted Vick Ballard, a player with a similar style in Round Five. Ballard isn't a third-down back either, which is why veteran Mewelde Moore was signed.
If the Colts rely heavily on their ground game this season, Moore will be on the field often because third-and-long will be nearly as common as first-and-10 for this offense. It's not just that Brown and the rest of the backs are underwhelming, it's that the Colts don't have anything remotely resembling a road-grading offensive line. It's a mostly revamped unit, which is a good thing when you recall the group Indy trotted out last season. The only returning starters are left guard Joe Reitz and left tackle Anthony Castonzo (though backup Jeff Linkenbach, who has seen some starting action off and on in recent years, is still on the roster).
Reitz isn't anything special, but he won't have as much trouble sustaining blocks late in the down as Linkenbach did. He may still be somewhat of a liability, though. At least Castonzo can provide optimism. The first-round pick from a year ago shows very natural athleticism. His his already solid mechanics should only get better.
As for the newcomers Samson Satele has always been somewhat hit-or-miss at center, but when healthy, he can be a very good lock-and-drive run-blocker. He doesn't have the size to move piles in the ground game, but he plays strong when working off designed movement. At right guard, Eagles castoff center and recent Bengals backup Mike McGlynn is expected to start ahead of young journeyman Seth Olsen. At right tackle is Winston Justice, who underachieved for most of his six years in Philadelphia. What progress Justice did show in 2009 and 2010 was negated by a knee problem that wiped out most of his 2011 campaign. The Colts desperately need Justice to contribute in 2012, as their backups at tackle are undrafted Mike Tepper, a fringe guy who has had several "inactives" his first two years, and little-used journeyman Seth Olsen.
It's a good thing Luck thrives on three-and five-step drops because that's a tactic that a front line like this will require. Many of his passes will go to tight ends Coby Fleener and Dwayne Allen, though Luck is too savvy a pocket passer to not consistently include the wideouts in his progressions. Twelfth-year veteran Reggie Wayne was, surprisingly, re-signed this past offseason after the much younger Pierre Garcon got away in free agency. At 33, Wayne doesn't have the same burst and quickness that once made him a flawless route runner, but he's still physically strong and has a rare feel for playing the position. Of course, he's basically learning a new position, as Arians is casting him in the Hines Ward role. That means, instead of just lining up outside on the left, Wayne will be going in motion, splitting tight to the formation (almost like a third tight end) and even catching swing passes out of the backfield.
Wayne's new chores will primarily occur out of three-receiver sets. Filling the more traditional receiving roles will be Austin Collie and veteran signee Donnie Avery. Collie is a sound possession target who can get downfield; Avery is more of a diminutive speedster. Both come with injury baggage, as concussions have been a problem for Collie (he suffered another one in the second preseason game) and knee problems have basically kept Avery off the field since 2009.
Fittingly, Avery missed most of training camp with a hip injury. That opened the door for fast-but-undersized third-round rookie T.Y. Hilton, who is expected to become the team's long-term solution in the slot. Also in the receiver mix is sixth-round rookie LaVon Brazil, though some scouts were concerned about his lack of quickness.
DEFENSE
Chuck Pagano and defensive coordinator Greg Manusky surely understand that 2012 is likely to be a rough transition year for this defense. A lot of players are learning new positions, and many of them will prove to be ill fits. The only dire wish in all this is that the "ill fits" won't include Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis, as, just like in the old 4-3, those two are expected to be the cornerstones of this scheme (or at least Mathis is, having just signed a four-year, $36 million deal; the Colts are taking a wait-and-see approach with Freeney, who is a free agent after this season).
In the Tampa-2, Freeney and Mathis had to focus simply on pinning their ears back and attacking the passer off the edge. Now standing up in a two-point stance and aligning just off the line of scrimmage, they'll have to worry about reading run-pass, taking on blocks in run defense and, occasionally, setting up pass-rushing lanes for others in some of Pagano's sub-package blitz designs. Both being in their early 30s, they have the acumen to handle the new assignments and enough gas left in the tank to execute them. But there's a reason they've thrived playing just one style their entire careers. At their core, both are still pure edge-rushers (Mathis especially - at 6-2, 245 pounds, he simply doesn't have the size to be a fierce run anchor).
Pagano and Manusky know this. And they know that Freeney's and Mathis's edge speed is the best thing this defense has going for it. They'll defer to this in obvious passing situations. Hopefully they can defer to Jerry Hughes, as well. The 2010 first-round pick has been a bust thus far. With none of the new major decision-makers in this organization having any ties to Hughes, this could be his do-or-die season. Hughes played in a quasi 3-4 at T.C.U. and figures to be more comfortable in this new scheme, but it's wise to be skeptical of his prospects. He'll get plenty of opportunities given that the only other backup outside linebackers are undrafted 27-year-old Justin Hickman and seventh-round rookie Tim Fugger. Waiver wire pickup Mario Addison is also in the mix.
It will be interesting to see what the Colts get from their inside linebackers. Third-year man Pat Angerer is a developing, energetic run stopper who plays faster than his timed speed or raw athleticism suggest. However, he's not very big (6-0, 235). He compensates by being a quick, firm tackler, but in this 3-4, unlike the Mike in the Tampa-2, he'll have to shed blocks. And he won't be very schooled in his new assignments considering a fractured foot early in training camp will most likely keep him sidelined until late September.
Jerrell Freeman or Moise Fokou will start in Angerer's absence. Both would have trouble making a lot of other rosters. At the other first-string inside spot will be Kavell Conner, a fast, fluid but finesse-oriented third-year pro who started 15 games on the outside last season.
The personnel is just as precarious in the trenches as it is at the second level. Pagano brought Cory Redding with him from Baltimore to provide quality experience at one of the defensive end positions. Redding is a high-motored veteran who knows how to get off blocks and into the backfield. He can help Fili Moala learn the nuances of the new scheme. The fourth-year pro did a good job of holding his ground in lateral movement as a defensive tackle last season and could be an ideal fit at the five technique spot (aligned over the offensive tackle's outside shoulder). At nose tackle will be solid clogger Antonio Johnson, who was supposed to backed up by former Raven Brandon McKinney, a low-to-the-ground 340-pounder. However, McKinney was lost to a torn A.C.L. in the preseason. His replacement, fifth-round rookie Josh Chapman, has been on the shelf with a knee injury. Rounding out the startling thin second string defensive line is last year's third-round pick, Drake Nevis, who will probably have to add weight for this scheme, and Ricardo Mathews, a little-known seventh-round pick from 2010.
Expect Pagano to use plenty of presnap disguises and overload blitz looks in obvious passing situations to compel offenses to play at a more hurried pace. Pagano can't afford to have this pass rush be as anemic as it was in 2011. Otherwise, the Colt defense will yield a completion percentage greater than 70 for a second straight year.
Manufactured pressure is a must when you have starting cornerbacks like Jerraud Powers and Cassius Vaughn. The Colts recognized their futility at this position and dealt their 2013 second-round pick to Miami for corner Vontae Davis. The supremely talented but mercurial fourth-year pro immediately supplanted Vaughn in the starting lineup and gave the Colts a capable man-to-man defending playmaker. The second-rounder was a steep price, as it will most likely be a second-rounder, but Davis has shown he clearly has high second-round talent.
Powers has been decent as an off-coverage corner for most of his first three years in the league, but it remains to be seen whether he can handle a wide variety of coverages as a true No. 1. Vaughn was mostly a sub-package player in Denver and missed the second half of last season with a fractured fibula. He'll compete for slot duties with free agent acquisition Justin King, who doesn't change directions smoothly enough to be an everydown player. The rest of Indy's cornerbacking depth is composed of little-known commodities like the recently traded-for Josh Gordy and a bunch of undrafted guys.
Fortunately this secondary has a pair of veteran safeties. Two-time Pro Bowler Antoine Bethea is underrated in all facets. He is great at entering the box or making open-field run stops, and he takes smart angles in coverage. Part of his success stems from always playing in a familiar Tampa-2, however, which is why the veteran leader could, for the first time in years, find himself requesting guidance instead of administering it. The man Bethea would turn to is strong safety Tom Zbikowski, who played for Pagano in Baltimore.
SPECIAL TEAMS
Twenty-five-year-old Pat McAfee is evolving into one of the game's better punters. It's weird to think about Adam Vinatieri still kicking for this rebuilding team considering we associate the 17th-year veteran with so many big game moments. Vinatieri still has plenty of leg. LaVon Brazil was drafted to be the full-time return artist; if he can't secure that job, fellow rookie T.Y. Hilton will get a look.
BOTTOM LINE
The Colts will certainly be better than they were last season, but they have a lot of groundwork still to lay. The most important piece is in place (Andrew Luck), and it helps that they're already cultivating long-term receiving targets for him. But there are still needs in the backfield and offensive line, and the entire defense is frighteningly thin.

Deal Helps a Bank Catch Up in Capital | One of the nation's bigger regional banks, M&T Bank, has had a hectic few days of deal-making.
Last week, M&T paid back the government its bailout money, and on Monday it announced the acquisition of Hudson City Bancorp, a struggling mortgage lender. The transactions appear to affirm M&T's reputation as a hardy institution that has sought since the financial crisis to avoid hurting the interests of its shareholders.
But the deals also show M&T, based in Buffalo, as a bank in need of more capital. The bank is paying roughly $3.7 billion for Hudson City, which is based in Paramus, N.J., and was held up as paragon of sound residential mortgage lending in the midst of the financial crisis. In the last two years, however, Hudson City's earnings have declined as interest rates have fallen and demand for its mortgages has diminished. DealBook »
Far From Wall Street and Silicon Valley, a Focus on Family Ties | When the hedge fund manager David Einhorn was just another investment analyst in the mid-1990s, his family gave him $500,000 to get his fund, Greenlight Capital, off the ground. Now that he is a billionaire after a career of doing battle with large corporations, he has returned the favor.
A world away from Wall Street and the tech money culture of Silicon Valley, the Einhorn family started a venture capital firm here, which raised a $40 million fund last year.
David Einhorn is the largest investor in the fund, run by his brother, Daniel, and their father, Stephen. The firm, Capital Midwest Fund, also led by another partner, Alvin Vitangcol, has ambitions of changing the way early stage investments are run. DealBook »

HEADLINE: HSBC's Rising Legal Liability

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: HSBC's legal headaches may not go away anytime soon, and when they do, the resolutions could be costly. 

 BODY:
The legal headaches at HSBC may not go away anytime soon, and when they do, the resolutions could be costly.
The first problem is the extent of government scrutiny of the bank. 
HSBC has been ensnared by some of the largest federal inquiries into the banking industry. The government is looking into whether the bank ran afoul of restrictions on dealings with countries subject to economic sanctions, including Iran and Cuba. It is investigating HSBC for possible violations of regulations against money laundering. Authorities are also focusing on HSBC as part of the broad inquiry into rate rigging.
 The eventual costs could be sizable.
In a recent filing, the bank disclosed that it had set aside $700 million to pay potential penalties associated with the investigation related to money laundering and one mounted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control into dealings with countries subject to economic sanctions. But that amount looks to be on the low side of its potential exposure, according to .
Federal authorities think HSBC could end up paying at least $1 billion. The bank itself said "it is possible that the amounts when finally determined could be higher, possibly significantly higher."
And that does not account for the potential cost to beef up its compliance standards. 
The government's regulations enforcing economic sanctions could be portrayed as mere technicalities, a reflection of the long-standing antipathy between the United States and Iran and Cuba that have been foisted on the banking system. Money laundering, on the other hand, is something clearly prohibited by every developed nation because of fears the banks can be used to finance terrorists and drug dealers. 
A report issued by a Senate subcommittee claims the bank ignored numerous warnings about the operation of its Mexican subsidiary, which allowed bulk cash transfers of billions of dollars on behalf of clients that may have included drug cartels. 
A spokesman for HSBC asserted that this "case is not about HSBC complicity in money laundering. Rather, it's about lax compliance standards that fell short of regulators' expectations and our expectations, and we are absolutely committed to remedying what went wrong and learning from it."
As such, any settlement over the matter is likely to require HSBC to enhance its compliance protocols for money laundering. In other cases involving accounting fraud, federal prosecutors have mandated the appointment of an outside monitors, sometimes for three or more years. With operations in 84 countries and 60 million customers, the cost of an outside monitor for HSBC would be significant if the government wants someone to keep an eye on the bank's internal controls. 
HSBC has been pushing to settle the investigations quickly, but whether prosecutors and regulators are willing to wrap up the cases in a short time period remains to be seen. 
One potential roadblock is the investigation into rate manipulation. HSBC is among more than a dozen banks that helped set a benchmark rate known as the London offered interbank rate, or Libor. 
Given that HSBC is part of that inquiry, authorities may be reluctant to settle the other matters before they know the full extent of the bank's exposure to the Libor case. Prosecutors will want to avoid the appearance of going easy on HSBC by entering into a string of settlements in which the bank pays a chunk of money while only being required to promise to be good in the future.
The potential costs associated with the Libor case may only add to HSBC's woes. Barclays paid $450 million to settle allegations by global regulators related to the Libor case. Along with the investigations by regulators around the global, the Libor case also holds the potential for significant financial exposure to civil lawsuits for antitrust violations. 
HSBC has not begun to put a figure on its potential bill for Libor. In its latest earnings results, the bank said it had not yet set aside money for potential fines or settlements related to the global investigation. 
"Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these regulatory investigations or private lawsuits, including the timing and potential impact on HSBC," the bank said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Following Up on a Restaurant's Unconventional Strategy

BYLINE: IAN MOUNT


HIGHLIGHT: The Red Iguana's owners make the most of a road project that forces them to shut down. 

 BODY:
A year ago, we told you about a dilemma facing Red Iguana, a family-owned Mexican restaurant in Salt Lake City. Its owners, Lucy Cardenas and Bill Coker, were facing a two-pronged problem with their first location. First, a happy problem: their restaurant had gotten so popular after appearing on the Food Network's "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives" that customers regularly had to wait an hour to be seated. At the same time, the city was about to build a light rail line down the middle of the restaurant's street, a project that had the potential to force the business to close for several weeks.
To ease the customer wait and protect themselves from downtime, there was little doubt that Red Iguana's owners needed a second location. But they decided to expand was somewhat surprising. Ms. Cardenas and Mr. Coker decided to open a second location with the same name and menu just two blocks from their first, a plan that went against conventional wisdom and was rejected by most of the experts we consulted at the time of our original article.
But the strategy quickly found success. During its first full year, 2010, the new restaurant had revenue of $2.1 million. Still, that was only a little more than half of the original restaurant's annual take of $3.9 million, which itself was down from $4.2 million in 2009. So, would the new location be able to build on its early success (without cannibalizing the original business)? And what would happen when the construction project shut down the first location? 
We recently checked in with Mr. Coker, and the new location seems to have built on its strong start. The original location is on track to bring in $4.2 million during 2012, he said, which would match its income from the height of its popularity in 2009 (when it was the only restaurant). And the new location should pull in about $3.2 million, he said.
"What we've seen is that there are a substantial number of our clientele who prefer location No. 2 to No. 1 because when the patio is open, there are more seats, and we have a counter and indoor waiting area and valet parking in the evenings," Mr. Coker said. "It's more spacious and quieter than the original, and some people prefer that atmosphere. Others prefer the original. It's actually turned out to be to our advantage that it's not a cookie-cutter of the original; we're able to accommodate two different types of clients. Also in terms of operational ease, it's a tremendous advantage to our kitchen managers to be able to stabilize food flow by running two blocks to the other restaurant."
Almost as important, the second location saved the company from what could have been major economic damage caused by construction of the rail line. As a member of a community board advising the city on the construction, Mr. Coker negotiated a deal whereby the street in front of the original Red Iguana would be rebuilt last, so that the construction company could concentrate all of its efforts on the site - thereby turning a three-to-five week job into a weeklong project.
And then, to best use the week during which the original restaurant would be closed, Ms. Cardenas and Mr. Coker -- after employing announcement cards, banners, Facebook and Twitter to point their customers to the new restaurant -- laid out a seven-day plan to renovate the original location using restaurant workers as labor.
At 9 p.m. on July 8, when the original location turned on its "closed" sign, the city began tearing up the street, and Red Iguana's staff started dismantling their restaurant. Directed by paid trade contractors, a third of the staff from the original location (including a professional painter and plumber) took part in a $250,000 renovation. Working 24 hours a day, alternating crews of from 30 to 50 people moved the restaurant's furnishings outside into a circus tent set up for the occasion; laid an epoxy floor; installed $25,000 of stainless steel equipment in the kitchen; and repaved the parking lot.
"Normally I don't think a restaurant could pull off a $250,000 renovation in seven days, but that's the kind of experience I have from the entertainment business, coordinating multiple crews simultaneously," said Mr. Coker, who in the early 1980s had worked as an assistant director and production manager on a series of Burt Reynolds buddy comedies, including "The Cannonball Run."
At the new restaurant, the owners added 28 outdoor seats, increased staff with another third of the employees from the first location (the final third took vacation), and began offering valet parking at lunch and dinner every day.
And on Monday July 16, one week after it closed, the original location reopened. According to Mr. Coker, even without the seven days of income, the first location took in $282,000 in July, barely $300 less than in July 2011.
