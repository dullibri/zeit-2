A Rush to Build Complexes to Care for the Aging

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WITH the nation's ninth largest population of residents 65 and older, New Jersey is becoming a magnet for the development of specialized housing for the elderly.
Developers are starting or planning a spate of such projects, which provide housing and varying levels of services and health care, from independent to assisted living and nursing beds. Some, called continuing-care communities, offer all three. 
 Several factors beyond the state's number of older people -- which will rise from 1.1 million to 1.3 million by 2010, with those 75 and over growing the fastest, according to state figures -- are stoking the activity, analysts said. They include an improving economy and the trend among the elderly to stay near their families.
As a corollary, the state's Department of Health and Senior Services is advocating less costly alternatives to nursing homes, including assisted-living communities or components of communities that offer residents meals, transportation, housekeeping and personal and medical care.
Since 1994, when the state began regulating assisted-living communities, 15 entire developments or complexes with assisted-living components have been built and licensed. And 457 more are in various stages of the approval or application process, according to the department, which also monitors care.
Many of the projects cater to the affluent elderly, but a few are geared to those with middle incomes. To keep prices affordable three semi-autonomous state agencies are offering construction loans at or below market interest rates. They are the New Jersey Health Care Facilities Financing Authority, the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.
Qualification differs from agency to agency. For example, the Housing Finance Agency will offer funds to projects by both for-profit and nonprofit builders that reserve some units for people with incomes of 50 to 80 percent of the area's median.
The pace of development has some in the industry worried about overbuilding. "The concern is that this market sector is being perceived as the next get-rich-quick bandwagon to jump on," said James Robbins, president of RAD Consultants, a Fairfield-based real estate consulting firm. "This activity is just the tip of the icebreg."
But developers say that in the short term the demand for such housing is greater than the supply under or nearing construction. And analysts say that some of the activity will be in northern New Jersey, where few such communities are now available.
LEN FISHMAN, Commissioner of the state's Health Department, said that the licensing needed from his department would temper growth because it "puts everyone's cards on the table and considers the potential competition." In turn, he added, securing financing "will not be easy."
Developers also must meet state regulations, find properly zoned land on which to build and address municipal concerns over traffic and sewage capacity, among other issues.
Some municipal leaders are becoming more receptive to such projects, developers say. Among the reasons are that they add to the tax base without having an impact on schools and provide a way to help keep older residents from moving away.
The larger projects offer a transition from independence to assisted living to nursing care. In some continuing-care communities residents pay an entry fee for access to all levels, as well as monthly service fees.
The biggest is the 2,026-unit Senior Campus Living of Baltimore complex planned for Tinton Falls in Monmouth County. The 134-acre site along Essex Road, off the Garden State Parkway, will be the first project in the state for the company, which had advanced two previous development plans in north Jersey that were derailed by community concerns.
Brian P. Froelich, the Senior Campus Living president, said that while the size of his company's projects "does cause concern it is what makes it possible to reach the untapped middle-income market."
The company has won rezoning to build the Tinton Falls project on the once commercially zoned site, but still must reach an agreement to buy the sewage capacity for it from Neptune Township. Company and Tinton Falls officials said they were hopeful a solution could be worked out.
Entry fees, which will be 100 percent refundable upon death or departure, range from $75,000 to $312,000. There is expected too be a monthly charge of $900 to $1,500 for the 1,650 studio to two-bedroom independent-living units and $2,200 for the 136 assisted-living units. The fee for a second person has not yet been set..
The fees will cover everything but advanced medical care, "which residents pay for when they need it," said Mr. Froelich. There will also be a 240-bed nursing wing, as well as four 50,000-square-foot community centers.
In Plainsboro, work is proceeding on the first phase of the Windrows at Princeton Forrestal, which is set up as rentals and a condominium, where units may be bought and sold as in a regular residential condominium and no entry fees are required. It is rising on 45 acres in the 1,700-acre Princeton Forrestal Center, the commercial center owned by Princeton University.
The first phase has 83 assisted-living units, 180 nursing beds and a 22,000-square-foot medical center. Rents, including meals and all other services, are $2,500 to $3,500 for the studio to two-bedroom units, said Bernard N. Plante, senior vice president at Care Matrix of Needham, Mass., the developer. The second-person fee is $650 for independent living, $825 for assisted living.
ULTIMATELY there will be 300 independent-living units, from condominium apartments to villas, as well as a 45,000-square-foot community center. Prices for the residences will be $160,000 to $400,000, with monthly fees of $980 to $2,000 covering all meals. Construction is to start this fall.
Developers are also building assisted-living projects alone or with nursing homes. In Park Ridge, Care Matrix will start construction this month on a project with 100 assisted-living units and 210 nursing beds. Monthly fees will range from $2,950 to $3,850 for studio and one-bedroom apartments, respectively, including all meals and services. The second-person fee is $825. Advanced medical care will cost more.
Mr. Plante said projects were also planned in Livingston and Monroe.
Paul E. Johnson Jr., president and general manager of Marriott Senior Living Services, a division of the Washington-based hotel chain, said his company had put a major focus on the growth of its assisted-living suites nationally and in New Jersey.
It has opened two in the state -- one in Edison with 98 assisted-living suites and 30 nursing beds, the other in Mountainside with 98 assisted-living units and a 21-bed special-care wing for people with Alzheimer's disease and related memory disorders.
Monthly rents, including all meals and services, range from $2,425 to $3,690; second-person fees at both complexes is $500. The fees for the nursing and special-care units range from $5,400 to $5,730 a month at Edison and $3,060 to $3,860 at Mountainside. Mr. Johnson said several more projects were planned, including one each in Paramus, Saddle River and Cherry Hill.
MARRIOTT expects to break ground next year for a continuing-care community in Wayne. It will have 220 independent-living apartments, 20 assisted-living units and 60 nursing beds. Entry fees are expected to be $176,000 to $427,000, which will be 90 percent refundable, plus monthly fees of $1,900 to $3,100. For a second person, there will be an added $15,000 entry fee and an additional $700 monthly fee.
Sunrise Assisted Living, based in Fairfax, Va., has four assisted-living communities under way in Morris Plains, Old Tappan, Westfield and Wayne. Each will have 77 units and a wing for residents with Alzheimer's disease and other memory disorders. Rents for a shared unit with an unrelated person, including meals and services, will be $1,700 to $2,800, a month, said Lori M. High, its regional director of sales and marketing. Advanced and specialized health care will cost more.
Rents for a private unit will be $2,900 to $4,300. The second-person fee will be $725 to $1,075.
Of all the activity Mr. Fishman, Commissioner of the state's Health department, concluded: "We will have to see how it plays out, but the licensing of 15 projects so far suggests a reasonable rate of growth."

HEADLINE: ON POLTICS;
A Freshman in Congress Faces Up to Democracy

BYLINE: By Melinda Henneberger; Melinda Henneberger reports from Washington for The New York Times.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A couple of union lobbyists recently paid a call on William J. Pascrell, a first-term Congressman so fresh to Capitol Hill that he had arrived in Washington -- Clampett-style, to hear him tell it -- with a carload of his belongings earlier that morning and spent the time just before dawn wrestling with a shower curtain in his new apartment. Mr. Pascrell, a Democrat who gave up steady work as a state Assemblyman and Mayor of Paterson to come to the House of Representatives, was one of labor's few success stories last November. With the help of unions, he narrowly defeated a Republican freshman, William J. Martini, in a campaign that Mr. Pascrell himself calls "a food fight." And the labor lobbyists wanted to let Mr. Pascrell know that they do not much like his support for a balanced budget amendment. His decision will not be symbolic, either: a vote this month is likely to be so close that a change of one heart could make all the difference.
Now, Mr. Pascrell has an accommodating nature. Making his way from one meeting to another along the hallway of his office building, where he's still struggling to find his way ("I think I'll start leaving bread crumbs"), he stopped to greet a small group of strangers who had come to lobby other lawmakers: "Vietnam vets? I'm a vet. You can count on my support." 
 His decision on the amendment seems a particularly tough call because he unambiguously campaigned in support of the hugely popular idea of a balanced budget amendment, yet he speaks of the unions he would be flouting with an almost religious fervor. "Unions are not-for-profit, like churches!" he thundered in an interview. "It would be un-American to do away with their ability to contribute to campaigns!"
But in Washington, as Mr. Pascrell seems to be learning, it is sometimes possible to keep faith with your friends while also keeping a promise to defy them.
When Alan Reuther and Bernie McKinnon, who work for the United Auto Workers, stopped by Mr. Pas crell's office, the three of them began by kicking around what Mr. Reuther called "anti-worker bills."
Mr. Pascrell cursed proponents of a bill that would keep unions from using dues to make the kind of campaign contributions that were so helpful to him. "Nothing makes me madder," he said.
Moving to the topic of child labor, Mr. Pascrell let loose again. "I read of another company like the Kathie Lee fiasco," he said, raising his eyes to heaven. "Another company that was getting away with murder, a large company contracting work out with child labor and saying they didn't know anything about it. And it didn't make the product any cheaper, either. Just bigger profits!"
Eventually, the talk came around to the one big area of disagreement.
"We, like the other unions," Mr. Reuther said, "are very much opposed to a balanced budget amendment, as a threat to Medicare and Social Security and as bad economic policy."
Mr. Pascrell said he wanted to explain his contrarian view to his union brothers. "I think we need to do it to improve the credibility, the credit rating, of the Congress," he said.
Mr. Reuther countered: "The passage of the amendment could do more to hurt the credit rating of Congress. The amendment does nothing to save $1. The amendment is a gimmick. They can say, 'I've done my thing on the balanced budget, and now I don't have to make the hard choices.' "
Mr. McKinnon said: "And once the amendment is passed, how do you deal with these issues?"
"Well, it has to go to the states to be ratified," Mr. Pascrell said. He sounded as if it might not be so horrible if that never happened. "The debate is healthy," he said, sounding as if it might not be a tragedy if that debate went nowhere.
Mr. Reuther said: "I would just hope you would keep an open mind. The key for us is a vote against Stenholm-Schaefer," he added, referring to the Republican version of the measure.
Mr. Pascrell has supported another version, sponsored by Senator Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat, that would protect Social Security from cuts. Critics of that version have called it pretty flimsy political cover for Democrats who want to go on record for a balanced budget amendment without actually having to balance the budget.
"We don't object to other votes" for other versions, Mr. Reuther said, smiling.
"Most of the unions are against it," Mr. Pascrell said, as if to himself. "People are rather shocked that I took the position I did."
"That's why I asked, how far did you go in your commitment?" to support a balanced budget amendment, Mr. McKinnon said, making himself absolutely clear.
And suddenly, everybody seemed in accord.
"I never committed to the Republican bill," Mr. Pascrell said. "That's not a balanced budget. That's strangulation!"
After the meeting, Mr. Pascrell, whose first re-election fund-raising event is scheduled for March, said the support from the union in no way obliged him to support their agenda.
"It's called democracy," he said.

HEADLINE: GOVERNMENT;
SoHo-by-the-Sea? Asbury Park Advances, but Cautiously

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK

 BODY:
Here in the downcast remains of what was once a flourishing entertainment capital, people have pinned their hopes on attracting artists to live, work and exhibit amid the leftover downtown grandeur and the still-proud Victorian neighborhoods. At $100,000 or less for a roomy 19th-century house, even artists can afford to live in Asbury Park, residents will tell you, as they voice their hopes that their small city, with its ornate but silenced carousel and its corroded, derelict hotels, will become a SoHo-by-the-Sea.
Therefore, one might think that a proposal to build artists' lofts and gallery space in the boarded-up, blocklong hulk of the former Steinbach department store would be greeted with open arms. That's what John English, a real-estate developer from Brooklyn, has said he wants to do, provided he can obtain financing for the project, as well as a zoning change to allow residents in the commercial area. 
 While some here say the concept is a good one, every discussion comes back to fears that hang like clouds: that either the project will run into trouble, or city officials will destroy it with bureaucratic foot-dragging.
"I'm interested in this building because I would like to live there," said Patrick Schiavino, a real-estate investor who lives in nearby Ocean Grove and is a self-described cutting-edge abstract painter. "But I don't know if anything is going to take off."
Mr. English said he was already so frustrated that he has all but withdrawn from the project. "It's not that they are particularly giving me a hard time," he said. "It's more that they can't get their act together. The politics in Asbury Park are more complex than anything I've ever encountered."
He said he had discussed his plans with the Mayor, Carl Williams, as well as the city planner and other officials. When he offered to go before the City Council, he was told that would be improper, he said.
"I think everybody is in agreement that Asbury Park has to change," Mr. English said. "But as everything they've tried to do has failed, they have become so afraid of failure that they're afraid to stick their necks out."
City officials said that while they had some questions about his plans, the zoning question could be resolved with a proposal that the City Council is likely to vote on by Feb. 27. Mr. English has offered about $150,000 for the building, city officials said. The renovation plan calls for 42 loft condominiums of 1,500 square feet that would sell to artists only.
Among the questions are what to do about parking, said Christopher Armitage, director of economic development for the city.
Mr. Schiavino said parking was hardly a problem in Asbury Park, calling it "a ghost town." Let them make people want to come to the downtown, he said, "and if parking becomes a problem, we'll solve that problem later."
Mr. Armitage described the Steinbach plan as "still up in the air," but said he was hopeful the developer could allay the city's concerns. "We have to make sure somebody who comes to us with a plan is complying with our local ordinances," he said.
It is understandable that Asbury Park's administrators would move cautiously on developers' plans. They have been badly burned in the past.
In 1984, a major deal to revive the waterfront was signed by the city and a group led by Joseph Carabetta, a Connecticut developer who attracted the likes of Johnny Cash, the singer, and Ernie Anastos, the news anchor, as partners. One cornerstone was a high-rise condominium development. The largely abandoned beachfront, where sea gulls wheeling overhead are the only signs of life these days, was supposed to turn into a fabulous attraction once again. As steel girders began to outline the project against the sky, the real-estate market plummeted and Mr. Carabetta declared bankruptcy.
Today, reminders of that venture are mortifyingly plain to see, as the concrete-encased skeleton sits unused along what is known as Ocean Mile.
Mr. Schiavino said the city was well intentioned, but not well informed. "Asbury Park is being very naive because they think artists are just going to move there," he said. "Their idea is good, but they have no idea how it will start. They don't understand that in all those areas that artists gentrified around Manhattan, the artists were basically squatting in those buildings."
Kate Mellina, who owns a shop and gallery called Cleopatra Steps Out and is the newly minted arts-business-development coordinator, said she thought the city had proved its potential as an artists' space.
"We've got a core of arts-related businesses that are starting to come in, and we want to promote that," she said. There are plans for a monthlong arts festival in August, she said, and a promotional day last October attracted 250 artists. The organizers had expected perhaps 40.
She, too, is worried about something undermining the Steinbach plan. "As much as I want to see this happen, we can't risk another Asbury-Park-can't-get-it-together story," she said. She said she wanted Mr. English to "go through the hoops of the planning and zoning boards before we start getting people enthused."
Mayor Williams said he was all for Mr. English's plan. But he said, "It seems like we're our own worst enemy, always tying ourselves up with the wrong people."

HEADLINE: Future Trucks: Muscular but Soft Inside

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
IF you think today's sport utility vehicles are plush, just wait. Future versions, suggested in hybrid car-truck concept vehicles on display at the Chicago Auto Show, have the high, aggressive look of off-road gladiators but will offer luxury-car appointments and standards of ride, handling and fuel economy that approach those of family sedans.
Lexus, for example, is showing off a prototype it calls the Sport Luxury Vehicle, or SLV. Based on the Lexus ES 300 midsize sedan (itself based on the Toyota Camry), the SLV, with its roof rack and thick lower-body moldings, looks like a sport utility. But it is intended to behave much like a car, providing easy entry and exit for passengers and amenities that include leather upholstery and a premium sound system. 
 Lexus, which already sells the LX 450, a fancy version of the muscular Toyota Land Cruiser, may offer a second sport utility like the SLV within a couple of years.
The Ford Motor Company showed a similar concept car called the Mercury L'Attitude. Based on the Mercury Sable station wagon, it maintains the Sable's carlike ride and handling but has large off-road tires, a roof rack and a side-hinged cargo door that give it a sport utility appearance.
General Motors' Pontiac-GMC Division showed the Envoy, a compact sport utility vehicle based on the GMC Jimmy. A production version of the vehicle, loaded with luxury-car amenities including a communications-navigation system and rear-seat stereo controls, will go on sale within two years.
The old-fashioned pickup is changing, too. The Chrysler Corporation is taking the multiple-door trend on extended-cab models to the next level, offering four doors. Its Dodge Quad Cab has small, rear-hinged doors on both sides behind the large regular doors.
Other trucks are flexing new muscle. Chrysler showed the Dodge Dakota R/T, a high-performance midsize pickup with a 5.9-liter, 250-horsepower V8. And the Ford Powerforce, a concept truck based on the F-series pickup, is equipped with a potent V10 engine now available only on full-size vans.
Power enhancements also found their way into cars unveiled at the show, which opened over the weekend at McCormick Place. The 1998 Ford Contour SVT, a product of Ford's Special Vehicles Team, churns out 195 horsepower from the 2.5-liter Duratec V6, up from 170.
Toyota displayed the Solara, a convertible version of a Camry-based coupe that will be built at an assembly plant in Cambridge, Ontario. The coupe will be in showrooms in summer 1998; Toyota hasn't decided whether it will actually produce the convertible.

HEADLINE: The Bloch Who Left Block

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
EVEN as a teen-ager, Thomas Bloch aimed to become chief executive of H & R Block, the company founded by his father, Henry, and his uncle Richard.
He cut high school classes to join his father on business trips, eagerly signed on as a tax preparer immediately after finishing college and rose to president of tax operations before he turned 28. In 1992, he was named chief executive. 
 No wonder Mr. Bloch, now 42, recalls the April day nearly two years ago -- when he announced his intention to quit the job that had once been his dream in favor of teaching -- as "the first time in my life I didn't have a road map."
His father, like everyone else in the company, was surprised by the announcement. But the senior Mr. Bloch said he was pleased that his son had the courage to move on if he was no longer enjoying the job.
Thomas Bloch had no teaching credentials, but he eventually found a welcoming classroom at St. Francis Xavier, a Catholic elementary school at the edge of a poor, mostly black neighborhood in Kansas City, Mo. In addition to teaching at St. Francis, Mr. Bloch is taking education classes across the street at a community college. He says he hopes his experience will one day make him an authoritative voice for innovation in education.
"I'm going after a totally different kind of fulfillment," Mr. Bloch said, describing his goal of mixing more time for his wife and two sons with work that is focused on people who struggle with poverty and other inner-city woes. He said that leaving behind his former job, at which he earned $618,000 in his last full year, did not create a financial hardship. At the time he left, his holdings in Block were worth $13 million.
"When you are a C.E.O. in a public company," he said, "you are fairly removed from where the good is really being done."
Apparently, plenty of other high-powered professionals harbor similar feelings. Mr. Bloch says he gets calls from business executives and others at the top of the economic mountain whenever a news article about his move appears.
Mr. Bloch is not the only family member open to change.
His uncle, whom Mr. Bloch credits for the entrepreneurial drive that fueled Block's early growth, stepped down as chief executive in 1976, after the company's first wave of expansion, but remained chairman. After recovering from lung cancer, diagnosed in 1977, he stayed on until 1982 when he resigned to devote himself to sponsoring cancer-related projects.
And his father, who is still the company's chairman, managed to stay involved while gracefully and cheerfully turning over power first to his son and then to outside successors, a feat that is far from commonplace in family-bred businesses. BARNABY J. FEDER

HEADLINE: Day of Whines and Roses;
Proposing Marriage? Make It Short, Sweet and Real

BYLINE: By LOIS SMITH BRADY 

 BODY:
TO propose to Bronwen Hruska, Graham Rayman left a letter on a table in their Manhattan apartment, along with a bottle of wine, a glass and a tape he made of their favorite Van Morrison songs. In the letter, Mr. Rayman, a 30-year-old writer, explained why he wanted to spend his life with her, instructed her to put on the tape, drink some wine and think about her answer. If it was yes, he would be waiting at 9 P.M. at their regular hangout, the Paris Commune in Greenwich Village.
"It was a very heartfelt and real proposal," said Ms. Hruska, 31, a screenwriter. "It would have been embarrassing for him to get down on one knee in front of the maitre d' of some fancy restaurant. That would have taken away from what it was all about -- Graham and me." 
 On Friday, many men and women will live through a moment so momentous it verges on an out-of-body experience: they will propose, or be proposed to. Indeed, Valentine's is by far the biggest day of the year for asking the big question. And for them, wedding experts offer this advice: like Mr. Rayman, "think real."
Some people may still imagine extravagant proposals involving billboards, skywriting or buckets of champagne, but the loud, fantasy-filled presentations of the 1980's have been overtaken by proposals that are emotional rather than sensational, more candlelight than neon in spirit.
Joy Lewis, the owner of Mrs. John L. Strong Fine Stationery in New York, which has engraved wedding invitations since the 1930's, describes marriage proposals as if they were shoes: from Mary Janes to Dr. Martins, each decade has its own particular style.
"The 50's was the time when women flirted and waited for proposals," said Ms. Lewis, who calls herself an "arbiter of decorum" and often advises clients on the latest etiquette. "During the 60's there just weren't proposals because no one wanted to get married. In the 80's, it was limousines with moon roofs and couples talking about their dream dog and their dream house and their fantasies of a dream wedding. It was the time of thinking about weddings more than about marriage. Now, people are thinking about marriage. There's more focus on honesty and reality."
And that can present a challenge, even to today's more sensitive proposer. "As the world gets more impersonal, people crave intimacies that really make a difference," said Marcy Blum, a longtime wedding consultant in New York. "A proposal is a lot less expensive to do these days, but it requires much more thought."
Men and women at the prime marrying age -- the median is 24.5 for women and 26.5 for men, the Census Bureau says -- seem skeptical about everything from politics to job security to love, and they no longer fall for the old "Let me sweep you off your feet" proposals, Jane Rinzler said. Ms. Rinzler, who conducts seminars on Generation X and is the founder of Youth Intelligence, a New York marketing company that studies trends among people in the 22-to-34 age group, finds that they want romance in a proposal, but in a down-to-earth way.
"Because Generation X-ers don't see marriage as the perfect institution and women don't expect men to come in as their prince in shining armor on a horse, everything has taken on a different meaning," Ms. Rinzler said. "It's not like the proposal is the beginning of a fantasy. This is the reality generation.
"You can't say: 'Sweetheart, don't worry. We'll get married, and our life will be perfect.' You can't say, 'I make tons of money,' because everyone knows you could get fired. The only thing you can really bank on is your trust in the person as an individual."
Indeed, when describing their proposals, some men these days sound so honest and sensitive you want to, well, marry them.
Allan DeYoung, 33, a director of new media in New York at TVSM, which publishes weekly cable-television guides, said that he wanted to propose in a way that was "romantic, creative, adventuresome and warm." Last year, he presented Kim Martins DeYoung, 32, with a large antique wicker picnic basket filled with gifts and keepsakes.
As Ms. Martins DeYoung remembers it, "There was a mystery book I love; my favorite perfume; a bottle of tequila, because I surprised him by drinking tequila shots on our first date; a bag of chocolate chips, because I'm a chocolate fiend; a roll of quarters, because I love bubble gum from quarter machines; a beautiful candle; Chiclets; matchbooks from all the restaurants we had gone to while we were dating."
When she reached the bottom of the basket, she found a Scrabble board -- she often beats him at the game -- with letters glued to it that spelled, "Will You Marry Me?"
"The most meaningful thing about that box was the thought that went into it," said Ms. Martins DeYoung, the vice president for merchandising at Armani Exchange stores. "It showed he wasn't coming to me because I strong-armed him. He was coming to me because it felt right in his heart."
Because the basket was filled with things that were more sentimental than expensive, she said, it showed that he was committed to providing for her not so much financially as emotionally.
"It isn't like he's providing me with jewels and clothing," she said. "He provides for me in the sense that he listens to me and understands who I am. I view him as a life partner and my soul mate. A friend recently said to me, 'Allan takes care of your heart.' "
Frank Porcelli, a 33-year-old equities salesman in New York, also decided to go for a small, homey touch. He proposed to Jennifer Giordano, 25, by hiding a diamond ring inside a vintage cookie jar exactly like one her mother used to have. He filled it with vanilla wafers, her favorites, and hid the ring among them.
When he gave the jar to her, it was wrapped in a paper bag Mr. Giordano described as "the oldest, crinkliest paper bag I've ever seen."
Ms. Giordano ran through the apartment screaming. "I absolutely loved it," she said. "I grew up with the same cookie jar, with vanilla wafers in it all the time. Anyone can go to a fancy restaurant, but this was very unique and romantic. Men are finally realizing what's important in a relationship -- the little things."
A YUN HALLIDAY, 31, an actress who was partly inspired by several pals who asked their boyfriends to marry them, used little more than glue, paint and paper to put her proposal together. She said she wanted to make it as simple as possible. So one night last year, she greeted her live-in boyfriend, Greg Kotis, 31, at the airport with a hand-painted sign.
"I got the courage up to go to the 24-hour grocery and buy a big piece of red poster board and a little bouquet of flowers they had on sale," she recalled. "I wrote, 'Will You Marry Me, Greggy K.?' on the poster. I felt like I was painting someone's locker in high school. It was homemade, and homemade is our esthetic -- it's cheap, and you have to embrace its flaws, and it's from the heart."
Ms. Halliday added: "It seemed odd to follow some Emily Post outdated propriety and wait for him to ask. Sometimes I pick up magazines and think, 'Wow, there are still articles about how to capture a man.' That's so foreign to my experience."
(By the way, Mr. Kotis said yes, and they were married last November.)
No matter how homespun proposals become, one traditional element remains: the surprise.
When Stuart Sclater-Booth, 27, proposed to Kirsten Oxboel, also 27, they had been living together for a while. Even though they had talked about marriage often, he still wanted to surprise her with the actual question.
Last summer, while on a monthlong trip out West, he led her on a long hike that ended at a picturesque spot known in the area as the Marrying Tree. He knelt and offered her a bunch of wildflowers he had picked along the trail, held together by a diamond ring.
Like a 50's bride, she burst into tears; like a 90's man, he did, too.
"I think it's more emotional with a surprise," said Mr. Sclater-Booth, a graduate student in economics at Boston University. "If we had shopped for the ring and planned it together, we wouldn't have had the moment of hugging and tears that we had."
Not everyone appreciates such sentimentality. When Kim Martins DeYoung's father heard about her proposal and the wicker basket, he called Mr. DeYoung and said: "Are you crazy? You're going to give men a bad name!"

New Split on Columbus, Over BID Plan

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
In the last 10 years, as Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue have enjoyed an economic revival of sorts, Columbus Avenue has lagged behind.
Touted as an alternative to Madison Avenue in the late 1970's and early 80's, Columbus attracted hip clothing stores and restaurants, but many closed or moved after the stock market crash in October 1987. Business declined further during a two-year, $65 million project in which the city dug up the avenue from 59th to 110th Streets to replace sewers and repair the roadbed. The work was finished late last year. 
 Today, many landlords say the avenue's economic climate remains so dismal that they have either reduced rents or held off collecting increases to which they are entitled. "At this point, Columbus Avenue is still about 20 percent below the market rent," said Robert C. Quinlan, president of Walker Malloy & Company, a real-estate concern at Columbus and 70th Street.
Mr. Quinlan is trying to form a Business Improvement District along Columbus from 67th to 96th Streets. The proposal calls for the approximately 170 property owners to be annually assessed $$300 to $2,000, depending on the size of their holdings. The BID would have an annual budget of $350,000 and would focus on issues like sanitation, security and attracting more shoppers, Mr. Quinlan said. He said about 74 property owners have indicated support, but acknowledged that some of the 300 businesses that would come under the BID are resisting the idea. Many business owners voiced anger about a clause in their commercial leases that allows property owners to pass along the BID fee to them.
And Stewart Schneider, who owns the Associated grocery story on the block between 82d and 83d Streets, said he feared that formation of the BID would give the city an excuse to reduce police and sanitation services.
Some merchants, like Gerald Spiegel, who owns Indians on Columbus, a fine arts and jewelry store, says a business district would eventually drive out small businesses. "When business picks up, big businesses would want to come in and the landlords will jack up the rent," Mr. Spiegel said.
But Michael Weinstein, who owns an Italian restaurant and a bakery on the avenue, said those fears were groundless. "The movement of rent doesn't have anything to do with the BID," said Mr. Weinstein, whose other businesses are associated with the Times Square BID and the 34th Street Partnership. "It's driven by supply and demand.
Forming the BID requires the approval of 51 percent of property owners along the strip. JANE H. LII

HEADLINE: Zero-Risk Leadership

BYLINE: By Richard Darman; Richard Darman served as the director of the Office of Management and Budget and a member of President Bush's Cabinet from 1989 to 1993. He is the author of "Who's in Control?"

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Clinton opened his State of the Union Address by asking Americans to "rise to the decisive moment." In an unscripted aside, he added that he was given a second term "to take the tough decisions." So it seems fair to ask: What exactly are the tough decisions he recommends?
He wants to "make a nation and a world better than any we have known," provide all Americans "the best education in the world," balance the budget, provide middle-class tax relief, advance medical science, build stronger families, end bigotry, and even have "our children grow up next to parks, not poison." Presumably, these are not the toughest of calls. 
 But it is hard to identify what tough calls have been made. The President seems to have over-learned the lesson of his first-term health fiasco. Instead of grand policy schemes, he has shifted to the other extreme: a laundry list of risk-free initiatives. Most of these are unobjectionable: $11 million more for food safety; 100,000 more master teachers; 500 more waste sites to be cleaned up; and so on. Yet, together, the initiatives amount to policy tokenism writ large. They are not scaled to meet the challenges the President has defined. And they leave tough decisions for another time.
The President's budget reflects this approach exactly. A balanced budget is now within relatively easy reach, thanks to the budget agreements of 1990 and 1993, the Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary policy, sustained economic growth since 1991 and private-sector restraint of health costs. With little pain, the deficit can be reduced to zero -- even as popular tax and spending tokens are put forward. That is what the President has proposed.
The problem, of course, is that unless more difficult decisions are made with regard to Social Security and Medicare, the deficit will reach zero (or a token surplus) for at best a few years. Then it moves back up to hundreds of billions of dollars as the baby boom generation enters retirement. To prevent a return of bloated deficits, and to avoid painful adjustments of future benefits and taxes, politically tough decisions on the big middle-class entitlement programs must be made well in advance of the boomers' retirement. That is, now.
The necessary decisions are hardly mysterious. They involve a combination of the following: correcting the overstated cost of living index; reducing transfers and subsidies to wealthier beneficiaries; adjusting the retirement age to reflect advances in healthy life expectancy; and, within reasonable limits, increasing reliance upon market-based approaches to Social Security and Medicare. These proposals have been thoroughly analyzed. All they require is prompt decision.
And that is what the President has explicitly chosen to avoid. Indeed, he has proposed that only after he and Congress have taken the easy approach to a transitory balanced budget should an effort be made to "agree to a bipartisan process" to reform Social Security and Medicare. Thus, not only are essential substantive decisions deferred; so, too, are decisions about the very procedure for deciding!
This habit of avoiding politically tough decisions is not confined to the budget. It is evident throughout the President's program -- even in the areas about which he seems most deeply concerned.
Education is intended as his defining priority. Here, the laundry list of initiatives and exhortations is especially long. In trying to understand the President's tough decisions one might wonder: When middle-class entitlements require restraint, should new ones be created? If the goal is to make American education best in the world, and if the lag is in elementary and secondary school performance, should additional scarce resources be allocated disproportionately to higher education? Strangely, the President's answers are yes. He seems determined to offer a little something for every constituency.
Yet why don't initiatives like an extended school year or market-oriented vouchers for public and private schools make his list -- even if only as worthy experiments? They would reasonably be expected to improve performance and innovation. But by seriously challenging the conventional, change-resistant education establishment, they would entail political risk. The President, by ignoring such initiatives, underlines the driving logic of his "tough" decisions: The politically inconvenient must be rejected.
The effect of the President's zero-political-risk rule is made clear by considering his heart-felt reference to Isaiah 58:12 in the State of the Union Message. He called for Americans to be "repairers of the breach" of racism and bigotry. In the abstract, it seems courageous to put this high on the national agenda -- for the breach is wide. Yet when it comes to particulars, one is again left to wonder: What exactly are the tough decisions Americans are asked to rise to at this decisive moment?
The President has noted a few encouraging statistics. But for much of urban America, reality has not been getting better. Racial segregation is in some ways worse than it was in the explosive 60's. A destructive drug culture is more deeply embedded in America's ghettos. Guns are more prevalent. Random killing is up. Lines between the criminal world and the mainstream are blurred. Public education is strained beyond its capacity to help. Job growth and job opportunities are elsewhere. Social, family and physical infrastructure have all decomposed. An honest reckoning of the cost of addressing this combination of problems would be staggering.
To meet the President's goals of "opportunity, responsibility and community" would require huge commitments from the public, private and volunteer sectors. For those who like such analogies, the necessary investment would exceed the scale of the Marshall Plan and Desert Storm combined. It is measurable in the hundreds of billions of dollars, not in tokens. Even if it were approached incrementally through a series of bold, urban experiments, a serious effort would mean much tougher decisions on the budget. It would not be politically convenient.
And, quite obviously, it is not the approach the President has chosen. His approach to the racial divide combines high rhetoric with low investment. To the inspiration of Isaiah, it adds a political sprinkling of underfunded "empowerment zones." And it leaves most of the practical challenge of repairing the breach to 21st-century decision makers.
It is often noted that the President is no longer campaigning for office; he is running for his place in history. He cites important decisions from America's past as models for America's future. In examining heroic analogies, however, he might do well to observe that much of America's remarkable achievement is the result of courageous risk-taking. And zero-risk leadership is a contradiction in terms.
In a democracy, the challenge of leadership is not to find the path of least political risk. Society can find that on its own. Heading in the lowest-risk direction can yield short-term popularity. But it is an unlikely route to greatness -- and rarely the best way to what President Clinton called a "land of new promise."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
Church Group Battles Pathmark Proposal

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
The block bounded by 144th and 145th Streets, Frederick Douglass Boulevard and Bradhurst Avenue has been an eyesore to local residents for more than 20 years, its three dilapidated buildings on a city-owned, garbage-strewn lot dwelling places for rats and the homeless.
Cuts in government funds stalled the effort by Harlem Churches for Community Improvement to build a retail center with some 150 units of affordable housing above. But now, with the prospect of an economic boom from the nearby Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, developers are vying for a chance to build on the block. This has fueled resentment among Harlem Churches and other local groups that say the city is taking control from them. 
 At issue is a proposal first floated during the Dinkins administration to build a 45,000-square-foot Pathmark supermarket to anchor a residential-retail complex that would take up most of the block. Advocates say that such a store would serve tens of thousands of local residents who now pay more for inferior goods at smaller stores and that it would create well-paying union jobs.
But Harlem Churches for Community Improvement is angry that the city has not allowed the group to select the developer for the site. It says the Pathmark would bring far too much traffic.
The Rev. Preston Washington, president and chief executive officer of Harlem Churches, wants Alpha I Marketing Corporation, which owns the trademark to grocery stores like C-Town and Bravo and is lining up local investors, to build the mixed-use complex. "We want a store that's owned by local businessmen to better serve our needs," he said.
Joining the fight against the Pathmark is Community Board 10, which voted to oppose a zoning variance that would allow such a store on the site. The city has agreed to consider the board's recommendation.
The board chairman, Willie Walker, said members would like to see the retail portion devoted to small SoHo-style boutiques, to give the area a more upscale image, and to have a supermarket built on another city-owned lot, on 155th Street between Macombs Place and Frederick Douglass Boulevard. "We want a quaint residential area," Mr. Walker said. "We don't want people from all over the city coming here to get their groceries."
Sheila Greene, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation, said the city would issue a request for proposals to develop the block in the spring and would then choose a developer. JANE H. LII

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
A Quick Guide to Big Ideas, if You Didn't Get to Davos

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland

 BODY:
DAVOS, the shorthand by which the World Economic Forum's annual jamboree in this ski resort is known, is over for this year. Nelson Mandela, Yasir Arafat, Bill Gates and Jack Welch, among others, spoke. And while they were not talking -- in fact, even while they were up there on the podium -- the business elite used their view from these Alpine peaks to ponder and discuss where the world is and where it may be going, in forums large and small.
So your company declined to pay the $20,000 entry fee, plus expenses, to send you to Davos? Do not despair. If Tom Peters, the consultant, can offer "Business School in a Box," surely what goes on in Davos can be summarized in, say, 1,200 words. Here's the skinny you need to make it look like you were here. 
Think of Davos as a kind of global Renaissance weekend, only bigger, longer (six days) and more serious. With as many as nine panels happening at once -- and many more, somewhat lighter topics (like Chinese medicine and the future of movies and television) programmed for discussion over daily lunches and dinners -- Davos is a pot-au-feu of conversation starters and conversation stoppers.
Except for the plenary session speeches, Davos conversation is considered to be off the record. Here, lacking attributions to protect both the innocent and the guilty, are some of the more thought-provoking tidbits.
 
GLOBALIZATION This year's focus may have been "Building the Network Society," but the Globalization Question reigned in the way that the German Question once dominated European politics. No one doubted the inevitability of globalization, which is a product of the triumph of capitalism. But many fear it, for many reasons.
Some see globalization as the villain behind increased poverty, unemployment and inequality. They believe it threatens the sovereignty of nations, especially small ones that feel obliged to court international capital no matter the impact on their social and development agendas. Direct foreign investment, someone pointed out, is growing faster than international trade.
Globalization may be harmful, too, because it homogenizes the world's cultures. National cultural differences are being sacrificed on the mega-brand altar of companies like Disney and MTV, which thrive by peddling the same products everywhere.
Paradoxically, some experts say quick and nimble small companies may well end up being more powerful than huge corporate titans that fall behind in technology. One man even predicted the demise of America's largest corporations.
 
THE INFORMATION AGE In contrast to globalization, the arrival at last of the Information Revolution won many more plaudits than raspberries. In the political sphere, for example, information technology is seen as undermining repressive governments.
 
GOVERNMENT One drawback to the information age is that it exposes and demystifies all governments, exacerbating the loss of confidence in them. In some areas, governments are struggling to make themselves relevant.
Yet governments themselves contribute mightily to that loss of faith. They tend to do things that succeed in the short term but fail in the long term. For example, the social welfare systems that European nations erected after World War II to protect people are now hurting them, as they steer away jobs and wealth. Unemployment is rampant.
Plutocrats know that these social systems must be dismantled -- after all, not a single net new job has been created in Europe since 1970 -- but they have done nothing to create a constituency for change.
 
BANKS The very existence of banks is in doubt. Some experts believe that new forms of commerce, like the use of cybermoney, will make them obsolete. Others predict that they will thrive in the information age because they are the only institutions trustworthy enough to make electronic commerce work.

CRIME Like everything else, crime is going global. Experts expect organized crime -- drug trafficking, money laundering, financial fraud and corruption -- to increase. They worry about increases in digital terrorism, with hackers wreaking havoc on information networks. And they fear the emergence of black markets in nuclear material that the Soviet republics never tracked after their empire broke up.

HEALTH Nearly half of United States cancer patients are now surviving at least five years -- and the challenge to health care providers is to make that percentage, at the least, hold for the rest of the world.
Scientists are scrambling to discover genetic secrets, but one avenue of exploration -- testing for genetic susceptibility to various diseases -- carries its own risk: nearly everyone will be at risk for some disorder. How genetic profiles will be used -- including by insurance companies -- and who will have access to them remains a huge question. True confidentiality is unlikely.
And what will happen if courts accept the idea that some criminal behavior has a genetic basis?

THE ENVIRONMENT Energy is still being used -- and wasted -- in vast amounts, degrading the environment. Some experts say the only answer is to reduce energy consumption, to make people live more frugally. But others say information technologies can help countries and consumers cut back by eliminating the waste. For example, better traffic management could slash the gasoline wasted in traffic jams.

LEARNING Education must reach more people -- and it must go to them rather than forcing individuals to go to schools to learn. People may then see education as a lifelong activity, rather than something that takes place when they are young.
It's also not too late to join the information age -- worldwide, fewer than 5 percent of people use computers, although the proportion in the United States is upward of 30 percent.

POPULATION By 2000, half the world's population will be under 20, with profound consequences. The vast majority will live in poor nations, many in the streets of mega-cities that cannot provide jobs.
Worriers are certain that these leaps in population will test the world's ability to feed everyone. Still, recent surveys in China show that the amount of arable land there is greater than previously thought, and some scientists see biotechnology as the savior that will increase food production. No matter what happens, food may well cost everyone a lot more.

THE FRENZY Are you tired? Just wait. The pace of life in the developed world will only get faster, leading some to suggest that some people will opt out of post-industrial life altogether and others to predict a big business in building sanctuaries for the harried. Alienation is a huge risk.
Considering that a huge part of Davos is the talk that goes on in the corridors, attendees had a good Davos if they covered anywhere close to the ground outlined here. If it all sounds squishy, however, remember that Davos functions best when it provides questions, not answers. After all, Elie Wiesel said at one meeting, "Questions unite people, and answers divide them."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
To Get More Defensive, Try Cost-Cutting Companies

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRUSH 

 BODY:
WITH the market looking so pricey these days, judicious stock picking may soon gain on broad market bets as an investment strategy. And while selective investors can use many different guideposts to pick companies, one yardstick sounds a very familiar theme: downsizing and similar cost-cutting maneuvers.
Of course, many companies have already improved profits by laying off workers or otherwise revamping. But more are on the way. "This theme is mature, but it is continuing," said Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. "It is still going to be an important theme and a major source of investment opportunities in 1997." 
 Restructuring companies can be found in many sectors; Mr. Metz cited the health, financial and technology industries as good places to look. Companies in Europe, where downsizing has not been as extensive as in the United States, are also good possibilities; Mr. Metz singled out Germany.
"German industry is going to rationalize and get rid of underperforming assets," he said.
Cost cutters can look good in this lofty market because their stocks are often relatively cheap; indeed, these corporate revampings would not be necessary if the enterprises were already lean and mean.
These companies may also appeal to investors who are worried about a market downturn. After all, much of their earnings growth will come from an activity -- cost-cutting -- that management can control. These stocks may not offer as much downside protection as traditional defensive equities like electric utilities, but in a sour economy their bottom lines may hold up better than those of companies that count on sales growth alone to improve earnings.
But analysts warn investors to avoid companies whose earnings growth relies solely on restructuring. "Cost-cutting in and of itself is fine, but if you don't have revenue growth, where do you go from there?" said John Maack, portfolio manager of the Crabbe Huson Equity fund.
Investors should also remember that these companies' stocks can zig and zag before the final payoff. "When you are restructuring a company, things can get delayed, and they don't always go exactly according to plan," said Robert Rodriguez, portfolio manager of the FPA Capital fund, which often invests in such enterprises. "Companies that are restructuring have more control over their economic ship of state. But you still have a degree of volatility because of that uncertainty."
One company that is just beginning to restructure is KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which trades here as American depository receipts and closed on Friday at $30, just 12.33 times its estimated earnings per share for 1997. Last fall, KLM announced a plan to save $539 million by 2000.
"They are closing some unprofitable routes and planning some head-count reductions, and there are some plans to negotiate more stringently with pilots and employees on wage increases," said Nick Whitridge, the manager of the Babson Value fund, which owns KLM shares. "It is a pretty aggressive move on their part."
By mid-1998, fare increases and fuller planes should begin to substantially increase revenue, said Mr. Whitridge, who predicts an average of 10 percent growth in annual revenue over the next five years.
Another restructuring play is Michaels Stores, whose more than 500 outlets make it the largest specialty retailer of arts, crafts and decorative items in the United States. Its new managers, brought in last year, have been improving the company's inventory management and product mix.
The company has already put in place a new "point of sale" inventory control system in its stores, and is now doing the same at its warehouses. It is also encouraging store managers to order more products through this internal system, rather than through outside suppliers, from whom they often over-order.
These changes will help lower the company's inventory costs, as will a move to insure that high-volume items are never out of stock.
On the sales side, Michaels has been adjusting its merchandise mix to focus on its more profitable goods. The new inventory system can help there, too, by better keeping track of which products are selling best.
Mr. Rodriguez, whose fund owns more than 10 percent of the Michaels stock outstanding, expects these efforts to start paying off in 1998. "Their turnover should increase and the level of markdowns should decrease," he said, "because they will be cycling inventory more rapidly." He said operating margins should rise to about 8 percent, well above the 3 percent the company posted in 1996, exclusive of a $22 million write-down in inventory last September.
The stock, which closed on Friday at $13.125, should be in the mid-$30's within about two years, said Mr. Rodriguez, whose fund has had an average annual return of 22.8 percent for the five years through 1996.
Another company that should benefit from lower costs is National Steel, which had $2.95 billion in revenues for the year ended in December. By reducing the size of its work force through attrition, the company is trimming labor costs by 2 percent to 3 percent a year. New equipment and maintenance procedures are also cutting expenses.
Indeed, Mr. Maack, whose fund owns shares of National Steel, said the company pared steel production costs by about $16 a ton last year, from $512 a ton. It expects to cut another $44 a ton over the next four years, for an overall savings of almost 12 percent. The company is also shifting its product mix to higher-quality steel with bigger profit margins, and hopes to benefit from an upswing in domestic steel demand resulting from booms in auto making and commercial and industrial construction.
ECONOMIES of scale -- lowering average costs by getting bigger -- are the goal at Tesoro Petroleum, an oil and gas company. Tesoro has three divisions -- exploration and production, refining and marketing, and distribution. The last has been by far the smallest, but to save on costs Tesoro recently bought a distribution company.
And some analysts expect more of the same. The enlargement of Tesoro's distribution business "is a good model for what they are going to do with these two larger divisions," said Robert Kleinschmidt, who manages the Tocqueville Fund, which invests in Tesoro and other companies that are revamping. He said he believes that Tesoro, which has a strong balance sheet after winning a contract dispute, is now actively buying more oil fields and may also soon purchase an exploration and production company.
Tesoro will probably also soon form a joint venture involving its Alaska refineries, a move intended to propel it into other markets, Mr. Kleinschmidt said. He expects that this plan and the acquisition strategy will double Tesoro's stock price in three years.

HEADLINE: From Storefronts to Supermarkets

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
LIKE 14 million other Americans last year, Muriel Page turned to H & R Block for help in filling out her tax return. She was pleased enough with the results that Block caught her attention with the flier it mailed last summer announcing its recent entry into the mortgage business.
"It's hard to get in with the big banks around here and I haven't heard the names of the other mortgage companies," Ms. Page said. 
 She ended up refinancing her home in Esmont, Va., a small town south of Charlottesville, with a $71,000 mortgage from Block that cut her interest rate by 2.5 percentage points.
In just over a year of experimenting with mortgages, Block was able to put together a package of $102 million in mortgages that it either originated or acquired from other lenders, and sold it to institutional investors late last month. This year, Block is expanding its mortgage-origination efforts to more than 30 tax preparation stores in Colorado, Indiana, North Carolina and Virginia.
Peddling mortgages year-round is a far cry from filling out millions of tax forms in the space of a few weeks, but it is just part of a smorgasbord of initiatives that Block is pursuing in the hope of re-creating itself as a faster-growing, broad-based financial services giant.
"It just doesn't make sense to have 14 million customers and sell them only one product," said Thomas L. Zimmerman, head of Block's tax operations.
Block, which had earnings of $177.2 million on revenues of $1.7 billion in the year that ended on April 30, is hardly giving up the tax business. In fact, it figures it can gain double-digit growth in the next two years simply from working more aggressively to expand that business. But the 42-year-old company wants to also become known for financial software, annuities and other retirement packages, life insurance and investments like mutual funds to build and broaden its customer base.
The company is also experimenting with using its storefronts, many of which stand empty for much of the year, to process college loan applications and immigration documents.
And it aims to turn its Internet site -- which is at http://www.conductor.com/ -- into a financial cybermall where visitors can trade stocks, check credit balances, connect to on-line banks and buy software like Kiplinger's Taxcut program for home tax preparers.
"Our most significant growth opportunities are with financial services delivered on line," said William Anderson, who heads Block's push into new financial products.
If Block sticks to its ambitious plans, a result will be one of the most sweeping tests of the reach of powerful brand names in financial services.
"The strategy is not illogical because they have a reputation for being trustworthy in a financial area that's pretty anxiety-ridden," said Bill Schneider, a brand management consultant at Lippincott & Margulies in San Francisco. "But it's not necessarily easy."
Indeed, it's not, even for a company with Block's strengths, which include a strong cash flow, a balance sheet free of long-term debt and experience in forming alliances with well-connected partners.
"Sears, American Express, Merrill Lynch all got killed trying to create financial supermarkets in the 1980's," said Bruce Greenwald, a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business who argues that cash-rich companies in mature markets usually reward shareholders more by increasing dividends than by diversifying.
Block has tried to diversify before, without ever finding a business that fit well with its bread-and-butter tax operations. This time, Block clearly will face serious challenges trying to grow on so many new fronts from its narrow base of just 2,000 permanent employees. And while Block is used to having a market largely to itself, many of the new businesses it is thinking about are highly competitive.
WALL STREET is apparently in no rush to bet that Block's latest growth strategy will be a winner. For years, Block outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, but since 1995, the story has been very different. And this year, while the S.& P. has soared, Block's shares have been hovering around $30 -- well above last summer's bottom of $23.625 but down more than 25 percent from the 52-week high of $42.125 last February. The stock closed on Friday at $29.75.
Many investors are preoccupied with Block's struggle to sort out the woes at Compuserve Inc., the on-line computer services company that Block acquired in 1980, in one of its earlier efforts to diversify.
Shortly after Block sold just under 20 percent of the unit to the public last spring, Compuserve's earnings and share price plunged, dragged down by increased competition among on-line services and the decision by many consumers to bypass the services and go directly to the Internet. Block's shares fell along with Compuserve's. The two companies are now mired in shareholder class-action lawsuits contending that they failed to warn shareholders earlier about Compuserve's earnings plunge, and Block has been forced to shelve plans indefinitely to spin off the rest of Compuserve to its shareholders until the on-line company's tailspin has been halted and earnings are restored.
Nor does it help that Wall Street is still getting to know the new management team led by Frank L. Salizzoni, Block's third chief executive in the last two years. The upheaval began in April 1995, when Thomas Bloch, then 40, sprang some stunning news on his father, Henry, who had stayed on as chairman after passing the job of chief executive to him in 1992. The younger Mr. Bloch said he would soon be leaving the company and his lucrative job to teach at an inner-city elementary school and spend more time with his family.
After an intensive search for its first leader from outside the family, Block excited investors by recruiting Richard H. Brown from the Ameritech Corporation, where he had been vice chairman. Mr. Brown, whose tenure began in September, persuaded the board to go along with the rising shareholder interest in splitting off Compuserve, shook up top management of the tax group and pushed hard to speed the company's three-year-old strategy to expand into other financial services. But Cable and Wireless P.L.C., a leading British telecommunications company, soon came calling on Mr. Brown with an irresistible offer for him to move to London as its chief executive. He left in June, just nine months after he arrived.
Block's surprised board then turned to Mr. Salizzoni, 58, a board member for eight years who had been semiretired since resigning as president and chief operating officer of USAir in April 1995. Mr. Salizzoni became briefly famous on Wall Street during the late 1980's when he led TW Services, the owner of Denny's and other restaurant chains, in a bitter but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to stave off a $1.65 billion leveraged buyout led by Coniston Partners.
Mr. Salizzoni, the son of a Pittsburgh construction worker, had started his career as a financial analyst for Trans World Airlines and eventually became chief financial officer of the airline's holding company at a time when it also owned the Hilton Hotels Corporation and other ventures. Although admired on Wall Street for his strategic experience, he is considered to be more cautious and methodical than Mr. Brown.
MOST analysts now figure that there is no rush to either pile into the stock or to race to the exit.
"Dick Brown got the company going in the right direction, but Salizzoni is conservative," said Martin Romm, who follows Block for CS First Boston. "They are going to be prudent."
Mr. Salizzoni says his immediate priorities are to expand the tax business and to straighten out Compuserve so the spinoff can be completed. On the tax and financial services side, he promises that Wall Street and customers are going to see "lots of tests of different kinds of products."
The job of speeding up growth in the tax business is falling largely to Mr. Zimmerman, whom Mr. Brown promoted to president of H & R Block Tax Services after forcing the resignation of Harry W. Buckley in the fall of 1995. Mr. Buckley says he and Mr. Brown disagreed over how thoroughly to test new programs that might interfere with traditional services.
"When Brown arrived, the shareholder became the most important person," said Mr. Buckley, who now works as a consultant. "Under the Blochs, it was always the clients."
Mr. Zimmerman agreed that Mr. Brown brought a new culture of aggressiveness to the company. When plans were made to try marketing Bloch's tax services on 10 college campuses last year, Mr. Brown challenged the tax group to go after 500 instead. In the end, the program, built around concerts and promotional items, touched 200 campuses.
The results were disappointing. Most college students, it turns out, rely on tax preparers back home if they need help. Still, Mr. Zimmerman said that the process was energizing and that moving faster and harder on new products would pay off in the long run.
To speed the process, Block has been recruiting experienced marketers from consumer products companies. Eric Steinhouse, a longtime executive at Procter & Gamble, Kellogg and Dow Brands, was brought in as senior vice president in charge of marketing in 1994.
Five new products and services were rolled out nationally during the company's last fiscal year, more than in the previous 10 years combined. They include a simple kit for drafting wills in the home and a program to help people who prepare their own taxes to check their results. Block also began offering in-the-home tax preparation for an extra $25 for customers who are unwilling to visit one of its 4,300 company-owned offices. Franchisees, who do about a third of the business from another 4,000 or so offices in mostly rural areas, are encouraged but not required to offer the new services.
It makes sense for Block to work hard on enhancing its tax franchise. Block and its franchisees prepare more than 12 percent of all American individual tax returns, about 17 times the total of any other tax preparer. Some 70 percent of the customers are repeat visitors to its modest storefronts or to the offices in Sears, Roebuck stores that carry the Block name.
More than once since the 1970's, Block worried that the tax business had matured -- only to have new tax laws, new products or other changes rekindle its growth. In the late 1980's, business skyrocketed with the development of electronic filing and refund anticipation loans, or RAL's, which allow taxpayers to immediately receive payments covering most of their anticipated refunds. In return, they have to sign over their rights to the refunds to the banks or other financial institutions making the loans.
CONSUMER advocates complain that many taxpayers do not understand that RAL's are short-term loans with interest rates that can reach 200 percent on an annualized basis. In New York City, Block has repeatedly clashed with the Department of Consumer Affairs over advertising and scripts used by Block phone operators, with the city contending that consumers may be misled about the difference between electronic filing, which leads to quicker refunds, and RAL's.
Last month, Block, while denying any fraud, agreed to pay $250,000 to settle the latest dispute. But it is hardly backing away from RAL's. Indeed, it has formed a partnership with the Beneficial Corporation, a leading RAL lender, to invest Block cash in such loans.
RAL's aside, Block figures that its traditional business can grow rapidly over the next few years simply by opening satellite storefronts, acquiring smaller tax practices -- it bought more than 100 last year -- and raising customer retention rates to 90 percent, a level that some local offices already approach, from the current average of 70 percent.
For the last few years, Block has also been going after more upscale customers -- those earning $40,000 to $80,000 -- with a growing chain of "Premium" offices. (Block says that 80 percent of all of its customers make less than $50,000 a year.) These offices feature posher surroundings, more experienced tax preparers and service by appointment in private rooms. They also offer guarantees to not only pay interest and penalties if Block makes an error in tax preparation, as is the promise at its regular offices, but to also pay up to $5,000 of the increased tax assessment itself, for no additional fees. (Customers at regular Block offices pay $25 for $4,000 of such increased assessment protection.) Block served 643,000 Premium clients last year from about 600 Premium offices, up 16.4 percent.
Mr. Salizzoni said Block was considering opening an even more upscale chain of offices focusing on clients with incomes of $60,000 or more, although it is reluctant to invest heavily in chasing the relatively small number of taxpayers in high brackets and in competing with major accounting firms for such business.
BLOCK sees better growth opportunities for its tax business overseas. The company set up H & R Block International as a separate division last year and put Ozzie Wenich, formerly vice president for finance, in charge of expanding it.
"Taxation systems are changing everywhere," Mr. Wenich said. "There are middle classes emerging, and governments like to tax them."
Block already has more than 1,000 offices in Canada, which it entered in 1964. They handle just over 10 percent of Canada's individual tax returns, or 40 percent of those completed by paid tax preparers. More than 300 offices in Australia handle about 75 percent of that country's professionally prepared returns. Offices are also scattered in nine other countries, most of which traditionally assisted American soldiers stationed overseas.
Mr. Wenich says his first target for a big expansion will probably be Britain. Recent tax changes there have doubled the number of citizens required to file income taxes, to nine million. Block hopes to gain a foothold by acquiring a number of small accounting firms that handle tax forms and standardizing their service, but Mr. Wenich freely concedes that the strategy may not work.
"Trying to organize foreign accountants is like trying to herd cats," he said.
The long-term question for Block, though, is whether the company is such an unusual species of business animal that it is doomed to have trouble expanding out of its tax environment.
Block employs 80,000 workers at the peak of tax season (franchisees hire tens of thousands more) but just 2,000 full time. It trains almost 110,000 workers annually, starting in September. Although it signs year-round leases for offices and equipment when necessary to guarantee their availability in tax season, it still rents huge amounts of equipment and work space for a few short weeks or months a year.
"It's like starting a new business every year," says Henry W. Bloch, 74, the company's chairman, who founded the business in 1955 with his brother Richard as an accounting agency. (They used a variant of their last name to avoid having it mispronounced as "blotch.")
Block's strength has been in building relationships with consumers who are not used to being courted by most American financial institutions.
"People talk to you about everything," said Sophie Wolan, who has been a tax preparer for 15 years, first in a Block office in Chicago and now in a Block Premium office in nearby Elmwood Park, Ill. "They'll even ask you to recommend doctors and dentists."
OVER the years, though, Block has repeatedly bobbled attempts to transfer that consumer confidence and its skills to other enterprises, to sell its customers more products or to find other uses for its offices. Many such experiments have been timid, in part because of the need to make sure tax operations are not impeded and that no information gathered in tax preparation is used illegally for other purposes. But even when Block has moved more aggressively to diversify into related fields or to acquire companies with new technology that could help the tax business, the synergies have been limited.
Compuserve is only the latest and most prominent example. The company, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, was an insurer with spare computer capacity that it marketed to other businesses when Block acquired it in 1980. But the spread of personal computers, the Internet and competition among on-line services forced Block to keep redefining how the two companies might interact. The idea that Compuserve would provide electronic expertise and be Block's primary route for distributing electronic financial services fell by the wayside.
"The more they grew, the less we understood their business," Mr. Bloch said. "Once America Online went public and people saw how highly valued it was, shareholders became almost belligerent, demanding we separate the two companies."
Through subsidiaries, Block has also tried its hand at running a temporary-employment agency, selling business software and conducting management seminars. It has dabbled in travel, advertising, office supplies and insurance.
From 1980 to 1987, it was the major financial backer in the nationwide expansion of Hyatt Legal Services, a chain of storefront legal clinics intended to serve the same kinds of clients that Block has long helped with taxes.
"Everyone has to file a tax return every year, but not everybody needs a lawyer," Mr. Bloch said several years ago, explaining why the Hyatt alliance never made sense for Block. After Block pulled out, Hyatt retreated from storefronts and now concentrates on selling prepaid legal plans to business.
On the bright side, Block's shareholders have rarely had much to complain about. Even when its plans have not worked strategically, Block has usually managed to get out at a profit, or at least with minimal losses. Compuserve, acquired for around $20 million, was profitable for years, and the initial public offering of 19.9 percent of the shares last spring raised $519 million. Interim Services, a temporary-employment agency acquired for $49 million in 1991 and combined with a small employment business Block already owned, was sold in 1993 for $188 million.
Such results, together with the growth of the tax business, have meant that an investor who bought 100 shares of Block when it went public at $4 a share in 1962 would have 41,206 shares today, worth around $1.2 million, assuming reinvestment of dividends. The compound annual growth rate works out to about 25 percent.
The more recent softness in the stock underscores why Block needs to break out of its strategic straitjacket. And business strategists say the steps the company is taking to branch out into financial services are crucial.
"They will have to invest heavily in consumer marketing to have customers make the link between what the brand has historically stood for -- tax preparation -- to other products," said Joel Friedman, a partner in the San Francisco office of Andersen Consulting. "If you can demonstrate once that you have successfully created a new set of relationships around your brand, it becomes easier and easier."
Block is not relying solely on its own name. It entered the credit card business first with a Compuserve Visa affinity card and then with the more generically named Websource Visa card. It markets Kiplinger's Taxcut, Home Legal Adviser and Small Business Attorney software. And the conductor.com Internet site is more a conduit for others to sell their services, for a fee paid to Block, than for Block to market products under its own name.
"This will allow us to expand our marketing to customers with summer and winter homes in our area," said Carol Cone, vice president for operations at Mascoma Savings Bank of Lebanon, N.H., which began offering bill payment and other electronic services last month through that Internet site.
Where the Block name is being used -- in the new mortgage business, for example -- the company is contracting with others to provide it with qualified personnel, including licensed brokers, and crucial services, like payment collections and disbursements.
"The key is to take it at a speed you can manage, and Block is doing that," said David Everitt, a longtime mortgage banker who owns NF Investments in Griffin, Ga., a company that is helping Block get into a specialized area: mortgages for homeowners who are unable to secure Federal loan guarantees.
Still, Mr. Friedman warns, one highly publicized failure during a time of brand expansion can undermine years of effort. Yet another potential pitfall is that the company's traditional clients could become confused about what Block stands for.
One executive who ought to have some insight into the magnitude of the challenge is betting on Block. In a telephone interview from Cable and Wireless's headquarters in London, Mr. Brown was resolute about the company he once ran. "I've hung on to my Block stock," he said.

WALL STREET
Mating Ritual of Bulls
Forget the bulls' stampede. Now it's the brokers that are making news on Wall Street. The elite Morgan Stanley is merging with Dean Witter, Discover, home of the masses. The resulting powerhouse will knock Merrill Lynch off its perch as the biggest Wall Street firm and seems likely to prompt a cascade of other mergers in the battle for individual investors. Morgan works for the bluest of blue chips, while Dean Witter is a sales machine, with 40 million customers. In mutual funds alone, the firm will have 306 offerings, and all told, it will have $270 billion in assets under management. But Dean Witter, while huge, is not considered to be in the forefront of competitive changes sweeping the industry. Merger speculation immediately focused on other firms, including top investment banks and second-tier companies, and more names were on the list than off it.
 
FISCAL RESTRAINT
Shadows of a Budget Deal
The era of big government is over, Bill Clinton declared last year, a reality that left him a smaller canvas to paint in his State of the Union address, especially when his audience was another Republican Congress. The President did not make a single major spending initiative and urged Congress to balance the budget by 2002. In that general atmosphere of restraint, the President chose other areas to emphasize, chiefly his 10-point crusade "to insure that Americans have the best education in the world." His proposed $1.69 trillion Federal budget for next year was artfully constructed to suggest the terms of a deal with Republicans, who are lusting after a cut in the capital gains tax, presumably one that could benefit the millions who have reaped big paper profits on the stock market. The second part of a meaningful deal would be to find a way to slow the calculated increases in inflation, saving the Government money on benefits. Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, said negotiations could produce a balanced-budget agreement "within six weeks or so."
 
BROADCASTING
Dawn of Digital TV
Broadcasters' ears perked up when they heard that sweet word "free" waft from the White House. The Democrats, under the guidance of Vice President Al Gore, offered broadcasters the use of digital signals, allowing crystal-clear pictures and sound. In return, they are asking only for a modest guarantee of public-interest programming, perhaps a few hours of children's shows each week. Eager to get going, the broadcasters thought about it for a moment and decided: Why not? If Republicans sign off on the deal, digital services could begin soon, by spring 1998. Consumer electronics and computer companies, rushing to build sets, agreed on standards two months ago.
 
ROCK ON
Ziggy Stardust, Financial Innovator
In the dense language of Wall Street, the brokerage firm Fahnestock & Company placed $55 million of asset-backed securities. But cool, dude. It turns out the assets are the recordings of David Bowie, rock legend, who has morphed from the days of androgyny into a star known for his financial and technological savvy. "I wish all our clients were as innovative as David Bowie," said David Pullman, a senior vice president of Fahnestock, who usually works on duller debentures. Mr. Bowie raised $55 million from institutional investors, who got the promise of 7.9 percent annual interest for 10 years from royalties on sales of his past music. Futuristically, Mr. Bowie is also getting a new deal with EMI for new recordings, for perhaps $30 million. The royalties bond is the first of its kind ever, and one reason it went over well, a British banker told The Financial Mail, is that it is "no different from securitizing any other asset." The banker added, "Provided one can come up with a reasonable prediction of what future royalties are going to be, one can package anything."
 
NAZI LOOTING
The Swiss Blink
Old sins have long shadows. More than a half-century after World War II, three giant Swiss banks are putting $70 million into a fund for Nazi victims. This is the first time Swiss banks are using their own money to compensate Switzerland's close relationship with Nazi Germany. The banks still deny that they are hoarding any kind of vast wealth deposited by Jews who sought financial refuge before perishing in the camps. Other gold in vaults under Wall Street and at the Bank of England may form the core of another Holocaust fund.
 
ADVERTISING
Bowing to the Duchess
She weighed in at 203 pounds, was loaded with debt and is not on the best terms with her ex's family, but she's a Duchess, isn't she? Dear Fergie hooked up with Weight Watchers -- actually she's properly slimmed-down now -- and voila, she's pitching products. For a reported $1 million, the high-spirited Duchess of York will travel the United States on Weight Watchers' behalf. She is also thought to be pulling in half that much for pouring a bucket of ice on some paparazzi, all in ads to bolster sales of Ocean Spray juice. The very notion causes shivers in Britain. "Only somebody this vulgar could take the British royalty into this kind of situation," intoned Hugh Trevor-Roper, the historian, in The Daily Telegraph. But state-side, vulgarity and advertising have a way of hitting it off.
 
TAX POLICY
What the Right Hand Doesn't Know
Oops! The Treasury somehow never got around to collecting $1.2 billion in airline ticket taxes last year, and the result may crimp improvements in runways and radar and other aspects of air travel. Granted the tax was a nightmare; twice last year Congress let it lapse, and in the interval, the airlines collected the money but squirmed through a loophole to delay paying it. Eventually the Government woke up and the airlines paid, but by then, the Treasury had lost the authority to write a check to the intended beneficiary, the Federal Aviation Administration.

HEADLINE: Secrets to Maximize Savings;
In Japan, Bankers Make House Calls

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: FUKUI, Japan

 BODY:
IF it ever rains here, people like Miho Shimizu will be well prepared.
Miss Shimizu, a 21-year-old college student, has been saving for a rainy day since she was a young child, and so has just about everyone else in this windy, rice-growing city on Japan's west coast. 
 "I've been banking my otoshidama all these years," said Miss Shimizu, referring to the annual New Year's cash gift from parents and relatives. While a happy-go-lucky American child might have used the money for a new bicycle, Miss Shimizu and many Japanese kids take their money right to the bank.
Americans have been trying for years to bolster their saving rate, which economists say is vital to maintaining long-term growth. But despite individual retirement accounts and other saving plans, nothing seems to work. Americans save only about 4 percent of their household income, but Japanese save nearly 13 percent. This means that Japan essentially borrows from its own citizens, rather than relying on foreign investments that drive up trade deficits.
In Japan, saving seems so second nature it could be part of an ancient tradition. It turns out that saving is no mystery at all; it is not nature, but nurture.
 
Banks That Still Give Gifts
 It would be hard not to save, when faced with the likes of Yoshitake Sakihara, a 30-year-old banker who makes house calls on his motorbike. Mr. Sakihara visits about 40 homes a day, after paydays, and brings gifts of soap, dish towels and Buddhist temple boxes -- a Japanese version of piggy banks.
The soap seems to have hooked Misao Tanuma, a 65-year-old mother who has been saving for decades in her suburban-style house at the edge of Tokyo. Every month she gives 62,000 yen (about $500) to Mr. Sakihara for deposit in his institution, the Sugamo Credit Union.
"It's different from having to go and deposit the money in the bank yourself," said Mrs. Tanuma, as she handed over the money to Mr. Sakihara. "If someone visits me to pick up a fixed amount, I set the amount aside as if it doesn't belong to me."
It is often thought that thrift in Asia is a cultural trait, derived in part from a legacy of Confucianism. Indeed, one of the most common expressions in Japanese life is "gaman," or perseverance through hardship, and children learn the word early on.
"We tell them they can use some of their money to buy something and save the rest," said Masahiro Kusano, a 51-year-old economist whose two sons have saved $3,700 from their otoshidamas. "Savings has to do with gaman, and if you teach them gaman, that leads to savings."
But some experts dispute the notion that Japanese have thrift so deeply entwined in their culture that they are unique. Though statistics are scarce, scholars say savings rates in Japan a century ago may have been lower than in the West.
Charles Yuji Horioka, an economist at Osaka University who specializes in savings, says saving rates in Japan around the turn of the century were usually low, and sometimes negative.
It was policy measures -- and a business climate that promised healthy returns to people who saved rather than consumed -- that lifted savings rates up from scratch after the war. A national push for saving swept the nation and has lasted for years. Newspaper ads and posters in trains and subways occasionally beckon people to save, and the Central Council for Savings Information encourages a nationwide network of more than a thousand volunteers to organize activities to promote savings. The Council, a group sponsored by the Bank of Japan, also runs commercials that preach the benefits of building a nest egg and organizes an annual Saving Day in October. The Council for Savings even holds an annual essay contest on saving; last October 19,000 elementary and junior high school students submitted 1,200-word expositions on prudence with money.
Then, of course, there are the local banks and credit unions, which aggressively encourage savings to increase their deposits. Some banks enroll savers in programs that automatically deduct money from ordinary deposit accounts (the Japanese almost never use checking accounts) and put it into savings accounts.
Bankers sometimes inundate their customers with estimates of future financial burdens. And banks try to grab customers early, targeting fresh graduates of vocational schools or colleges. At the end of the month, when most Japanese are paid, bankers at institutions across the country fan out to homes on foot, bicycle or car to pick up the savings before they are spent.
This way, the banking relationship is sometimes passed on down through the generations. Akemi Sasano, a 32-year-old mother of two young children, met her bankers when they came every month to collect cash from her mother, Hatsue Kaneda.
"The reason I started to save was for my children's education, their high school and university," said Mrs. Sasano, whose family lives with her parents. "My kids are still small, but it takes money."
Indeed, one reason Japanese save so much is that everything is so expensive. In Tokyo, homes can cost up to nine times a typical annual salary, so that a million-dollar home is a matchbox of a house with no yard. College tuition costs are running about $53,000 for four years at a private university, and Japanese spend, on average, nearly $70,000 on a wedding. The $150,000 wedding is not uncommon.
Moreover, though Japan's health care system is somewhat more generous than that of the United States, it does not cover nursing and care for the elderly. Growing uncertainty over the ailing pension system is also impelling many people to save for hard times in old age.
"It's just common sense to keep your money and save up, even though there's no special purpose in mind," said Kazuyoshi Asai, a 47-year-old education official in Fukui. "It's a natural thing to save."
The Government was clearly adept at orchestrating the high saving rate. But its success drew criticism in the 1980's, when Americans complained repeatedly that Japanese thrift meant that Japanese consumers were not buying American goods.
This sensitivity led the Central Committee on Savings Promotion to change its name to the Central Council for Savings Information and to begin promoting consumption. That may have hastened an impending trend.
 
Rampant Retirees
 Because the population is aging rapidly, soon a greater number of people will become net spenders, rather than savers.
"Japan's population is aging probably at the fastest rate ever recorded," said Mr. Horioka. "Japan will be the most aged society in the world by 2010."
In any case, it still seems that Japanese have strong reasons to save, sometimes for unexpected reasons. Harumi Yoshida, a 42-year-old social education official in Fukui, recently bought an education insurance policy -- it would pay a child's education costs if his parents died -- as a savings vehicle.
Her colleague had asked her many times to buy a policy from a friend at the postal savings institution, and somehow the friend found out that Mrs. Yoshida didn't have any saving vehicle for her third son, who is 10 years old. When the postal official, who was pressured to meet a sales quota, appeared at her office, Mrs. Yoshida gave in.
"So as a favor to her, I deposited some of my bonus, just out of a sense of obligation," said Mrs. Yoshida. "I think it's strange. But it's something we do."

Dear Dr. Greenspan

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland

 BODY:
"Dear Dr. Greenspan, I have a terrible problem. I'm feeling irrationally exuberant about the U.S. stock market and I just can't shake it. I know you've said 'irrational exuberance' is bad for my health, and I've tried everything: Hypnosis. Valium. Short-selling. Even rereading your speeches from 1987. But nothing works. Every time I come over here to Europe, or visit Japan, I return home itching to invest more in the U.S. market. Please, please help me. Sincerely, Mr. Full E. Invested."
I keep dictating that letter in my head to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, ever since he warned that Wall Street's long rise was being driven in part by a certain "irrational exuberance" among investors. I'm sure Mr. Greenspan has a point, but when you look at the U.S. from Europe, or Japan, some exuberance seems quite rational. 
 The Davos World Economic Forum is an annual gathering of the captains of industry and politics from around the world. Each year there is a star at Davos, someone who seems to define the moment. In the past, the stars have ranged from the financier George Soros to the Russian Communist leader Gennadi Zyuganov. This year the star at Davos was America. Whether it was Bill Gates of Microsoft or Andy Grove of Intel or Lawrence Summers of the U.S. Treasury, when Americans were on the dais people seemed to stay a little longer, listen a little harder. It seemed to be their way of saying that the U.S. growth model -- not the rigid Japanese one, and certainly not the inflexible European one that has fallen far behind the U.S. in producing new information technologies -- is now in the ascendancy.
And why not? If 100 years ago someone told you that by the end of this century the defining feature of world affairs would be "globalization" -- the integration of financial, information and trade networks to create a single, high-speed global marketplace -- and that you had to design a country best suited to compete in such a world, in many respects you would have designed today's America.
The U.S. has the world's most diverse and efficient capital markets, which reward, and even celebrate, risk-taking. Anyone with an invention and a garage can hope to raise millions overnight. It has a multicultural population that speaks the language of the Internet, a constantly renewing flow of immigrants, a transparent legal and regulatory environment and a flexible federal political system. It has a job market that enables workers to move easily from one hot industrial zone to another, and a corporate sector that has, unlike Europe's or Japan's, already gone through the downsizing and restructuring needed for global competitiveness. It has multiple economies, with a single currency, on a single continent that looks to both the Pacific and the Atlantic.
And, most important, its big multinational companies and little entrepreneurs think globally and excel in almost everything that is post-industrial: software, computing, package delivery, consulting, fast food, amusement parks, advertising, media, entertainment, hotels, financial services, environmental industries and telecommunications.
Globalization is us.
Of course, the stock market's sustained rise can be easily explained by traditional macro-economic factors -- low interest rates, low deficits, improved productivity -- and if these factors turn sour so will the market. But I suspect that there is another unarticulated, unquantifiable factor behind the market's rise. I would call it "The Globalization Premium." That is a sense among global investors that somehow the whole mix of America -- its society, its culture, its technology, its business environment and its geography -- meshes more naturally with globalization than either Europe or Japan. It is a sense that while many in Europe and Japan are still trying to adjust to the demands of globalization, and are barely up to the starting line, the U.S. is already around the first turn.
There is no way the U.S. can afford to be complacent, or ignore its underlying problems -- our weak public schools and inner cities, our widening income gaps and our low savings rate that makes us very dependent on others. But it still seems to me that something more is going on with America than just another uptick in the business cycle. It is a structural change that makes America a very good fit with the brave new world. Call me crazy, but I think it merits a little rational exuberance.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Jamaica Spat Undermines Region's Anti-Drug Efforts

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: KINGSTON, Jamaica

 BODY:
Hoping to step up its fight against drug trafficking, the United States instead finds itself stuck in a messy dispute with Jamaica that threatens to undermine anti-drug efforts throughout the Caribbean.
The quarrel centers on Washington's attempt to negotiate an agreement that would let American ships operate in Jamaican waters. Nearly a dozen other Caribbean countries recently signed such accords, which typically allow the United States Coast Guard and Navy to penetrate a country's 12-mile territorial limit to pursue ships believed to be carrying drugs. 
 Jamaica does not oppose such an arrangement, so long as the United States agrees to "operate on terms set by the Jamaican Government," said Seymour Mullings, Jamaica's Foreign Minister. But officials here say they are puzzled and offended by what they regard as Washington's strong-arm tactics and intrusions on national sovereignty. These include recent threats that Jamaica could soon be "decertified" for American economic aid.
Though the two countries have long differed over the most effective strategy to cut drug trafficking and consumption, the situation took a nasty turn in December. That was when Patricia Hall, director of Latin American and Caribbean programs at the State Department's Bureau of Narcotics and Law Enforcement, said on a television program seen here that Washington knew of "at least one elected representative" in Jamaica who had ties to drug traffickers.
Ms. Hall said: "We just do not seem to see any progress as far as a concern for controlling the trafficking, production of drugs and passing the legislation that is necessary." She added that extradition of criminals, eradication of marijuana fields and passage of more crime control laws were "lagging," and that this was leading to a situation fraught with "the danger of decertification."
Under American law, drug-producing or transit nations are ineligible for direct American economic aid if the White House does not certify by March 1 of each year that the countries are making adequate efforts to stem the flow of narcotics to the United States. Countries not deemed to be cooperating fully, including Colombia, Afghanistan and Iran, can be subjected to further trade sanctions at the President's discretion.
Jamaica, the largest of the English-speaking islands of the Caribbean, is a major producer of marijuana and an important transshipment point for cocaine bound to the United States. Because of some success in shutting down smuggling routes through Central America and Mexico, American officials estimate that at least a third of the cocaine leaving Colombia now travels on Caribbean routes.
The Jamaican reaction to the threat of decertification has been sharp. Addressing Parliament, Prime Minister Percival J. Patterson said that his nation had done everything in its power to cooperate with the United States. He suggested that an "unequivocal retraction" was in order, saying Washington had brought out its big stick because there had been problems in negotiating a ship agreement.
"We find it difficult to accept that negotiations should proceed with a threat of decertification hanging over our heads," he said. "Indeed, the act of decertification would be unilateral, but would result in significant bilateral and multilateral consequences."
"We intend to maintain our self-respect," he added. "We will not grovel."
Washington's approach has "enabled the Government to couch the debate in terms of the big, bad U.S. pressuring us," said Stephen Vasciannie, a lawyer and professor of government at the University of the West Indies here. He added that the approach had united the country behind the Prime Minister.
Jamaica's position has won widespread support elsewhere in the Caribbean, even among nations that have already signed ship agreements with the United States. In mid-December, after an emergency meeting in Barbados, the Caribbean Community issued a communique in which 14 heads of government "rejected any suggestion or threat of coercive measures as a means of extracting compliance with predetermined policies."
In the statement there were complaints about "unfounded allegations" and "innuendoes" that "undermine the foundation of the good relations" with the United States. Prime Minister Lester Bird of Antigua, chairman of the regional group, wrote President Clinton complaining of "the tactics by certain U.S. agencies" and requesting "a meeting at the highest possible level at the earliest opportunity in 1997."
Caribbean leaders have expressed frustration with Washington's demands for increased cooperation on the drug issue as it cuts economic aid to the region and refuses to grant English-speaking islands the same access to the American market that Mexico enjoys. Washington is also seeking to block the Caribbean's preferred access to Europe for exports of bananas, a crop widely seen as the region's only real alternative to marijuana.
"I can't recall relations ever being so frosty," one adviser to the Cabinet here said. "There are just so many areas where we are banging heads."
In its talks with the United States, Jamaica has stressed the inadequacy of taking a narrow focus on drug trafficking, one that ignores closely related economic and security issues. It prefers what K. D. Knight, the Minister of National Security, calls "a comprehensive package approach," which would include provisions obliging the United States to provide more aid to Jamaican security forces and to step up its own gun interdiction efforts.
With fewer than 2.5 million people, Jamaica had more than 900 homicides last year, nearly the same number as New York City, which is three times as large. Jamaican officials maintain that most of the weapons used in those crimes are smuggled in from the United States, often by the traffickers who are shipping marijuana and cocaine to New York City and Miami.
"The gun issue is integrally connected with the drug issue," Mr. Knight said, "and for years we have been the victims of gun smugglers. Since gun smugglers are also drug smugglers and dealers, it is necessary to attack that aspect of the problem simultaneously."
But American officials say that officials negotiating the ship agreement are not authorized to discuss a broader accord. So with the two countries scheduled to resume talks soon and the certification deadline pending, further friction still seems likely.
"We are the good guys, the ones seeking the partnership," said Mr. Knight, who has recently visited Washington for talks. "It is the drug dealers who are the bad guys, so we must therefore not behave as if we are enemies and do not have a common objective."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK MEMO: You Smilin' at Me?;
The Mellowing of the Quintessentially Crabby City

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
If a city of seven million people can be said to have moods, which for the sake of argument it shall be presumed that it can, the mood of New York City oscillates perpetually between the extremes of smugness and disgust.
Sometimes its state of mind seems downright visible in the posture of pedestrians or the chemistry of subway crowds. Then it shifts, with a seeming suddenness that says as much about the seeming as the being of city life. 
 This is one of those mood-shifting times. This much might be ventured, without overstating the case: Suddenly (it seems), it has become a given (in certain circles) that life in New York City (or some things about it) have changed for the better (at least for some).
There are a few obvious reasons people might be feeling less glum. The crime rate has dipped below that of Independence, Mo. The economy is not sliding into the plumbing. Tourism and the real estate market are up, and some heavily traveled stretches of the city look strikingly better.
Yet much about New York seems unchanged, at best. Two out of every three public-school third graders still read below grade level. Thousands of families live in crowded, dangerous conditions. The city is still expensive, noisy, infuriating a few dozen times a day.
So, how to explain the apparent magnitude of the mood change, the recent poll showing satisfaction levels rising sharply, the insistence of visitors that the New York they remember has been transfigured, the grudging admission by even skeptics that the place seems improved?
Interviews with dozens of New Yorkers and outsiders, from sociologists and psychologists to lifelong residents and tourists, point to three factors that may help explain the apparently abrupt change of heart.
First, in a city where some things are more visible than others, much of what has improved happens to be highly visible -- public safety, the atmosphere on the streets, the experience of the subway, the look of places like the area around Grand Central Terminal and Times Square.
Second, in a world in which repetition tends to make statements seem credible, especially when the people making them seem likely to know, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, tourism officials, the media and others have repeatedly stated that things are looking up.
Third, New Yorkers need to believe it. They have chosen to live in a place that, not infrequently, leaves them wondering why they did. Perhaps more than many other people -- say, Tahitians -- they hunger for evidence that justifies their choice.
"We like to have our choice affirmed as a wise one, or at least a reasonable one," said Dr. Robert Jay Lifton, the psychiatrist, author and native New Yorker, speaking from his apartment on Central Park West. "Otherwise, we're not very bright."
As Dr. Lifton sees it, people are acutely ambivalent about New York. They hold two extreme images in their head: New York as "the most vital, fascinating, rewarding city on earth" and New York as "the most terrorizing, deteriorated, impossible place on earth."
A mental pendulum swings back and forth -- maybe four times a day, but also slowly over time. "There's a sense in which we reach a kind of rock-bottom horror and resentment and pain and anger," he said. "And then the pendulum starts swinging the other way."
How that mood change comes about is not easy to decipher.
"It's the way a joke goes around town," said Milton Glaser, the graphic designer, who knows something about the mysteries of image, perception and mood. "Who in the world knows why a joke comes to life? It races through the city and, by the end of the day, everybody knows it."
No mood change, of course, is universal or equally felt. Some say New York is a slicker, less interesting, less compassionate place. They say the police are harassing the homeless, corporations are colonizing neighborhoods and people no longer care about the gap between rich and poor.
Yet interviews and polling detect something like optimism in many places, from parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn to the South Bronx, where a Trinidadian woman who regularly shoos drug dealers from her lobby and carries a gun when she walks her dog recently said even she is feeling upbeat.
New immigrants may be among the most optimistic New Yorkers, some sociologists suggested -- which could leave a mark on the city's collective state of mind. After all, 425,000 immigrants moved in between 1990 and 1995, while 780,000 New Yorkers moved out, their discontent in tow.
Nearly everyone, of course, judges the city by the view through his or her own keyhole. Phyllis Ambler, living near Union Square, is pleased to see it looking clean. William Gutman, of Borough Park, says shopping has increased in Borough Park. Mary Fitzsimons, a fashion designer, says Madison Avenue now rivals the Via della Spiga in Milan.
Others imagine a great proliferation of positives. Carlos Rodriguez, a maintenance worker from Jackson Heights, Queens, sees improvement in everything from altruism to voter turnout. "People are not rude anymore," he marveled. "The smog, I don't know what happened with it. It's not, like, polluted."
Is perception outstripping reality? Ms. Ambler was asked.
"Perception is reality," she said.
 
Abstract Impressions
Small Gains Grow Into Symbols
Few issues in New York have the visibility of crime. Fear of crime may bear little relation to the actual crime rate, but notions about crime and public safety have exercised an outsize influence on overall views of the city.
New York is, after all, an especially public city. It is known for its public, more than its private, spaces. When people fear New York, they cannot appreciate its virtues. They stay off the streets, or they stay away.
Public safety is also a highly visible, 24-hour-a-day service. Unlike public education or health care, it affects New Yorkers of all ages and incomes, and visitors, too. If the police appear competent, that seems to signify a lot.
As any sentient New Yorker now knows, the murder rate is lower than it has been in nearly 30 years. Other crimes are down, too: fewer people are being robbed and assaulted, fewer homes broken into, fewer cars stolen.
"The single biggest impediment to getting people to visit New York City was and is perceptions about crime," said Stephen Morello, president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. "By turning crime around, we have the single biggest opportunity."
Other recent changes have a different kind of high visibility. Business Improvement Districts have transformed the appearance of some of the most heavily traveled parts of the city, leaving the debatable impression among some that the city in general is cleaner and tamer.
Take Times Square. Each day, 1.5 million pedestrians are said to pass through the Times Square Business Improvement District between West 40th and West 53d Streets. One fifth of the hotel rooms in the city are in the district and millions of people worldwide see images of Times Square.
These days, private sanitation workers scour the sidewalks for litter, corralling 99 pounds of cigarette butts a day. Forty private security guards patrol the streets. The district has installed new lighting, removed graffiti, painted litter baskets, paid for services to get the homeless off the streets.
All of that -- along with the commercial reincarnation of Times Square and the fact that the first high-rise office tower to be built in Manhattan in the 1990's happens to be going up on the northeast corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue -- has left among many visitors a broader impression of an entire city rebounding.
"It's what I call the differential visibility of things," said Dr. Norman Bradburn, a senior vice president for research at the National Opinion Research Center, a survey-research center affiliated with the University of Chicago, where he is a professor of psychology and public policy.
"Changes in some kinds of things about the city are more visible than others," he said. "Then there's always a question about visible to whom. One thing that tends to be visible is graffiti and garbage and litter and dirt and a lot of homeless people or beggars.
"People have an implicit, causal theory about why things are littered -- that somehow it's out of control, the city is not paying attention," he said. So by simply removing graffiti, he said, "You may not have changed other things, but you make people feel as if you have."
So while it is by no means certain that the city, taken as a whole, is any cleaner, guerrilla windshield-washing at intersections is down these days. So is aggressive panhandling at automatic teller machines, peddling Rolex knockoffs on sidewalks and other activities targeted by the Giuliani administration's crackdown on quality-of-life offenses.
There even appear to be fewer homeless people in heavily traveled areas of the city, particularly midtown Manhattan (though agencies that work with the homeless say their clients have merely migrated to Harlem, lower Manhattan and other boroughs, where they find the attentions of the police less intense).
None of which was lost on Dr. Raleigh Kent 3d, a 44-year-old surgeon from Birmingham, Ala., who visited Manhattan for the first time in years over Christmas. He found the place quite changed. "I felt safer and it seemed cleaner," he said. "I didn't see bums everywhere."
Dr. Kent's earlier memories had not been terribly favorable -- a lot of panhandling and "crumby-looking people around in the areas where tourists would go." There was a menacing quality to the place: "I always felt like I needed eyes behind my head."
Then came the movie "Home Alone II." . "You laugh?" he said. "It is a huge influence." The footage of Christmas in Manhattan, the Plaza Hotel, and F.A.O. Schwarz all helped persuade Dr. Kent to gather up his wife and two children and come.
There was something else, too -- the "Today" show's studio at Rockefeller Center, where since 1994 crowds have gathered daily outside the picture window to watch. Dr. Kent had seen them many mornings: "All these people are smiling, 'Hey, Mom! I'm here in New York! And everyone is having a wonderful time!' "
New York's profile in popular entertainment happens to be higher than usual these days. The number of film and television shooting days has risen steadily since 1993, according to Patricia Reed Scott, Commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcast.
From "Spin City" to "Cosby" and "Law and Order," there are more prime-time shows coming out of New York than at any time since the 1960's, Ms. Scott said. As for the "Today" show window, she called it "an early-morning advertisement for New York that goes worldwide."
It is unclear whether the film and television image of New York is rosier, too. But the sheer quantity of footage may matter more than the content. "I can only think that the multiplicity of images puts it in people's minds and on balance that has to do nothing but good," Ms. Scott said.
Daniel Leab, a professor of history at Seton Hall University, who has written about film, suggested that New York simply looks better on color film than in real life, in aerial shots instead of close up. "The movies make New York look great," he said.
 
Three Little Words
Repeat: 'Cleaner, Safer, Brighter'
One other thing inspired Dr. Kent to give New York a second chance. He kept hearing the same reports, over and over. According to Dr. Kent, friends from Birmingham would visit New York and report back: "It looks different, it feels better, it feels safe."
If that phrase sounds familiar, it is. It resembles a slogan used these days by the Convention and Visitors Bureau and the Times Square Business Improvement District. "Cleaner, safer, brighter" is a mantra the city's promoters use frequently.
The phrase made its debut in 1995 at the Travel Industry Association's convention in New York, a tourism-industry bonanza that gave the Convention and Visitors Bureau a captive audience of 1,500 tour operators from 69 countries and 500 journalists, all marooned in Manhattan for a week.
"The city was starting to turn around," Jeanine Moss, director of communications for the bureau, recently recalled. "We had to be clear about what our message was. We wanted them to see that this was a new and revitalized destination that is cleaner, safer, brighter."
Apparently, it worked.
"We got millions of letters afterward saying, 'We had no idea New York had changed so much,' " said Ms. Moss. "They felt it was so safe, clean and friendly." In her job, Ms. Moss speaks with about 1,000 journalists a month. Words like clean, safe and bright now find their way into all sorts of articles about New York.
"You can never underestimate the value of communication," said Ms. Moss, who credits the Giuliani administration with understanding just that. "Why does the Mayor talk about crime 50 times a week? Because it has to be communicated that many times before people act and come and see."
Reporters who cover Mayor Giuliani say he talks about the crime statistics at least every other day, especially now that he is running for re-election. He also regularly suggests that the city is enjoying a "renaissance." Anyone listening is left to wonder: Renaissance? Could it be?
"It's like going to the doctor and the doctor says, 'You're better now,' " said Bill Lynch, a former deputy to Mayor David N. Dinkins. "Then I feel better."
Which comes first? he was asked.
"For me, that's chicken and egg," he said. "It can be a self-fulfilling prophecy."
The media, too, have reinforced the message. There have been innumerable articles and television news reports about the drop in crime. At the same time, some critics say the media's interest in crime stories of the other kind seems to be waning.
"When things are bad, they tend to be exaggerated. When things are good, they tend to be exaggerated," said J. Phillip Thompson, a political science professor at Barnard College and former Dinkins administration official. "Probably because it sells papers and gets people to watch TV. Because it's exciting."
 
Theories of Relativity
Maybe 'Better' Is Just 'Not as Bad'
New Yorkers, like anyone else, want to hear good news about where they live. They may even want it more than others. Dr. Ralph L. Rosnow, a professor of psychology at Temple University in Philadelphia, calls living in New York "the ultimate cognitive dissonance situation."
According to cognitive dissonance theory, people are uncomfortable holding inconsistent ideas. (For example: "I choose to live in a place that drives me nuts.") So, they try to reduce the dissonance. ("Maybe it's not so bad after all.")
"There is a natural, human tendency to try to have a dynamic equilibrium which is pleasant," Professor Rosnow said. If a credible source offers some evidence that life is improving, people might leap to believe it, he said.
On the other hand, improvement is relative. Some changes in the city are remarkable largely in the context of how far New York had sunk. Subway ridership may be the highest it has been since 1990 -- but it is still below what it was in the late 1980's and early 1970's.
As for the economy, 35,000 private-sector jobs were created last year and a total of 145,000 have been created since late 1992; but 342,000 were lost between April 1989 and November 1992. The number of overnight visitors to New York has grown steadily since 1992 -- but only this year is it expected finally to return to the level seen in 1991.
In other words, expectations had dropped. And satisfaction is intimately tied to expectations. As Professor Bradburn, the opinion research expert, said: "Something that, 20 years ago, would not have been viewed as an improvement, we now see as positive" because people adjust their expectations down.
People can, of course, adjust them back up. Too much good news and that could even happen in New York.
"It's like you have no heat in your house, then all of a sudden you get heat and hot water," Mr. Lynch said. "Then you start looking around and saying, 'Do I have any soap and towels?' "

HEADLINE: For Indians, Environment Becomes New Battleground

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS 

DATELINE: HAYS, Mont. Feb. 5

 BODY:
A narrow dirt road leads away past a tiny cluster of houses and a stone mission church that make up this settlement on the Fort Belknap Reservation. It runs past the sun dance lodge and the powwow grounds and into the forest that cloaks the Little Rocky Mountains.
At the end of the road is a place where Assiniboine and Gros Ventre Indians still hunt and seek visions. But the look of the place has changed drastically in recent years: now there is a huge open pit and a towering wall of crushed stone there, remnants of a mountain that has been turned inside out for the gold inside. 
 A century ago, this piece of the mountain range was part of the reservation, and many in the tribes still smolder over the loss. They say that in 1896 their ancestors were forced to sell the gold-bearing land because of a form of blackmail typical of the time: if they did not sell, the Government agent for the reservation would have withheld food rations.
Now the mining has led to a new battle over the controversial ground.
Last year, the tribes filed a notice of intent to sue Pegasus Gold, which owns the Zortman mine at the site, for damages to reservation water. The suit forced state and Federal action under the Clean Water Act, resulting in a $37 million settlement, including a $1 million payment to the tribes and a $30 million bond against future damage.
In January, the tribes sued in state court to stop Pegasus from creating a new pit until it cleaned up the old one. And the tribes are considering a lawsuit in Federal court, which would contend that Federal agencies did not prepare an adequate environmental impact statement when they approved the new pit.
Tribal leaders say they are making sure the dynamics are different than they were for their ancestors.
 "They threatened their rations, so they gave in and made poor decisions," said Tracy Charles King, an Assiniboine who is president of the Fort Belknap Community Council, the tribal governing body. "But starvation tactics are over. It's time for us to ask questions, get answers and be treated with respect."
The tribes say the two huge open pits in the area have poisoned wells, have diminished the flow of streams and may have widely contaminated groundwater.
The mining company says those contentions are exaggerated.
"There's been a lot of allegations," said John Pearson, director of investor relations for Pegasus Gold at the company's headquarters in Spokane, Wash. "And there have been studies done that have proved some of them absolutely false. Our environmental record and reclamation effort is a very strong one."
In the last seven years, Mr. Pearson said, the mine has produced about 110,000 ounces of gold a year. At full capacity, the mine has about 300 employees.
Legal actions by Indian tribes have been rare but are becoming more common, in part because Indians have become better educated and more of them are lawyers.
One of the new generation of Indian lawyers who came of age during the political activism of the 1960's and 70's is Tim Coulter. He is the director of the Indian Law Resource Center, a nonprofit organization in Helena, Mont., that helps indigenous people worldwide and is working on the Fort Belknap lawsuit.
"Tribal leaders better understand how to manipulate the legal, economic and political machinery," Mr. Coulter said. "And they're not as overwhelmed with the gross ill health and education problems that used to exhaust their resources."
Legal action by Indians was also aided by amendments in the last decade to several major Federal environmental laws, like the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. Tribes got the same standing as states to enforce environmental standards. Many tribes are using Federal money to set up programs to monitor and enforce environmental quality.
A rekindled interest in traditional tribal ways is also helping to inspire tribes' participation in environmental affairs. Many young Indians are taking part in vision quests and other ceremonies conducted at traditional sacred sites outdoors. Many of these sites are off the reservation and threatened by development.
One such site was the mountain that the Zortman mine destroyed.
"That mountain they tore down was Spirit Mountain," said Virgil McConnell, 72, an Assiniboine tribal elder who lives near Hays. Mr. McConnell said the other mountains were still used extensively for vision quests, several days of praying and fasting in the mountains in search of a gift from the Great Spirit.
"You pray, you do a lot of crying and pray to the Great Spirit," Mr. McConnell said. "But you can't go on a vision quest when there's blasting and a lot of noise. We tried to tell the mining company this, but they wouldn't pay any attention."
The mine does stop activity for four days in June during the annual Sun Dance, he said.
The ascendance of a new generation of leaders has also made Indians more assertive. On the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre council, the oldest member is 49, and the chairman, Mr. King, is 39.
Tribes are also becoming more involved in environmental programs because of their traditional relationship to nature. The Nez Perce won a Federal contract to manage the recently reintroduced gray wolf for the state of Idaho, a role usually filled by the state.
Such new roles for tribes do not come without controversy. The Kootenai and Salish tribes in northwestern Montana recently received authority from the Environmental Protection Agency to implement water quality standards on the reservation. The move provoked howls of protest and a lawsuit by the state.
"Eighty-five percent of the people who live within the reservation boundary are nonmembers," said Paddy Trusler, who owns land within the reservation and also administers land within the reservation boundaries for Lake County.
New tribal authority, he said, "adds a layer of government that, unless you are a tribal member, leaves you without rights."
But Indian leaders say the tribes need to keep in mind what is at stake in the battle over the environment.
"Eternity," said Poncho Bigby, the director of the Fort Belknap Natural Resource Department. "We'll suffer the impacts of that mine for eternity."

HEADLINE: An Inquiry Clouds a Lobbyist's Success Story

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER with STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand

 BODY:
A few years ago, Pauline Kanchanalak wanted to become a Washington lobbyist for the Government of Thailand. Officials turned her down, believing that she lacked the connections to be effective in the corridors of power in the United States capital.
But Mrs. Kanchanalak eventually succeeded on her own. Only last June, she and a prospective client from Thailand sipped coffee in the White House with the President of the United States and his political aides. Their discussion focused on United States trade policy toward China, where the client, a businessman, is one of the largest investors. Mrs. Kanchanalak and her client also joined State Department officials in encouraging Mr. Clinton to visit Thailand, and in November he became the first American President to do so in 27 years. 
 But Mrs. Kanchanalak's standing in the world of lobbying and deal making began to fall apart a few months after the White House meeting, when the Democratic National Committee returned $253,000 in donations from her after concluding that some of the money might have come from someone else. Not only are the donations under scrutiny but so are some of the contacts in the Federal Government whom she had worked with as a lobbyist and Democratic Party activist.
The story of Mrs. Kanchanalak's evolution from low-level Thai embassy official to well-placed lobbyist illustrates the zeal with which foreign businesses seek influence and access in Washington, especially in a global economy where the actions of the Federal Government can affect businesses with few or no operations in the United States.
Indeed, some of those caught up in the current investigations of Democratic campaign fund-raising are Thai and Indonesian companies that were trying to influence United States trade policy toward China and other Asian countries, where they have far more extensive holdings than in the United States.
In interviews with businessmen and officials in Washington and Bangkok, Mrs. Kanchanalak emerges as a smart and sociable woman who glided easily through business and political circles in two disparate capitals. Over five years, along with her husband, Chupong Kanchanalak, she cultivated ties with Democratic fund-raisers and Arkansas insiders who were interested in doing business with Thai companies. And she was able to use her ties in the United States to advance her own business interests: Dhanin Chearvanont, the prospective client she took to see Mr. Clinton, is one of the richest men in Asia.
"She was trying to develop a business relationship," said William Hou, the lawyer for her American consulting company, Ban Chang International. "A lot of people, when they're developing business relationships, try to do things like that. If I can take a potential client to the Super Bowl, obviously it wouldn't hurt."
Mr. Dhanin's conglomerate, the Charoen Pokaphand Group, based in Thailand, is one of Asia's largest and most successful business empires and the largest foreign investor in China. It controls more than 250 companies that sell products as diverse as chickens, shrimp, petrochemicals, motorcycles and telecommunications equipment.
Politically well connected throughout Asia, Mr. Dhanin is widely known in Bangkok as having contributed millions of dollars to political parties in Thailand, where there are no campaign finance disclosure requirements. Mr. Dhanin, who is ethnic Chinese and lived in China as a boy, also advised Chinese officials on issues that included their Hong Kong negotiations with the British.
In November, when Mr. Dhanin started a motorcycle factory in Shanghai, Mrs. Kanchanalak was with him, as was Neil Bush, a son of former President George Bush.
Mrs. Kanchanalak's ties have now become the focus of a widening investigation of the Democratic Party's fund raising. As for $253,000 in donations that were returned by the Democratic National Committee, Mrs. Kanchanalak, who along with her husband declined several requests to be interviewed for this article, has said some of the money came from her and the rest from her mother-in-law, Praitun Kanchanalak. American investigators are trying to determine whether she was actually a front for other interests that could not legally make campaign donations in the United States.

Diplomat Becomes Woman of Influence
Mrs. Kanchanalak was born in Thailand in 1950. In the late 1970's she attended Stanford University on a scholarship, graduating in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in philosophy. She then went to Washington and took a job in the press section of the Thai Embassy, said Kasem Kasemsri, the Thai Ambassador to the United States from 1982 to 1986and now a business associate of hers.
She had good connections, charm and excellent English, Mr. Kasem recalled in an interview. As a result, she was effective in promoting Thailand's profile in Washington and in getting important people to attend functions at the Thai Embassy. "We needed help," Mr. Kasem said, because "we didn't have a lot of money like the Koreans."
After Mr. Kasem left the embassy, so did Mrs. Kanchanalak and with her husband, known as Jeb, she began lobbying for private clients. Their first major effort was against farm legislation that would have made it more difficult for Thai agricultural products to enter the United States, according to The Nation, an English-language daily newspaper here. "After that, the couple established their lobbying mark on U.S. politics," the paper wrote recently.
She also worked in Washington for The Bangkok Post, another English-language newspaper here, writing mostly about trade policy. She occasionally appeared on a CNN journalists' program discussing trade and foreign policy issues.
"She had excellent sources," recalled Paisal Sricharatchanya, the Post editor then. But in 1992, the paper decided that she was not writing enough to justify a Washington operation and let her go, Mr. Paisal said. So Mrs. Kanchanalak turned to lobbying full time.
In some instances, she sought out senators' wives, and through them persuaded their husbands to visit Thailand, according to people who have worked with her. And two Senators with influence over foreign policy -- Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia and now retired, and William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine and now Defense Secretary -- were squired around Thailand by the Kanchanalaks. Mr. Nunn and Mr. Cohen did not respond to questions on the subject.
Mrs. Kanchanalak's influence in Washington grew to the point that she knew about impending Congressional visits before the United States Embassy in Bangkok, said one diplomat here. And the embassy would frequently turn to Mr. Kanchanalak to set up meetings and tours.
"Where some see conniving or a conspiracy, I see successful business people connecting with government, which is supposedly what it's all about these days," a senior Western diplomat said.
The Kanchanalaks opened an office on the second floor of a high-rent building in Washington, overlooking the Potomac River. They entertained prospective clients, lawmakers and other lobbyists at the Jockey Club. And they sought American investors for enterprises in Thailand.
One of Mrs. Kanchanalak's main clients was the Ban Chang Group, a Thai real estate conglomerate with developments and projects throughout Asia. Ban Chang International, her consulting company, is partly owned by the Ban Chang Group, according to records in Thailand.
The Ban Chang Group is headed by Pairoj Piempongsant, whose penthouse office in the Glas Haus -- one of the first high-rise buildings in Bangkok, built by Mr. Pairoj -- is scattered with framed photographs of him with President Clinton and Mrs. Kanchanalak.
Mr. Pairoj declined a request to be interviewed. But to his friends, Mr. Pairoj has made little secret of his desire to be close to Mr. Clinton.
"He's very boastful of his connections, how he's close to this senator and that senator," a Thai friend said. "If he's able to introduce himself into political circles in Washington, it gives him an edge above other Thai businessmen to Thai politicians."
 
An Organization Grows And Gains Power
 One of Mrs. Kanchanalak's biggest accomplishments came with the help of John Huang, the former Commerce Department trade official and former Democratic campaign official at the center of the fund-raising investigations.
In 1994, at the request of the Thai Government, she helped form a United States-Thai Business Council, to promote trade between the two countries. Such councils proliferate through Washington, providing a forum for lobbyists to invite lawmakers and influential officials to rub elbows with their clients.
Mrs. Kanchanalak had great ambitions for her group. She wanted President Clinton and the Thai Prime Minister to bless it by showing up at its inaugural meeting.
On Sept. 30, 1994, Mrs. Kanchanalak telephoned Mr. Huang at the Commerce Department, recently released Government records show. That same day, Mr. Huang wrote a memorandum urging a more senior Commerce Department official to support the establishment of the business council, and to try to get the President to attend the first meeting.
Mr. Huang noted that National Security Council officials like Sandy Kristoff, an Asia specialist, might object to the arrangement. "There are quite a few members in this proposed Council from Arkansas," Mr. Huang wrote to David Rothkopf, the more senior Commerce official. "They may want to utilize their contacts to get this matter squared away directly from the top even if they offend Sandy and the N.S.C."
Among the other proponents of the Thai council was Mark Grobmyer, a lawyer from Little Rock, Ark., who has close ties to the President and Vice President Al Gore and who was working on business deals between American and Thai companies.
In October 1994, shortly after Mr. Huang wrote his memorandum, Mrs. Kanchanalak attended meetings at both the Commerce Department and the White House. Within days of those meetings, at least some of which involved the establishment of the Thai council, she donated $32,500 to the Democratic Party, Federal Election Commission records say.
The council was established, and at its first meeting at the White House, on Oct. 6, 1994, President Clinton and Thailand's Prime Minister stopped in to congratulate the group. Mr. Clinton's tacit endorsement of the council gave it extra clout and credibility in Thailand, even though the Administration had declined a request for a grant by the group.
Investigators from the Justice Department and Commerce Department are examining whether Mr. Huang may have been involved in Democratic fund-raising efforts at the time in connection with the establishment of the council.
 
Donations Raise Questions of Timing
Investigators have also been struck by the timing of Mrs. Kanchanalak's contributions last year, around the time that she had arranged the kaffeeklatsch that included President Clinton, Mr. Dhanin and a senior official from the Thai Foreign Ministry.
Around the same time as the coffee meeting on June 18, Mrs. Kanchanalak gave the Democratic National Committee $135,000 and her sister-in-law Duagnet G. Kronenberg, who listed the same home address in Virginia as Mrs. Kanchanalak, contributed $50,000.
The main discussion at the coffee was over United States policy toward China, one participant said. The meeting was arranged through Mr. Huang, who had left Commerce and was working as the vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee's financing arm. Mrs. Kanchanalak brought three executives from Mr. Dhanin's conglomerate, the Charoen Pokaphand Group.
Accompanying Mr. Dhanin at the meeting with Mr. Clinton was Sarasin Viraphol, a senior official in the Thai Foreign Ministry at the time. Mr. Dhanin and Mr. Sarasin, who now works for the Charoen Pokaphand Group, are among the cadre of ethnic Chinese businessmen who run many of Asia's largest corporations.
Ultimately, the President decided to visit Thailand, as some of the visitors at the June 18 meeting had asked. Shortly before the White House announced the visit, a friend of Mrs. Kanchanalak said, she was told by Mr. Clinton that he intended to come to Thailand for a brief visit in November. On Nov. 26, the President ended a 12-day Asia-Pacific tour with a 24-hour state visit here.

HEADLINE: Unromantic Economic Facts Cast Pall Over Niagara Falls

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y., Feb. 8

 BODY:
Winters have never been kind to the Honeymoon Capital. The city grit seems to transform the curbside snow into oatmeal clumps. The spray rising from the falls stings the face. And the Twist o' the Mist ice cream stand, which is shaped like a huge, cherry-topped cone, is closed until springtime, when the tourists return.
But this winter has brought particular hardship to a city that, while blessed with a natural wonder, struggles with the unromantic realities of unemployment, municipal debt and a sickly downtown that seems immune to revitalization. 
 First, a casino opened nearby -- in Ontario, Canada, just across the Rainbow Bridge. Second, the State Senate voted against permitting casinos in several communities, including Niagara Falls. Then, on Thursday, the latest indignity: an ultimate fighting bout, scheduled to take place in the sold-out Niagara Falls Convention and Civic Center Friday night, was suddenly moved to Alabama because its promoters did not like the state restrictions on the sport.
For Niagara Falls, the effect was immediate, severe and oh so familiar. The Radisson Hotel had 30 percent of its reservations canceled within hours. The convention center lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in food sales and parking fees. And Mayor James C. Galie could not help but dream of the free advertising his city would have received from the event's pay-per-view broadcast. Instead, he says, "the people who came here will remember it as a bad experience."
The Mayor will get no argument from two couples from Michigan, the Stearnses and the Gregorys. They had driven five hours to attend the bout and to spend the weekend in the city. Once they learned that the event had been canceled, they drove into the downtown to find a restaurant, but the only business open was an adult-video store; they passed.
They wound up going to the casino in Ontario, where the restaurants and wax and horror museums are decidedly more appealing and therefore help attract the bulk of tourists to the falls. The Michigan couples checked out of the Radisson two nights earlier than planned.
"We drove around and saw a lot of empty buildings," Martin Stearns said, before turning his white Riviera westward. "This area definitely could have used the money."
Hearing of the Michigan couples' experience, Mayor Galie pursed his lips and shook his head, like a father being told that his child had failed a test. He has spent all his 55 years in Niagara Falls, including 31 as a police officer. He pointed to a photograph of a busy street scene that hangs behind his desk. It is like an oversize postcard: Greetings from Falls Street, 1953.
"It's nothing like it was," he said. "I mean, it was so hustle and bustle."
City planners here say that Niagara Falls has suffered the economic hardships of many Northeast cities, only more so. Dozens of steel and chemical plants once benefited from the electrical power generated by the Niagara River. The Hooker Chemical Company made chlorine, the Carborundum Company made abrasives and the forerunner of the Nabisco Company made that breakfast treat known as Shredded Wheat. Meanwhile, the city became the place for marital consummation.
But an economic and social winter followed World War II. As families moved to the suburbs, some of the housing fell into disrepair. The collapse of a private power plant in 1956 wounded an already declining industrial base. Imbued with the urban-renewal hope of the 1960's, the city leveled part of downtown and, as Thomas J. DeSantis, the city's senior planner, put it, "waited for development to come." As an added lure, the city erected the convention center that now looms over downtown like a massive concrete Calder sculpture.
The plan did not work, he said. "Since the 1970's, the city's been struggling to redevelop its downtown, to interest people into coming down to this wasteland, this botched-in-the-60's downtown."
If Mr. DeSantis sounds bitter, his is the bitterness of a hometown son. Through the 1980's and into this decade, he said, he has witnessed a series of flawed courtships between the city and several developers. Many of the suitors either broke their promises or stuck the city with low-interest loans to be collected.
A monument to these ill-fated romances is Niagara Splash, a water slide park that the city inherited from a financially troubled developer several years ago. But the city has given up efforts to preserve the attraction; it has pulled the plug on the Splash for the 1997 season. "We were probably losing about $200,000 a year," Mayor Galie said. "We just don't have the money to sink."
The Niagara Falls of today is nothing like the city of Mayor Galie's childhood, or that of Mr. DeSantis. Close to half of the city's families receive some form of public assistance; almost 19 percent live in poverty. In 1989, more than half of the housing stock was estimated to be substandard. And when businesses close or move, they leave behind ghostly buildings that the city cannot afford to raze.
But businesses have not been the only ones leaving town. When Mayor Galie was a child, 102,000 people lived here; when he began walking the police beat in the mid-1960's, there were 90,000 bustling around him. "Now," he said, "we're probably between 55,000 and 58,000."
Although migration to the suburbs explains some of the decline, city officials say, younger people simply cannot find jobs in Niagara Falls. Robert Antonucci, the city's project administrator for community development, said that his meetings with residents always elicited the same plea: "Provide jobs. Keep our young people here. Keep our families together."
This plaintive cry can be found in the grammar school projects that have been taped to the wall of City Hall. One child proposed the construction of the "Niagara Falls Fun Center -- for all people," while another offered the "new Niagara Cinema." In crudely drawn blueprints, they laid out the locations of the swimming pool, the restaurants and the six theaters. The implied request to observers was to imagine the tourists and the jobs.
Given these circumstances, the city wastes little time discussing the moral implications of casinos and ultimate fighting bouts: if they bring revenue, they are welcome. Mayor Galie was elected to office in 1995 based in part on a campaign promise to try to attract an American Indian casino to Niagara Falls.
As if to underscore his argument, the Canadian casino opened in December; from Mayor Galie's City Hall, it is a 15-minute walk across the Rainbow Bridge. Close to 20,000 people a day are visiting the 24-hour casino, but so far, the Mayor said, the city on the American side of the falls has picked up only modest spillover business.
Undaunted by the State Senate's vote against casinos last month, Mayor Galie said he was continuing to hope that an Indian tribe -- preferably one with an aboriginal connection to Niagara Falls -- will want to establish a casino in the troubled downtown. But a recent discussion with the Seneca tribe ended with its leaders informing the Mayor that, for now, they are interested only in bingo.
The Mayor struggles on, raising taxes, cutting city jobs, holding out hope. Last year, he persuaded a Denver telemarketing company to move to downtown Niagara Falls, bringing several hundred jobs. A Hard Rock Cafe opened here last spring. And he courts developers with yet more plans for family-style entertainment centers.
And in the end, Mayor Galie, Mr. DeSantis and the rest will always have Niagara Falls. The obligatory kitsch notwithstanding, the falls remain an international attraction. Some 10 million people a year come to watch the mesmerizing glide of water over cliff and to hear the soothing low roar.
Here, this geologic formation is the center of the world, the symbol of hope and movement. In the anteroom of the city administrator, there are no fewer than 12 lithographs and photographs of the falls. And the falls figure in yet another of Mayor Galie's vaguely promising plans.
He is trying to get United States and Canadian parks officials to reverse their decision not to allow Jay Cochrane, a professional daredevil, to cross over the Niagara Falls gorge on a tightrope later this year. Such stunts have been banned here since 1897. "It's not dead," the Mayor of Niagara Falls said. "But it's not alive that much either."

GRAPHIC: Photos: This ice cream stand will reopen in spring, when tourists return. But a Canadian casino is drawing visitors from the New York side of the falls; Main Street in the depressed downtown section of Niagara Falls, N.Y., has suffered as dozens of steel and chemical plants that once benefited from electrical power generated by the Niagara River have closed.

HEADLINE: Black, Yet White: A Hated Color in Zimbabwe

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe

 BODY:
John M. Makumbe is a professor of political science. Richard Nyathi is chief librarian for a Government ministry. Stanley S. Gunda is a senior financial officer in another ministry. Not so long ago, they might have been killed at birth.
Even today, pregnant women refuse to shake their hands. On crowded buses they sit apart. On the street they see mothers point and warn their children, "If you don't behave, I'll let that monkey get you." 
 Messrs. Makumbe, Nyathi and Gunda are albinos. In Africa, far more than on any other continent, that is a lifelong curse. They lack the gene that codes the skin pigment melanin, and they are very nearsighted. As white-skinned men in a black society, they are shunned and feared as the products of witchcraft, taunted by children and drunks as "peeled potatoes," "monkeys" and "ghosts."
There is a stereotype that all albinos are intelligent and accomplished, as these three men are. But Professor Makumbe said successful albinos were "a teeny-weeny minute number." Most, he added, languish at home without education because they cannot see the blackboard at school or because their parents, told such children die young, will not pay for their schooling.
In parts of Africa, albinos rarely live beyond 40. Mr. Nyathi has already lost a 30-year-old brother to skin cancer. And Professor Makumbe said he thought "many just die of frustration -- of broken hearts."
With a handful of other albinos, Professor Makumbe has founded the Zimbabwe Albino Trust. He dreams of a powerful human rights organization that battles prejudice on albinos' behalf. But his first goals are almost pathetically humble: to raise enough money to buy sunscreen lotion and spectacles for albinos who cannot afford them, and to raise $20,000 for a survey to count albinos in Zimbabwe and see what they need most.
In the United States, about 1 person in 20,000 is an albino, according to doctors at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, which has a clinic that studies the genetics of albinism. The condition is more common among blacks than among whites, and almost unknown among Asians.
In parts of Nigeria, as many as 1 in 1,100 are albino; in parts of South Africa the incidence is 1 in 1,800. It varies sharply from country to country and tribe to tribe, said Jennifer Kromberg, an expert on albinism at the South African Institute for Medical Research. For instance, in South Africa it is twice as high among Tswana as among Zulu, she said, because Tswana encourage marriage between cousins while Zulu forbid it.
Estimates for Zimbabwe vary. One done early last year found that 1 schoolchild in 4,700 was albino. An earlier one found nearly twice that rate in Harare.
Albinism comes from a recessive gene and must be inherited from both parents. Not all children in affected families are albino. Mr. Nyathi, for example, has two albino siblings, while his parents and eight other siblings are black.
The condition may skip generations, reappearing to cause confusion and ruin marriages.
Lloyd Thuchila, a pipe fitter, said his father had left his mother shortly after he was born. "He said, 'Why do I have to be the one with an albino child?' " Mr. Thuchila said. " 'No one in my family has an albino.' "
Professor Makumbe, who is married to a black woman and has three black children, said that when his first child was born, one of his colleagues at the University of Zimbabwe asked if the baby was "black, white or colored."
"He's a physicist," Mr. Makumbe said. "He should know better."
Many men accuse their wives of infidelity when albinos are born. Some even accuse them of having had sex with a tokolosh, a devil's imp who is said to be produced by witchcraft from a tree root and to live under beds.
Superstitions are strong in rural Zimbabwe. The practice of killing suspected witches survives, and albino children were once smothered at birth. The belief that adult albinos do not die, but simply vanish, is still widely held.
There is also a lingering belief that albinism is somehow contagious. Many Africans admit to spitting when they see an albino, to ward off the "spell." At parties, Mr. Gunda said, people hesitate to shake his hand. Some albinos say they bring their own food on group outings to avoid embarrassing incidents.
"When my nephew got a rash when he was 18," Professor Makumbe recalled, "my own sister said, 'You must have got this from your Uncle John.' "
Professor Kromberg said surveys she had done among young albino adults in Soweto, South Africa, found that they were rarely shunned on buses or in the classroom but did have much lower marriage rates and believed that they would have difficulty finding work. She said she had come across anecdotal evidence that black children were reluctant to share food with albino classmates.
More disturbingly, she said studies she had done in the 1980's found that mothers of albino children took about nine months to accept them fully. "They keep a distance that's not normal between mother and child, and talk to them less," she said.
She conceded that discrimination might be worse in other African countries. For 25 years she and a social worker have been visiting clinics and reminding nurses to explain to people that the condition is genetic "and not caused by witchcraft or by the mother drinking orange Fanta during pregnancy or by laughing at an albino or other things people believe," she said.
Many albinos have developed a bitter humor about their lot. Twice in the 1970's during the war against the old white regime, Mr. Nyathi was almost shot by guerrillas who took him for a white man. He was very funny as he described walking home from a rural bus stop and seeing three soldiers leap up from behind a bush, pulling back their rifle bolts, then halting in astonishment when he started shouting at them in Ndebele, the language of southern Zimbabwe. "Oh, look, he's an African," they said. "Sorry, brother, sorry!"
Sibongile Chitiyo, a 27-year-old albino studying social work at the University of Zimbabwe, said she could judge a man's feelings for her by his behavior in public. "If people ask who I am, and he says 'Oh, she's my sister,' then I know he's ashamed," she said.
Mr. Nyathi, 36, Mr. Gunda, 33, and Mr. Thuchila, 24, met in the library of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce recently and talked about the difficulties of doing ordinary things like dating and looking for jobs. The day-to-day discrimination that albinos face sounded hauntingly like that suffered by black Americans.
Mr. Gunda recalled how the mother of "the first girl I wanted to marry" declared, "I will commit suicide if I have an albino son-in-law."
All three men mentioned having co-workers who were friendly at work but avoided them socially.
Mr. Nyathi described job interviews he had set up by phone, and the shock and confusion of the interviewers when he walked in. "You know you have failed before you start talking," he said.
Several times as the men spoke, ministry employees came around the bookshelves that hid Mr. Nyathi's desk. Each one started at the sight of several white-skinned men, and retreated, apologizing.
Mr. Nyathi smiled ruefully and reflected on the peculiar shame that discrimination creates in those who must face it. "Albinos tend to unconsciously avoid each other," he said. "If I see another albino on a bus, I won't go stand next to him. Other people will assume he's my brother or something. But you look at each other, and you both have this sense of, 'They're on to us.' "
All three men did well in school, despite vision problems. The genetic differences that cause albinism also change the connections between the optic nerves and the brain. Many albinos have nystagmus -- "dancing eyeballs" -- and myopia that, even with thick glasses, can only be corrected to about 20-200.
"Albinos seem more intelligent because they try harder," Mr. Nyathi said. "You have to get out of your seat, go up to the board, squint, write two sentences, go back, and still finish the test in the same time as the others."
Dr. Kromberg said her intelligence studies had confirmed that. "Albinos have normal I.Q.'s but a higher capability," she said. "I think it's because they don't play in the sun all day. They stay inside and do their homework."
But poverty and discrimination often hold them back.
Mr. Thuchila was a good student but could not afford glasses. He became a pipe fitter in a Government motor depot but had to give up the job because the oils on the lathes he used damaged his fragile skin. His bosses, he said, would not give him a different job, or one he could do with gloves on.
For those who do poorly in school, there is even less hope. "It's pretty common to see an albino with a little bowl, begging on the street," Professor Makumbe said.
His trust is seeking outside money, but without much success. "Foreign embassies usually say, 'Give us a development project, not charity,' " Mr. Thuchila said.
At Christmas the Mayor's office gave $500, an anonymous donor, $300. Johnson & Johnson's local subsidiary donated 50 small bottles of sunscreen lotion and some toothbrushes.
John Chinyandura, a 48-year-old unemployed albino who asked Professor Makumbe to pull together the rights group, knows what he would do if there was more money.
He said he would go on speaking trips throughout Zimbabwe, "to tell people that we are the same blood -- that we are people."

HEADLINE: 2 Giuliani Advisers Prosper From City Lobbying

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Two of the most influential members of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's kitchen cabinet, Raymond B. Harding and Herman Badillo, have built a prosperous lobbying business at their law firm even as they continue to serve as close advisers to Mr. Giuliani, who controls the very city agencies that they are lobbying.
New York City records show that in the year before Mr. Giuliani took office, the law firm had 3 lobbying clients. It now has nearly 60, including companies and nonprofit groups whose executives acknowledge that they hired the firm -- which charges up to $350 an hour -- to try to gain an advantage in winning contracts or favorable rulings from the Giuliani administration. 
 The firm, Fischbein Badillo Wagner Harding, has done so well that Mr. Harding, in serious financial straits just a few years ago, said he has been able to pay off hundreds of thousands of dollars in debts, including a sizable sum of money he owed in back taxes.
The firm has grown in power despite Mr. Giuliani's repeated contention that he has brought an independent administration into City Hall -- free of patronage, favoritism and other vestiges of clubhouse politics.
Mr. Harding and Mr. Badillo have not been accused of breaking any laws by lobbying the administration; they are unpaid advisers to the Mayor, not municipal employees, who are legally constrained by city conflict of interest laws.
While it is common for lobbyists to be on good terms with elected officials, it is unusual for two of the city's best-known lobbyists to be close mayoral advisers. So the firm's lobbying has stirred questions about conflicts, the perception of conflicts and what the appropriate roles are for people who are the Mayor's confidants but are not on the city payroll.
When he ran against Mayor David N. Dinkins in 1993, Mr. Giuliani made an issue of Mr. Dinkins's friendship with another top lobbyist, Sid Davidoff, arguing that the relationship had compromised the way the city awarded contracts. Now, in this election year, Mr. Giuliani's critics have begun to make similar accusations against him because of his ties to Mr. Harding and Mr. Badillo.
Mr. Harding and Mr. Badillo are both prominent advisers to the Mayor on politics and policy. Mr. Harding, the leader of the state Liberal Party, is also spearheading the Mayor's re-election campaign and has numerous supporters in key jobs in the city administration. Mr. Badillo, an unsuccessful candidate for city comptroller in 1993 as Mr. Giuliani's running mate, is now the Mayor's special adviser on education and a liaison to Hispanic groups.
Fischbein Badillo said it took in $366,849 in lobbying fees last year. But that amount does not include money that it earned doing legal work for its lobbying clients that did not fall under the firm's interpretation of lobbying, which is defined in city law but subject to differing readings. The firm reaped many hundreds of thousands of dollars more last year from those other services, its clients said in interviews.
Fischbein Badillo has also done legal work on a handful of municipal bond deals involving two city agencies, the Educational Construction Fund and the Economic Development Corporation.

A Perception of Power Follows a Law Firm
 The Mayor declined to comment on Mr. Badillo and Mr. Harding, who left his solo legal practice to join the firm in April 1994, soon after Mr. Giuliani moved into City Hall. The Mayor has not publicly discussed whether he has tried to limit the law firm's lobbying activities.
Top mayoral aides insist they show no favoritism toward Mr. Harding, Mr. Badillo or other members of their law firm, but the aides also concede that Mr. Harding's and Mr. Badillo's phone calls are often the first they return. "A major effort is made to make sure that everybody is treated fairly," said John S. Dyson, who was Deputy Mayor for economic development in the first two years of the administration and is now an unpaid special adviser to the Mayor. "But I think that it's natural that people whom you know you tend to talk to."
Mr. Dyson's successor as Deputy Mayor is Fran Reiter, a former Liberal Party chairwoman and a protegee of Mr. Harding. Ms. Reiter, who was Deputy Mayor for community relations before she rose in the administration last year, is one of the Mayor's most important liaisons to the business community. She said she spoke with Mr. Harding regularly, but emphasized that to prevent conflicts of interest, she did not talk with him about substantive matters involving his clients.
She did say that she occasionally advised him on whom he should contact in the administration on behalf of his clients. "I am sure that the perception out there is that it is a leg up" to hire Fischbein Badillo, Ms. Reiter said. "But I can't help that perception. That is always going to be out there, whether it is Fischbein Badillo in this administration or another lobbying firm at another time. I can't control that. All I can do is control my own conduct."
Mr. Harding's influence is familial as well as political. After Mr. Giuliani took office the Mayor not only hired Ms. Reiter, but also gave jobs to both of Mr. Harding's sons: Robert Harding is the city's chief lobbyist in Albany, and Russell Harding is executive vice president for corporate communications at the Economic Development Corporation.
Even if Raymond Harding and Ms. Reiter vow to avoid discussing his clients, he is still lobbying people whom she supervises. Last year, for example, Mr. Harding registered with the city to lobby personally for about 15 clients, including companies that are involved in some of the most hotly contested battles over contracts or rulings.
Lobbying records show that Mr. Harding is representing Donald J. Trump in his bid to develop the Columbus Circle area; Adshel, which is vying for a contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars to build newsstands, portable toilets and bus shelters; Brooklake Associates, which owns Fulton Landing in Brooklyn, and the National Helicopter Corporation, which is fighting neighborhood groups over its use of the 34th Street Heliport in Manhattan.
Ms. Reiter is the Mayor's chief negotiator on many of these issues.
Fischbein Badillo has also lobbied on behalf of at least two clients who are being investigated by the city's Department of Investigation: Promesa, a health care company, and Nemco, a construction company.
Ms. Reiter said she had repeatedly told other officials to treat Mr. Harding like any other lobbyist, and was confident that they were doing so. "I have been very straight with my staff about this," she said.
But some officials at city agencies said it was not so easy to regard Mr. Harding, Mr. Badillo or other lawyers from their firm as just any other lobbyists.
"There is pressure to accommodate those companies," that are represented by Fischbein Badillo, said one high-ranking administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. A former senior aide who left the administration last year said, "Nobody wanted to cross Fischbein Badillo. You didn't want to get caught in that situation."
It is those kinds of reactions that have spurred criticism of Mr. Giuliani. "How can he even say he's anything like a clean, good-government Mayor, and have as his closest adviser Ray Harding?" said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, an erstwhile Giuliani enthusiast who is now feuding with the Mayor. Mr. Koch questioned whether Mr. Giuliani had allowed Mr. Harding to lobby the administration because Mr. Giuliani needs Mr. Harding's political backing.
"Harding has him by the throat, because Rudy needs the Liberal line," Mr. Koch said, adding that Mr. Harding's support was critical to Mr. Giuliani's 1993 victory and may be again, because the Liberal Party line gives the Mayor, a Republican, credibility with Democratic voters in an overwhelmingly Democratic city.

For Clean Government, Some Very Gray Spots
In an interview, Mr. Harding maintained that his firm's growth in lobbying clients stemmed from the skills of its lawyers, not from political connections. He said he never lobbies the Mayor and dismissed the notion that he receives special treatment.
"The fact that I may see the Mayor socially," he said, "or maybe even talk political matters with him, or maybe rarely be asked views as to the general policy directions of the city, has no bearing at all on these subject matters, which are rather mundane and specifically focused."
Acknowledging his success since joining the firm, Mr. Harding said that in the last year, he had paid the Internal Revenue Service $258,794.14 in back taxes, interest and penalties for taxes he had owed from 1988 through 1993. He said he had fallen behind because he neglected his solo law practice while building the Liberal Party.
Mr. Badillo declined to be interviewed. He said through his partner at the firm, Richard Fischbein, that he, too, does not lobby the Mayor. Mr. Badillo also said that because he advises the Mayor on education, the firm does not lobby on education.
To be sure, several lobbying clients of Fischbein Badillo have not received the contracts or rulings that they wanted from the administration. But interviews with more than a dozen clients indicated that even if they lost, the firm usually won them access to senior officials.
"They have entree to City Hall," said Edward J. Hardy, a spokesman for the American Red Cross in Greater New York. In an unresolved dispute, the Red Cross says it is owed fees by the city, and hired Mr. Harding to lobby Peter J. Powers, who was First Deputy Mayor, as well as his successor, Randy M. Mastro.
Another client, Earle W. Kazis, said he hired the firm to find out what he could not on his own: whether the city would continue renting space in one of his buildings. Mr. Kazis said Fischbein Badillo quickly got him an answer -- that the city was moving out.
The portrayal of Fischbein Badillo as a politically connected law firm angered Mr. Fischbein. He said the lobbying fees that the 70-lawyer firm earned were less than 2 percent of its revenue. "The lobbying issue has as much to do with our firm as the man in the moon," Mr. Fischbein said.
He said the number of clients the firm disclosed had jumped because the city tightened its disclosure rules in 1993. Lobbyists at other firms, though, said the new rules had not had a marked impact. Either way, Fischbein Badillo was 10th in the city in lobbying fees collected in 1995, the last time the city issued rankings.
Lobbying is exhaustively defined in city law, but the language is subject to interpretation. And lobbying experts said the firm was certainly earning money from its lobbying clients that it did not make public, because it did not believe it was required to under the law.
"It's incredibly hazy," said Chris Meyer, an expert on lobbying at the New York Public Interest Research Group.
For example, in 1994 and 1995, the firm reported billing Star Recycling for $21,415 for lobbying. But a person familiar with the the company said he believed that Fischbein Badillo had done lobbying worth at least $100,000 for Star, but had labeled the work legal instead of lobbying.
Mr. Fischbein said the law firm was scrupulous in disclosing all of its lobbying fees. And he pointed out that each company has to confirm the amount in lobbying fees that the firm registers with the City Clerk. If a client disagreed with the firm's accounting, he said, it should have told the firm.

HEADLINE: ALLIES WELCOMING U.S. HINT AT PAUSE IN DOLLAR'S SURGE

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Partly shell-shocked and partly delighted by the dollar's extraordinary surge in value in recent months, finance ministers and central bankers from the world's seven largest capitalist countries voiced relief today after signals from the United States that a pause was in order.
One day after Treasury Secretary Robert H. Rubin issued a broad hint that the United States had dropped its two-year effort to boost the dollar's value, finance ministers here for a meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations quickly nodded their full agreement. 
 "The dollar's correction process ought to end about now," said Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's central bank, at a meeting with reporters today. In recent weeks, Mr. Tietmeyer has characterized the dollar's rise as a necessary and healthy "normalization" to correct what the central bank viewed as serious overvaluation of the German mark.
Those views were echoed by France's Minister of Finance, Jean Arthuis, who expressed considerable satisfaction with where things stand now. "The recent appreciation in the dollar was logical and necessary," he said. "I would like the new configuration of exchange rates to be stable and lasting."
Mr. Rubin's cryptic message on Friday -- "We have had a strong dollar for some time now" -- was fairly close to what his counterparts wanted to hear. The comment was quickly interpreted here as a statement that the United States now favors keeping the dollar around its current level, but not pushing it higher. And that message was welcomed.
But Mr. Rubin and American officials have stopped short of suggesting that they would intervene in the markets -- selling dollars and buying the yen and the mark -- if the dollar continued to climb higher. The only hint of such action today came from Japan, which has been concerned that continued weakness of the yen would cause investors to flee from its already battered stock market.
Questioned today about the possibility of the dollar gaining further ground against the yen despite the change of signals, Japan's Finance Minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said: "G-7 nations have agreed to take appropriate action if it appears to be necessary. No more, and no less." The other members are Britain, Italy and Canada.
Mr. Rubin, the most seasoned market player among the finance ministers because of his long career at Goldman, Sachs & Company, was clearly trying on Friday to sow fear in the markets that a surprise intervention in the markets by the United States and its trading partners is possible. That fear alone could keep the dollar from rising further, because it opens the possibility that speculators could lose billions of dollars on a bet that the dollar would keep surging forward.
Even with today's meeting, though, no amount of public cordiality or tinkering with exchange rates could dispel the sour taste of economic anxiety that is plaguing Japan and much of Europe.
It is one measure of that anxiety that America's biggest trading partners have in recent months been alarmed by both a very weak dollar and a considerably stronger one. There is no magical exchange rate that insures prosperity, and indeed there are dangers whether the dollar moves sharply up or sharply down.
Against that backdrop, most countries were grateful for the chance of a rest. The dollar has soared against most currencies since last year -- by 38 percent against the yen and nearly 20 percent against the mark.
Though Europe and Japan were initially thrilled by the dollar's rise because it boosted their exports by making them cheaper in dollar terms, several were beginning to worry that their currencies might start declining too far and too fast.
Indeed, at a time when German unemployment has been surging to its highest level since 1933 -- 12.2 percent -- exports have been that country's only economic bright spot. Similar patterns have been apparent in Japan, where automobile manufacturers have seen their share of the American market climb by 3.3 percent since May. In Europe and Japan, domestic demand for goods and services remains buried in a slump of pessimism and doubt.
Just three days ago, in fact, the German Government issued data showing that unemployment had soared by 500,000 workers in January alone -- a huge increase that was far worse than expected.
"I think the world economy is relatively healthy, but unfortunately I cannot say the same thing for continental Europe," Mr. Tietmeyer said as he prepared to greet ministers here. "There is a need for structural reform and more flexibility."
Though the countries decided not to issue a formal communique after today's meeting, many officials said that reflected a sense that little more needed to be said on the subject.
But the ministers did issue a statement reflecting their agreement.
"We believe that the problems outlined in our communique of April 1995 in the currency markets have been corrected," the statement said.
"We reaffirm our views that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals and that excessive volatility is undesirable."
American officials, speaking on condition of anonymity after the meeting, said their decision had been driven almost entirely by an evaluation of American interests. They said they had not been influenced by pressure from American automobile manufacturers, which have been hit hard by the strong dollar, nor by complaints from other countries.
Most analysts agree that the dollar's current value in relationship to the mark and the yen is about right.

HEADLINE: 'Round and 'Round On Bus-Fuel Issue

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article about New Jersey Transit's bus purchase policies ("Will the Diesel-Bus Fleet Survive Trenton's Eco-Politics?" Jan. 12) failed to explain why readers should care about the outcome of an otherwise obscure political standoff involving N.J. Transit, the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Whitman. 
 At the heart of the debate is whether N.J. Transit should join the growing list of transit operators around the nation who recognize that they have a responsibility to move people in buses that are as clean as possible. N.J. Transit's current diesel bus fleet fails in this regard.
Diesel buses are among the region's largest local source of fine particulate matter, or soot. Recognizing that at least 60,000 premature deaths annually in the United States can be linked to fine soot, the Environmental Protection Agency recently proposed a stringent new health standard for this pollutant. At least 1,500 of these avoidable deaths are among New Jersey residents.
N.J. Transit's fleet contributes the lion's share of locally produced diesel particulate matter, yet cleaner alternatives like natural gas buses exist. Natural-gas buses are providing safe and reliable transit service in more than 70 fleets around the nation. Among the larger fleets, economies of scale are being reached to make natural-gas buses more cost-effective than diesel over the long haul. With only five natural-gas buses in its fleet and no plans to buy more, New Jersey Transit is woefully behind this industry trend.
Working with a growing roster of political leaders throughout the state, a diverse coalition of environmental, public health, religious, civic and business leaders have been urging N.J. Transit to hasten the switch to cleaner fuels like natural gas. The time is ripe for Governor Whitman and the New Jersey legislature to push New Jersey Transit in the right direction.

HEADLINE: Stamford's Clout In Hartford

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
MOIRA K. LYONS was a duly-elected State Representative when she first set foot in the Capitol in January 1981, but she felt like an outsider. The issue was geography. Mrs. Lyons was from Stamford, and the goings-on in Hartford seemed parochial to her.
"Being in Hartford was almost as if the state government was just the government for that area," she said. "It was unusual to find leadership from outside that portion of the state." 
 She has reason to feel differently now. Last month Mrs. Lyons began her third term as the House majority leader. And George C. Jepsen, also from Stamford, was installed as the State Senate's majority leader. It is the first time anyone can recall two such highly-placed legislators being from Stamford.
Mrs. Lyons and Mr. Jepsen are also both Democrats. Yet it is the differences many speak of when comparing the two.
She is a process person, who excels at detail rather than speeches. He is a crusader who credits some of his most notable successes to working outside the legislative system. He is committed to tackling social issues like abortion rights and assisted suicide. She is better known for her keen interest in highways.
"They are very different personalities," said Representative Michael P. Lawlor, a Democrat from New Haven. "George puts a lot of emphasis in going out, marketing ideas, and then selling them to the legislature. I think Moira is more focused on making sure that outcomes in the legislature are reasonable and balanced."
Mr. Jepsen was elected to the House in 1986. Unlike Mrs. Lyons, he said he never felt like an outsider, perhaps because of his background of involvement in state Democratic politics, including the first United States Senate campaign of Christopher Dodd in 1980. But he agreed that Stamford and lower Fairfield County have been "estranged" from the rest of the state.
"Stamford specifically and southern Connecticut generally, until recently, never had a seat at the table," he said. "There's been a shift, not simply because of the emerging power base, but also because of the emerging economic base."
While the rest of the state struggles to shake off the effects of the recession of the early 90's, Stamford is going through a boom period. Employment is up. New construction, including a stocktrading center complex and a downtown branch of the University of Connecticut, promises more good times ahead.
"I joked with George when I visited his office" -- at Landmark Square in Stamford -- "and saw the construction projects downtown, asking what those long metal things were," said Senator Kevin B. Sullivan, a West Hartford Democrat who became Senate president pro tempore this term. "We long for the vision of a construction crane."
Stamford bills itself these days as "The City That Works," and Mayor Dannel P. Malloy said having Mrs. Lyons and Mr. Jepsen in such positions of power is heartening.
"If not a zenith, this is clearly a high point in Stamford's influence in the state," Mr. Malloy said.
Two other State Representatives from the city, Anne McDonald and John Wayne Fox, head committees on public health and general law, respectively. Across the aisle, Republican Senator William H. Nickerson of Greenwich, whose district includes the portion of Stamford not served by Mr. Jepsen, is ranking member of the Finance Committee, while Senator Robert L. Genuario of nearby Norwalk holds the same post in Appropriations.
"It's not just two leaders, but a delegation all playing at the top of their game," Mr. Jepsen said.
Mr. Jepsen and Mrs. Lyons both deny pursuing a "Stamford-first" agenda. But there are issues of importance to the lower Fairfield County region in which they are expected to wield critical influence.
"I don't think there's anything more vital to our area's economic future than transportation," Mayor Malloy said.
There is major congestion along southwestern Connecticut's main traffic artery, Interstate 95. Mrs. Lyons, a former chairwoman of the House Transportation Committee, continues to be an advocate of mass transit. Mr. Jepsen is likewise committed. "The transportation issue is not just a question of I-95 and trains, but the interplay between the two," he said.
Shuttle bus service and additional parking lots near railroad stations throughout the county are proposed by both parties as well as a regional lobbying group, the Southwest Area Commerce and Industry Association (Sacia).
Mrs. Lyons said better transportation is critical if the rest of the state is to reap some benefit from lower Fairfield County's robust economy.
One issue said to be of less concern in recent years is taxes. In years past, a dominant feeling was that the rest of the state leaned too heavily on lower Fairfield County for revenue. When Sacia did a tax flow study of transportation spending in 1987, it reported a differential of around 20 percent favoring the Hartford region over southwestern Connecticut.
But Joe McGee, a Sacia official, said that the last 10 years have brought healthy change. He credits the emergence of figures like Mrs. Lyons and Mr. Jepsen, as well as a "very good working relationship" between Democrats and Republicans from Fairfield County. "There's a lot more collaboration," Mr. McGee said. "It has strengthened Fairfield County's hand."
Mrs. Lyons said that Fairfield County continues to provide more state revenue than any other county, while receiving less than troubled urban areas like Hartford and Bridgeport.
"We probably shouldn't get as much grant money outright as a city in distress," she said. But she added the mind-set in Hartford of seeing lower Fairfield County as a cash cow for spending elsewhere has diminished. "And yes, being a majority leader helps diminish it, no doubt about it," she added.
The region still has image problems. When he and other lower Fairfield County legislators strenuously opposed Gov. John G. Rowland's support for a casino in Bridgeport, Mr. Jepsen said he had the feeling "people up in Hartford thought we were just unhappy because it would take us an extra half-hour to get to our vacation homes on the Cape and Block Island."
Both Mr. Jepsen and Mrs. Lyons say the problem is two-sided, with too many Fairfield County residents more focused on New York City than on events in the state. Cable television, which has given Fairfield County access to Hartford-area channels, and the election of Lowell P. Weicker Jr., of Greenwich, as Governor in 1990 have helped improve matters, but much has to be done.
At least one legislator -- Mr. Lawlor -- says he is concerned about having two such highly placed people from the same city. "A fundamental part of politics is geography," he said. "The fact that the two legislative managers are from Stamford is a concern."
Others are more sanguine. "Anybody in leadership gets there on their merits," said the House Speaker Thomas Ritter, a Democrat of Hartford.
There is no shortage of admirers on either side of the aisle when it comes to Mrs. Lyons. Mr. Ritter, her senior partner on the House leadership team, calls her a "real technician."
"When things go smoothly in the House, it's because of her," he said. "Beyond that, she gives me the best political advice I can get."
Among Republicans, Pamela Z. Sawyer, of Bolton, said Mrs. Lyons "set a standard for consensus" in the last term, when the state budget was passed on time.
Mrs. Lyons said there was a conscious decision to avoid partisan brickbats last term, despite the fact that the Democrat-dominated House was dealing with a budget proposal from a Republican governor.
"People were taking bets on how long we'd stay in session, that we'd never adjourn in June," she said. "I think we showed them that we really take our job seriously. We believe we are elected to give people good legislation, not sit around and be political animals."
The term "political animal" comes up a good deal when talk turns to Mr. Jepsen. For his part, Mr. Jepsen ticks off a succession of issues he has pushed for, saying the state now has "the strongest living will law in the nation, the strongest pro-choice law in the nation, and the strongest domestic violence laws in the nation."
"I may not have been the only person pushing for them, but in all cases I was the most active, aggressive leader,," he said.
Sometimes, Mr. Jepsen recalled, some Democratic leaders urged him to slow down, as with the 1990 abortion rights bill. He may not have gone along with them, but he insisted that his advocacy has never gotten in the way of being a team player.
"George spends a great deal of time staying in touch with colleagues," Mr. Sullivan said. "He's unafraid to take on tough issues or even the Governor from time to time. His colleagues see that as a strength."
Republicans are more divided on Mr. Jepsen. Mr. Genuario of Norwalk called Mr. Jepsen "a substantive, hard-working legislator."
But the party's State Chairman, Chris DePino, a State Representative from New Haven, said Mr. Jepsen has been "a strident partisan" on several issues, and a chief instigator of friction in last year's Senate session. If Mr. Jepsen is to be an effective majority leader, Mr. DePino said, he will have to make himself over. "His view has got to be much broader," Mr. DePino said.
Mr. Jepsen said he proved he can lead effectively and in bipartisan style when he headed the Judiciary Committee in 1993 and in 1994. While its passage of an assault weapons bill proved contentious, the committee also dealt with a variety of nuts-and-bolts issues like probate law and adoption, and with minimum fuss.
"I tackle tough issues, but not as a firebrand," Mr. Jepsen said. He paraphrased Kenny Rogers: "I know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em.' "
One example of the latter was his decision not to push forward a bill last year that would have legalized assisted suicide; the votes for passage simply weren't there. He said its passage would soon arrive: "The public believes in the right to control our own bodies in terms of the right to die. The politicians will catch up."
Mrs. Lyons keeps a lower public profile, but the State Democratic Chairman, Edward L. Marcus, said that "doesn't mean she's not equally as effective."
"She has the votes," he said, noting the Democrats' overwhelming majority in the House. "If you have the votes, you vote. If you don't, you talk."
She is viewed as a moderate by some, a conservative by others. "I don't really see myself as a political individual," she said.
Others say she does speak out from time to time. Last year she took an influential stand against managed care policies for women given birth that became known as "drive-by deliveries." A minimum 48-hour post-natal hospitalization period is now mandatory.

HEADLINE: Despite Critics, New U.N. Chief Keeps His Style

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Kofi Annan captivated Capitol Hill. He dazzled financiers and political leaders at Davos.
The United Nations' new Secretary General impresses nearly everyone he meets as ever so nice, but now they are discovering that he is also ever so cautious. And although Washington and other capitals are reluctant to pass judgment so early on the man the Clinton Administration promoted as the organization's savior, some of his first moves -- or lack thereof -- have disappointed. 
 By Mr. Annan's own admission, the job he assumed last month makes him "the man in the middle," the chief administrative officer -- with very limited authority -- over only part of an unwieldy, decentralized, global system that takes orders from the 185 countries of the world that make up its membership.
"I'm trying to move the organization to go through with reform at a time when lots of people think that the United States is imposing reform and that the member states are not ready," he said in an interview on Friday in his office overlooking the East River. "You can come with the best blueprint, but if you impose reform, you're never going to go anywhere."
Asked whether he had an impossible job before him, he replied, "A friend of mine described it as a job from hell."
A career international civil servant from Ghana who is said to have never raised his voice with colleagues, Mr. Annan, 58, whose name is pronounced to rhyme with cannon, has survived and thrived in the labyrinthian United Nations bureaucracy for more than three decades because he prefers quiet, slow-moving consensus-building to dramatic, bold action.
But it is precisely that quality that may make it hard for him to press the United Nations to change -- the only way the United States will pay more than $1 billion in back dues.
In its 1998 budget proposal released on Thursday, the Administration proposed spending $100 million next year and $912 million in 1999 to pay its debt. However, the payments are contingent on a level of reform that the Administration and the Congress have yet to define.
"It's not ideal, but given the history and circumstances it's probably the best we could get," Mr. Annan said, acknowledging that he has no choice but to accept the proposal even though the payments are not at all certain and even though the United Nations says the United States owes $300 million more.
Mr. Annan disagrees that his studied, low-key style is a liability. "There seems to be a sense out there that unless you are confrontational and get into contentious situations you are not tough, you are not a leader, you are not free," he said. "I've never shared that view in my life and I'm not going to change now. I often tell my colleagues you can even win without fighting so why do I have to go and pick unnecessary fights."
Much to the dismay of the United States and some of the other big donors, Mr. Annan has announced that he will not have a comprehensive reform plan ready until late July at the earliest, after the entire United Nations membership has had an opportunity to weigh in.
"A good leader must also be a good follower," he said of his decision to wait until all the other countries have their say.
But the delay misses the opportunity to capitalize on the extraordinary goodwill surrounding Mr. Annan in succeeding Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Egyptian whose ouster was spearheaded by the United States.
It also gives conservative Republicans in Congress time to preempt Mr. Annan with their own legislation.
"I was a little surprised," said Princeton Lyman, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations, of Mr. Annan's decision to take so much time. "There are a number of steps we have all been waiting for, and frankly, we hope he takes them before July."
One change the United States and the world's six other largest industrial countries say they want is the merging of the United Nations' three economic departments under a single head, a proposal they formally presented last year.
Even the departments' titles suggest duplication: the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development, the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis, and the Department for Development Support and Management Services.
But when Edward W. Gnehm Jr., the acting chief American representative, and Ambassador Alain Dejamet of France met with Mr. Annan on Tuesday to press him for a decision on behalf of the group, he said he was not ready to make a decision, according to diplomats familiar with the meeting.
In fact, they said, he changed the subject. And when the two envoys tried again, Mr. Annan refused to be pinned down.
"This is an idea that has been around for a long time," said one diplomat. "Even the Chinese seem to be in favor. It's all, well, a bit disappointing."
Mr. Annan's reappointment of most of the senior bureaucracy at the United Nations -- many on contracts of three to five years -- instead of cleaning house has also dismayed the United States, some of the other members and even some officials inside the bureaucracy. He has even given plum assignments to several senior officials who openly lobbied against him for Mr. Boutros-Ghali.
"Uninspired," is how one senior Administration official described the appointments.
To that charge, Mr. Annan replied that the right time to make personnel changes is not in the midst of a far-reaching reform process. "Change is a process; it's not an event," he said.
Still, the way Mr. Annan has decided to organize his reform team is already causing confusion about who will do what.
Mr. Annan appointed Maurice Strong, a former businessman from Canada who has undertaken a number of United Nations missions, to a newly created post of "executive coordinator for reform" at a symbolic salary of $1 a year. But Mr. Strong reports directly to Mr. Annan, not to Joseph E. Connor, the American Under Secretary General in charge of the United Nations' administration and management.
The two men are said to have a correct relationship at best.
The Administration has expressed concern that Mr. Strong may usurp or duplicate some of the functions now performed by Mr. Connor, a former chairman and chief executive of Price Waterhouse, whom the Administration hand-picked to lead the reform effort three years ago.
In addition, Mr. Strong openly campaigned for a second term for Mr. Boutros-Ghali, predicting that efforts by Madeleine K. Albright, then the chief American representative, to oust him would fail.
When Ms. Albright met with Mr. Annan before she left for Washington as Secretary of State, she had a two-word reaction to Mr. Strong's appointment, according to American officials: "Why Strong?"
Mr. Annan explained that Mr. Connor would continue to deal with making the United Nations more efficient, but that he needed Mr. Strong to reach out to the countries that belong to the United Nations and craft a plan reflecting their larger vision for change.
"Reform is a full-time activity," Mr. Annan said in defending Mr. Strong's appointment. "It is not something I can tag on to Mr. Connor's functions."
Meanwhile, there is still a third reform apparatus: a handful of committees made up of all the countries in the United Nations, headed by Ismael Rezali of Malaysia, the president of the General Assembly, many with their own specific ideas of what does and does not need to be changed.
As part of his conciliatory style and his determination to reach out to the United States Congress, Mr. Annan has invited a team from the staffs of several lawmakers, including that of Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an outspoken critic of the United Nations, to discuss reform at the organization next week.
Mark Thiessen, Mr. Helms's spokesman, said the purpose of the meeting is to give Mr. Annan "some input" into the specific targets for the United Nations that Mr. Helms will include in legislation he intends to introduce before any taxpayers' money is spent on back dues.
Mr. Annan said he is "uncomfortable" with specific targets dictated by Washington, but his gesture to consult closely with Congress at all has sparked criticism from other delegations that he is America's man at the United Nations.
"I am a free man," he insisted.
He is a realist as well.
"Without Congress the payment cannot be made," he said. "To those who say, 'Aren't you setting a bad example and are you going to do the same for all the other 184 Parliaments in the world?' my answer is, 'I will devote the same attention to any country that pays 25 percent of the dues and owes $1.3 billion.' "

HEADLINE: College Finally Finds a Home in Downtown Bridgeport

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE

 BODY:
STUDENTS sitting on upholstered benches in the atrium that is the main entrance of the new Housatonic Community-Technical College in Bridgeport might find it difficult to imagine that the building had once been a shopping mall.
David Council, beginning his first semester as an accounting major, said he didn't recognize much of the old Hi Ho Mall at all, but Ana Sharp, who was browsing through a course catalogue for introductory computer offerings, was able to recall the mall. "There was an escalator here," she said, pointing to a space where no escalator remained, "and there was a Chinese restaurant." 
 All around them were pieces of the college's 4,500-piece art collection, giving the space a serene eloquence the shopping mall never had.
In January the college moved from its rented home of 26 years in an old sewing machine factory on the East Side of Bridgeport into its new $27 million home in downtown Bridgeport. The move pleased the college community as well as the municipal government and downtown merchants, who see the college as an important component of the city's rebirth. Lots of people were talking about what might be next in downtown Bridgeport's revitalization. "It's like getting new clothes or a new hairdo," said Janis Wertz, the president of Housatonic Community-Technical College. "'It just makes you feel different."
What was equally remarkable was how successful the college project was. The building's architecture manages to be understated but not boring. Moreover, it was a sizeable government construction project completed within budget and on time.
That was in sharp contrast to the decades of delays and disputes over where the 31-year-old college's permanent home should be. "It's been a very long and tortured history," said Esther Watstein, of the college's public relations office. "It was the only state college in Connecticut that didn't have its own property." Housatonic was created in 1966 as a branch of Norwalk Community college. Its classes met in Bunnell High School and Wooster Junior High School in Stratford. It was formally established as an independent state junior college the following year. Over the next few years, its classroom sites spread into church halls, a library and a Masonic temple, while state officials searched for a permanent site.
Studies in 1970 and 1971 recommended more than a dozen places in Bridgeport, Stratford and Trumbull, but no action was taken. In 1971, Housatonic signed a 10-year lease for the former factory of Singer Sewing Machines on Barnum Avenue in Bridgeport.
As the lease approached expiration, another study recommended moving Housatonic to shared space on the campus of the University of Bridgeport (which had lost much of its enrollment and had empty buildings). But that was rejected by Housatonic's trustees, who chose instead to negotiate an extension of the college's lease. Quarreling between interest groups within the college and in the city government over where the school should go, and a steadily shrinking number of acceptable sites, stymied efforts throughout the 1980's to find a permanent home for Housatonic.
But as the state's economy slipped into recession, city leaders, the college trustees and state officials selected the Hi Ho Mall, which was bankrupt and millions of dollars behind on its property taxes by 1994 when the state took possession of it.
The state -- rather than advertise bid specifications and select the low bidder -- asked contractors and architects to submit design ideas and chose the one thought to be in the best interest of the college and the city. The winning proposal was swiftly completed without add-ons or revisions. "We knew what they wanted and they knew what they were getting," said Louis Cappucci, vice president of operations of the Fusco Corporation, the general contractor.
Its intended use, its urban setting and the college's determination to be able to display its extensive art collection guided the final design. The original structure was completely gutted, keeping only the columns, beams and floor slabs. About a third of it was completely torn down to create a courtyard between the college itself and the parking garage. Part of the garage was also removed so that the main entrance would be exposed to the street.
Petina Killiany, an architect with the S/L/A/M Collaborative, the design contractor, said the twin themes of an urban campus and an Ivy League atmosphere went into the architecture. The exterior is defined by the use of vertical lines and curves. The courtyard is intended to draw in the buildings much as a traditional university quadrangle does, and will be the site of a sculpture garden.
Inside and out, Ms. Killiany said, the design is urban minimalist, thought best to display the art collection. Two art galleries off the main entry atrium will be used for shows, but pieces from the collection are hung on walls in hallways and offices throughout the building.
The college and its art collection are considered to be major assets for Bridgeport's efforts to revitalize its downtown business district. Chris Duby, a spokesman for Mayor Joseph P. Ganim, said the college would help restore the downtown area as "the cultural and economic development center for the city." Just having Housatonic's 2,600 students there will help the downtown economy, he said.
"We are now getting a renewed interest in retail in the downtown," said Michael Freimuth, the city's director of economic development. The Days Inn hotel, which went into bankruptcy and closed several years ago, will soon be torn down and redeveloped as retail stores, he said.
Mr. Freimuth said the college is the second of a three-part state government development program aimed at aiding the city's downtown economy. The first was to move State Police Barracks Troop G to a building there, and the third will be the redevelopment of the former Sears department store, the last piece of the mall site, into a state office building. He added that the college and its art collection also support two economic development themes: arts and entertainment, and educational and cultural development.
Housatonic Community-Technical College also now has many amenities: four computer labs filled with new hardware, all linked in networks and offering access to the Internet. Most classrooms are equipped with video monitors and VCR's.
The school also has a day care center with two classrooms. The center be available for the children of the college's students, and one classroom has a one-way mirror through which students in early childhood development courses will be able to observe the children at play.
The new college also has a student lounge that looks out into the courtyard. The old lounge was too small and occasionally had to serve as a lecture hall.
Frambiel Rodriquez, sitting in the lounge waiting for his criminal justice course class to start, said he remembered the Hi Ho Mall, but noted there was little left of it. "You can recognize the shopping mall when you first come in, the second-floor balcony, but that's the only thing," he said.

HEADLINE: A Vacant Tower in Philadelphia Casts a Shadow

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
WRANGLING over repairs to a fire-scarred office tower in this city's commercial heart has become a major obstacle to downtown revitalization. Vacant and barricaded for more than six years because of a dispute between its owner and an insurance company, it has become such an eyesore that neighboring property owners say their own plans for redevelopment are in jeopardy.
The building is One Meridian Plaza, a 38-story, 756,000-square-foot office tower where a fire in 1991 killed three firefighters and heavily damaged 11 floors. While the owner and Aetna Corporation, the fire insurer, prepare for litigation over how to proceed on repairs, and at what cost and under whose control, neighboring property owners have been waiting for a decision on the building before making their own plans. 
 Behind the tower, on Chestnut Street, a smaller office building and several three-story shops damaged by falling debris from the fire sit with gray cinderblocks in windowframes and doorways. "You can't do anything until you have the disposition of the Meridian building," said Warren Dunlap, a sales agent for Edward M. Paul & Company, which represents several retail and office properties behind the Meridian Plaza.
Meridian Plaza is on 15th Street between Market and Chestnut Streets, diagonally across Penn Square from City Hall. The century-old City Hall is at Broad and Market Streets, which form the north-south and east-west axes of the city's downtown.
Just east of City Hall is the new Criminal Justice Center and the new Pennsylvania Convention Center. The Wilma Theater opened late last year south of City Hall along South Broad Street, a portion of which the city has dubbed the Avenue of the Arts.
J. Ward Larkin, a local real estate broker, called the Meridian Plaza fire "the best thing and worst thing to happen to Broad Street."
"It forced people to make some decisions and created a blank slate for an entrance to the Avenue of the Arts," he said. "That area had died anyway and the fire created an opportunity for a gateway."
Until 1987, no building was permitted to rise higher than City Hall, which with the statue of William Penn atop it stands 548 feet high. Since then, five office towers, ranging in height from 700 to 945 feet, mainly west of City Hall along Market Street, have been built. These have provided the major competition for postwar buildings of an earlier vintage such as One Meridian Plaza, which was completed in 1972.
THE fire on Feb. 11, 1991, started when a workman's chemicals and rags were ignited accidentally. The blaze, which burned for 19 hours, raged from the 22d floor to the 30th floor, raining down glass panels and debris to the street below, before a sprinkler system installed by a tenant on the 30th floor extinguished the flames.
(The Meridian Plaza, which included partial asbestos insulation, rose before the building code required sprinkler systems. The requirement went into effect in December 1991, but the building had been grandfathered under the old code.)
The building is owned by E/R Partners, a joint venture of the Rubin Organization, a Philadelphia real estate company; Equitable Life Assurance Company of America and a Dutch pension fund. Consulting engineers for the owner say structural steel elements were bent into an hour-glass shape by the fire's intense heat, according to Jeffrey Rotwitt, the owner's spokesman and a lawyer with Obermeyer Rebmann Maxwell & Hippel of Philadelphia. He added that fire-damaged walls, floors and granite slabs had been contaminated with chemicals that require hazardous-waste disposal.
The engineers have proposed stripping the building to structural steel to just below the 19th floor and reconstructing it at a cost of $250 million, Mr. Rotwitt said.
But Aetna maintains that undamaged, existing girders above that level can be used, cutting repair costs to $115 million. Aetna also has proposed taking over the reconstruction, as permitted in the language of its insurance policy, and returning it after completion to the owners.
The owner has rejected the proposal, saying Aetna is delaying a settlement and trying to force a lower cash settlement on the owners. To that Aetna's lawyer, Henry Daar, of the Chicago firm of Kostauer & Daar, says that it is the owner who is delaying.
"If they were so motivated to get back in business why haven't they done anything with this building," Mr. Daar said. "The Dutch pension fund has $250 billion in assets; it's the second largest fund in the world. If they wanted to repair it, they could afford it. But if they could get the loss of rents for years and years, what's the impetus to do anything with this building?"
Meanwhile. ongoing maintenance continues at the building with monthly expenses totaling $500,000 for security guards, utilities and ongoing inspections by engineers, Mr. Rotwitt said, adding that the owners say they have spent $50 million to secure and safeguard the tower.
E/R Partners has $90 million in escrow, to be used for the redevelopment. The money was amassed from suits against 45 companies, ranging from the metal cleaning company that caused the fire to the fire department's supplier of nozzles that were ineffective in combatting the fire, Mr. Rotwitt said.
Mr. Rotwitt said the claim against Aetna included $250 million for the cost of restoring the building to its original condition; $60 million in rent lost during the last six years and $50 million in interim expenses plus interest lost by the partners since the fire.
Adjacent to the damaged tower, Craig Spencer, a local developer who has bought and renovated several downtown office and retail properties, acquired an old office building in 1993 with plans to restore it to office use. As the office market weakened, he decided instead to convert the building into a 350-room Westin hotel.
CONSTRUCTION of the $62-million project, which acquired its financing last December, could spur action at the Meridian Plaza and a vacant property across from Mr. Spencer's building, where offices could be converted into apartments.
While the burned-out Meridian Plaza has had a major effect on holding up development in the area, Mr. Spencer said, other factors also contributed to it. He cited the recession, the abundance of available office space and the shift in the office market to the western edge of downtown. "I hope that our project will be a catalyst to get the block going again," Mr. Spencer said. "It's an eyesore, you can't get away from that. I don't think I can help it. I know I can't hurt it. But it's tough for me to say if that building hurt my project."
Instead of restoring the Meridian Plaza to its previous condition, a more economically viable project might include a mixed-use office, hotel and retail center, said Forrest Huffman, associate professor of legal/real estate studies at Temple University. But such a major change would only complicate negotiations, he added.
Professor Huffman, however, is not too perturbed by the status quo. "It's an excellent location for office space but there's just too much office space and if you're putting money into this, you're not going to get much out of it," he said. "In some ways it makes sense to let it sit rather than bringing it back online in a time of oversupply."

HEADLINE: A Wider Public for Noncommercial Radio

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
For the first time, public radio stations are being asked to demonstrate their relevance to their own communities or risk having their Federal funds cut off. The demand for accountability is forcing a new discipline on smaller broadcasters, who are struggling to broaden their appeal without crossing the line into commercial radio.
In the Los Angeles area, three of the six noncommercial radio stations, which all occupy the lower end of the FM dial, received notice that they currently failed to meet the new financing criteria set by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Federal-financed entity that will provide 620 public stations with $260 million in support this year. On average, stations rely on Federal money for 16 percent of their budgets. 
 Los Angeles has 80 or so commercial stations, nearly all owned by groups that have bid up station prices in recent years and rely on mass appeal to generate enough cash to service their debts. It is the noncommercial stations that provide room for long discussions on issues and for idiosyncratic programming.
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting's criteria, developed in the face of fewer Federal dollars and prodding from Republicans in Congress, who question taxpayer support for public broadcasting, is based on a complex set of standards. A station must demonstrate a minimum audience size and a certain level of local financial support, depending on the number of people in its market and the geographic reach of its broadcast signal.
In a reflection of the fractious, fragmented character of noncommercial radio, each of the small Los Angeles stations under threat is using different strategies to satisfy the new qualifications. About a dozen other stations elsewhere in the country -- including KDHX in St. Louis, WYSO in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and KBOO in Portland, Ore. -- have also been warned that their Federal funds might be cut off this year because their audiences and local financial support fell short of the eligibility threshold.
Even operators of strong public radio stations, with bigger budgets and audiences, are heeding the self-help message. Some are adopting the business practices of their commercial cousins, although under different guises, by consolidating operations and allying with others to jointly raise funds.
Critics of this new approach say it squelches distinctive programming by pushing stations to adopt more successful, uniform formats. Because only 10 percent of listeners contribute to noncommercial radio, the new rules also force more reliance on corporate support, which some critics believe jeopardizes the independence of broadcasts.
But Robert T. Coonrod, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's chief operating officer, said: "These standards are reasonable. Mature institutions ought to periodically assess their impact on the community. We're not suggesting they have to become rock-and-roll stations to get reasonable support."
In fact, the music itself was removed from the programming at KPCC in Pasadena, Calif., which became the region's first all-talk alternative radio station.
Rating figures show that KPCC's audience is climbing, but is still short of the mark, said Rod Foster, the station's manager. KPCC, which operates from Pasadena City College, faces the loss of $175,000 in Federal funds from its $1.5 million budget.
"We hope we will make the C.P.B. number by the fourth quarter," Mr. Foster said. "If not, we hope it's enough to convince them to stick with us."
At KPFK in Los Angeles, one of five stations operated by the Pacifica Foundation, which include WBAI in New York, the new guidelines came as management was imposing more structure on a chaotic programming schedule that catered to ethnic and interest groups.
KPFK, a standard-bearer for leftist ideology, eliminated programs devoted to medicinal hemp, atheists and Central America. Others were shifted to different times, like the one featuring former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California. As a result, some defiant volunteer programmers revolted, briefly seizing control of the station in February 1996. They accused KPFK of going mainstream.
"Our independence speaks for itself," said Mark Schubb, the general manager, who after a few frantic minutes threw the switch and took the dissidents off the air. The Pacifica stations are among the few that reject corporate sponsorships. About 80 percent of Pacifica's $8.5 million budget comes from listener donations, while the rest -- which KPFK says is crucial -- comes from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
Along with program changes, the station's pleas for money moved listeners to increase donations 37 percent last year, to $1.3 million. Mr. Schubb says KPFK now meets the new financial-support standards.
At KCSN, a classical-music station on the Northridge campus of California State University in the San Fernando Valley, taxpayer funds of $115,000 make up 30 percent of the budget. "Were assuming the worst -- that we'll lose it," said William Toutant, the station's acting general manager and associate dean of the college of arts, media and communications. "We have not been aggressive enough in tapping corporate underwriting. The classical music audience is not a mass audience."
Lynn Chadwick, president of the National Federation of Community Broadcasters and a member of a task force that established the financing criteria, said, "The intent of this redesign was not to kick stations out, but to help them focus on getting listeners and listener support."
"It is a threat," she added. "It has helped some stations move in a direction they needed to."
In Seattle, for example, the two public radio stations, KUOW and KPLU, have begun offering joint underwriting, giving corporate sponsors a simpler way to reach their combined audiences and for the stations to save money.
In New York, WFUV at Fordham University has focused its format on music, dropping several specialty programs aimed at ethnic groups, and news from The Christian Science Monitor. Its audience has grown.
"Today, we have a much healthier station in terms of economic support," said Ralph Jennings, WFUV's general manager. But the station's audience is still insufficient to meet the new financing standards. "They don't believe public broadcasters should serve fragmented tastes," Mr. Jennings said.
A harsher critic of the standards is Mr. Schubb of KPFK. He says a loss of Federal support will make noncommercial radio too reliant on corporate support and chill independent programming. "The national news brought to you by Archer Daniels Midland," he said, paraphrasing a sponsorship tag line on National Public Radio. "These things seriously compromise democratic debate."

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
Reaons For Optimism

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
Bobby Godsell is a top executive in the Anglo-American Corporation, the dominant force in South African business. I asked him how he thought the country was doing two and one-half years after its democratic transformation.
"All things considered I think we're doing extraordinarily well," he said. "On the economy I am very optimistic -- robustly optimistic. The reason is that I think the fundamental diseases of the economy are at long last being tackled." 
 The "diseases" that afflicted the country in the last decades of the apartheid Government included high budget deficits and inflation, sapping investment. President Nelson Mandela's Government is reducing both, and Mr. Godsell said "there is every indication that they'll keep to the target they have set."
President Mandela and his colleagues have made it their prime goal to attract new capital investment to modernize South African industry. To that end they are following a conservative fiscal policy and plan to privatize Government-owned companies such as South African Airways in whole or part.
Mr. Godsell's optimism was not based only on economic considerations. He spoke also of social change.
In the past, he said, labor relations were crippled by the politicized divisions of race. "Blacks and whites had different pubs, different sports heroes, different politics. It was Nadine Gordimer's world. That cannot make for productive human relationships at work.
"That has changed enormously," Mr. Godsell said. For example, large numbers of black children are now in Government schools with whites in the once-segregated suburbs of Johannesburg.
"It is one of the most successful pieces of racial integration that I know about in the world," he said. "It is one area in which the two worlds have begun to overlap."
He also mentioned sports. Soccer, which was an almost exclusively black sport, now has 10 or 15 percent whites in the stands at matches. And there are blacks in the crowd at rugby and cricket.
The upbeat appraisal ends, for Bobby Godsell and everyone else, when it comes to one subject: violent crime. Concern about that crosses lines of race and class. Among those who raised it with me as a profound problem was Walter Sisulu, Nelson Mandela's life-long comrade in the African National Congress.
Carjacking, as it is called, is a menace in the Johannesburg area. People are stopped at gunpoint as they leave their homes, told to get out -- and sometimes killed. Crime syndicates fill orders for particular makes and models.
Another common practice, less terrible but still frightening, is for a criminal to smash the front passenger window when a car is stopped at a traffic light, reach in and grab a cellular telephone or a woman's purse. That has happened twice to Mr. Mandela's secretary at A.N.C. headquarters in Johannesburg, Beryl Baker.
The police are less than effective for several reasons. In the apartheid years their resources were devoted overwhelmingly to suppressing dissent instead of fighting crime. Corruption has been rampant. There has been little visible patrolling.
The Government is prosecuting policemen in large numbers; 400 have been arrested in the Johannesburg area on corruption charges in two years. In his speech at the opening of Parliament last week Mr. Mandela said, "We will make criminals' lives difficult this year." But meanwhile the fear of crime has pushed up the white emigration rate.
Some think high unemployment is a factor in crime. The economic growth rate, 3 percent, is better than it has been but just about keeps up with the population increase.
The truth is that while racial divisions have eased dramatically, the lines of class are still there. Millions of black South Africans subsist outside the formal economy, without decent homes. In the election campaign in 1994 the A.N.C. promised a mass housing program, but only now is the Government beginning to make progress on housing.
There are shortcomings in the Government's performance, but there are also pluses. It has brought electricity and clean water to millions for the first time. It has set out to restore land to blacks from whom it was seized. And more broadly, everyone knows it is a government that looks to the interests of the majority: the first in South Africa's history.

HEADLINE: Special Winter Games Warm Hearts in Toronto

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Feb. 9

 BODY:
It was the same kind of tiered stage used for award ceremonies at the Olympics. Gold, silver and bronze medals were standard here too. Even the triumphal music was similar.
But when athletes like Thabelang Gumbi of South Africa or Liu Yanpeng of China stepped forward on shaky knees to receive medals for skating in the 111-meter dash at the Sixth Special Olympics World Winter Games that ended here on Saturday, the national anthems of their countries were not sung nor were their nation's flags unfurled. 
 Organizers of the Games say that is because at the Special Olympics, the handicapped athletes and 2,000 others like them from 75 countries are expected to represent more than their homelands.
"We don't count medals, we don't use flags," said Timothy P. Shriver, president and chief executive of the Special Olympics. He said the games are an attempt to show the world that what counts is not being better, or stronger, but recognizing the best in people no matter where they came from, what they look like, or how their minds work.
When the Special Olympics was started 29 years ago by Mr. Shriver's mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, it was not much of an international event. Canada was the only country besides the United States to take part in the first games, held on a blustery day at Soldiers Field in Chicago.
Now, nearly three decades later, this year's winter games were billed as the largest international sporting event of 1997. Through the years the basic goal has remained the same: to help the athletes see themselves in a new light.
It is hard to say just how much taking part in the Special Olympics may change the lives of the athletes when they return home. But while they are here, they have the chance to visit a dentist or have their eyes checked. Some get to be television sports commentators, or newspaper reporters. And as they listen to the announcer read off their names and call them to receive their medals, their faces indicate that life has grown sweeter, at least for a while.
Mr. Gumbi, 18, who lives just outside Johannesburg, could not express what he felt as he raced haltingly around the slick ice at Veteran's Arena. But in the stands, the volunteers who traveled with the team's 16 members were on their feet shouting "Thabelang, Thabelang."
"It just proves that something could be done for these children," said Doreen Selekane, one of the volunteers. She has been fighting for the rights of the mentally handicapped in South Africa since 1982, and against apartheid all her life. At one time, she said, someone like Mr. Gumbi, whether black or white, would have been locked up at home and never let out.
Another volunteer, Angela Braun, said the rink where her handicapped daughter Lorna trains in Johannesburg has now been desegregated, and the "Whites Only" signs have been removed. But much still has to change in South Africa, both concerning race and prejudice toward the mentally retarded, she said.
People still fear Lorna because they do not understand her. And economic inequality remains.
"None of the black athletes' parents could afford to come over here because of the financial conditions of the country," Mrs. Braun said, "and that's sad."
As another heat of the 111 meters (the distance was one lap around a hockey rink) was almost ready to be run the other day, a burly man from Inner Mongolia named Daxidorji, the head of the Chinese delegation, leaned over from the stands and urged Mr. Liu, 18, who only started skating a year ago, to do his best.
Mr. Liu skated hard, but when he crossed out of bounds on one of the turns, he was disqualified. He received a medal anyway, as all athletes here do.
Mr. Daxidorji could not explain why all 14 athletes on the Chinese national team this year are from Inner Mongolia, nor how handicapped children get the special care they need when they return home.
But he said that while Mr. Liu and the other athletes in the orange and gold ski suits of China were competing in this year's World Games, "they feel terribly happy to enjoy the sports with everyone, black and white, boys and girls, young and old."
That much, at least, was clear.

HEADLINE: In America;
Bad Air Day

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Here we go again.
Hoping to prevent 40,000 premature deaths per year while easing the health problems of children with asthma and other respiratory illnesses, the Clinton Administration is proposing tough new anti-pollution standards that would lower the current levels of smog and soot in the air. 
 Industrial leaders do not think this is a good idea. They have already launched a multimillion-dollar assault on the new proposals, complaining that they will cost too much money, will slow down the economy, will raise the price of consumer goods, will force people to car pool and -- perhaps most ominously -- will threaten the weekend barbecue.
If this were a sporting event, I might ask for whom you were rooting -- the kids with asthma who have a tough time breathing whenever there's a bad air day or the powerful representatives of the oil industry, the mining industry, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, the American Bus Association, the Chemical Manufacturers Association, etc.
The problem with the industry groups is that they lack credibility. They always claim that taking steps to improve air quality will lead to economic catastrophe. U.S. News and World Report, in January 1976, noted that E. B. Speer, chairman of the board of U.S. Steel, had declared that "the lifeblood of America's economic strength" was being undermined by the Clean Air Act of 1970.
Mr. Speer wanted the law weakened. Luckily, a more sensible approach prevailed. In 1977 the law was expanded and strengthened.
An article last month in the National Journal had an item that showed just how wrong industry can be on these matters. The article pointed out that during the 1990 Clean Air Act debates "electric utility industry officials asserted that curbing sulfur dioxide emissions would cost $10,000 per ton. Today reductions are being made for as little as $100 per ton."
The new standards proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency would lower the permissible levels of ground-level ozone (commonly known as smog) and the airborne microscopic particles that typically result from the burning of coal, gasoline, oil and diesel fuel. These particles are technically known as particulate matter and are commonly referred to as soot.
A series of well-documented scientific and medical studies have linked ozone and particulate matter to decreases in lung function and other forms of respiratory distress in children and adults, to increases in emergency-room visits and hospital admissions and to increases in mortality.
According to the American Lung Association, children playing outdoors in ozone levels 33 percent below the current standard have experienced as much as a 20 percent loss of lung function. The problem is worsened by the fact that ozone levels tend to be highest on warm, sunny days -- the very days on which kids are most likely to be playing outside.
Mortality studies, according to the association, have shown that "the average life span shortening resulting from exposure to particulates is on the order of two years." That implies, association officials said, "that many individuals in the population have lives shortened by many years."
Big business contends that it would cost too much to do much about these problems. Overall air quality is improving, so why bother to do more? If the kids are gagging, if the old folks are wheezing and gasping for breath, if some of our lives are somewhat shortened -- well, that's the price of prosperity.
The Environmental Protection Agency, in its cost-benefit analysis of the proposed regulations, estimated the costs at $8.5 billion and the benefits, including saved lives and reduced medical expenses, at $120 billion.
But industry strategists are focused on other matters. A radio spot that was prepared to run in Chicago but was eventually pulled said that barbecue grills and even lawn mowers might be banned by the new regulations. A voice in the ad expressed fear that Americans might be forced "to change the way we live."
You might have thought that something equivalent to the Communist threat had arrived, and that the evils associated with clean air must be resisted at any and all costs.
Except that we've heard this hysteria before. The proponents of bad air need a new approach.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Journal on Line: Readers Pay but Profits Remain Elusive

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
From the moment that newspapers moved onto the Internet, some media futurists have been predicting that Americans will some day read their daily papers the way John P. Trebnik reads The Wall Street Journal: He points his Web browser at http://wsj.com, scans the articles he is interested in, downloads a few to be read or printed later, and logs off.
"In about 20 minutes or less, I'm finished with what I need," said Mr. Trebnik, an assistant professor of business and economics at Marian College in Indianapolis. "Frankly, I don't need the paper version hanging around -- too many other paper things to read." 
 Yet, although about 700 newspapers now have sites on the World Wide Web, only The Wall Street Journal, which is published by Dow Jones & Company, has so far managed to close the circle by charging subscriptions for access to any part of its on-line daily, a distinction that was underscored by the recent decision by Slate, the Microsoft Corporation's on-line magazine, to abandon its plans to charge an admission price. Slate learned what other on-line publications assumed: most people expect the Internet to be free.
Many on-line papers require visitors to register for access or charge them for premium services like archival searches. The Web site of The San Jose Mercury News, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., provides free admission to some features but charges a modest subscription for access to archival searches and daily news reports beyond a brief summary. The New York Times charges about 2,000 overseas businesses $35 a month for access to its Web site, although the site is free to registered readers in North America.
The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition alone charges for all access. Mr. Trebnik and other subscribers said The Journal's specialized business coverage makes the on-line version worth the price.
"A year ago, everybody thought no one would be able to charge for content, and that there would be a huge backlash from the Web community because everything is supposed to be free," said Thomas Baker, business director of The Journal's Interactive Edition. "Sure, we lost a lot of readers, but we kept a lot, too."
The Journal's breakthrough has not answered all the questions surrounding on-line journalism. For one thing, nearly 90 percent of the Interactive Edition's readership had vanished by the time the last free trial subscriptions had expired at the end of the year. Moreover, Interactive Edition subscribers gave anecdotal support for a deep worry of newspaper publishers: that on-line services, free or not, will cannibalize their profitable newspaper sales when readers like Mr. Trebnik, decide they do not need "the paper version."
Meanwhile, on-line advertisers, who pay to have links to their Web sites embedded in on-line journals, are still trying to decide if reaching a relatively small number of paying subscribers is as good as reaching 10 times as many freeloaders.
And The Journal's subscription program is still too new to answer perhaps the key question: Whether subscribers will be loyal enough to resubscribe year after year?
Martin Nisenholtz, president of The New York Times Electronic Media Company, said on-line publishers were watching the progress of The Journal's Interactive Edition for clues to a still-emerging Internet news business. Although The Times's Web site -- www.nytimes.com -- may before long begin offering fee-based archival searches and other premium services, he said, few on-line publishers, including The Times, are willing to accept the decline in readership that comes with subscription charges.
"We are perfectly willing to start charging," Mr. Nisenholtz said, "once we see an acceptably large and loyal audience emerging."
Mr. Baker said he was not dismayed by the plunge in readership that followed the imposition of a $49 annual subscription fee -- $29 to current subscribers of The Wall Street Journal -- that became final on Jan. 1. The Interactive Edition had 653,000 registered users, some of them probably duplicates, before the subscription fees were imposed, he said; now there are 70,000.
Mr. Baker contends that the number of subscribers will rise as Internet users begin to accept the idea of paying for on-line services. "People will realize that if you want something interesting and deep, you are going to have to pay for it," he said.
Mr. Baker would not discuss his division's finances, beyond conceding that the Interactive Edition has not yet begun to pay for itself. Bill Bass, an electronic media consultant with Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., said most sites covered about 30 percent of their costs from advertising, a figure he estimated held true for The Journal's Interactive Edition.
"Seventy thousand is a pretty respectable start," Mr. Bass said. "I would think that puts them right in the middle of where they expected to be, but they're still not going to be making any money."
What subscribers to The Journal's Interactive Edition get is access to the main articles and features of the daily paper plus frequent updates from the Dow Jones News Service and The Associated Press..
"Now newspapers can be more up to date than radio and television," said John F. Dowd, a T.W.A. pilot who reads the Interactive Edition from his home in Kittery Point, Me.
Mr. Baker, the Interactive Edition's business director, is confident The Journal's Web site is not cutting into sales of the paper version. Interactive Edition readers were younger and less likely to be print version readers, Mr. Baker said, noting that fewer than 40 percent of on-line subscribers also had print subscriptions.
But a sampling of eight subscribers showed that only one, a woman in central Texas who would speak only on the condition that she not be identified, said she would continue to buy both the print and interactive edition. One, Chance Harris of Austin, said he might renew his print subscription once it expired, and six -- George Scriban of Ontario; Tab Turner of North Little Rock, Ark.; Mike Cline of Big Bear, Calif.; Mike Hollander of Redondo Beach, Calif; Mr. Dowd and Professor Trebnik -- said they stopped buying the printed Wall Street Journal once the on-line version became available.
"The Marketplace section is the most important part of the paper to me, and I can get that on line and not have to throw away big chunks of the paper that I never read anyway," Mr. Hollander said.
Interactive Edition advertisers pay a few pennies each time a page with one of their ads, which are linked to their own Web sites, is called up. Some are not concerned about losing the greater exposure that a free on-line publication offers.
"We thought the demographics of The Wall Street Journal would be right," said Cyndy Ainsworth, marketing director for Virtual Vineyards, an on-line food and wine retailer. "Because we paid by the impression it did not really matter to us if they charged their readers. In fact, we thought it might even be good."
Virtual Vineyards paid The Wall Street Journal 4 cents for each "impression," with a guaranteed 50,000 impressions before the charge kicked in -- a hurdle the Interactive Edition easily cleared, Ms. Ainsworth said. But the company dropped its account after it failed to produce enough "click throughs" to Virtual Vineyard's own Web site, let alone hard sales. In the future, she said, her company would try to negotiate ad rates based on sales or at least on click-throughs.
Advertisers mainly interested in attracting Journal readers to their own advertiser-supported Web sites said they were happy with the Interactive Edition, however.
"We think it makes them a better, more select audience because they are paying to get the service," said Laura Henry, a spokeswoman for Lucent Technologies, which produces a free mapping service on the Web called Maps On Us.

HEADLINE: MEDIA: BROADCASTING;
To fulfill a children's educational TV quota, everything old becomes new again.

BYLINE: By Lawrie Mifflin 

 BODY:
WHEN the Federal Communications Commission voted in August to require television stations to broadcast three hours of educational programs for children, the F.C.C. chairman, Reed E. Hundt, envisioned a new world of production, one in which "the creative community can invent a whole new art form: the art of teaching children with television."
Last week, the first glimpses of that world appeared, when the broadcast networks began presenting their fall 1997 children's program schedules to advertisers. 
 The schedules included the requisite three hours of educational or informational programs. But no new art form was on view.
In fact, some very old shows have been trotted out to meet the Federal mandate -- a sign of either cynicism or economic desperation.
Fox has filled two and a half hours of its three-hour educational commitment with five weekday half-hours of "Bobby's World," a cartoon about a 4-year-old boy that has been around for seven years. Mostly reruns with 10 new episodes thrown in, it is scheduled to run in most markets five days a week at 7 A.M. (In New York, where the Fox station has a morning news program, "Bobby's World" will be seen at 2 P.M.)
Similarly, Kids WB, the children's portion of the WB network, has filled two and a half of its three hours with weekday reruns at 7:30 A.M. of "The Adventures of Captain Planet," an environmentally minded cartoon that is still shown on the Cartoon Network, on TBS and in syndication.
NBC is sticking to the same Saturday morning format, three hours for adolescents, led by the eight-year sitcom "Saved by the Bell," and the seven-year-old "N.B.A. Inside Stuff," a show produced by the National Basketball Association's entertainment division. "I've never understood where the educational value is on that one," Jon Mandel, a senior vice president of Grey Advertising, said. "But I'm not an educational consultant, nor am I a child."
An educational consultant reads all the scripts for the NBC shows and suggests revisions that add or strengthen "pro-social" messages.
Mr. Mandel argues that children spot such overlaid messages, and that if a show is "90 percent as good as it was originally" in entertainment terms, "and it's up against a cable show that's 100 percent, kids will go for the 100 percent."
But Fox, known for its superheroes and karate choppers, has a program that disproves the notion that education and entertainment are incompatible. Its remaining half-hour of educational programming, "Life With Louie," is a Saturday morning cartoon about the comedian Louie Anderson's forlorn childhood; it is currently the highest-rated animated children's program.
Still, children can find pure entertainment all day on the Nickelodeon and Cartoon networks on cable, and cable networks are not required to meet educational requirements.
While Fox has children's programs every weekday afternoon, and WB plans to follow that next season, the three other broadcast networks have only Saturday mornings available for children's programs. Now three hours of that time must go to education or information.
CBS, which has been at the bottom of the ratings barrel with children for several years, decided to cut back to three hours from five, and make them all educational or informational. Under its new programming chief, Lucy Johnson, CBS also seems to be the only network that took risks in developing programs for the fall -- perhaps not surprisingly, since it had so little to lose. The only show returning to CBS from this season is "Beakman's World."
The new lineup includes a game show, "Wheel of Fortune 2000," adapted from the adult version; "The Sports Illustrated for Kids Show," based on the magazine, and a mixed-media comic variety show starring Weird Al Yankovic, whom many children know from MTV for his parodies of popular songs.
"People will trash it as silly, but 'Wheel of Fortune' may be the sleeper of the season," Mr. Mandel of Grey Advertising said. "And I'll argue that it absolutely is educational. One of the classic children's games is hangman, and this is just hangman with a wheel."
CBS is also recycling a program from ABC, "Fudge," based on the Judy Blume children's novels, and a public television show, "Ghostwriter," in which junior high school students and a ghost friend decipher word messages to solve crimes.
There are high expectations at ABC, now owned by the Walt Disney Company. Not all ABC's shows have been announced yet. One will be a cartoon version of the Disney movie "101 Dalmations." The network is excited, too, about "Pepper Ann," an animated show created by Sue Rose, about a seventh-grade girl "who thinks the coolest thing in the world is her brain," said Geraldine Laybourne, the former head of Nickelodeon, who is overseeing the retooling of ABC's children's lineup.
Whatever the educational value of Pepper Ann and other such characters, it will only seep through if the shows are entertaining enough to draw children away from Nickelodeon and Cartoon.
"If the F.C.C. rule just drives kids away from broadcast to cable," Mr. Mandel said, "then you're wasting three hours of public airwaves each week, and you haven't educated anyone, either."

HEADLINE: John Perry Miller, 85, Professor And Yale Graduate School Dean

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Dr. John Perry Miller, an economics professor for more than 40 years at Yale University who was the dean of the university's graduate school in the 1960's, died yesterday morning at his home in Hamden, Conn. He was 85.
He joined the economics department at Yale in 1939 after teaching briefly at Harvard and Princeton. He became an authority on industrial organization and public policy and was on a committee of seven economists who advised President Harry S. Truman on stabilizing and rebuilding the New England economy after a recession in the late 1940's. 
 Dr. Miller was appointed director of Yale's social sciences division, one of the three major faculty divisions, in 1959. He became the dean of the graduate school in 1961, holding the post until 1969.
As dean, he presided over several major changes in the university's approach to graduate education, including establishment of a Master of Philosophy degree, the first of its kind in the nation.
The degree, awarded to students who have satisfied all of the requirements for a doctorate except the writing of a dissertation, was intended to alleviate a shortage of college instructors. The move was seen as a challenge to the Ph.D. as the only valid mark of achievement for those seeking to join college faculties.
Following a trend started by Columbia University, Dr. Miller also instituted Yale's first combined degree program, allowing students to receive a bachelor's and master's degree in the same course of study. He called the combined degree program a forebear of "radical readjustments of the relationships between our secondary schools, colleges and graduate and professional schools." Combined degree programs are common today.
As dean, he also served on the faculty committee that in 1962 recommended admitting women as undergraduates.
John Perry Miller was born in 1911 in Lynn, Mass. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard in 1932. He received a Master of Arts degree in 1934 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1937, also from Harvard. He worked as a principal economist for the Office of Price Administration in Washington before being assigned to the Navy's Office of Procurement during World War II. He was released from the Navy in 1945 as a lieutenant commander.
Besides teaching, he also worked as a consultant on industrial economics, military procurement and higher education. He was director of Yale's Institution for Social and Policy Studies from 1969 to 1974 and also led the Campaign for Yale, a capital fund-raising drive that collected more than $370 million for the university in the early 1970's. He retired in 1981.
At the time of his death, he was the Elizabeth S. and A. Varick Stout Emeritus Professor of Social Science.
He is survived by a daughter, Ann M. Finicane, a lawyer in Brimfield, Mass.; a son, Dr. Perry Lowell Miller, a professor at Yale Medical School, and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: OFFICIALS SAY MOB IS SHIFTING CRIMES TO NEW INDUSTRIES

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
With their longtime control of extortion and bid-rigging rackets in New York City and New Jersey weakened by years of relentless prosecutions and by regulatory crackdowns, the region's Mafia crime families are switching increasingly to white-collar crimes as ripe sources of plunder, law enforcement officials say.
The new Mafia focus is primarily on multimillion-dollar frauds in three lucrative businesses: health insurance, prepaid telephone cards and small Wall Street brokerage houses, according to law enforcement experts on organized crime. 
 The experts say that mobsters and their associates, especially younger ones, have searched for new criminal opportunities in recent years as many of the most powerful Mafia bosses have been sent to prison and the flow of loot from traditional rackets has dwindled.
Those old enterprises, investigators said, included shakedowns for labor peace in the construction industry, garbage-hauling cartels, extortions of merchants in the city's wholesale food and produce markets, the milking of union pension and welfare funds, payoffs for obtaining jobs and contracts at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and control of the garment district's trucking companies.
With a tinge of irony, law enforcement officials said that their successes in eliminating long-established rackets had caused the crime families to mine new fields for booty.
"They are analogous to companies in Chapter 11 bankruptcy," Lewis D. Schiliro, a top Federal Bureau of Investigation official, said of the region's five largest Mafia gangs -- the Genovese, Gambino, Lucchese, Colombo and Bonanno families. "They are still in business but many of their old moneymaking bases have dried up and they are moving into new industries to fill the cash void."
Most information about the Mafia's moves into white-collar areas, law enforcement officials said, has come from informers, wiretaps and electronic bugs. They said that despite a handful of arrests in a medical-fraud investigation in New Jersey last year, no major mob figures had been seized so far. But they added that white-collar investigations required long and complex paper trails before indictments could be obtained.
"In destroying their old rackets, we have given them on-the-job training about how we infiltrate families, turn witnesses and use electronic surveillance," said Mr. Schiliro, the chief of the F.B.I.'s criminal division in New York. "They are not as overt as they once were, and we may have to change our techniques."
Mr. Schiliro and Peter G. Verniero, the Attorney General of New Jersey, said their agencies were giving high priority to thwarting mob attempts to turn medical insurance into an underworld treasure trove.
Infiltration of the health care industry, Mr. Verniero said in a recent interview, "is now our most serious organized crime problem."
The authorities in New Jersey said they uncovered what might be the prototype of the mob's medical care strategy in August, when they arrested 12 men accused of being members of a Genovese crew, or unit. The crew's leaders were charged with siphoning payments from Tri-Con Associates, a New Jersey company that arranged medical, dental and optical care for more than one million patients in group plans throughout the country.
Investigators said that the mobsters set up Tri-Con, investing their own money and using employees as managers, and intimidated some health plan administrators into approving excessive payments to the company. New Jersey authorities said Tri-Con in effect became a broker, linking networks of health-care providers, including physicians, hospitals and dentists, with group plans for companies and unions.
The authorities said that this area of health care service generally was not tightly regulated and that a grand jury was trying to determine the extent of any frauds manipulated through Tri-Con.
All Tri-Con defendants have pleaded not guilty to the fraud charges and denied that they intimidated health-plan administrators to approve excessive fees.
A relatively new industry -- prepaid phone cards -- that grosses about $1 billion a year is another Mafia target, Federal agents said. The cards, sold at neighborhood stores, are especially popular with immigrants as a convenient way to call overseas from public telephones.
The companies that make and distribute the cards program their magnetic strips with a fixed amount of credit for calling time, typically $20. They pay stores a small commission for each card sold and reimburse long-distance carriers for calls made with the cards, pocketing whatever money is left.
Agents say that the Gambino family set up a calling-card company that stole more than $50 million from callers and phone companies from fraudulent sales in the New York area and in other big cities.
An agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter was still under investigation, said that each card supplied by the Gambinos was typically sold for $20 in calls, but that most cards became worthless after $2 or $3 in calls because they had not been programmed for the listed amounts.
The agent said that Gambino gangsters "ripped off millions in small amounts from thousands of customers who bought semi-worthless cards." The telephone carriers that handled the calls also lost money, he said, "because they made the deal almost entirely on credit to the phony distribution company, which never passed along the money for the calls that were actually made with the cards."
The stock market boom is also attracting the mob. Federal and city law enforcement officials said they were investigating efforts by the Genovese, Gambino and Colombo crime families to coordinate frauds through initial public offerings of stock in the over-the-counter markets handled by small brokerage firms. The officials, citing ongoing inquiries, refused to give details of the suspected stock-tampering schemes. But a Long Island businessman who admitted participating in recent stock swindles involving Gambino and Colombo members agreed to discuss the deals on the condition of anonymity. The businessman, who served a prison sentence for grand larceny, said in an interview that his life might be endangered if he were identified.
Recounting what he said was the Mafia's most common ploy, he explained that mobsters or their associates offer loans to brokers who are in debt or need capital to expand their businesses. Then, the mobsters force the brokers, using confederates as front men, to sell them most of the low-priced shares in a company before its stock is available to investors through initial public offerings.
The mobsters, with the brokers' help, quickly inflate the value of the shares by trading among themselves in paper or fake transactions. The brokers are then coerced into further inflating the prices of the new shares by recommending them to unsuspecting investors. The gangsters then sell out with huge profits before the overvalued stocks plunge, the businessman explained.
"It is a new wrinkle on loan sharking," he said. "The brokers are in debt to these wise guys and the only way they can pay off and not get hurt physically or ruined financially is by pumping up the stocks that the mob is interested in."
Daniel J. Castleman, the head of the investigation division in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, said the Mafia's move into Wall Street and white-collar activities created unseen dangers for the public. "When you borrow from loan sharks, at least you know what you're getting into," he said. "But when you are unaware that you are dealing with mobsters, there is a tremendous potential for substantial financial losses."
The Mafia's entry into white-collar crime has followed a recent string of serious financial setbacks, law enforcement officials say. Investigators assert that the Mafia was hit with probably its largest loss -- about $500 million a year in illicit profits -- when its garbage-hauling cartels in the city and on Long Island were dissolved in the last two years. Leaders of the Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese families and their allies have been convicted or are awaiting trials on accusations of reaping enormous profits through rigged bids and inflated bills.
Another $50 million a year evaporated from the mob's treasury, organized crime experts said, when the city, using stricter licensing powers, evicted from the Fulton Fish Market more than 20 companies linked to the Genovese family. A proposed licensing law aimed at removing mob figures and corrupt practices from two other big markets, the Hunts Point produce market in the Bronx and the Gansevoort meat market in Manhattan, is before the City Council.
At the Javits Center, the state now supervises hiring and construction contracts controlled until the mid-1990's by carpenters' and teamsters' union officials who have been removed on charges of corruption and ties to the Gambino and Genovese families. In the garment district, a group of Gambino-run trucking companies that prosecutors said had a stranglehold for decades over the delivery of clothing have been replaced through a court order by untainted, independent companies.
Other Mafia economic bastions, known as the windows, concrete, drywall and paint clubs, that extorted millions of dollars a year for labor peace in the region's construction industry were dismantled by the convictions of top mobsters and union officials.
But the authorities concede that the Mafia's network of illegal sports bookmaking and loansharking rings still flourish. Investigators say that bookmaking and loansharking enterprises are hard to eradicate because they can be easily re-established and because gambling convictions usually result in light sentences.
In 1994, a New York City Police Department report estimated that mob gambling operations reaped $2 billion a year in illegal profits. Salvatore Gravano, the turncoat Gambino underboss who was arrested in 1990, testified later that he had routinely funneled more than $1 million a year in cash to John Gotti, the imprisoned Gambino boss, as his share from just one Gambino gambling ring.
"Gambling feeds the Cosa Nostra army for its true mission -- infiltrating legitimate business," said Robert T. Buccino, the deputy chief of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Division in the New Jersey Attorney General's office.

Chart: "UPDATE: Hard Times for the Mob"
Despite recent forays into white-collar crime, the Mafia has seen its power in the New York region slipping under the weight of arrests, prosecutions, infighting and other problems, the authorities say. Citing information gleaned from informers, surveillance and electronic eavesdropping, they cite these recent significant developments for four of the five big Mafia "families," or gangs:
 
GENOVESE -- The Genovese family remains the nation's largest and most influential Mafia faction, but it faces organizational difficulties because its reputed boss, Vincent Gigante, known as Chin, and his entire hierarchy will soon be tried on Federal racketeering and murder charges. Last year, a judge found that Mr. Gigante, who for years has behaved erratically in public, had been feigning mental illness to block his trial. "Chin is still the No. 1 boss in America," said Lewis D. Schiliro, criminal investigations chief of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York.
 
GAMBINO -- Two recent racketeering indictments of Nicholas Corozzo, who prosecutors say is a Gambino captain, have blocked his efforts to succeed John Gotti as Gambino boss, the authorities say. Mr. Corozzo's arrest, they say, may have revived the prospects of Mr. Gotti's son, John Gotti Jr., a reputed Gambino captain, to replace his father, who is serving a sentence of life without parole. Mr. Corozzo was designated last fall by other Mafia leaders to assume control of the family. But since he has been denied bail and is facing long prison sentences if convicted in New York and in Florida, he is unable to run the troubled family, agents said.
 
BONANNO and LUCCHESE -- In December, the New Jersey wings of the Bonanno and Lucchese families merged their gambling activities with the Bruno-Scarfo family, which operates in Philadelphia and New Jersey. Robert T. Buccino, the deputy chief of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Division in the New Jersey Attorney General's office, said that the three groups consolidated because their ranks in New Jersey had been cut by arrests and internal wars. The Bonanno family, the only Mafia group whose leaders are neither in prison nor under indictment, has emerged as the most stable mob group in the New York region. The authorities say that Joseph C. Massino revived the family's fortunes after becoming the Bonanno boss in 1992. (pg. B4)

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Jumped in December

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
American orders for machine tools rebounded in December, posting the first rise in two months, industry figures show.
Orders for domestic and foreign-made machine tools rose 29.7 percent during the month to an estimated $839 million, the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association said today. For all of 1996, estimated consumption totaled $8.5 billion. In November, machine tool orders totaled an estimated $647 million. All regions had gains in orders during December. 
 Exports of machine tools, which are counted separately from domestic orders, jumped 118.4 percent to $108.39 million in December from $49.63 million in November.
Actual machine tool orders rose 25.9 percent in December, to $554.58 million from a revised $440.57 million in November, the industry groups said. Total units ordered increased 12.3 percent, to 3,543 during the month from 3,155 in November.
The machine tool figures cannot be compared with those last year because the organizations changed their method of counting orders in August.
The Northeast region posted the largest gain in the latest report with a 45.3 percent increase in December, to $98.63 million. Orders in the Midwest jumped 22.4 percent, to $249.41 million in December. demand increased 15.2 percent, to $81.84 million in the Central region, 7.0 percent to $58.88 million in the West and 5.6 percent to $65.83 million in the South.

HEADLINE: AN ARMY ACCUSED -- A special report;
Sex Abuse Cases Sting Pentagon, But the Problem Has Deep Roots

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: ABERDEEN, Md.

 BODY:
It is hard to spot any signs of the behavior behind accusations that the Army post here had become the libidinous playground for a captain and about 20 or 30 sergeants. With strict enforcement of a new buddy system, even female recruits, alleged to be the men's prey, complain of having to walk in pairs just to cross a yard to breakfast.
But the immense Aberdeen Proving Ground, on the northern banks of the Chesapeake Bay, is reeling from charges by a growing number of young women. Nineteen in the first official report in November -- 50 at last count -- allege that 10 male superiors at the mechanics training school here sexually abused them. The charges include at least 26 rapes, forced oral sodomy, battery, buttocks grabbing, hair pulling and threats for reporting such misconduct. Seven men face courts-martial beginning in March, and more are being investigated. 
 No American institution has ever confronted such charges of sexual misconduct, including the Navy, which struggled five years ago with charges that drunken male aviators had groped or stripped 26 women at the Tailhook convention in Las Vegas.
But in the weeks since the stories of sexual misconduct began to surface, the Pentagon has discovered that the reports from Aberdeen are no aberration. Initially attributed to a "few bad apples," the accusations of sexual misconduct are reverberating throughout the Army.
Among all big American institutions, the Army, women's advocates say, stands out as the most abusive of women, stunning a top command that had prided itself on bringing women aboard with the same success it had achieved in integrating blacks.
Interviews with Army officials and female recruits, a review of the Pentagon's own surveys on harassment and an examination of the cases so far show that the Army failed to heed signs of widespread sexual misconduct dating back as far as two decades, when women began moving from hospitals and offices into fatigues and formations.
Seventeen years ago, for example, half the 300 women attached to the 3d Infantry Division in Germany said in a survey that they had been subjected to unwanted physical advances. Two Pentagon inquiries then found systemic misconduct in all the services, including instructor-trainee abuses at Fort Meade, Md., much like those reported here.
Nine years ago and again last year in polls conducted in all the services for the Pentagon, a majority of the women responding, particularly in the Army, said they had encountered some form of sexual harassment. In the latest poll, many said their complaints had been met with ridicule, retaliation or indifference, a charge repeated in interviews with women at Aberdeen and elsewhere.
In all the services, few of the women who report harassment behind the anonymity of surveys file formal complaints. Since 1991, the Army has received about 1,200 complaints from women each year, proportionately about the same as the other services. But the Army throws out almost two-thirds of the complaints as unsustainable, far more than the other services.
Disclosures of sexual misconduct are erupting week by week at posts across the nation. At Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, 28 instructors are under investigation for sexual misconduct; in November, two drill sergeants were discharged and given prison terms for illegal sex with nine female recruits.
At Fort Jackson, near Columbia, S.C., 64 people have been punished for sexual misconduct, including three rapes, occurring in the last two years. At Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio in December, two sergeants were jailed and five were disciplined for sexual transgressions with trainees on trips to Mexico to celebrate the completion of training.
Summoned before the Senate Armed Services Committee to testify about the scandal at the training grounds, Army Secretary Togo D. West Jr. assured the committee that the Army was pursuing a "zero tolerance" policy against sexual harassment.
But critics fault the Army's culture and structure for the scope of the problem. Harassment cases under an officer's command can hinder chances of advancement, and Army officials appear to be particularly hostile to complaints of abuse.
"At some posts, they are not reporting the rapes," said Susan Barnes, a military law attorney in Denver. Post commanders "don't want those statistics," she said.
Another problem, critics say, is that the Army chaplains to whom soldiers can take complaints have become hard to find because their numbers have shrunk with budget cuts. At Aberdeen, the sole chaplain had been reassigned to a teaching job.
Women's groups also say the Army has made only perfunctory efforts to tackle the problem. They note that Secretary West's anti harassment task force, like those of his predecessors, is made up almost entirely of senior and retired Army men and women who rose through the ranks of the institution they managed and are now investigating. On Feb. 3, Gene C. McKinney, the Sergeant Major of the Army, which makes him the service's top noncommissioned officer, resigned from the task force in the face of charges by a senior aide that he had sexually assaulted her in a Hawaii hotel room.
What is reported to have occurred at Aberdeen, while apparently extreme, illustrates the difficulty the Army has long had in dealing with allegations of sexual misconduct.
Prosecutors here have accused one sergeant of a striking number of abuses: Over the last two years, they say, Staff Sgt. Delmar G. Simpson raped 10 women, 5 of them more than once, until just before he was suspended, on Sept. 6. Sergeant Simpson, whose court-martial begins in April, has not entered a plea.
One reason the women did not complain, post attorneys say, is that Sergeant Simpson's company commander, Capt. Derrick Robertson, was also preying on the trainees. The captain, who has also not entered a plea, is to be tried on rape charges in March.
Representative Jane Harman, a California Democrat who is a member of a House subcommittee investigating sexual misconduct in the armed forces, said the Aberdeen cases suggested that Army anti-harassment programs "may not have accomplished much of anything at all."
Evidently, they accomplished little in Aberdeen, where officers say the surge of assaults was news to them.
"How come we're just finding out?" asked Capt. Craig A. Minnick, a lawyer at the post. "Why did not someone report it? There is a disconnect somewhere. The Army is trying to figure out where that disconnect is."

The Army
Women Play A Bigger Role
The Army is shrinking, but women are playing a much larger role. Six years ago, women made up 10 percent of a total uniformed force of 706,000. Today, woman represent 14 percent of a force of 495,000. And their numbers are likely to keep rising: they make up 20 percent of the Army's youngest soldiers, the trainees.
As women have spread through the service, the Army has maintained that sexual assault, though real enough, is no worse than in civilian life.
So far through the 1990's, the Army's public affairs office reports, soldiers have been submitting an average of 500 formal charges of sexual misconduct a year, representing well under 1 percent of the women in uniform each year.
But after the first report from Aberdeen, the Army's Criminal Investigation Command opened a hot line to let women to buck the chain of command and make their complaints directly. After only 12 weeks, the command recorded almost 7,000 calls, including 1,074 allegations of sexual abuse that it deemed legitimate enough to pursue.
The Defense Department also had ample signs of trouble in surveys of service members in 1988 and 1995. In July, when it announced its findings from the more recent survey, the top command seemed cheered. Though 64 percent of 20,000 women surveyed in 1988 had said they had received unwanted sexual attention in the previous year, that number dropped to 55 percent of the 90,000 surveyed in 1995. "Sexual harassment in the active-duty military is declining," the press releases began.
But an analysis of the survey results, compiled in December by the Pentagon's Defense Manpower Data Center and George Washington University, struck more somber notes.
Among other things, it found that most women kept their complaints to themselves, in many cases because they thought nothing would be done. Of those who did report harassment, 56 percent said that they had been urged to drop the complaint or had not been taken seriously, that their supervisor had received the report with hostility or that no action had been taken.
Just 27 percent said the person harassing them had been counseled to stop or had been transferred. One-fifth of the women said they believed that they had received a lower performance rating as a result of complaining.
The analysis showed entrenched and systemic harassment in the other services, too. But Army women had the lowest expectations that the leadership would intervene.
Army women also reported the smallest decline in abuse.

The Accusers
Two Careers End In Abuse Claims
Stephanie Calender, 41, who spent a long career on active duty and in the reserves and the Michigan National Guard, said her last skirmish happened in the guard, where she was a full-time technician and a specialist fourth class.
One day four years ago, she said, she was standing in a formation in the at-ease position, with her hands clasped behind her.
"The sergeant behind me pulled my hands onto his crotch area," she said. "He was very drunk. I walked out of the formation very quickly because he was coming after me. The platoon officer, a second lieutenant, ordered me back. They were all laughing."
Incensed, Ms. Calender went to her commanding officer, a woman. "She told me to drop it," Ms. Calender said. The top command in Lansing " 'will retaliate against you,' " Ms. Calender quoted the officer as saying. Ms. Calender has quit the guard and moved to California.
Jessica Bleckley, 18, is solidly built, 5 feet 3 inches tall and 134 pounds, with a firm jaw, dark blond hair and blue eyes. She joined the Army straight out of high school in Belton, S.C., and did basic training at Fort Leonard Wood. She was sent to Aberdeen last spring and assigned to Charlie Company in the 143d Ordnance Battalion.
In interviews here before she was granted an honorable discharge at the end of January, Ms. Bleckley said that on or about May 18, a drill sergeant in her company, Nathaneal Beach, had been spending the night in the barracks.
"My roommate was asleep," she said. "He said I had to go down to his office." She said Sergeant Beach had induced her to have illegal sexual intercourse in his office -- not actual rape, she said, but she said she had thought she had to acquiesce. It is against military rules for superior officers to fraternize with their charges.
After a month, she found someone in whom she could confide -- Staff Sgt. Ophelia Webb, one of the school's seven women among 39 drill sergeants. Sergeant Webb helped drive the complaint up the chain of command.
Then one day, Ms. Bleckley was sent to Alpha Company to copy some papers and ran into Sergeant Simpson. She said he had ordered her into an office latrine and had told her to have sex with him on the floor. "When he got through," she said, "he was like: 'Get out. Don't get in my face.' "
The harassment took a twist in November, after the Army reported the first allegations of abuses at Aberdeen and Ms. Bleckley was the only accuser to come forward publicly.
"Most people don't talk to me," she said. "They can't believe I said something because it draws negative attention to the Army. They say I asked for it. I wanted it. I didn't say no."
In classes on subjects like stress management and family abuse, she said, the discussion always turned to her. "We could be talking about inflation," she said. "But every meeting we have turns into a conversation about me." In one class, she said, someone asked, " 'How many of you joined the Army to talk to Diane Sawyer?' I hate it."
On Jan. 24, Ms. Bleckley was taken to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, after what she describes as a suicide attempt. She was granted an honorable discharge.

The Accused
A Training Officer Awaits Trial
Sgt. Delmar G. Simpson, 31, sits in the Marine Corps jail in Quantico, Va., awaiting a court-martial starting April 8. He grew up in Richburg, S.C., the fourth of five children brought up by his mother, Edna Simpson, after her husband's death, when Sergeant Simpson was 7.
Townspeople describe a tall, thin, well-mannered youth and a hard-striving student and athlete.
Douglas Harrison, his science teacher and basketball coach, said, "He didn't have a whole lot of ability, but he worked hard."
Mrs. Simpson, 60, a retired cook, said her son was disciplined and neither smoked nor drank. She is bringing up a son of Sergeant Simpson's who is 14. He also has a daughter in Texas, friends say, and is married to a woman who lives in Virginia.
Mrs. Simpson said she was confident about his innocence. In a recent telephone chat with her son, she said, "He said he didn't do it, and he ain't worrying about it."
Sergeant Simpson spent six years at Fort Hood in Texas before going to Fort Jackson for drill-instructor training and then, in January 1995, to Aberdeen. At Fort Hood, "he always stayed sharp," said Staff Sgt. Randolph Stevens. Of the sexual abuse allegations, he said, "I never saw any evidence of anything like that here."
But in Aberdeen, post officials say Sergeant Simpson was reprimanded and transferred to another company after poking and berating a woman in training. Now he faces a long list of charges. Of 26 women who have submitted formal allegations against Sergeant Simpson, 10 allege rape. One accuses him of "grabbing the hair on the back of her head and jerking her head back" and of threatening to "knock your teeth out." Among other charges are larceny -- the theft of one recruit's gold necklace and another's watch.
Sergeant Simpson declined to be interviewed. His Army lawyer, Capt. Edward W. Brady, suggested that the accusations were false or overdrawn. "When the facts and the evidence are presented in a court of law and not the court of public opinion," he said, "they will speak for themselves."
Whatever the outcome for Sergeant Simpson, it will be some time before the Aberdeen Proving Ground can settle down.
"There's a high probability," said Lieut. Col. Gabriel Riesco, the school's chief of staff, "there will be more people charged."

HEADLINE: The Dollar Declines, Then Recovers, in Tokyo

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Feb. 10

 BODY:
The dollar rebounded from a sharp selloff at the opening of Asian trading today as traders looked beyond the weekend decision of the Group of Seven industrialized nations to end their two-year campaign to strengthen the American currency.
Traders said that the dollar continued to draw buyers because interest rates in the United States are much higher than in Japan and Germany, making the returns on dollar-denominated deposits and fixed-income assets more attractive to investors. 
 "The major reason for a strong dollar and a weak yen is the rate gap," Makoto Sato, foreign-exchange manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said. "If currencies were to stabilize, the best strategy is to buy one of the highest-yielding currencies."
In Tokyo in late afternoon trading, the dollar was quoted at 122.81 Japanese yen, after falling as low as 120.35 yen. In New York late Friday, the dollar ended at 122.60 yen after a selloff that followed comments by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's that were taken to suggest that the United States had finished its effort to raise the currency's value.
The dollar also pared its losses today against the German mark. In late afternoon trading in Tokyo, it was quoted at 1.6495 marks, up from the 1.6345 marks it touched earlier this morning but down from 1.6568 marks in New York on Friday.
Japanese stocks, meanwhile, rose sharply during the afternoon trading session. At the end of the day, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 314.13 points, or 1.76 percent, to 18,181.17. Analysts attributed the surge to investor hopes for strong Japanese corporate earnings.
The dollar slipped at the opening of Asian trading after finance ministers and central bank governors in the Group of Seven, meeting in Berlin over the weekend, issued a statement saying that "major misalignments" in foreign exchange markets that the group noted in April 1995 "have been corrected."
When Group of Seven members -- the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- met in the spring of 1995, they called for an "orderly reversal" of the dollar's decline to a postwar low of 79.75 yen set in April 1995 and a record low of 1.3455 marks in March 1995.
A day before the Group of Seven's latest meeting, the dollar reached a 32-month high of 1.6751 marks and a four-year high of 124.75 yen. That was a gain of more than 7 percent against the yen and the mark since the beginning of this year. Group members suggested that they did not want the dollar to keep rising at such a rapid pace.
"We reaffirmed our views that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals and that excessive volatility is undesirable," the Group of Seven said in a release Saturday.
Traders said economic fundamentals still suggested the dollar should not fall much. Though the Group of Seven statement "slows the speed of the dollar's rise," said Yukihiko Hashimoto, foreign-exchange manager at Sanwa Bank, "people will continue to park their money in the U.S."

HEADLINE: Netanyahu and Arafat Say Peace Talks Are on Track

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 10

 BODY:
The Israeli and Palestinian leaders met today in what both described as a "constructive" meeting and agreed to start detailed talks next Sunday on further steps in carrying out their peace agreements.
The meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasir Arafat, the head of the Palestinian Authority, was held at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip. It was meant to fulfill various aspects of the agreement reached last month on the Israeli troop withdrawal from most of Hebron. 
 The meeting was delayed for several days by the disastrous collision of two Israeli military helicopters last Tuesday, in which 73 lives were lost. Mourning for the soldiers has overshadowed all other Israeli affairs since then, but today's meeting marked the resumption of intensive domestic and foreign activity.
In southern Lebanon today, Party of God guerrillas attacked an Israeli patrol, wounding seven soldiers. According to reports from Lebanon, the guerrillas fired anti-tank rockets, hitting one Israeli tank.
Israel retaliated with rocket fire against suspected guerrilla bases.
The attacks, coming on the heels of last week's disaster, are bound to fan the growing debate in Israel over whether the country should unilaterally withdraw its troops from the nine-mile-wide buffer zone that it has maintained in Lebanon for 11 years.
On Saturday, senior politicians from both major parties met with former intelligence officials to discuss such a move. The group included Yossi Beilin, a leading member of the opposition Labor Party; Michael Eitan, parliamentary whip for the governing Likud Party; Yisrael Harel, a leader of West Bank settlers, and two former senior officials of the Shin Bet intelligence service, Gideon Ezra and Yaacov Perry.
While no details of the discussion have emerged, the very fact that the meeting took place attracted considerable attention.
Mr. Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai rejected a withdrawal from the buffer zone, arguing that Israel must first stabilize its northern border and that any pullback should take place in the context of a peace agreement with Syria.
But with guerrillas attacking ever more effectively, the possibility of a unilateral withdrawal was certain to remain prominent. The Party of God, a Shiite Muslim group supported by Syria and Iran, has insisted that its only goal is to drive Israel out of Lebanon. But many Israelis remain wary of allowing Lebanese militias to approach the Israeli border.
Mr. Netanyahu will travel to Washington on Wednesday for a brief visit, which is expected to focus on reviving negotiations with Syria. The visit will include Mr. Netanyahu's first meeting with Madeleine K. Albright since she became Secretary of State.
The meeting with Mr. Arafat today was intended in part to confirm before the visit to Washington that the Israeli-Palestinian agreements reached through American mediation last month were on track.
Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat agreed that their representatives would settle down to work next Sunday on provisions for a safe-passage route between Gaza and the West Bank and a port and airport for the Gaza Strip, as well as various security, social and economic issues.
On Tuesday, Mr. Netanyahu is expected to honor one of his commitments by releasing 22 Palestinian women held in Israeli detention. Under the second of the Israeli-Palestinian agreements known as the Oslo accords, signed in September 1995, the women were supposed to have been released immediately, but President Ezer Weizman balked at pardoning two women who had been convicted of killing Israelis, and the rest of the prisoners refused to be freed without them.
This time, the release might be postponed again by a suit brought by several Israelis asking the Supreme Court to block it.
Dore Gold, Mr. Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser, said today's meeting with Mr. Arafat had been attended by Foreign Minister David Levy, who is taking a more active role in the new round of negotiations, and Mr. Arafat's deputy, Abu Mazen.
Mr. Gold said both sides had raised various complaints. He said Mr. Netanyahu had protested that the Palestinian Authority was releasing from detention Islamic militants believed by Israel to have been involved in terrorist attacks and that the authority was opening offices in East Jerusalem in violation of the Oslo agreements. They bar the authority from operating in Jerusalem until the final status of the city has been resolved in negotiations.
The Palestinians envision East Jerusalem as the capital of future state, but Israel, which captured it in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, claims it as part of its own undivided capital.
Palestinian demands, Mr. Gold said, focused on financial issues.
The meeting lasted an hour and 40 minutes. "Each side brought up its grievances, issues that troubled him, and we found ways in an atmosphere of cooperation to resolve them," Mr. Netanyahu said afterward. "I think it was an important conversation, and I thank the Foreign Minister, the Chairman and his deputy for this cooperation that will surely be continued throughout the talks between Israel and the Palestinians."

HEADLINE: PRIVATE VENTURES HOPE FOR PROFITS ON SPY SATELLITES

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
Commercial spy satellites are about to let anyone with a credit card peer down from the heavens into the compounds of dictators or the backyards of neighbors with high fences.
The first satellite is scheduled to fly into orbit in April or May, another in December and perhaps a dozen in all during the next decade. The launchings will end a monopoly that advanced nations held for nearly four decades in orbital espionage. 
 Rivaling military spy craft in the sharpness of their photos, the new American-made satellites are designed to see objects on the ground as small as a yard or so in diameter -- cars and hot tubs, for example.
While the new craft pose knotty security and privacy questions, their builders tend to play down such issues and instead pledge to aid cartography, law enforcement, oil exploration, disaster relief and urban planning, among other things.
"The possibilities are endless," says a brochure from Earthwatch Inc. of Longmont, Colo., which is first in line to send up the new satellites. "Vacationers will plan exotic sailing cruises along foreign coasts. Small retail businesses will have a better understanding of demographics."
Images are expected to cost as little as a few hundred dollars each, depending on whether an order can be filled from company archives or requires a satellite to turn a camera on a new part of the Earth.
The Clinton Administration approved this commercial use of spy technology in 1994 to help aerospace companies facing post-cold-war contractions and to challenge foreign rivals in the emerging industry of civilian surveillance from space. Today, much of the American activity involves gear and contractors that once were, or still are, part of the sprawling Government complex for military espionage, as well as former Federal officials.
While Federal and private experts have quietly discussed the shift for years, the actual debut of a fleet of commercial spy satellites is expected to prompt wide debate over the new industry's promise and peril for nations and individuals.
"The biggest market for this information is going to be foreign governments that can't afford their own reconnaissance systems," said Albert D. Wheelon, the former Central Intelligence Agency official who helped shape the nation's early spy-satellite program.
"The issue is going to heat up the first time we get a real crunch between two friends, like Pakistan and India," he added. "Right now, we have an incomplete policy. I don't think the Government thought through the issues thoroughly enough."
Analysts say the implications of the shift will probably take decades to sort out politically, militarily and perhaps legally, in court cases involving possible invasions of privacy.
Over all, they add, the subject is exceedingly complex and ill suited to blanket condemnation or praise.
"It's bad because it's going to give countries like Libya and North Korea reconnaissance capabilities like those of the United States," said John E. Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington. "But it's good because it's going to significantly improve the ability of citizens to monitor governments."
Federal officials say that the risks and benefits were carefully weighed before the 1994 decision and that economic gains will offset military or diplomatic losses. A vibrant economy, they say, is one of the most important elements of national security.
To date, the Commerce Department, which coordinates control of the private work, has issued licenses to nine United States companies, some with foreign partners, for 11 different classes of satellites, which have a range of reconnaissance powers.
The total number of spy-class satellites that will reach orbit is hard to predict, but experts say at least a half-dozen are likely to be introduced in the next two or three years.
"Soon these won't just be applications on paper," said Michael Mignogno, head of licensing coordination at the Commerce Department. "They'll be real assets in the sky."
Makers of the satellites say the market for space photos might eventually reach billions of dollars annually. And contrary to critics who worry about aiding war, they say the field is likely to bring about a new age of peacefulness.
"We have a chance to change the world," said Douglas B. Gerrull, president of Earthwatch, which has four satellites in the works. "The basic premise is that the more people know, the safer we are. Dictators will realize they can't move their troops without somebody knowing about it."
Military spying from orbit began in 1960, when the United States launched the world's first reconnaissance satellite. Over the decades, only a few countries have had the wealth and skill to achieve their own espionage from the high ground of space.
The photographs were fuzzy at first but grew increasingly sharp, until they could reveal objects at least as small as a football.
The visual power of spy craft is usually expressed as the length, in meters, of the smallest feature that analysts can see when photo processing is pushed to the limit. For a camera that can show a football, the resolution is about one foot, or one-third of a meter.
In the early 1970's, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration launched a civil satellite known as Landsat, the first to near the military's surveillance realm. With a resolution of about 100 meters, or 109 yards, its cameras were able to show things no smaller than wheat fields, ice floes and general land formations.
The Landsats evolved to show images of features as small as 30 meters, or 33 yards. But the Defense Department blocked further progress as a security threat.
In the mid-1980's, the French Government moved to the edge of the espionage realm with its civilian Spot satellites, which had a resolution of 10 meters, about 11 yards, and could aid urban planning and the reconnaissance of large military targets, like warships.
In 1987, Moscow began selling photos with a resolution of five meters. The imagery, from spy operations, was limited geographically and badly out of date. But it prompted fears in Washington of foreign rivals.
In 1992, the Russians raised the ante by beginning to sell old imagery with a resolution of two meters -- good enough to see planes, tanks and troop movements.
The Bush Administration responded by easing American regulatory barriers. In early 1993, it granted a license for a commercial craft with three-meter resolution.
The Clinton Administration's 1994 decision was the most dramatic step, giving the go-ahead for craft with a resolution of slightly less than one meter, images unambiguously in the heart of the spy zone.
Today, the rules let American companies photograph anything from space and sell the fresh imagery on the open market. But the Government retains the right to switch off the companies' cameras in time of war or international tensions, a plan known as shutter control.
The Federal Government also has the right to screen and limit the American companies' foreign customers. Nations likely to be denied access to the imagery include Iraq, Libya, Cuba and North Korea. But private experts say front companies will probably evade export prohibitions, as they have repeatedly done for nuclear, chemical, biological and missile technologies.
Today the change of Federal policy is aiding some of the Pentagon's most experienced contractors. For instance, the Eastman Kodak Company, an important maker of cameras for Government espionage, is hard at work for the commercial spy companies as well.
In the vanguard of the new industry is Earthwatch. With about 200 employees, it is building two satellites with three-meter resolution, and two with one-meter resolution. The first is to soar aloft from Siberia in April or May, atop a Russian rocket. Its corporate partners include Ball Aerospace and Technologies Group, owned by the Ball Corporation, and Hitachi Ltd. of Japan.
Earthwatch draws on the innovations of the Pentagon's anti-missile program, which has spent more than $30 billion to find ways to spot and destroy rising rockets and warheads from space.
The giant of the fledgling field is Space Imaging Inc., based in Thornton, Colo. The private company is owned by the Lockheed Martin Corporation, which makes many of the military's spy satellites, and E-Systems Inc., a unit of the Raytheon Company that provides many of their communication links.
Space Imaging is building two satellites with one-meter resolution, the first of which is scheduled to blast skyward on an American rocket in December from California.
The president of Space Imaging is Jeffrey K. Harris, who from 1994 to 1996 directed the National Reconnaissance Office, the secretive Federal group that builds and runs the Government's spy satellites.
"I'm confident we're on a path to being quite successful," he said in an interview.
Other companies pursuing the work include the Boeing Company, Motorola Inc. and the Orbital Sciences Corporation, a company in Dulles, Va., that wants to have a one-meter satellite aloft by 1999.
The initiatives have sparked rival efforts beyond American business. For instance, NASA is preparing to send up two reconnaissance satellites -- Lewis, with five-meter resolution, and Clark, with three-meter resolution. NASA plans to share the imagery with American students.
And foreign governments with the wherewithal are scrambling to enter the commercial fray. The Indian Government last year began selling five-meter imagery, currently the best that is timely. By 1999, it hopes to have a new satellite that will yield 2.5-meter imagery.
"The genie is out of the bottle," said Christopher Simpson, an expert on space reconnaissance at American University in Washington. In March, he plans to hold a conference on how news and nongovernmental organizations can use the imagery.
Dr. Wheelon, who was the C.I.A.'s deputy director for science and technology in the 1960's, said the new trend threatened to lessen the value of the diplomatic currency of military spy photos, which the United States shares with such allies as Australia, Canada, Israel and Britain.
And, he said, Governmental shutter control over the new cameras would most likely prove awkward or futile because Washington would be unlikely to always know ahead of time when censorship might be in the best interests of the United States.
Civil libertarians also foresee knotty problems. They say that courts weighing aerial-photography cases have steadily eroded privacy protections and that the new technologies threaten to further the trend.
But many experts say the new surveillance age, though laden with problems, is probably good over all because it plays to American strengths and against totalitarian governments.
"We fought the cold war to prove that open-information societies are better than closed ones," said Joanne Gabrynowicz, a lawyer in space policy studies at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. "We can't stop now."

To the Editor
George F. Kennan's views on North Atlantic Treaty Organization expansion (Op-Ed, Feb. 5) deserved the exposure you afforded them. One wishes his sober warning that expansion "would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold war era" had influenced your editorial of the same day to move beyond just having "qualms" about the Clinton Administration's plans to expand NATO. 
 What Eastern Europe and the former Soviet states need first and foremost is economic help through a lowering of trade barriers and European Union expansions. The Marshall Plan's approach to rebuilding Germany should be our model, not beggaring these countries by substituting a nuclear umbrella for economic alliance.

Bonds Mixed As New Issues Are Awaited

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday as the dollar weakened and traders prepared for new supply coming to market as well as fresh economic data later this week.
The 30-year bond fell 1/32, to a price of 97 15/32; its yield held to 6.70 percent, unchanged from Friday. 
 The five-year note was unchanged for a price of 100 14/32 to yield 6.15 percent; the 10-year note rose 1/32, to 100 25/32, yielding 6.39 percent.
Traders traced the market's early selloff to the dollar's decline, after representatives of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, meeting over the weekend, declared a victory in a two-year campaign to bolster the dollar.
Investors initially sold off, taking the statement to mean that the dollar was near its top and could soon weaken. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more valuable to foreign investors because of potential gains in currency translation.
Downward pressure on prices also came from dealers and traders preparing for this week's supply of new Government debt as the Treasury begins its quarterly refunding starting with today's sale of $17.75 billion in new three-year notes.
The refunding continues with tomorrow's sale of $12 billion of 10-year notes, and Thursday's sale of $10 billion of 30-year bonds. In when-issued trading the three-year maturity was offered at a price to yield 6 percent, the 10-year at 6.37 percent, and the 30-year at 6.64 percent.
David Shabelman, an analyst with MMS International in San Francisco, called the new supply the market's major concern this week. The most significant data will be in reports on retail sales, producer prices and industrial production. "But Thursday could be the toughest day of the week, with both retail sales and the 30-year bond auction," he said.
Interest rates at the weekly bill auction were mixed. The three-month bill averaged 5.02 percent, up two basis points from last week's auction, while the six-month bill was down a basis point, to 5.07 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The selling by investors was less aggressive than anticipated, with some short-covering by traders who were looking for only a small decline in the long bond. Short-sellers sell borrowed Treasury securities on the premise that if the market declines they can later buy back the securities at a lower price, pocketing the difference as profit. But if prices rise, they can incur big losses.
Patrick R. Dimick, Treasury market analyst at UBS Securities, said he saw a lot of price action overnight, with the statement by the Group of Seven validating concerns that had arisen Friday that there would be a coordinated effort to stem the dollar's rise. Treasury securities dropped after the first hint that the United States had decided the dollar had risen far enough.
"But traders began to think about the G-7 in different terms, that the intent was not to weaken the dollar but to slow its ascent," Mr. Dimick said. "If that was the case, then the selloff was an overreaction."
The following are the results of yesterday's three-month and six-month Treasury bill auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	 	Average Price	98.731	97.437	Discounted Rate	5.02%	5.07%	Coupon Yield	5.16%	5.28%	High Price	98.739	97.442	Discounted Rate	4.99%	5.06%	Coupon Yield	5.12%	5.26%	Low Price	98.731	97.432	Discounted Rate	5.02%	5.08%	Coupon Yield	5.16%	5.29%	Accepted at low price	23%	9%	Total applied for	$60,487,775	$50,378,027	Accepted	$13,087,295	$13,204,489	Noncompetitive	$1,423,573	$1,289,505	

Both issues are dated Feb. 13, 1997. The three-month bills mature on May 15, 1997, and the six-month bills mature on Aug. 14, 1997.

Dollar Ends Little Changed After Wide One-Day Swing

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled and then rebounded to end little changed yesterday in the aftermath of a weekend meeting of global finance officials that suggested that the dollar's prolonged rally was over.
It was one of the widest one-day swings in the dollar since the currency began its ascent from postwar lows against the Japanese yen and German mark nearly two years ago. 
 "There was a lot of scrambling on the downside, and a lot of scrambling back up," said Gary Sakamoto, vice president of foreign exchange at the New York branch of the National Australia Bank. "You see a lot of people licking their wounds today."
In intraday dealings, the dollar fell as low as 120.50 yen, more than 4 yen cheaper than its four-year intraday high of 124.70 yen reached on Friday, before settling in New York at 122.78 yen, up from 122.60 yen on Friday.
The dollar fell as low as 1.6350 marks in intraday trading, down sharply from a 32-month intraday high of 1.6750 marks Friday, before settling in New York at 1.6560 marks, down from 1.6568 Friday. The British pound rose to $1.6407 from $1.6399.
The main force that initially drove the dollar lower was a widespread expectation that the currency would fall sharply when global trading resumed yesterday, after financial leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and the United States said on Saturday that misalignments in foreign-exchange rates had been corrected.
The statement was viewed as meaning that central bankers of the so-called Group of Seven were uncomfortable with a further appreciation of the dollar. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's suggestion on Friday of a shift in United States foreign exchange policy also weighed on the dollar.
But buyers emerged as the dollar reached levels deemed attractive, and sellers who had speculated on a short-term correction were forced to buy dollars to minimize their losses.
Moreover, many traders said there were underlying fundamental reasons for a further strengthening of the dollar against the yen and mark, which are restrained by low interest rates and economic weakness in Japan and Germany. The United States, by contrast, is benefiting from a moderately growing economy and benign inflation.

Tokyo Stocks Rise by 1.8% After New Accord on Dollar

 BODY:
The Tokyo stock market rose 1.8 percent yesterday in the first day of trading since a group of the world's richest countries agreed to end efforts to raise the value of the dollar, a move that could hurt the earnings of Japan's big exporters.
In Frankfurt, shares rose to a record for the sixth consecutive session as the dollar made up some of the ground it lost earlier in the day. 
 The Nikkei index of 225 stocks, the benchmark indicator of the Tokyo market, gained 314.13 points, or 1.8 percent, to 18,181.17. With a Japanese national holiday scheduled for today, trading volume was moderate.
The rise in share prices was spurred in part by a report in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the Japanese financial newspaper, that the Honda Motor Company would report earnings for the current fiscal year that were higher than expected. A statement by the Finance Minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, that big Japanese banks would receive financial assistance if they faced financial uncertainties, also lifted the market.
Prices rose despite a sharp decline in the dollar since Friday's trading in Tokyo. The dollar, which has been rising strongly all year, did an about-face beginning on Friday afternoon when Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin gave a broad hint that the United States had ended its two-year effort to strengthen the dollar. The next day, at a meeting in Berlin of the Group of Seven major industrial nations, finance ministers from other countries endorsed the shift in the American stance.
Before Mr. Rubin made his comments, the dollar had jumped about 38 percent against the yen and 20 percent against the mark since last year. Its strength has meant that exports from other countries, including Japan and Germany, to the United States have become less expensive for American buyers. That is also true regarding shipments to countries whose currencies are pegged to the dollar.
At the same time, exports from the United States have grown more expensive.
The help for exports has been welcomed by Japan and Germany, which are facing severe strains on their economies.
On Friday, shortly before Mr. Rubin met with reporters, the dollar traded at a four-year high of 124.75 yen. It fell sharply on the heels of his comments, however.
In early Tokyo trading yesterday, the dollar touched the 120-yen mark before recovering to end the day at around 123.20 yen. That was above the currency's level of 122.60 yen in New York late Friday. By late yesterday in New York, the American currency stood at 122.78 yen.
Stocks in Tokyo might have been expected to decline yesterday because of the help the dollar's surge has given Japanese exporters. Last week, for example, the Sony Corporation said earnings doubled in its fiscal third quarter, largely because foreign sales rose on the back of the strong dollar.
That share prices rose, analysts and economists said, was an indication that market participants did not expect the yen to strengthen a great deal against the dollar as long as the Japanese economy remained weak and the American economy continued its steady expansion.
"I don't think people see the yen's gains continuing," Bloomberg News quoted Masaharu Tsubouchi, the head of equity trading for the Cosmo Securities Company in Osaka, as saying. "There's no indication that the domestic economy is picking up."
A rebound in the Japanese economy might draw more foreign investment into the local financial markets, lending support to the yen.
Honda's shares rose about 4.3 percent after Nihon Keizai said the auto maker's net income would triple in the year ending March 31. The report helped raise the stock of other big exporters.
Still, traders noted that the market's gain was limited, as investors in stocks kept an eye on foreign-exchange activity.
In Frankfurt yesterday, the weighted DAX index of 30 blue-chip stocks rose 46.35 points, or 1.5 percent, to 3,184.36 in the official floor trading session -- the daily session that is followed by electronic trading.
The dollar was fixed at 1.6536 marks. Although that was down from its level of 1.6568 marks in New York late Friday -- and well below the level of 1.6751 marks it reached on Friday before Mr. Rubin spoke -- it was up a bit from the American currency's level earlier in the day. In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.6560 marks.
"The market is up today because of the dollar," said Jurgen Scharnowske, head of equities and bonds at Rabo Bank (Deutschland) A.G. in Frankfurt, referring to stock activity, Bloomberg reported.

HEADLINE: Vote Delayed On Measure To Balance The Budget

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Afraid that they do not have the votes for approval, House Republican leaders decided today to postpone at least until next month further action on a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget.
The decision is the latest indication that adoption of the proposed amendment is in serious doubt. It would require approval by two-thirds of those voting in the House and Senate and then ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures. 
 The House Judiciary Committee, which was scheduled to vote on the measure on Tuesday, announced today that the meeting had been canceled.
Sam Stratman, the committee's spokesman, said the leaders wanted to wait until the Senate voted, hoping that approval there would give the measure momentum in the House.
But approval in the Senate is by no means a certainty.
Debate began on the Senate floor last week, but no vote is scheduled. Senate leaders from both parties agree that the outcome there hinges on the votes of four freshman Democrats who have not announced their positions.
The Senate voted 64 to 35 today to reject a proposal by Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, that would have allowed the balanced budget requirement to be waived by a simple majority vote in times of serious economic problems.
The proposed amendment would require that the Federal budget be balanced by 2002 or two years after ratification by the states, whichever came later. The requirement could be overridden only by three-fifths' majorities in the House and Senate.
An almost identical measure was approved in the House in 1995 by a vote of 300 to 132, 12 votes more than the two-thirds needed. But the amendment was rejected by one vote in the Senate.
Almost all Republicans in Congress support the amendment, and most Democrats oppose it. President Clinton is strenuously opposed.
The proposed amendment has been a central part of Republican doctrine for years. Republicans argue that it would provide the discipline elected politicians need to reduce Government spending.
Democratic opponents counter that it would clutter the Constitution unnecessarily, make recessions worse and threaten Social Security benefits.
The immediate problem faced by Republican leaders in the House was the possibility that the Judiciary Committee would adopt a Democratic substitute that would require a balanced budget but exclude Social Security from the calculations.
The substitute is a political tactic designed to kill the constitutional amendment, not a serious attempt to balance the budget.
Many lawmakers, especially those who represent large numbers of retirees, see votes that seem to threaten Social Security benefits as political poison pills.
Polls show that the public favors a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget by a large margin. But most people say they would oppose such an amendment if it would lead to lower Social Security benefits.
Republicans have a majority on the Judiciary Committee of 20 to 15. This means that if three Republicans vote for the Democratic amendment, the panel will pass it.
One, Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, has already said he will vote for it. Staff assistants who have been keeping track of how members intend to vote on the Social Security question say Republican leaders could not count today on the votes of several other Republican Representatives on the panel, including Elton Gallegly of California, Charles T. Canady of Florida and Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia.
As a practical matter, adoption of the Social Security measure would make it impossible to show a balanced budget by early in the next century. The latest Congressional Budget Office figures show that lawmakers would have to find an additional $465 billion in savings in the next five years to offset the surplus in Social Security accounts.
Mr. Stratman, the Judiciary Committee spokesman, said Republican leaders still expected to prevail on the amendment.
But other Republicans who asked not to be identified said that an important reason for having the Senate vote first was that if the measure was rejected there, Republicans in the House would be spared a difficult vote on Social Security.
Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said tonight that the decision to cancel Tuesday's meeting was "strong evidence that supporters are in trouble both on and off the committee."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Persecuting The Christians

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Some columns can be postponed for more important topics, some put off until they seem newsier and many dropped because they do not flesh out. But some have to be written as soon as information is collected, no matter how late.
This column is late, not because so much has been written about the subject and everybody knows, but for exactly the opposite reason. 
 A few journalists have written about the persecution of Christians in Communist or religious dictatorships. A few legislators have risen to protest. A few clergymen and their religious organizations try to arouse congregations.
But astonishingly few, compared not only with the spread of the persecution, but what could be done to fight it, if the political, religious, business and press leaders of the world had the will and courage.
The following few paragraphs sum it up:
"Millions of American Christians pray in their churches each week, oblivious to the fact that Christians in many parts of the world suffer brutal torture, arrest, imprisonment and even death -- their homes and communities laid waste -- for no other reason than that they are Christians. The shocking untold story of our time is that more Christians have died this century simply for being Christians than in the first nineteen centuries after the birth of Christ. They have been persecuted and martyred before an unknowing, indifferent world and a largely silent Christian community.
"Eleven countries where Christians are currently enduring great religious persecution are China, Sudan, Pakistan, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Egypt, Nigeria, Cuba, Laos and Uzbekistan. . . . They evidence a worldwide trend of anti-Christian persecution based on two political ideologies -- Communism and militant Islam."
These passages are from "In the Lion's Den" -- as in the Book of Daniel: "My God sent his angel and he shut the mouths of the lions" -- by Nina Shea, director of the Puebla Program of Freedom House, and is published by Broadman and Holman (1-800-233-1123).
Too briefly, but to be returned to another day:
In the Sudan it is a pogrom. The Islamic militant Government has bombed and burned Christian villages, taken Christian children as slaves and tortured Christian worshipers and their priests.
In Saudi Arabia, that great ally of the U.S., no public expression of Christianity or any religion but Islam is permitted. No Bibles, no crosses except those smuggled and used on pain of arrest and torture. The price of conversion to Christianity is death.
In China, thousands of Roman Catholic and Protestant Chinese are imprisoned -- more than in any country in the world -- for holding worship, preaching or distributing Bibles without permission.
Like other Communist or Islamist states, China is an equal-opportunity persecutor. It makes life as nasty as possible in Buddhist Tibet.
If I were Christian I would complain that Christian leaders, political, religious and business, around the world have failed in their obligations to fight oppression of their co-religionists. I am complaining anyway.
Nor do I think Jewish organizations have done nearly enough, although more are involved than I had first thought. The presidents of Jewish organizations in meetings with U.S. officials have denounced anti-Christian persecution in Islamic nations.
I hope they also get more involved against persecution in China and Tibet and that Israel shows the U.S. the path to righteousness by ending arms trade with China. It was a Jew, Michael J. Horowitz of the Hudson Institute, who screamed me awake, as he has so many Christians.
In and out of Congress, the campaign to free Soviet Jewry is being studied for lessons on how to help persecuted Christians. Some obvious lessons:
Organize congregations to pay attention, more and continuously, to co-religionists outside America. Make sure every American official meeting any Communist or Islamicist protests, and warns, every time. Fight for legislation strengthening the rights of religious refugees and use of economic pressures.
Elect senators like Specter, Nickles, Lieberman, Ashcroft and Allard, and representatives like Wolf, Smith of New Jersey, Pelosi and Gilman.
And, personal note: Once awake, don't fall asleep again.

HEADLINE: Clinton Begins Campaign for His Education Proposals

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: ANNAPOLIS, Md., Feb. 10

 BODY:
Clearly comfortable in his own tribe, President Clinton began politicking among the politicians today, starting his itinerant national campaign to create education standards and to soften changes in the welfare system by addressing a special session of the Maryland Legislature.
In the first of what aides say may be many such exhortations of state legislators, Mr. Clinton urged Maryland and other states to embrace as-yet-undeveloped national standards in reading and math. And, mocking those who attacked previous welfare laws, Mr. Clinton warned the legislators to gird for the impact of changes in the system. 
 "This welfare reform bill had this ringing declaration: Everybody who can work, everybody who's able to work, has to take responsibility for their own lives," said Mr. Clinton, who signed the bill into law. "No more permanent dependency. Full of moral precepts. Well, the morality shoe is now on the other foot.
"The challenge is primarily on you and the employer community, which is the way you said you wanted it."
But Mr. Clinton said he was willing to "jump off this cliff, to hold up this high standard."
Members of both houses of the Legislature -- overwhelmingly Democrats -- sat shoulder to shoulder on folding chairs in the House chamber for Mr. Clinton's speech. Before Mr. Clinton arrived, they sat silently when told that he would shake their hands in a receiving line after his speech. But a moment later they burst into applause at the news that the President, whose popularity is surging in the polls, would pause after his address to be photographed with each of them, preserving the moment for their constituents.
The legislators seemed thrilled to be hosts for the reigning champion of their profession. "Your presence today makes this the single most prestigious day in the history of this great institution," the House Speaker, Casper Taylor, a Democrat, said in introducing Mr. Clinton -- no mean statement about a building where George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Woodrow Wilson walked.
Famously empathetic, Mr. Clinton, a former Governor, adapted easily to this audience, perhaps because, as he noted at one point, "I've been though a zillion state legislative sessions."
But even as he took to the bully pulpit, Mr. Clinton appeared to worry about its potential limitations. "It's hard when you're not threatened by a foreign enemy to whip people up to a fever pitch of common, intense, sustained, disciplined endeavor."
In his 55-minute address, President Clinton frequently praised Maryland for already having done what he wants the states to do.
Mr. Clinton said Maryland had made a "good start" by developing standards for what children should learn by third, fifth and eighth grades. His own system would set standards for literacy in fourth grade and math in eighth grade, and he hopes to encourage all states to test against such standards by 1999.He also praised efforts by the University of Maryland in College Park to have college students tutor reading through a program similar to one he has proposed.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said that Mr. Clinton wanted to highlight states where ideas like his own were already working, before approaching less welcoming audiences. "You need to continue to make that case everywhere in the country, and there are other places where we'll have to make it in the face of those who might be opposed to some of the President's ideas," he said.
Perhaps preparing for tougher crowds, the President tried out a new defense of his education standards today, rejecting the criticism that they amounted to, as he put it, "a Federal power grab."
"That's nonsense," he said, emphasizing that the standards would be national and voluntary, not Federally mandated. "I say, from Maryland to Michigan to Montana, reading is reading and math is math," Mr. Clinton said. "No school board is in charge of algebra, and no state legislature can enact the law of physics. And it is time we started acting the way we know we should."
Mr. Clinton analyzed some of the problems that states might face as the new welfare law takes hold over the next two years. He went into some detail, urging the legislators, for example, to address the needs of "young, single men who are unemployed, who are eligible for food stamps but not welfare."
Mr. Clinton became impassioned as he tried to build support for one of his budgetary priorities, restoring welfare benefits to legal immigrants who become disabled. He offered the hypothetical example of a native of India who came to Maryland to develop computer software, stayed for three years, had two children and then faced a medical emergency without enough insurance.
"So what do we say?" Mr. Clinton asked. "Tough luck? You had misfortune? Yes, you've worked hard; yes, you've paid your taxes; yes, you've been perfectly legal; yes, you've complied with every provision of the law; yes, you didn't try to sneak in our country, you waited your turn just like everybody else. But I'm sorry."
He added: "This is wrong, folks."

HEADLINE: Clinton Aides Say That Income Gap Narrows

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
A new White House report contends that the gap between rich and poor in America appears to have stopped widening and may have reversed.
"In the last few years some signs have begun to emerge that inequality may be stabilizing and perhaps even declining slightly," President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers declared today in the annual report on the state of the economy and the Administration's approach to second-term policy-making. 
 Other reports in the last year, from the Census Bureau and the University of Michigan, have shown a widening disparity between rich and poor Americans. But the council found that the poorest 20 percent of households had the biggest income gains among the five percentile groups between 1993 and 1995.
The rise, averaging nearly 3.5 percent a year, was more than twice the gain of the top-earning group at a time when pay soared for top executives.
The council is a three-member panel headed by Joseph E. Stiglitz, who starts his new job as chief economist of the World Bank on Tuesday. Alice H. Munnell and Jeffrey Frankel, a nominee to the council, also contributed to the report, which drew on Commerce Department figures.
Still, the council cautioned that the latest figures might prove to be only a pause rather than the start of a trend.
"It is too soon to tell whether a break in the long-term trend toward greater income inequality has occurred," the report says.
The council offered little by way of explanation for the latest figures other than to imply a shift in one or more of the forces commonly cited for widened disparity: more immigrants and women in the labor market, technological developments favoring skilled workers, expansion of international trade and the "winner take all" phenomenon in which top people are paid far more than those with only slightly less ability.
Yet the report does declare that the narrowing was more than would have been predicted by a rising tide of business expansion that lifts all boats.
Social Security is the Government program that probably contributes most to reducing inequality, the panel also said, with other important factors being the earned-income tax credit and the minimum wage. The credit was made more generous in 1990 and 1993 and the minimum wage was raised in 1990 and 1996.
In the 424-page report's chapter on the labor market, the council disputed the contention of some analysts who, it said, believed that a basic change in the nature of the job market had occurred, with growth concentrated in low-paying jobs, wages falling, layoffs rising and prospects fading for long-term employment.
"These claims are exaggerated," the council said. "It is the jobs in the middle, the ones offering wages close to the median, that have become somewhat scarcer.
"Layoffs, meanwhile, are not rising: The rate of job loss has actually declined somewhat although it does appear that certain categories of workers previously less affected by job loss are now more at risk," the report said.
The council said that the Administration's economic policy "synthesizes and transcends" the polar world views of the "Panglossian" Reagan years marked by "self-sufficient individualism" and the New Deal view of "monopolistic firms despoiling the environment and exploiting the masses."
"The proper question in circumstances where a choice between government and the market arises is whether any reason exists not to rely on markets," the economists said.

HEADLINE: Ecuador's Military Code: Democracy Is Better

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, Feb. 10

 BODY:
When Rosalia Arteaga addressed Ecuadoreans for the first time as their undisputed Interim President on Sunday, her backdrop was a sea of stars and bars, representing the country's most powerful admirals and generals lined up behind her.
While the generals did not actually chose among the three claimants to the President's office, they operated behind the scenes to broker a deft solution that ushered an eccentric populist out of office, gave the Vice President her constitutional due, and set the stage for new elections next year. The outcome quelled angry street protests and stayed within the boundaries of the law. 
 Ecuador's military is regarded as among the least iron-fisted in Latin America. The quip about the military junta that ruled here until 1979 was that it was not so much a "dictadura" (dictatorship, literally "tough-speak") as a "dictablanda" ("soft-speak"). But the role it played this week reflects the way the militaries of the continent now wield their power.
They still exert a political influence that democracies in North America or Europe would find unnerving. But the current military profile in much of Latin America is far more subtle than it was in the days of strongmen in uniform and hit squads, and the military is preoccupied with assuring its own political and economic survival as an institution.
"The generals realize that military institutions do better under democracy," a diplomat here said. "They don't have to tackle the hardest questions."
Nobody claims that Latin American militaries have become branch offices of Amnesty International. In Colombia, Peru, Brazil and elsewhere, armies have been accused of brutal behavior against those who challenge the established order.
But in a series of hemispheric meetings, the armed forces have also pledged to protect democracy and constitutions, and for the most part seem to be following their word.
"They know their countries would be isolated and they would be at a real disadvantage if they were to take over countries," said Louis Goodman, dean of the School of International Services at American University.
In Colombia, the military has resisted pressure from business leaders and other sectors for a coup to remove President Ernesto Samper, whose alleged acceptance of $6 million from drug dealers has made him the bane of Washington. Though the leftist guerrillas it battles have grown stronger in the political vacuum created by a weak President, the military has been able to profit from the President's weakness to get budget increases and new laws that strengthen its hand in combating guerrillas.
Nor was the message lost on the military in April, when a Paraguayan general, Lino Cesar Oviedo, tried to seize power from President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. Neighboring countries were swift to signal their rejection, essentially scuttling his power play.
"There's been an effective consensus built that constitutional rule is the way of the future in South America," said Bill Spencer of the Washington Office on Latin America, a liberal research institute. "Militaries have seen this and been working very hard with finding a new role for themselves within those constraints."
In Ecuador, Colombia and Chile, the military also has vast economic holdings, which a share of the country's oil profits, hotels, airlines and factories. Those economic stakes give the militaries a degree of independence from civilian budgets and oversight.
In Chile, the military plays a central role in opening the south to economic development, noted Frederick M. Nunn, a professor of history at Portland State University and author of "The Time of the Generals: Latin American Professional Militarism in World Perspective."
Mr. Nunn said discussions in the internal publications of the armed forces in Chile, Argentina, Peru and Brazil closely follow the prices of commodities and macroeconomic changes to reduce the state's role in managing the economy and industry. The literature reflects an uneasiness over the free-market reforms and transnational companies -- some of the very same discontents fueling popular protests in capitals throughout Latin America.
"There's an atavistic nationalism that comes out," Mr. Nunn said. "They see themselves as a last bastion of national values in an age of international everything."
For different reasons in each country, armed forces have also lost the invincibility, even imperiousness, they exuded at the height of the cold war. In Argentina, the military's reputation was badly frayed by its doomed war over the Falkland Islands. In Brazil, popular protests in 1985 drove out generals who overstayed what was supposed to have been a brief takeover 21 years before.
In the aftermath, the military is in many places seen as providing the framework for democracy to function, and stepping in like a stern parent when the political hijinks threaten to get out of hand. Often, it is the institution that has most penetrated the countryside, reaching remote areas in which the state has no other presence, neither schools nor sanitation nor health posts.
As Gen. Paco Moncayo, chairman of Ecuador's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said when he undertook the role of mediator of the presidential crisis here, he saw the military as largely assuring order and security while Congress works to fill in the "legal vacuums" of a poorly written Constitution that contained no clear rules for presidential succession.
In much the same way, the military sees itself as a literally constructive force -- building civilian roads, operating economic development programs and carrying out environmental cleanups, said Yolanda Kakabadse, president of a sustainable-development organization based here called Latin American Future.
"The experiences we had in Latin America, with the armed forces serving such a destructive function, has made Latin American societies reject that role," Mrs. Kakabadse said.

HEADLINE: LIBERTY, EQUALITY, ANXIETY: A special report.;
For France, Sagging Self-Image and Esprit

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 10

 BODY:
When Bernard Liautaud started Business Objects, a software company, he applied a simple formula that he naively thought might stir the imagination and shake the torpor of his country: dump French habits and do things the California way.
The results were spectacular. Founded in Paris in 1990 with $1 million of venture capital, the company was worth close to $1 billion by early last year. 
 From the French business world there oozed a collective gasp. Such rapid growth in a country where fortunes tend to build over generations was unprecedented. Intent on understanding the upstart who had so quickly created 600 jobs and such wealth, President Jacques Chirac invited Mr. Liautaud to Elysee Palace.
The 34-year-old multimillionaire's pitch last July to the French leader was, he said, simple -- a summary of the Silicon Valley mantra he learned while a graduate student at Stanford and applied at his company. Promote a shareholding culture. Think global. Think marketing. Reduce taxes.
The President listened. But no changes to France's heavily regulated economy followed. And when Business Objects' shares fell recently because of delays in a new software program, there were some smug "I told you so's" from the Paris establishment.
Where other countries have embraced the global entrepreneurship that drives Business Objects, France tends to see its economy and very identity threatened by innovation -- a mood that provides a perfect feeding ground for peddlers of xenophobia like the National Front party.
France today is racked by doubt and introspection. There is a pervasive sense that not only jobs -- but also power, wealth, ideas and national identity itself -- are migrating, permanently and at disarming speed, to leave a vapid grandeur on the banks of the Seine. Rapid technological innovation, radical strategic shifts, the Internet and the global market have contributed to an optimistic mood in the United States, as measured by the ever-rising stock market, an increase in jobs and public opinion polls. But these same forces have cast an ominous cloud here.
The old cultural antagonism between France and America, rooted in the fact that both countries aspire to represent some universal model, has been brought to a new level by the American victory that a market- and Internet-driven revolution are seen to represent. There are now regular snipes at America's "velvet hegemony." Profiting from this somber mood, the racist, extreme-right National Front party of Jean-Marie Le Pen has swept to a series of victories in municipal elections, including the southern town of Vitrolles on Sunday. It has gained support precisely by attacking globalization -- portrayed as the death of national culture -- and the high unemployment said to stem from untrammeled market forces and immigration.
With left and right, socialism and conservatism increasingly indistinguishable, the National Front has successfully contended that it is the only group with a distinct message.
"If we want to send the Arabs and Africans and Asians back to where they came from, it is not because we hate them, it is because they pollute our national identity and take our jobs," said Bruno Megret, the deputy leader of the party and husband of the new Mayor of Vitrolles. "When we have power, we will organize their return. We will stop renewing their residence cards, and we will force companies to pay a tax on foreign workers that will eventually lead to the foreigners losing their positions."
Such statements have a widening impact. Over a third of French people now say they sympathize with at least some of the National Front's ideas. Even a large city like Toulon has been won. The party's effectiveness appears to reflect the simmering frustration of a France that has lost its way.
As Pierre Birnbaum, a political scientist, put it, "Our problem is that we have not found the way to modernize while preserving our imagined community." In other words, how do you leap into the age of the Internet and remain French?
 
The Breakdown
An Uneasy Society Haunted By Ghosts
France is still rich and it enjoys an importance beyond its wealth. Its nuclear bomb, its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, its central place in European security, its hold on the world's imagination through its wines, its perfumes and its cheeses, and its universalist pretensions themselves -- all carry weight.
The country has many excellent companies; the Bourse rose 27 percent last year. As its leaders never tire of repeating in these dark days, France is the world's fourth-biggest industrial power and fourth-largest exporter. A stronger dollar, up 10 percent in the past month, bodes well for French exports.
But France has a stagnant economy -- growth was slightly more than 1 percent during the last year. Its unemployment rate has swelled to 12.7 percent, more than double the rate in the United States.
The corrosive anxiety pervading France is captured by a line from Rimbaud -- "nos horreurs economiques" or "our economic horrors" -- that is now widely used. The horror is not merely economic. Rather, the phrase captures the extraordinary collective angst of a people seemingly convinced that, as the philosopher Alain Finkielkraut simply put it, "There is a crisis of the modern world."
That crisis, as lived in France, is about cultural and political identity. Market reform, the global panacea, tends to leave the French cold. A hankering for grandeur -- some reconciliation of poetry and politics -- remains.
In the gathering debate between advocates of the untrammeled global market and those who argue that it accentuates social injustice, France tends to identify with the critics of globalization. Indeed, it increasingly seems to equate its welfare state with its very identity.
The obsession with identity is particularly strong because France is on the verge of two historical steps that critics equate with an abandonment of sovereignty and a surrender to global forces. It is scheduled to adopt a European currency, the euro, by 1999, thus yielding control over much economic policy to a European central bank; and it has indicated that it will return to the integrated military command structure of NATO, thus abandoning the most potent symbol of the Gaullist "non" to Washington.
Both moves, however, appear vulnerable to the present mood.
"The French are confronted by a lot of changes," said a senior adviser to Alain Juppe, the Prime Minister. "Are they prepared to accept them all? France disappearing into the euro, disappearing into NATO, at the same time as we demand more mobility, harder work and sacrifice? An upheaval cannot be ruled out."
France does not look prerevolutionary. The country's manicured capital, impeccable roads, high-speed trains, glorious food, seductive scents and deep-rooted savoir-vivre provide a compelling image of wealth and tradition. But just as the golden statuary on the bridges of Paris distracts the eye from the homeless sleeping beneath the arches, so the moving beauty of France tends to mask what amounts to a kernel of despair.
In Pantin, just a couple of miles outside the gates of Paris, there is a housing development called Les Cortillieres, most of whose 5,000 inhabitants are immigrants from Algeria, Morocco and West Africa. Into such places are emptied the human flotsam who cannot afford life in the showpiece capital.
Almost 40 percent of the population is unemployed. Graffiti hurl insults at Mr. Juppe and the police. Life begins in the afternoon because, for many young people, there is no reason to rise early. Drug dealers hang around in doorways. At the Jean-Jaures High School, repeated scrubbing has not quite effaced calls to join the ranks of militant Islamic groups that have carried out recent bomb attacks in Paris.
"Some of these kids have never seen the Eiffel Tower," said Boris Seguin, a teacher at the school. "They live on the margins of the city and the margins of society. If the French republican model stood for one thing, it was integration through education. So you see here how the model is threatened."
Mr. Seguin recently completed a dictionary translating the language spoken in Les Cortillieres into standard French. A conversation with Sabah Benmimouna, a teen-age French girl of Moroccan descent, reveals that a "lascar" is a guy and "fatal" is fantastic. Boys talk of a "passeport" for a condom, "kiffer" for loving and "dunker" -- from basketball -- for smashing somebody. Several of these expressions would not be widely understood in central Paris.
The spread of alienated suburbs matters particularly to the French because the revolution and the republic -- and their universal resonance -- were about the equal rights of citizens.
Indeed, the schoolteacher was the model republican figure, the person whose instruction turned waves of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish and other immigrants into French citizens.
That system now appears to be cracking, and its decomposition is evident in the Tours suburb of La Rabaterie -- a drab expanse of crumbling five-story apartment blocks that make the nearby chateaus of the Loire appear infinitely distant. La Rabaterie was built, like many poor suburbs, by North African immigrants in the boom years of the 1960's. Unemployment then stood at 1 percent and France was in the midst of what is now nostalgically recalled as "les trentes glorieuses" -- the 30 glorious postwar years.
La Rabaterie now houses the jobless children of those Algerian and Moroccan workers. Unemployed kids chant rap lyrics like "What are we waiting for to light the fire; what are we waiting for to no longer follow the rules of the game?"
Here, on Oct. 23, 1996, a 22-year-old Frenchman of Algerian descent, Mohammed Boucetta, was found in a coma with a bullet in his head. That led to a series of events that illustrated France's current malaise.
Anger among Mr. Boucetta's North African friends that no assailant was arrested exploded into rioting; the rioting was then apparently compounded when agents from the National Front sought to exploit the situation to gain votes.
The unrest started a week after Mr. Boucetta was found. Shop windows were smashed. More than 40 cars were burned. The chaos lasted for four nights.
After the first night, tracts distributed by the National Front began to appear. Some, emblazoned with the party's torch symbol, attributed the vandalism to the "immigration policies" of governments of the left and and now of the right.
"With us, foreign delinquents will be sent back to their countries and French people will have priority for jobs," one said. Others contained such messages as: "Why do rats wear roller skates in Tours? To clean out the garbage cans faster than the Arabs." Or: "What do you do when you see an Arab on a mobylette? Run after it because it's yours." Those were found beside the National Front tracts, but without the party's symbol.
To one of Mr. Boucetta's friends, Youssef Sana, who is 27 and the son of immigrants from Oran in northern Algeria, there is no doubt that his friend was a victim of racist violence. "We are at war here in the suburbs," Mr. Sana said. "And we, the children of Algerians, are already losers. It's apartheid; we don't even figure in the system.
"If Mohammed were a white French boy, the case would have been solved long ago."
More than three months later, the police say the Boucetta case remains a mystery. But Michel Mesmin, a local municipal official, said it now seemed clear that if the first night of violence was a spontaneous expression of outrage from the youth's friends, the others were mainly the work of what he called "provocateurs" from the National Front. "The only thing that is really clear from all this," he said, "is we are an increasingly uneasy society, haunted by specters."
 
The Paralysis
Out of Touch And Out of Ideas
That unease appears to be linked partly to the rigidity of a highly centralized system. France's superb technocrats, who planned and managed the country's remarkable reconstruction after World War II, appear overtaken by the global economy, ill-adapted by their formal training to its challenges. Its labor unions, parading the rags of an exhausted socialist dream, often seem equally fossilized.
Its political class is widely seen as a group of cloned eggheads -- Mr. Chirac, Mr. Juppe and the Foreign Minister, Herve de Charette, all went to the same elite school -- out of touch with a population that consistently gives the President and Prime Minister approval ratings in the 25-to-30 percent range.
At the same time, because socialism was long the source of idealism in France -- the sustenance of left-bank intellectuals and a strong labor movement -- and that idealism was simply exhausted by the 14-year rule of Francois Mitterrand that ended in 1995, the country has found itself suddenly bereft of any meaningful ideological debate.
A slogan of Mr. Mitterrand's second seven-year term was "Ni-Ni" -- neither nationalization nor privatization. It translated into internal paralysis. It appears that it may now take the French left several years to fashion a new message for the electorate.
France suffers in this void. It is a country traditionally driven by politics rather than economics; to be deprived of a political dialectic is as painful as being deprived of wine. "We have no more clear political markers," said Christiane Laporte, a headmistress. "We feel lost."
This sense of loss is evident in France's reluctance to adopt the new. It is a society where fewer than 15 percent of homes have personal computers and fewer than 1 percent are connected to the Internet, figures well below not only the United States but also France's European neighbors.
Opening the new national library in December, Mr. Chirac discovered the computer "mouse" for the first time and gazed at it in wonder. Mr. Chirac has spoken dismissively of the Internet as "an Anglo-Saxon network," although he did meet with Bill Gates this month.
It is not surprising, then, that Mr. Liautaud and his partner Denis Payre of Business Objects are scarcely national celebrities.
Yet the extraordinary success of their company, which makes a software that sifts data in order to further corporate decision-making, has thrown a sharp spotlight on many of France's problems.
"What I realized in America was that there is a technological revolution going in," Mr. Payre said. "Today, I look at France -- our great conceptual thinkers and lousy doers, our brilliant engineers and lousy marketers, our risk-averse culture that if you fail once it's all over -- and I wonder if we're not simply going to miss out on tomorrow."
In 1982 France began offering people video terminals that were connected electronically to a phone line, allowing the transmission of text and simple images. The system, known as Minitel, gave the country the lead in the race toward the information society. But it was never effectively marketed outside France and never taken much further. Today it is outdated.
Business Objects sought to build on this lesson. Rather than concentrating on the French market, it immediately sought to expand worldwide. Rather than relying simply on a good product, it opted for aggressive marketing. And in the place of the security of a state-owned job, it presented employees with stock options that gave them a financial stake in the company's success.
At the other end of the spectrum from Mr. Liautaud stands Lawrence Bricogne. At 30, he is four years younger than the entrepreneur and he has a qualification in computer sciences from a technical school, but he has not worked for almost a decade.
He has a small Paris apartment bought for him by his mother, a piano, a television, a personal computer and an answering machine. He recently sold his car. Every month, like about one million other French people, he collects what is known as the R.M.I. -- the acronym for the "minimum revenue for insertion." It amounts to about $400; it is what the French state reserves for those not receiving any other unemployment benefits.
"The R.M.I. allows me not to work," Mr. Bricogne said. "It's bizarre; it's probably unhealthy. Without the R.M.I., I would have taken a job some time ago -- a night watchman, or a kitchen job in a restaurant. Something menial." Many artists in Paris who once, like George Orwell, did such jobs to survive now collect the R.M.I. instead.
This Rmiste (pronounced air MEEST), as people like him are known, considered his situation and then added: "But I still prefer the French system to the American. Everybody envies us our social security."
The R.M.I. was introduced a decade ago. It was supposed to encourage the "insertion" into society of the jobless by committing people to prove they were looking, or training, for jobs. But Genevieve Monnot, who works with the unemployed at the Paris city administration, said only about 10 percent of Rmistes were certain to find jobs. "Many are now just too far from society," she said.
Mr. Chirac has recently tried to lay out a French "alternative" in which the energy of Mr. Liautaud and the solidarity that protects Mr. Bricogne are somehow married. Official calls for a more entrepreneurial spirit and streamlined state have been spiced with criticism of Anglo-Saxon "flexibility" in the workplace -- deemed antisocial.
But this hodgepodge has fallen far short of the galvanizing message that French people habitually await from their leader in this, the most monarchical of republics.
It has left the country hurtling toward union with Europe even as a bloated state, overarching welfare, and cash-hemorrhaging state companies like Air France and the Credit Lyonnais bank make the competitive demands of Europe and its German-dictated budget discipline hard to meet.
Since succeeding Mr. Mitterrand in mid-1995, Mr. Chirac has tried to battle the National Front by embarking on long-delayed reforms -- of the army, the justice system, social security, pensions, state companies -- that are intended to give the country new momentum and adjust it to the realities of the end of the millennium.
On a trip to Tokyo in December, Mr. Chirac spent his time hustling to sell everything from French apples to Airbus planes. For the man who personifies "La gloire de la France," it was a considerable step. Charles de Gaulle, who stood for a "certain idea of France," its civilizing mission and majesty, once dismissed the Japanese as transistor salesmen.
Times change. Gaullist grandeur no longer feeds the people. The numbers in France are not good; and capital and jobs, in the global village, are not much interested in a "certain idea of France."
France cannot afford its welfare state but is unwilling to abandon it. It has proved unable to create jobs even as the United States -- for all its "downsizing" -- has created more than 10 million since 1993. But it is loath to ease the mandatory health and social security contributions that make hiring prohibitively expensive.
The minimum monthly wage here is about 5,000 francs, or $912, but after mandatory contributions for pensions, health coverage and unemployment benefits have been paid by employers and employees, it amounts to about 8,200 francs, or $1,518. Thus 36 percent of the wage cost comes from social insurance payments, compared with about 10 percent in America.
French and international companies, many of which can now shift jobs to Portugal or Indonesia, have shown a growing reluctance to hire, particularly as dismissing anyone is, in the words of one Paris-based international economist, "long, tedious and expensive."
The arithmetic of France's unrivaled social security net is also bleak. Already facing annual deficits of about $10 billion, the social security budget will face enormous pressure as the number of pensioners increases from 12 million to 17.3 million during the next two decades, while the active population scarcely grows, according to official forecasts.
Yet labor unions have recently suggested lowering the retirement age to 55 from 60, in line with a Government-sponsored settlement reached last year with striking truck drivers. They have also mounted a bitter attack on proposals to introduce American-style private pension funds, saying they will lead to a system "of every man for himself."
Similar resistance has met the beginnings of attempts to reform the cash-guzzling state that has inspired generations of French parents to dream of their offspring becoming not doctors or lawyers but "fonctionnaires." Public spending here accounts for almost 60 percent of total national output, compared with an average of of 40 percent in major industrialized countries.
 
The Crossroads
Sagging Energy And Hesitation
As its domestic woes have deepened, France's international policy has become more aggressive -- and more strident in its aspersions on the United States.
Mr. Chirac has recently argued forcibly for the euro as the only way for Europe to "fight effectively against American hegemony." And he has pressed -- unsuccessfuly -- for French command of NATO's Mediterranean flank as a symbol of European emancipation from American military tutelage.
The impact of all this on French-American relations has been little short of poisonous. "They want an original foreign policy but they have recently gone a little overboard," said a senior American diplomat. "We have been through a trough, a very aggravated period."
France stands at a crossroads. Full NATO integration or the preservation of a uniquely French membership? Real market reform -- privatization, private pension funds, a shareholding culture -- or preservation of the highly centralized, state-heavy French welfare model? America as firm friend or threatening purveyor of an undifferentiated global culture? A European currency and a real commitment to building a federal United States of Europe or the temptations of the National Front's nationalism?
Hesitating before these choices, France quite palpably sags. To go to London or Berlin today is to feel how flat, how lacking in energy, Paris has become. The sense of living in a museum becomes almost tangible.
"We want to be an alternative, to show that if nobody resists America any more, at least we will," said the sociologist Jean Baudrillard. "The problem is that because we are not sure which model to embody, we tend to offer simply inertia."
What is left? Europe -- and the extraordinary postwar French reconciliation with its old enemy, Germany. But this does not yet move the French as they want to be moved.
The yearning for some uplifting solution persists and makes France far less predictable than Germany or Britain, as the National Front's victory this weekend underscores. The country is deeply unrequited, susceptible to a political lurch. The republic was founded on ideas -- "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" -- and the last two words retain a lingering resonance. Wealth, personal enrichment, is still considered a dubious measure of success.
Such views are unfashionable, feeble dikes to the global tide, but they are a deep part of French culture. Therein lies a profound problem: the distinctiveness of France no longer has much international resonance. Mr. Chirac said this month that France should be "exemplary," but candidates for its depressed example are hard to find.
"The ego is greedy, it needs to be nourished," said Marek Halter, a writer. "But the French ego is not being nourished these days. That is dangerous and that is why I feel that anything could happen."

HEADLINE: Bank Loan Gives Mercury A Chance to Renegotiate Debt

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 10

 BODY:
The Mercury Finance Company said today that it had secured a short-term, $50 million prime rate loan from the Bank of America, a lifeline that will allow it more time to renegotiate hundreds of millions of dollars in debts on which it has defaulted.
While some analysts estimated the loan would buy the company as little as 10 days, William A. Brandt Jr., the corporate turnaround specialist who was named president and chief executive of Mercury a week ago, said it would cover operating expenses and interest payments "beyond 30 days." 
 Either way, the loan from Bank of America was seen on Wall Street as hopeful news for the company, which is based in Lake Forest, Ill. Mercury's shares -- which were the most active on the New York Stock Exchange today, with 5.5 million changing hands -- gained 43.75 cents each to close at $2.3125.
Many analysts had initially predicted Mercury would make a quick bankruptcy-law filing after investors and creditors were shocked by the company's disclosure last month that earnings reports had been falsely inflated since 1993. Mercury said more than $90 million had been added to its earnings in false bookkeeping entries dating to 1993.
Mercury blamed James A. Doyle, its controller, whom it dismissed, for the irregularities. But a lawyer representing Mr. Doyle said he was cooperating with the Federal authorities in plumbing what he described as a broader accounting "charade."
The disclosures caused Mercury's stock to plummet by 86 percent, to less than $2 a share, when trading resumed Jan. 28 after a halt of two and a half days. Nervous lenders refused to roll over short-term loans into new commercial paper. The cash squeeze left Mercury unable to repay maturing loans, putting all of its debt into default. John Brincat, Mercury's longtime chief executive, was then replaced by Mr. Brandt.
Mercury missed payments on $61 million in debt during the first week of its financial crisis and expects to be in arrears on another $127 million by the end of this week. In all, Mercury has about $500 million in commercial paper scheduled to mature this year and over $500 million more in longer-term loans.

HEADLINE: New Era For Taking Market's Pulse;
Analysts Debating Valuation of Stocks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
As the Dow Jones industrial average flirts with the stunning level of 7,000, several leading analysts on Wall Street are counseling that the old rules no longer apply when judging whether the stock market has soared beyond reason.
These market watchers, whom some call the New Era group, divine a new period for stocks that is defined by low inflation and the public's keen attraction to stock mutual funds. When the old standbys for valuing stocks are adjusted for these factors, they assert, stock prices look either perfectly reasonable or, at worst, modestly high. 
 But in boldly rejecting old-style analysis of stock market physics, the New Era group is meeting stiff, skeptical resistance from a hard-core group of traditionalists, many of whom draw on the sobering experiences of past downturns. With an eye on measures used for decades, they fear that investors are being encouraged to pay grossly excessive prices for stocks and will suffer terribly if -- when, they declare -- the market takes a severe tumble.
The old school, embarrassed at having missed out on the riches of the bull market, finds strength in a long history of market binges and the hangovers that followed. And the traditionalists are now taking comfort from the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank.
According to minutes released last week, the Fed's policy-making committee observed at its last meeting of 1996 that the market's rally had been "extraordinary and had brought market valuations to fairly high levels relative to earnings and dividends."
Despite the divisions between analysts of the old school and the new one, there is broad agreement that investors should temper their enthusiasm for the market. With major stock indexes having risen so impressively, they say, investors clearly face greater risks.
In some ways, the disagreement over how to view the current stock market is defined by generations and experience as much as methods of analysis. Byron R. Wien, a traditionalist and the 63-year-old United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company, recalled an encounter after a presentation last December when he predicted that 1997 would be the worst year for investors since 1990, when the Dow fell 4 percent. Mr. Wien expects the Dow to fall about 1,000 points this year.
"I am going to tell you what your problem is," a woman in the audience told Mr. Wien, who has worked more than three decades as an investment strategist. "The problem with you is that you went through 1973 and 1974 and those scars are still healing." The Dow dropped 45 percent in those two years.
Mr. Wien makes no apologies for his attention to history, and in it he finds support for his methods. In 1987, he noted, many analysts argued that liquidity, money rushing into the stock market, was changing its dynamics. But his valuation measures signaled that the market was significantly overvalued. The Dow Jones industrial average later took a breathtaking, one-day dive of 508 points, or 22.6 percent.
New Era analysts argue that measures that worked well in the past must be updated now that the investment climate has changed.
Among that group is Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company, who has become a major voice of bullishness on Wall Street in the last several years. At 44, she was still working as an economist at the Federal Reserve during the bear market of the early 1970's.
"I have been a New Era person since 1991," she says, explaining that changes in the behavior of the baby- boom generation were a catalyst for her fresh market perspective.
"It was easy for me to see that many of the people in this age group were beginning to increase their investment levels," she said. "You recognize that things have changed."
While Ms. Cohen forecasts that the Dow will hit 7,050 this year, she cautions that stocks are fairly valued and that the market could stay roughly where it is until the earnings outlook is clearer later this year.
Another New Era devotee, Richard Bernstein of Merrill Lynch, notes that the market has soared 68 percent in the last two years even though conventional measures of fair value have been flashing warning signals for some time. "If everybody knows well that the market is overvalued and it is not going down, then -- and these are dangerous words -- something may be different," said Mr. Bernstein, 38, who is Merrill's director of quantitative research.
The issue of whether stocks have reached unsustainable heights has become more pressing as investors appear to be holding firm in their belief that stocks will continue lurching upward, with only brief dips and pauses. A poll of 1,014 mutual fund investors taken at the end of last year by Louis Harris & Associates found that 86 percent thought that the annual returns from the stock market in the next 10 years will be 14 percent or better, at least equal to those during the last decade.
The Leuthold Group, a research and money management firm in Minneapolis, whose traditional analysis says the stock market is significantly overvalued, projects that the market is facing about a 25 percent decline. A decline like that in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks would shave the annualized total return for the previous five years to 6.8 percent from 15 percent.
Andrew Engel, senior research analyst at Leuthold, said the stock market would ultimately conform to the discipline of traditional measures. "The question is when," he said.
When assessing the overall market, analysts frequently look at the price-to-earnings ratio of a particular index, which is determined by dividing the level of the index by the earnings per share of the companies that make up the index. According to the Standard & Poor's research firm, the average annual price-to-earnings ratio since 1926 for its widely recognized index of 500 stocks is 14.4. Its low was 6.64 in 1948, and its high was 26.1 in 1991. Based on nearly complete earnings reports, the figure for 1996 is 18.9.
But there are wide variations in how the ratio can be calculated -- whether, for example, to use reported earnings or operating earnings adjusted for unusual corporate write-offs. Some show the market wildly overvalued, but others show it is only marginally so.
For instance, the Leuthold Group's price-to-earnings measure, which blends current earnings forecasts with actual earnings in the previous four years, is at 23.94 for the S. & P. 500, near the highest level ever.
Other models for valuing the stock market carefully consider the level of long-term interest rates along with forecasts of earnings, because higher interest rates tend to draw investors away from the stock market. If predictions of companies' earnings hold steady, the threshold for considering the market overvalued will decline when interest rates rise, as they have been doing since December.
Based on this approach, the S. & P. 500 index is overvalued, according to a model used by Mr. Wien. With the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond about 6.70 percent and his forecast of operating earnings of $44 a share for the stocks in the S. & P. 500 index, the fairly valued level of the S. & P. index is about 742. The index closed down 4.13 points yesterday at 785.43, or about 6 percent above what Mr. Wien regards as fair value.
And Mr. Wien is forecasting that a pickup in economic growth will force an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve and push long-term interest rates to 7.5 percent. That would lower the fairly valued level of the S. & P. index to 650. On that basis, he expects about a 130-point decline in the S. & P. 500 index and a 1,000-point decline in the Dow.
Mr. Wien's forecast of a sharp market drop looked good when stocks plunged last July. But the subsequent rally to new highs forced him to recant. Now he thinks the Dow can break 7,000 before it falls. But he is not abandoning his valuation model. "The model has served me for 12 years, and I am not about to abandon it without new information," he said.
There are two other classic valuation measures. In one, the price of a stock is compared with the company's book value, the excess of its assets over its liabilities. In the other, called the dividend yield, the stock price is compared with the dividend that the company pays. A pattern of high price-to-book ratios and low dividend yields has traditionally been viewed as a warning sign that the market is peaking.
But these two measures have come under fire from New Era analysts because they gave negative signals about the market throughout its steady upward march.
In the case of the price-to-book ratio, strategists say that recent accounting changes have artificially devalued companies, making the measure look higher than it should be.
On dividend yields, analysts argue that the current level of 1.9 percent, the all-time low for the S. & P. 500 index, is understated because companies are opting to reward shareholders in other ways. Many companies now use their cash reserves to buy back their stock from shareholders rather than using the same cash to pay dividends. By reducing the number of shares in the public's hands, these buybacks raise the earnings per share.
At the heart of market valuations by many of the New Era analysts is the effect of inflation. Inflation undermines the value of future earnings and also raises interest rates, which makes bonds more attractive to investors relative to stocks.
With inflation last year at 3.3 percent and prospects good for continued stability, the New Era analysts see little cause for worry about the stock market. And they argue that the market should be appraised in light of how current price-to-earnings ratios compare with those that prevailed during comparable periods of inflation. That means the ratio can be higher without signaling danger.
When the Consumer Price Index has been below 3.5 percent, Ms. Cohen of Goldman, Sachs said, price-to-earnings ratios for the S. & P. index have averaged 16.2. That level is close to the current price-to-earnings ratio, which she calculates to be 16.7, assuming that operating earnings for 1997 match her forecast of $47 a share for the stocks in the index. Because this means the market is only slightly overvalued, she said, the S. & P. 500 index can rise this year by 10 percent, equivalent to the increase she expects for earnings.
So far this year, the market seems to be siding with the New Era crowd despite the selloff at the end of January and the failure of the Dow to rush right through 7,000. And this strong performance troubles the traditionalists, who grudgingly confess that they have to wonder if the world may be changing.
When Mr. Wien's thoughts drift in this direction, he remembers the market gurus of the late 1950's who closely tracked the dividend yield on stocks. When the yield fell below that of bonds for the first time in 1958, many of them pulled their money out of the market and advised their clients to do the same. But the signal turned out to be faulty.
"What is worrisome," Mr. Wien said, "is that I am the same age as they were at the time. They were soothsayers and revered -- and ultimately they got carried out. And there is always the danger that we are at that kind of point again."

AMERICAN SPHINX
The Character of Thomas Jefferson
By Joseph J. Ellis
365 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.
Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence and the third President of the United States, remains one of the most enigmatic of historical figures -- the "American Sphinx," as the title of Joseph J. Ellis's compelling new book puts it. His life, after all, stands as a messy tangle of contradictions: he was an aristocrat who was suspicious of elites, an avatar of freedom who owned slaves, a spendthrift who believed in governmental austerity; a worldly philosopher who championed agrarian values; a nearly lifelong politician who repeatedly insisted he wanted nothing so much as to retire to his plantation in Virginia. 
 Since his death in 1826, Jefferson has been embraced by wildly divergent political movements, from Southern secessionists who cited him on behalf of states' rights to Northern Abolitionists who quoted his words from the Declaration of Independence, from conservatives fed up with government regulations to liberals committed to the institutionalization of equality. After 30 years of work on his life, one of his many biographers, Merrill Peterson, confessed that "Jefferson remains for me, finally, an impenetrable man."
So what does Mr. Ellis, Jefferson's latest analyst, make of him? In this fascinating volume, he draws a portrait of a highly romantic, often intensely naive man who became practiced in the arts of denial. As a young man, Mr. Ellis suggests, Jefferson became accustomed to "constructing interior worlds of great imaginative appeal that inevitably collided with the more mundane realities." "Rather than adjust his expectations in the face of disappointment," Mr. Ellis argues, "he tended to bury them deeper inside himself and regard the disjunction between his ideals and worldly imperfections as the world's problem rather than his own."
This impulse endowed Jefferson with "the internal agility to generate multiple versions of the truth," Mr. Ellis says, as well as "the deep deviousness only possible in a dedicated idealist." In later years, Ms. Ellis adds, it also galvanized a political philosophy more focused on the possibilities of the future than the problems of the present, and a determination to see politics (and for that matter, just about everything else) in moralistic categories of black and white, an either-or outlook that tended to devolve into a darkly conspiratorial view of the world.
Mr. Ellis's portrait of Jefferson is not terribly flattering. With his last book, "Passionate Sage" -- an erudite and illuminating study of Jefferson's great friend and rival, John Adams -- Mr. Ellis's sympathetic understanding of his subject combined with his obvious intellectual appreciation of Adams's realistic approach to the world helped make a powerful case for his lasting political legacy. In this volume, he seems to have internalized Adams's skeptical regard for Jefferson. While "American Sphinx" is certainly not as critical of Jefferson as some revisionist studies (like Leonard Levy's 1963 book "Jefferson and Civil Liberties: The Darker Side" and Paul Finkelman's 1992 essay "Jefferson and Slavery: 'Treason Against the Hopes of the World' "), it does provide a sobering response to the hagiographic tradition in Jefferson scholarship, represented by recent books by Alf J. Mapp Jr. and Willard Sterne Randall.
On the sensitive question of Jefferson's attitude toward slavery, Mr. Ellis suggests that in the early stages of his career Jefferson belonged to the progressive "vanguard that insisted on the incompatibility of slavery with the principles on which the American republic was founded." Later on, however, this principled stand gave way to procrastination, silence and rationalization -- developments related in no small part to Jefferson's distaste for controversy and his growing financial distress, which made him more dependent than ever on the slave-run economy of Monticello.
Other distasteful episodes and tendencies in Jefferson's career are noted as well: his efforts to doctor his early correspondence, in Mr. Ellis's words, "to convince posterity that his affection for France had not blinded him to the possibility of unparalleled violence" during the French Revolution; his suspicion that people of African descent were sufficiently inferior to whites in mental aptitude that any emancipation policy leading to integration was a biological travesty against "the real distinctions that nature has made"; his complicity in using hired character assassins in the party wars of the 1790's; and his willingness late in life, as Mr. Ellis puts it, to allow "the enormous prestige associated with his name to be captured by the most reactionary segment of Southern political culture, with its attendant defense of slavery and its doctrine of states' rights."
As for the much-debated question of Jefferson's liaison with his slave Sally Hemings, Mr. Ellis is dubious. He argues that Jefferson's "deepest urges were more self-protective and sentimental than sexual" and that "the alleged relationship with Sally Hemings, if it did exist, defied the dominant patterns of his personality."
Less a comprehensive biography than an extended character study, "American Sphinx" focuses on pivotal moments in Jefferson's life while skimming over entire periods (like Jefferson's disastrous second term as President) in a mere paragraph or two. As he did in his earlier book on Adams, Mr. Ellis uses his wide-ranging knowledge of Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary history to situate Jefferson's philosophy and actions within a social context, providing the lay reader with a remarkably vivid feel for the period's mood, conventions and concerns. He manages to avoid the sin of "presentism" (the assumption, fashionable among some academics, that the past can be judged by the values of the present), while at the same time giving the reader an understanding of the main strands of Jefferson's thought and their relevance (or irrelevance) to contemporary debates.
In Mr. Ellis's opinion, one of the chief heirs of Jefferson's anti-government agenda is the conservative wing of the Republican Party, represented by Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich. He adds, however: "On the most disturbing and controversial problems in contemporary American society -- abortion, drugs, poverty, crime -- the Jeffersonian legacy has little to say. The debate about such social problems is a debate about government's proper role, and from a Jeffersonian prospective, government should have no role at all."
Though the reader may not agree with all Mr. Ellis's assessments, he writes so intelligently and knowledgeably that it's impossible to read this book and not reconsider Jefferson's role as a thinker, writer and politician. With "American Sphinx," Mr. Ellis has made an important and highly readable contribution to the already voluminous literature on this most elusive of America's Founding Fathers.

HEADLINE: Immigration Fosters Surge In Subway Use

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
Despite a 25-cent fare increase, subway ridership in New York City soared last year to its highest level since the early 1970's, as the immigrant surge that has reinvigorated neighborhoods throughout the city has rippled over to the transit system.
The ridership statistics provide a snapshot of how the new immigration is having its scattershot impact on the city neighborhoods. In Queens, where the already crowded No. 7 line traverses immigrant communities like Woodside, Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Corona, ridership has risen 20 percent over the first half of the decade. Similar increases were seen along the A and the C lines serving Washington Heights, where thousands of Dominicans have settled and along the N and R trains, which new arrivals from China, Mexico and Russia use to get to their homes in neighborhoods like Sunset Park. 
 While the increases can be partly explained by safer and cleaner cars, along with the city's booming tourist trade, the patterns of the increases -- with the largest jumps in ridership along lines that go to immigrant neighborhoods -- largely explains why ridership rose from less than 1 billion in 1992 to 1.1 billion last year, transit officials said.
"The spurt in immigration has really been behind this increase," said Harvey Poris, the Transit Authority's budget director. "It's a relatively new phenomenon."
The jump in ridership has worsened already dense crowding on lines like the No. 7, but transit officials say they have no immediate plans to alter service, since such population trends tend to be fluid. At the same time, the increase in ridership has produced an unexpected $24 million windfall in fare revenue for a system struggling with cutbacks in government subsidies.
The last time that officials could directly link ridership increases to the surge of new immigrants was in the 1920's, as the last great immigrant era ended in New York City, Mr. Poris said.
Despite the increase in subway ridership, bus ridership continued its 25-year decline, dropping 5.2 percent to 426 million passengers in 1995. In part this is due to the continuing popularity of illegal vans, which not coincidentally have sprung up as a major transportation alternative in many immigrant neighborhoods.
Ridership on the subways began a long decline in 1970, when there were 1.3 billion riders a year as an exodus to the suburbs was followed by service cuts to the system that lowered the system's performance. Ridership figures leveled off at a billion a year through the 1980's, dipping to 995 million in 1991. But from then on, ridership began to accelerate, something transit officials initially attributed to the cleaner cars and improved performance of the trains after a large-scale rebuilding program.
Historically, ridership patterns have often reflected the strength of the city's economy; the more jobs available, the more people ride the subways to get to work. When the economy declines, ridership decreases. Indeed, in 1990, when New York and the rest of the country were in a recession, ridership decreased by nearly 4 percent.
But from 1992 to 1995, employment rose only 1 percent while subway ridership jumped 9.7 percent, with the biggest increases on weekends.
In a 1995 study, the Transit Authority found that the growth in immigration was directly responsible for most of the increase in subway ridership between 1990 to 1994. For example, in the Ozone Park and Woodhaven sections of Queens, subway ridership increased by 20 percent. During the same period, statistics from the city's Planning Department showed that while the population of those neighborhoods showed an increase of only 1.7 percent, school enrollment -- considered a more accurate barometer of immigration trends -- increased 23 percent.
Besides the No. 7 line that goes through the heart of Queens, other Brooklyn and Queens lines that saw big increases in ridership were the the J and A lines, particularly the stops along those lines in Woodhaven, a working-class area that has seen a surge in immigrants. Another line that saw large ridership increases were the Brooklyn portions of the N line, which goes through the new Chinese enclave in Sunset Park and goes on to Brighton Beach, a magnet for Russian immigrants.
So far, officials said that the effects of the increase in ridership have been muted because it has stretched over a 24-hour period, so crowding has not been particularly noticeable at many stations.
Still, rider advocacy groups said that the Transit Authority needs to better address the needs of immigrants. For example, there are not enough signs in Spanish, Russian and Chinese at stations where the majority of the riders speak these languages, the advocates said, which they regard as vital if transit officials want keep the immigrants as riders.
"It's definitely an English-first crew," said Joseph G. Rappaport, coordinator of the Straphangers Campaign, a riders advocacy group. "If you go to other international cities, you'll likely find signs in three to four different languages. Here in New York signs are inadequate in one language."
Officials believe they can reverse the decline in bus ridership with the elimination of two-fare zones in July, when riders will be able to transfer from buses to subways for free. Officials plan to add 205 new buses to the fleet of 3,600 buses.

Graph also shows sites of stations with large increases in ridership from 1990 to 1994 that were attributed to a rise in immigration.

HEADLINE: All Society Isn't Divided Into Black and White;
Progress on Integration

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma was off base in his reply to President Clinton's State of the Union address (news article, Feb. 5) when he said that racial division in America has increased since the government began trying to heal it. 
True, when I was a child during the Depression and World War II, there was less acrimony. But the black population was segregated and repressed. That hardly constituted racial harmony.
A true process of integration is under way in America. More and more, one observes racially mixed groups in public. Unfortunately, the inner cities are excluded from this integration process, but more by economic and educational disadvantages than racial feeling.

HEADLINE: At the Wire, Auction Fans, It's, It's . . . Christie's!

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Swords will forever be drawn between Hertz and Avis, between Coke and Pepsi and, in the rarefied world of art, between Sotheby's and Christie's. The rival auction houses have been battling for two centuries to corner as much of the art business as they can.
Sotheby's, the bigger of the two, has long come out ahead. But when Sotheby's announced its 1996 sales totals on Thursday, it had lost the lead for the first time since 1954. As both houses raced to expand from their London and New York bases, gentlemanly Christie's, trying harder, perhaps, since Christopher Davidge became chief executive four years ago, had inched ahead. 
 "The auction business is a monopoly shared by two firms," said Donald B. Marron, chairman of Paine Webber and a passionate collector of art. "These are two global brand names in a business where everything is growing: the demand, the breadth of the market and the prices. It's an exciting time."
But every big business has big pitfalls. In London last week, Sotheby's found itself at the center of an embarrassing scandal when the company suspended two employees after a British television show, timed to the publication of a book about the company, reported that two Sotheby's experts in Milan had helped smuggle an $11,000, 18th-century painting out of Italy.
Last night, Sotheby's said it was forming a committee of independent directors to review its practices, adding more fuel to an expose that is the talk of international art circles. With the glamorous aura that now surrounds art auctions, though, sensational allegations can also be advertising.
Sotheby's auction sales totaled $1.599 billion last year, down 5 percent from $1.67 billion in 1995. Christie's sales totaled $1.602 billion, up 9 percent from $1.47 billion in 1995.
Both houses are still posting sales below the records set in the late 80's, before a recession devastated the art market. But as the numbers recover, Sotheby's and Christie's are waging refined war on new continents and in new markets, opening or expanding operations on the West Coast, in Paris and in Asia and aggressively buying up dealers and galleries.
Both increasingly offer their wealthy clients a range of services, from financing and luxury apartment sales to furniture restoration and high-security storage, while also reaching out to popularize the market. They hold evening classes to teach the uninitiated how to bid at auction without feeling intimidated, and they have increased their art education programs.
But in the fight to divide the spoils of the rich and famous, the competition to represent important collections and clients is also intensifying. Sotheby's appears to have won the celebrity sweepstakes in 1996, when thousands of people lined York Avenue to view the contents of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's houses and jewelry boxes, making Christie's two-part sale of Rudolf Nureyev memorabilia seem like a minor event.
But Christie's has slowly been creeping up. Although Sotheby's recently secured $15 million worth of German and Austrian Expressionist art from the estate of the art dealer Serge Sabarsky, Christie's is about to announce that it will be selling a third round of property from the heirs of the German businessman and collector Jacques Koerfer. The early modern paintings, valued at about $17 million, include a Rose-period Picasso, a 1929 Mondrian, a Gauguin self-portrait and a Giacometti sculpture.
Still in play are estate property of the conductor Leonard Bernstein, the billionaire Doris Duke, the financier John Loeb and the collector and philanthropist Sally Ganz. Those auctions could tip this year's sales figures in either house's favor.
That the two companies are neck and neck is not surprising. Christie's growth has been slow but steady since 1989, when it had 42 percent of the auction market. But Christie's became more aggressive about buying up companies and getting business with Mr. Davidge's appointment in 1993.
Mr. Davidge, whose father was a porter at Christie's, started out in the company's printing division and worked his way up. Last fall he moved from London to New York, a sign that he wanted to take a hands-on role at the biggest profit center.
In the meantime, Christie's has increased its Asian operations, is opening large premises in Beverly Hills and, like Sotheby's, is expanding its operations in Paris, where European Union rules will allow both London-based houses to hold sales for the first time beginning in 1998.
Though founded in 1774, just two years before Christie's, Sotheby's is quick to call its rival a newcomer to the New York art scene. Sotheby's entered the United States in 1964 with its purchase of Parke-Bernet Galleries, the Madison Avenue auction house. Christie's held its first American sale 13 years later.
Sotheby's experts also like to point out that the company's profits generally run higher than Christie's. Sotheby's 1996 profit was $62.8 million, up 26 percent from $54.3 million in 1995. Financial analysts predict that Christie's will report a 1996 profit of around $50 million, up from $32 million in 1995.
"Yes, I'd like us to be ahead, but it's just as important that the company report healthy profits," said Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's chief executive officer worldwide. "I'm more concerned with the overall business. We're more than just an auction house." Sotheby's also operates a successful real estate firm that just celebrated its 20th anniversary, and since the 1980's has offered clients one-stop shopping for services ranging from financing to furniture restoration.
Sotheby's has also begun forging close ties with dealers, setting aside a large portion of its assets to buy up their businesses. In 1990, Sotheby's and the Manhattan dealer William Acquavella founded Acquavella Modern Art when they bought the contents of the Pierre Matisse Gallery, 2,300 works by artists like Miro, Dubuffet and Chagall. Sotheby's, which invested $142 million, and Mr. Acquavella have been selling off the art at auction and privately.
In June, Sotheby's entered into an agreement with Andre Emmerich, the 57th Street gallery. While Sotheby's doesn't own the inventory, it does own the gallery, which is now Emmerich/Sotheby's, and Mr. Emmerich and his employees are on the Sotheby's payroll.
So is Roger Horchow, the king of the mail-order business, who is working as a consultant. And while Sotheby's won't confirm it, there is talk that it may take over Leslie Hindman Auctioneers in Chicago. Discussions have also taken place between Sotheby's and Butterfield & Butterfield, the San Francisco auctioneers.
Christie's has also done its share of shopping. Four years ago it paid $10.9 million for the London gallery Spink & Sons, which specializes in Oriental art and British paintings and is next door to Christie's on King Street.
In September, Spink bought the Leger Gallery, a Bond Street operation dealing in British paintings, watercolors and drawings, giving Christie's a presence perilously near Sotheby's Bond Street headquarters.
To make itself competitive with Sotheby's in real estate, two years ago Christie's bought Great Estates, the largest network of independent real estate brokers in North American, changing its name to Christie's Great Estates.
"We're all taking advantage of the fact that we are a global business with an international clientele," said Patricia G. Hambrecht, Christie's managing director in New York. "We see ourselves as an art business and we are constantly looking for areas of expansion that are related to the core of our business."
Both houses are secretive about another important area of growth: their private treaty sales, in which they act very much like the dealers they are buying up, finding a buyer for an artwork without putting it on the block.
Neither Sotheby's nor Christie's will say how big its private treaty sales have become, but officials at both houses admit that in this era of inconspicuous consumption, it is an important part of their business. This fall Christie's even bought a town house on East 59th Street as a separate gallery where experts can show clients art in complete privacy.
Both companies are also about to move to bigger quarters in New York. Sotheby's is working with developers on a plan for the Coliseum site at Columbus Circle that would provide enough space to put all its operations under one roof. Christie's, similarly, is about to move to a 300,000-square-foot complex at Rockefeller Center.
But even with new salesrooms and luxurious offices, the two companies will forever have different images. While Mr. Davidge is successfully bringing a savvy, businesslike image to Christie's and gaining a reputation as a clever deal-maker, their personalities, to many who do business with both houses, are very different.
"The old adage is still true, Christie's are gentlemen trying to be businessmen and Sotheby's are businessmen trying to be gentlemen," said Eugene V. Thaw, the collector and retired Manhattan dealer. "Sotheby's is more hard-driving and tougher and Christie's is more accommodating and softer. Maybe that's part of Sotheby's problem these days: they've chased away their clients."
The difference in styles may be a result of differences in management teams. Sotheby's top executives all began their careers in the business world. Mrs. Brooks joined the company from Citibank, and Kevin Bousquette, its chief operating officer worldwide, was a limited partner at Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts. (Henry Kravis, the leveraged buyout king, was just named to Sotheby's board.)
Christie's, on the other hand, is run by people with backgrounds in art. Most of their directors are experts who have worked their way up the auction house ladder.
Sotheby's was primarily a book auctioneer at its founding, while Christie's began by selling fine art and furniture. Christie's remains an English company, but Sotheby's is now throughly American. It's chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, the shopping center magnate, bought the business with a group of investors in 1983 and vastly increased its financial muscle and visibility.

HEADLINE: A NEW UNIVERSE;
Young Astronomers Scan Night Sky and Help Wanted Ads

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

 BODY:
AT the age of 26, Brenda Frye, a Berkeley graduate student, already seems assured of a career in the exclusive science of cutting-edge astronomy. She has had the privilege of controlling one of the largest telescopes in the world and has done significant research, including investigations of the chemistry of star-forming nurseries lying near the edge of the known universe.
During one observing run, the atmosphere in the control room at one of the twin telescopes of the Keck Observatory in Hawaii was especially tense because Miss Frye was trying out some new software. The idea was to align a narrow slit in the telescope with one spiral arm of a galaxy many millions of light-years away. Light shining through the slit was to be analyzed spectroscopically to reveal the chemical composition and motion of the spiral arm. 
 But a false step in manipulating the computer mouse added nine minutes to the "run," and the price of using one of the Keck telescopes is about one dollar a second, whether it produces new scientific insights or junk. Errors can wreck research budgets dependent on the Keck. Many nonastronomers regard astronomical research as a leisurely and agreeable form of star gazing, but real astronomers have little time even to look up at the stars.
When astronomers take their occasional breaks at the Keck Observatory, they sometimes prepare themselves for naked-eye viewing by inhaling a few deep breaths from a cylinder of oxygen; oxygen restores the normal light sensitivity of the eyes, which is noticeably diminished at 13,796 feet.
The tension of observing is only marginally relieved by soft music in the control room, where acoustic tiling muffles conversation. But the pressure of work and thin air takes its toll. Astronomers work almost to the point of exhaustion, 18 hours a day, all night every night and much of the day as well. Living conditions are Spartan at the Hale Pohaku dormitory halfway down the mountain, but at least the altitude there, 9,300 feet, is low enough to clear heads and permit sleep.
Working at the high altitudes where many observatories are built can make tempers flare. "High altitude sensitizes a person's temper the way a hair trigger sensitizes a revolver," an astronomer at the Keck Observatory said, "so we have to be very careful to avoid giving offense."
Despite the discomforts of the trade, Miss Frye and the other young astronomers on her team, Raja Guhathakurta and Gordon Squires, also from the University of California, find that the work is its own reward. The joy of scientific discovery, they say, is worth the hardships, low pay and uncertain employment.
Another young astronomer at the observatory, Dr. Lori Lubin, a postdoctoral researcher, is also hooked on the profession and has moved ahead much more rapidly than many other young astronomers.
Dr. Lubin, who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and received her doctorate from Princeton University, said: "People like me do astronomy because we love it, not to get rich."
Miss Frye, Dr. Lubin and a few other young people are proof that the field still has room for a few gifted and lucky newcomers to the field.
But many more are unlucky. Even as new technology heralds what promises to be a golden age of astronomical discovery, it has become almost as difficult to gain a foothold in professional astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology as it is for young actors to win starring roles in movies.
A recent survey by a national society of physicists found that recipients of Ph.D. degrees in astrophysics had a much harder time finding permanent employment immediately after earning their degrees than new Ph.D.'s in other branches of physics. Only 14 percent of the new doctorate recipients in astrophysics found permanent jobs immediately, contrasted with 75 percent of those in optics and lasers.
The spokesman for the American Astronomical Society, Dr. Stephen P. Maran, of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Space Flight Center, warns students about dismal job prospects.
At a recent symposium held by NASA's Space Academy, Dr. Maran outlined the heady future of discoveries that are coming within the reach of new observatories, instruments and spacecraft. But he prefaced his talk with a warning: "Before I start telling you about all the great new instruments and technologies that astronomers are getting, I want you to know something: There are no jobs out there."
"When I was a graduate student in the early 1960's," Dr. Maran said, "people like me had their own apartments and lived moderately well. Today's young Ph.D.'s live in group houses with low salaries and no tenure, and they may spend the rest of their careers chasing one short-term grant after another."
Computers and electronic replacements of old-fashioned photographic film have revolutionized astronomy, but they have also eliminated some of the charms of traditional observatories. Observers often used to ride inside their telescopes, seated in tiny cabins called prime-focus cages where they could feel the cold air and look up at the stars in solitude while they worked. But few telescopes require film plates anymore -- or people to expose and change them -- so astronomers can no longer enjoy the thrill of isolation from earthly distractions while peering up into the sparkling cosmos.
In some cases, the controls of major telescopes are thousands of miles away. The New Technology Telescope on La Silla Mountain in Chile, for example, is operated remotely by astronomers at computer consoles in Garching, Germany.
Compared with the numbers of scientists in other fields, there are not many astronomers: about 6,000 in the United States and roughly double that number for the whole world. The number of astronomers who regularly garner observing time at the biggest and best telescopes is far smaller, and many of them have ties to California. Most of the largest telescopes are privately financed and operated, sometimes with the help of Federal or state aid.
The traditional center of astronomy in the United States is California, partly because the sky is usually clear over some of the state's mountains but also because California observatories have been richly financed by private benefactors.
Typical of those who have sponsored big-time astronomy was James Lick, an immensely successful 19th-century San Francisco real estate speculator. Lick wanted to build a monument to himself, and he planned to erect a full-size replica of Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza. But astronomers talked him out of it, convincing him that the money could be better spent on an observatory.
The result was the Lick Observatory near Santa Cruz. It inspired another philanthropist, Charles T. Yerkes, who had made a fortune developing Chicago's mass transportation system, to endow a competing observatory at Williams Bay, Wis.
In the tradition established by Lick and Yerkes, William M. Keck, founder of the Superior Oil Company (now part of the Mobil Corporation) endowed a foundation in 1954 that led to the creation of a pair of nearly identical telescopes, both larger than any other in existence. The first Keck telescope was finished in 1993 and the second was inaugurated last May. Together they cost about $180 million, 80 percent of which was paid by the W. M. Keck Foundation.
The Keck telescopes were built in Hawaii, but, like their smaller siblings -- at the Lick Observatory, the Hale Observatory's 200-inch telescope on Mount Palomar and other major telescopes -- they are operated by the University of California. With certain exceptions, astronomers who wish to observe at these great instruments must be affiliated with a branch of the University of California.
For most outsiders, the alternatives are limited.
Open to all Americans (and many non-Americans) whose projects are deemed worth are three observatories operated by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories and financed by the Federal Government, largely through the National Science Foundation. Two of these, Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona and the National Solar Observatory in New Mexico, observe objects in the Northern Hemisphere, and the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in Chile covers the Southern Hemisphere.
A similar Federal system, the National Radio Astronomy Observatories, operates huge radio telescopes in New Mexico, Puerto Rico, West Virginia and elsewhere.
Federal support for optical observatories has been repeatedly trimmed, however, and as the National Optical Astronomy Observatories builds a pair of 8.1-meter (26.6-foot) telescopes called Gemini -- one on Mauna Kea in Hawaii and the other at Cerro Tololo -- the agency is considering closing some existing telescopes to save money. Among the ones that could be closed are some of the smaller telescopes at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona.
Dr. Robert W. Milkey, executive director of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, said it was nearly impossible to estimate the overall financing of astronomy by private benefactors. But it is certain that private support is vital.
Government contributions are easier to estimate. Dr. Richard F. Green, deputy director of the federally supported National Optical Astronomy Observatories, estimates that the National Science Foundation contributes about $100 million a year for the optical and radio telescopes it operates and that NASA, the other major Federal agency financing astronomy, contributes somewhat more than $100 million, not including money spent launching instruments into space.
Although the National Science Foundation budget for astronomy is expected to rise by 6 percent in the coming year, Dr. Green said, that will not defray the 35 percent decline in support that federally supported observatories have suffered since 1984.
That is one of the reasons, Dr. Green said, that of about 170 students who are awarded doctoral degrees in astronomy each year, only about one-tenth find permanent university jobs. Most of the rest must settle for temporary employment as postdoctoral research fellows or turn to other professions.
At a recent groundbreaking ceremony for a new telescope array at Mount Wilson, Calif., an astronomer commented under her breath, "It's great, isn't it? But if nobody's willing to pay astronomers anymore, who will run it when it's finished?"
 The article also referred incompletely to the management of the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Along with the University of California, Caltech is a manager.

HEADLINE: Jean Hewitt, 71, Home Economist and Food Writer for The Times

BYLINE: By ENID NEMY 

 BODY:
Jean D. Hewitt, a former food writer and home economist for The New York Times and an early advocate of natural foods, died on Sunday in the Bon Secours-Venice Hospital in Venice, Fla. She was 71 and made her home in Venice.
The cause was pneumonia, the family said. 
 Mrs. Hewitt planned The Times's test kitchen and was in charge of it from its opening in 1969. At the time, a number of newspapers employed home economics graduates as food writers and set up kitchens on the premises to test food and recipes.
In 1971, Mrs. Hewitt made headlines across the country when she tested the recipe for Tricia Nixon's wedding cake. She found the lemon-flavored cake inedible -- "mush on the outside and soup on the inside" -- and wrote that it left the oven in a mess. The problem, she decided, was too many egg whites and not enough yolks. She also suggested that the oven temperature be increased and the baking time lengthened.
The White House chef countered by saying that he had forgotten to mention that a collar was required for the pan. Later, however, more corrections were made.
In addition to developing and testing recipes, Mrs. Hewitt wrote a number of New York Times Cook Books, including "Main Dish," "Heritage" and "Weekend." Her "Large Type Cook Book" and "New Natural Foods Cook Book" were forerunners in their respective fields, as was her "International Meatless Cook Book." Four of her books received James Beard Food and Beverage Book Awards.
She joined The Times in 1961 as an assistant to Craig Claiborne, the food editor and restaurant reviewer. In addition to those duties, she researched and wrote about food and reviewed New Jersey restaurants.
In 1975, she was named food editor of Family Circle, a Times Company publication, where she wrote more books, including the "Family Circle Quick and Easy Menu Cook Book." She retired in 1993.
Born in Ipswich, England, in 1925, she moved to New York during World War II, after studying at the Westminster School for Chefs in London. She was a charter member of Les Dames d'Escoffier and a lifetime fellow of the Culinary Institute of America.
Mrs. Hewitt held degrees in food and nutrition from the University of London and Columbia University.
Her first husband, Dr. Eric J. Hewitt, whom she married in 1949, died in 1976. In 1983, she married James Blair of Venice, who survives her. She is also survived by two sons, Gordon Hewitt of Annapolis, Md., and Geoffrey Hewitt of Westfield, N.J.

HEADLINE: G. Stockton Strawbridge, 83, Dies; Retail Industry Executive

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
G. Stockton Strawbridge, who helped transform Strawbridge & Clothier from a small family dry goods store into a department store empire that girdled the Philadelphia area, died at his home in Newtown Square, Pa. on Saturday. He was 83.
In a career that spanned more than half a century, Mr. Strawbridge put a modern face on stores he labeled dull as a young man, expanded into the suburbs before the rival John Wanamaker stores and helped to develop the Cherry Hill Mall in New Jersey, the first enclosed mall east of Chicago. He also jumped into discount retailing, starting Clover Stores in 1969. 
 And he is credited with leading a $14 million restoration of East Market Street in Philadelphia. The goal, Mr. Strawbridge once told a reporter, was to turn the nation's oldest commercial street into the "Champs-Elysees of Philadelphia."
But despite all his success, Mr. Strawbridge suffered crushing disappointment months before his death.
After years of working to keep the business in the family, an objective he once told an interviewer was "ever present, comparable to inhaling and exhaling," Strawbridge & Clothier was sold last July for $600 million to the May Department Store Company of St. Louis.
Even though Strawbridge & Clothier was in failing financial health, Mr. Strawbridge, who had retired from active management in 1989, three years after successfully fending off a hostile takeover attempt, was violently opposed to the sale. When it was completed, he said it was a deal he could "never forgive."
The decision to sell led to a falling out with his son, Peter S. Strawbridge, who was the last chairman of Strawbridge & Clothier and who backed the deal. The two reconciled recently, family friends said.
Telephone calls to the Strawbridge family were not returned.
Peter Hearn, Mr. Strawbridge's lawyer, told Philadelphia newspapers on Sunday that it was "significant" that Mr. Strawbridge died so soon after the sale.
"He was the store, and the store was him," Mr. Hearn said in an interview with The Philadelphia Daily News.
Rhonda West, a spokeswoman for the May Company, said "both Philadelphia and the retailing industry have lost a great leader."
Even though he spent most of his adult life at the store his grandfather, Julius C. Strawbridge, opened with Isaac H. Clothier in 1868, flying, not retailing, was Mr. Strawbridge's great love.
As a teen-ager, Mr. Strawbridge tried to persuade his parents to allow him to forgo completing his studies at the William Penn Charter School in order to get his pilot's license. But he did convince his father to pay for advanced aviation training instead of college.
"I never had the remotest idea of going into retailing," Mr. Strawbridge told a reporter more than 39 years ago. "But in the 1930's, aviation suffered an economic setback. I got married and, out of necessity, went into retailing."
Despite a Quaker upbringing, Mr. Strawbridge enlisted in the Navy days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. During the course of World War II he flew 4,000 hours as a transport pilot.
Mr. Strawbridge, who was known as Stock, rather than George, his given name, started work at the company's flagship store at Eighth and Market Streets in 1934, as a clerk tracing consumer complaints.
After serving in a number of other posts throughout the organization, and taking time off to fight in the war, Mr. Strawbridge was named president of Strawbridge & Clothier in 1955. He served in that post for 12 years, another dozen as chairman of the board and 12 more years as head of the company's executive committee. Even after his mandatory retirement at age 75, he often sat in on board meetings as a nonvoting member.
An active and adventurous man, Mr. Strawbridge toured Antarctica by boat and once climbed the scaffolding that for years surrounded the statue of William Penn, high atop Philadelphia's City Hall. At the age of 77, he bungee-jumped from a hot-air balloon.
Besides his wife, the former Mary Lowry, and his son Peter, Mr. Strawbridge is survived by three other sons, Steven, Michael and Arthur; two daughters, Susan S. Williams and Polly S. Carpenter; 14 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. All live in the Philadelphia area.

Coffee Prices Jump as Strike In Colombia May Cut Exports

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Coffee prices jumped yesterday as a strike in Colombia began, threatening to delay exports from the world's second-largest grower.
On other markets, gold and silver prices fell. 
 An estimated 300,000 Colombian Government and state-industry workers walked off the job yesterday to protest wages, labor rights and plans to sell state assets.
The Colombian National Coffee Growers Federation's general manager, John Naranjo, said, "There was little coffee moving to the ports today." Private exporters contradicted those reports, though, saying shipments were normal.
Still, the possibility of a delay to Colombian coffee exports when Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange warehouse stockpiles are 75 percent lower than last year was enough to lift prices for the fourth straight day.
"People are scared about the Colombian strike and the market is trading like it," said Andrew Gordon, chief executive at the Coffee Holding Company, a roasting and packaging company in Brooklyn.
Coffee for March delivery soared 4.90 cents, to $1.6355 a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the highest price for the most-active contract since May 19, 1995. Coffee prices received an additional lift after the Procter & Gamble Company said it had raised prices on its Folgers brand of coffee by 10 cents to 15 cents a can, beginning next month.
Gold fell to its lowest price in almost four years, and silver fell also, as demand from investors continued to wither amid signs that inflation is tame.
Worker productivity during the fourth quarter rose a larger-than-expected 2.2 percent as labor costs grew at a slower pace, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Signs of subdued growth of labor costs eased demand for gold and silver. Some investors buy the two precious metals to guard against rising inflation, which erodes the value of interest-bearing assets such as bonds.
April gold fell $1.20, to $341.90 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest price for the most-active contract since April 22, 1993. March silver tumbled 12.2 cents, to $4.838 an ounce, the lowest since Jan. 22.

Little Change In Treasuries At Auction

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended little changed yesterday, as a sale of new three-year notes largely matched expectations. With two more Treasury auctions this week, however, market participants were reluctant to buy.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 1/32, to 97 14/32, leaving the yield unchanged at 6.70 percent, where it has ended for three consecutive sessions. Most shorter maturities of three years or less were unchanged, and longer maturities ended with slightly higher yields.
Dealers and traders set up for yesterday's $17.75 billion three-year Treasury note auction with the expectation that it would be the easiest to sell, so prices of securities were little changed until the results were released. The average yield on the notes was 5.997 percent, with demand a bit on the weak side.
Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of government bond trading at Cowen & Company, called yesterday's auction results mediocre, with the bid to cover, or the amount of bids versus the amount of securities available, less than average. The average bid to cover has been 2.5 to 1; yesterday's was 2.22 to 1.
The dollar's firmness in currency trading yesterday helped minimize investor concern that foreign investors would not be strong participants during the Treasury's quarterly refunding this week. Traders said the three-year note auction showed domestic demand, but today's 10-year note auction and tomorrow's 30-year bond sale would indicate whether there was demand from foreign investors, historically the biggest buyers of United States debt.
"Last year about 75 percent of U.S. Treasury securities sold at auction were bought by foreign investors and central banks," said Sung Won Soh, senior vice president and chief economist of the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "The 10-year note sale will give a better look of what to expect for the remainder of the refunding."
Today the Treasury will sell $12 billion of 10-year notes and tomorrow $10 billion of 30-year bonds. In when-issued trading the 10-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.37 percent and the 30-year maturity at a price to yield 6.64 percent.
Mr. Gamba said he expected the 10-year note auction to go fairly well because there was a significant spread between foreign 10-year bond issues and the Treasury 10-year note.
Yesterday's economic data had little impact. The Labor Department reported that worker productivity grew at the fastest rate in the fourth quarter in three years as labor costs slowed. The report indicated that inflation remained tame and that the Federal Reserve might not need to raise short-term interest rates.
Still, the weekly LJR Redbook survey of retail sales showed strength, with sales up 2.5 percent last week. "Even though the report suggests retail demand was strong in January, as long as inflation is benign, the market can accept these stronger numbers," Mr. Gamba said.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-year notes:

HEADLINE: 2.2% Rise in Productivity Is Best Since '93

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Worker productivity grew at the fastest rate in three years at the end of 1996, the Government said today, reinforcing a picture of a healthy economy with little inflation.
The Labor Department said productivity outside of the farm sector rose 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, a sharp improvement from the third quarter, when productivity was flat. It was the largest increase since a 2.8 percent productivity gain in the fourth quarter of 1993.
The increase slightly exceeded the 2.1 percent increase that Wall Street economists expected.
Still, most experts were not surprised by the increase given the 4.7 percent growth rate in gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the nation's economy, in the fourth quarter.
"With G.D.P. growth up so strongly, you would expect to see big gains in productivity," said Joel Naroff, chief bank economist with the First Union Corporation.
Nevertheless, Mr. Naroff and other economists viewed continued gains in productivity, or output per worker per hour, as crucial to insuring that inflation remained in check.
Higher wages and the difficulty some businesses have had in finding skilled labor have raised concerns about rising labor costs fueling inflation.
Concerns about labor costs have led to speculation in the bond and stock markets that the Federal Reserve might raise short-term interest rates to head off inflation.
But Kathryn Kobe, an economist with Joel Popkin & Company, said, "Increases in productivity would allow the best of both worlds."
"Workers could enjoy wage increases while more efficiency on the part of businesses would prevent them from having to pass along those increases in the form of price rises," she said.
While the fourth-quarter productivity numbers provided reassurance about inflation for now, analysts questioned whether the trend would continue.
"The fourth-quarter numbers were very impressive, but it's not typical of what we can expect in the future," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation, noting that part of the gain was a "catch-up" from weak productivity growth in the third quarter.
For 1996, productivity rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, the best performance since a 3.2 percent rise in 1992. Productivity rose three-tenths of 1 percent in 1995.
In the fourth quarter, productivity rose as output soared 5.9 percent; the total number of hours worked rose 3.7 percent.
Unit labor costs, which make up two-thirds of companies' production costs, rose 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter after growing 3.3 percent the previous quarter.

HEADLINE: District's University Struggles to Survive

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
The University of the District of Columbia opened its doors 20 years ago as the only land-grant institution of higher education serving the nation's capital, and one of just a few in the country supported by a city.
Since then, thousands of students -- most of them black, low-income residents -- have taken advantage of its minimal entrance requirements and low tuition rates to prepare for careers as scientists, doctors, teachers and public officials. 
 But like the District itself, the university has fallen on hard times -- struggles that reflect the larger problems of the District's continuing fiscal and political crises, combined with ever-present tensions over race.
The skid at the university has become so pronounced, driving tuition costs up, that access to higher education could move well beyond the reach of many minority students, a battle many people thought was long since won.
"It makes me angry, angry that after fighting for civil rights 35 years ago in South Carolina, we're doing the same thing here," said Cherrie D. Williams, a program manager for a campus research group. "It's like the clock has stopped, and the issue hasn't changed: denying access to education to minorities."
For the current academic year, the university's appropriation from the city is $38 million, less than half of what it was six years ago. To help offset the loss, tuition costs are scheduled to rise for a third consecutive year in the fall, to $2,360 a semester from $1,850 for full-time students and to $75 a credit hour from $58 for part-time students. All intercollegiate athletic programs are being eliminated after this year.
And just last week, the university trustees approved a plan to dismiss more than a third of the university's work force -- 125 faculty members and 193 support staff -- to close an $18 million budget gap for the current fiscal year.
The overall effects are hitting the university hard. Enrollment has steadily fallen since 1990, with a 25 percent decline from last year alone, to a current student population of 7,464. And campus officials say classes that now have 20 students could increase to 45 in the fall.
"Morale is pretty low," said Maria Washington, a senior art major who is the fourth generation of her family to attend the university or one of its predecessors. "Most people I know are confused and concerned."
Since a federally appointed control board took over management of all city finances two years ago, spending cuts have become a way of life throughout the District government as it struggles to achieve a balanced budget for the first time in years.
But supporters of the university, which is on upper Connecticut Avenue in the middle of a comfortable white neighborhood, say the control board's cuts at the university are hurting the city's most vulnerable students, those who, because of low grades, poor test scores or financial circumstances, are blocked from attending private universities or other colleges in the area. The city university requires only a high school degree or the equivalent to enroll.
Administrators, faculty members and students, placed in the role of lobbying for their university by the waning city support, contend that low-income residents of the city have the same right to higher education as anyone else and have the same potential to become productive residents of a city badly in need of expanding its tax base.
And because work and family responsibilities mean that two-thirds of the students attend part time, stretching the time they need to graduate to six years or more, university supporters have also found themselves defending the institution against complaints that it is a luxury in a time of economic crisis.
"The school is identified as a school for African-Americans, and in a sense, it has been 'Willie Hortonized,' like it's O.K. to whip U.D.C. around," said Meredith Rode, an art professor at the university who is white. "That only perpetuates negative ideas that aren't true."
But Andrew F. Brimmer, an economist who was appointed chairman of the control board, said he was not persuaded by any of the social arguments.
"The university has a mission, and it ought to pursue the mission to the extent it has the funds than can achieve that mission," he said. "It has to do the best it can with what it has."
In formulating budget priorities for the city's 1998 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, the control board focused on improvements in three areas -- public safety, public schools and public works.
"The university," said Mr. Brimmer, who is black, "was not on the list."
The District university was born as a union of three public colleges with widely different programs -- Federal City College, a four-year liberal arts institution; D.C. Teachers College, a four-year college, and the Washington Technical Institute, a two-year vocational and trade school.
It remains one of just two four-year public universities in the country that derives most of its financial support from a city; the other is Washburn University in Topeka, Kan. All the others are supported primarily with state money, hundreds of millions of dollars annually at the larger institutions.
But over the years, the union of the District institutions proved to be more a merger than a consolidation. The new university tried to be all things to all students, offering majors in areas as diverse as English, aviation and gospel singing, and the mix put added strain on the annual budget.
University administrators said they intended to retain as many of the courses as possible in the future, but they acknowledged that fewer classes would be offered in the fall and that students would be counseled more rigorously to take courses that will help them land jobs in the metropolitan area.
"If there is student demand for other courses, we'll try to accommodate them to the extent we can," said Julius F. Nimmons Jr., who was named acting president of the university in November. Mr. Nimmons, succeeding Tilden J. LeMelle, who resigned under pressure from the control board, became the 10th person to serve as president, acting president or interim president since the union of the three institutions.
Mr. Brimmer blamed instability at the top and poor judgment for many of the problems that have beset the university. But students and faculty members direct much of their blame toward the control board, which was created by Congress and is viewed by many city residents as an occupation force that is supplanting local elected officials. And because most members of Congress are white, some university supporters, including Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., have suggested that racism has played a part in decisions affecting the university.
"Factually, U.D.C. is a predominantly black institution, and some people in town do not want a good opportunity for those students to get a higher education," Mr. Barry said in an interview last week. "It might be subconscious, but these people have a different philosophy about what's best for the university than I do."
One of those people, Mr. Barry said, is Mr. Brimmer, whom the Mayor described as being insensitive to the value of an institution that spends far less per student than the $25,000 a year it costs to keep one inmate at the city's Lorton Correctional Institute.
"I don't know what the philosophy of the control board is," said Mr. Barry, whose wife, Cora Masters Barry, once taught political science at the university. "It's a lot different than mine."
Twice in the last 12 months, cuts in the university budget brought racial politics into the open. In each case, Mr. Barry was in the middle of it.
Last March, he joined hundreds of university students blocking traffic on Connecticut Avenue. The demonstration lasted 14 hours. Before he left, Mayor Barry told the students, "There are people on the D.C. Council and in the Congress who want to destroy this university."
Then, in December, shortly after the control board asked university officials to find $16.2 million in spending cuts, the Mayor took aim at Kathy Patterson, a white council member who was pushing hard for all city agencies not to exceed their budgets. He said, "Some people don't want blacks and young black adults to get a quality education."
In the interview, Mr. Barry softened his criticism of Ms. Patterson, saying he did not intend to single her out. But he insisted that a student population that is almost 75 percent black is an easy target for derision -- and budget cuts.
Faculty members like Thomas Stewart, a professor of political science, only shake their head at what they view as a steady assault on the university. After listening to President Clinton stress the need for educational opportunities in his State of the Union address last Tuesday, Mr. Stewart said he could not understand why the message has not reached the control board.
"Here we are, based in the nation's capital, and so little effort is focused on enhancing what we do," he said. "The perception is, we're low-income people who shouldn't receive an education because of test scores and money. But we have success stories here. We just don't have the support."

HEADLINE: Elite Schools See Numbers Of Applicants Leveling Off

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
After zooming to record highs last year, applications to many of the nation's most competitive colleges and universities are tapering off. But it is a development that college admissions officers say is not surprising.
"It's a market correction," said Karl Furstenberg, dean of admissions and financial aid at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. 
 Last year, Harvard University, for example, received more than 18,000 applicants for the 1,620 openings in its freshman class. That set a record and meant that fewer than 10 percent could be admitted. The year before, Harvard accepted 12 percent of those who applied; 5 years before that, it was 16 percent.
The kind of increases seen at Harvard also occurred at the other seven schools in the Ivy League, among them Cornell, Dartmouth and the University of Pennsylvania. Other elite institutions were similarly inundated.
This year, application decreases among the elite schools run from 8 percent at Yale and Harvard to 1 percent at Brown University. The only exception in the Ivy League is Columbia University, which reported a 9 percent increase. Another exception among the elite colleges is Swarthmore, just outside Philadelphia, where applications rose by 6 percent.
Admissions officials explained the overall increase in applications in recent years by pointing out that many parents considered a degree from an elite school to be the best possible ticket to success for their children in an era of economic uncertainty.
But now it appears that the trend may have run its course.
"There are always several things going on at once in admissions," said William R. Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid at Harvard.
"When we heard last year that Yale, Princeton and Stanford had switched to early-decision -- which is a binding program for those who wish to apply early -- we knew that the number of applicants would fall off. Normally, all of those students would have applied to as many as six or eight other institutions.
"A second reason for the fall-off," he continued, "is that all the talk about how you have to apply 'early decision' discourages the regular applicants. They figure the odds are too long, and they don't bother to apply" to elite colleges.
Finally, Mr. Fitzsimmons said, a number of students were falsely encouraged to apply last year by a change in the scoring of the Scholastic Assessment Test that elevated the scores of thousands of students. Many of these students applied to schools well beyond their reach and were not accepted.
"So this year's crop saw that and said to themselves: 'If Susie couldn't get in, then I don't stand a chance,' and they didn't apply," Mr. Fitzsimmons said.
Mr. Fitzsimmons said the decline represented "a return to sanity and the end of a craze of applying practically to any place in sight."
On the other hand, admissions officers said that Columbia's continued increase in applications reflected the perception that New York City was a safe place in which to live. They said applicants were being attracted to Swarthmore in record numbers because the school was ranked first among small liberal arts colleges last fall by U.S. News and World Report.
Michael Goldberger, director of admissions at Brown University, dismissed the 1 percent decline in applicants at his school as an inconsequential fluctuation. "We've had a steady incline for five or six years," he said, "and now it's off a little. I think Harvard will survive, and so will we."

HEADLINE: From the Wings, a Prayer: A Black Troupe Improvises

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
It was the first day of rehearsals for a new production, and that meant there was a ritual to adhere to, a tradition to uphold. So administrators and employees of the Crossroads Theater Company in New Brunswick, N.J., and the cast of "Wedding Dance" fanned out, held hands and bowed heads.
"This space belongs to you," the company's artistic director and co-founder, Ricardo Khan, said as he gazed at the 30 other people in the loop, all but 4 of whom were, like him, black. "This place is ours." 
 Then, in a grave voice, he intoned the company's mission, beginning with the vow "to provide a professional environment for artists in black theater to develop, explore and practice their craft."
A 264-seat auditorium decorated with kente cloth and other iconography of African-American culture and history, Crossroads is the name and place singled out by the black playwright August Wilson over the last eight months as a model of what black theater can and should be.
In remarks that have kindled a vigorous debate among intellectuals and artists, Mr. Wilson said that attempts to diversify American theater through such practices as color-blind casting were in fact harmful and condescending to African-Americans. What African-Americans in nonprofit theater need most, he argued, is not more participation in predominantly white theater companies, but stages of their own, run by black directors, showcasing black writers and actors, catering to black audiences, sustained by black support.
And Crossroads, he pointed out, is the only such arena in the country's elite League of Resident Theaters, an association of 67 nonprofit companies. "We need to have six or seven more just like Crossroads," Mr. Wilson said in a telephone conversation this week.
To visit Crossroads and to talk with its administrators and patrons is to understand immediately why it has emerged as an ideal. The characters in the original works that it showcases are black Africans rattling the chains of apartheid and black Americans battling the ills of the inner city.
Last season, it produced a revival of Mr. Wilson's "Piano Lesson," and this season it will produce another, "Jitney." The black playwrights and directors it has helped nurture include George C. Wolfe, the producer of the Joseph Papp Public Theater in Manhattan. And the audience includes black people who travel more than two hours in buses chartered by churches and community colleges and professional societies to observe and honor a caliber of black theater they say is hard to find.
Yet Crossroads is neither an unqualified success nor an exact realization of Mr. Wilson's vision. It is, in fact, an example of how slippery it can be to define black theater, of how hard it is to keep a black resident company solvent and of the forces -- in addition to the artists' passion and initiative -- that are necessary.
"People come to this space and see how beautiful it is, and they don't realize we're hurting for money," Mr. Khan said of the $4 million auditorium -- complete with gift shop, bookstore and even a small exercise space -- that a consortium of public and private benefactors built for Crossroads in 1991.
To get off the ground 19 years ago, Crossroads benefited from a level of government munificence no longer available. To grow, it has relied on a degree of benevolence from private foundations that is increasingly uncertain. And to survive, it recognizes the importance of building not only its black audience, but also its white one, which fills about 25 percent of the seats.
Indeed, while Mr. Wilson's argument was tinged with separatism in the eyes of some critics, the atmosphere at Crossroads is decidedly not. Mr. Khan wants a diversity of racial groups to see dignified images of African-Americans and nuanced explorations of their lives, to foster understanding between them. But integration at Crossroads also seems to be a matter of economic necessity. White membership on its board of trustees, which functions in part as a link to the many corporations with headquarters in New Jersey, has at times approached 40 percent. (It is about 20 percent now.)
And while the company's administrators are dedicated foremost to work that satisfies its core audience of African-Americans, its managing director, Steven Warnick, who is white, said that the limited black audience for noncommercial theater in and around New Brunswick compelled Crossroads to find ways to attract more whites.
Crossroads has had enough money only since 1991 to pay the union-scale wages required for membership in the national league, and it is among the smallest members in terms of its seats and operating budget of $2.2 million. That pays for a September to May season of five productions and a new-play festival for staged readings of developing works. While average nonprofit theaters earn more than 60 percent of their income, Crossroads earns just 50 percent. Over a season, about 25 percent of the seats go unfilled.
To be sure, most regional theaters struggle just as Crossroads does to draw theatergoers to plays without big stars, gimmicky effects and lauded playwrights. But to those challenges, Crossroads adds another: developing and marketing work that speaks to one ethnic group in particular.
"It's difficult for all not-for-profit theaters, but it's lethal when you add black to that," said Douglas Turner Ward, a founder and former artistic director of the Negro Ensemble Company in New York. There are, of course, worlds of black theater beyond the league. One embraces the low-brow melodramas that travel through a chain of inner-city theaters, described recently by Henry Louis Gates Jr. in a New Yorker article titled "The Chitlin Circuit." Another is the more high-minded productions by respected black companies like Penumbra in St. Paul that perhaps cannot afford the union-scale pay required for league membership. But the league's membership list is nonetheless a yardstick, and Crossroads' singular status reflects limited opportunities for black theatrical artists.
Scarce opportunities are precisely what led Mr. Khan to start Crossroads in 1978, the year after he graduated from Rutgers University with a master's degree in fine arts and dual ambitions to act and direct. When he surveyed the landscape for black artists, he said, he saw desolate terrain.
"The only roles available for black men were pimps or drug dealers or drug addicts or ex-convicts or convicts," Mr. Khan said. "I don't believe in separatism, but I do believe in righting the wrongs, especially when it comes to the images of black people in this society."
With a Rutgers classmate who has since left Crossroads, Mr. Khan began the company with a $225,000 grant not from a Government arts program, but from a Government jobs program, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act.
Mr. Khan used that money to convert a former sewing factory in New Brunswick into a makeshift auditorium with only 130 seats. A bulky Y-shaped beam bisected the stage.
"It was a tree in one play, a room divider in another," Mr. Khan said.
Although Mr. Khan strived to provide opportunities for black playwrights, he did not take the hard line recently advocated by Mr. Wilson against black directors and actors mounting plays by white authors. He does not take that line now, either.
Over the years, Crossroads put on productions of "American Buffalo," by David Mamet, "Zoo Story," by Edward Albee, "Agnes of God," by John Pielmeier.
It also attracted, or successfully solicited, grants from the New Jersey State Council of the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts and an array of foundations.
Mr. Wilson says that foundations are a major impediment to quality black theater because their members satisfy their liberal impulses by giving money to white companies that make stabs at ethnic diversity. But Mr. Khan says he has not felt shortchanged by foundations. Crossroads' smallest source of contributions is from individuals, perhaps, its directors say, because blacks as a group do not have the same wealth as whites.
Crossroads has benefited from the good fortune of time and place. In the 1980's, New Brunswick, with the artistic aspirations of a university town, formed a group of civic officials and philanthropists under the banner of the New Brunswick Cultural Center Inc. and that organization built the auditorium that Crossroads inhabits.
The company pays a reasonable rent of $55,000 a year. Even so, Crossroads has struggled to make ends meet, leaning heavily on benefactors. In 1991, Bill Cosby gave five benefit performances, raising more than $200,000 for the company. Since then, the company has gradually but decisively pulled back from an economic precipice, whittling its debt from $1.7 million just two years ago to about $600,000 now.
There is constant tension, the directors and trustees say, between promoting the challenging original work by black playwrights that few other resident companies sponsor and staging the established plays and musicals that increase ticket sales.
The mission of Crossroads, it turns out, is one thing; ticket sales are quite another. While about three dozen theatergoers at Friday's performance of "The Meeting" lingered after the show for a salon-style discussion of its themes, the majority of middle-class and upper-middle-class African-Americans in the audience, who had paid $20 to $25 for their seats, headed home for Somerset, Plainfield, Montclair or Princeton.
For some, coming to Crossroads was neither a statement nor an act of ethnic pride. It was simply a night at the theater more convenient than Broadway or Off Broadway.
"There's no Holland Tunnel, no Lincoln Tunnel," said Norward Harris of Westfield, N.J. "And when you walk out, your car hasn't been towed."

HEADLINE: Bear Stearns Is Negotiating For Space in Proposed Tower

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Bear Stearns & Company, the investment bank that has crisscrossed Manhattan for the last three years looking for a new home, is considering moving to a proposed 55-story tower on Seventh Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets.
The building, Rockefeller Plaza West, was first approved by the city in 1990 for the site, which is currently a parking lot. But the tower, which would stretch Rockefeller Center's presence a half-block west, might have to go through the city's seven-month review process again because of the design changes required by Bear Stearns. 
 If a deal can be struck with the current landowner, the Rockefeller Center Development Corporation, the tower would include up to 10 cavernous floors at the base for the bank's trading operations.
Bear Stearns, which wants to be a co-owner of the building, is the largest of many tenants scouring a resurgent midtown market, where rents are inching upward and developers are itching to build. But for now, the investment bank appears to be the most likely tenant for the Rock West tower, as it is called, according to real estate experts.
"We're in the market for space," said William J. Montgoris, chief operating officer at Bear Stearns who is leading the search for new quarters. "We've got several alternatives. Rock West is one of them. Hopefully we'll get everything resolved by the end of the year."
To build a 55-story tower, Rockefeller Center Development would also have to buy 466,000 square feet of unused development rights, or air rights, from the new owners of Rockefeller Center itself, Tishman Speyer Properties, Goldman Sachs & Company and David Rockefeller.
Jonathan D. Green, president of Rockefeller Center Development, a subsidiary of the Rockefeller Group, confirmed that he has held discussions with Bear Stearns, adding that his company also is considering building a smaller tower for other tenants currently in the market for space, like Reuters. "We've been working on what we'd do if a tenant like Bear Stearns wanted more and larger floors at the base," he said.
Bear Stearns's current lease at 245 Park Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets, expires in 2002, and the building is in need of extensive renovations. Last year, Bear Stearns struck a deal with CS First Boston to buy an entire block at 383 Madison Avenue, at 46th Street, for a new tower. But First Boston's partner, the al-Babtain family of Saudi Arabia, bought it instead.
Bear Stearns then began talks with Mr. Green. The bank is also negotiating with its current landlord, and is being wooed by several of the developers who hope to build a commercial and residential complex on the site of the Coliseum at the southwest corner of Central Park, a project that is 5 to 10 years away.
"Rock West is the most likely site," said a director of Bear Stearns who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"It's too disruptive to have to move around the Park Avenue building" as floors are renovated, he said, "and I don't think we can wait for delivery of the Coliseum site."
The Rock West site has served as something of a barometer of the real estate market. Mr. Green began assembling the property in 1980, as the real estate boom began. But by the time Mr. Green bought the land, demolished the buildings and obtained city approval in 1990, the recession had cut property values in half and pushed the vacancy rate for midtown office buildings to a devastating 17.6 percent. Now, with rents rising and the vacancy rate at 10 percent, Rock West is one of only four major sites for a new development in midtown.

HEADLINE: Caldor, in 700-Job Trim, Says It Will Close 2 Stores

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
In a setback to neighborhood redevelopment efforts, Caldor Corporation, the nation's fourth-largest discount department store, announced yesterday that it was closing one store in Brooklyn and one in the Bronx as part of its continuing effort to climb out of bankruptcy proceedings.
The stores, on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn and Fordham Road in the Bronx, are expected to be closed in May, with a loss of more than 700 jobs. Two other Caldor stores, in Westfield, Mass., and Woonsocket, R.I., were also scheduled to be closed because of poor results, the company said. 
 From a business perspective, the closings were not surprising. Caldor, based in Norwark, Conn., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September 1995 and has been steadily shedding stores. And Caldor is just the latest regional discount chain -- Jamesway and Bradlees are others -- that has fallen on hard times in recent years, crippled by the growing dominance of national big-box retailers like Wal-Mart and Kmart.
But from the local perspective, the closings are a blow to efforts to revitalize neighborhoods.
"When Caldor came in a few years, it was a big boost to what was happening then to rebuild the area," said City Councilman Jose Rivera, whose offices are across the street from the Caldor on Fordham Road. "So the fact that they're closing is not only a blow to the Bronx; it's a blow to the entire city."
In 1995, Caldor operated 172 stores in the 10 northeast states, and it ranked as the nation's fourth-largest discount chain, trailing Wal-Mart, Kmart and the Dayton Hudson Corporation's Target Stores division.
But in the face of competition, Caldor's sales declined. In the third quarter of 1996, the company reported a loss of $47.96 million on revenues of $2.7 billion, compared with a loss of $32.6 million for the same period in 1995.
The company, which will be reduced to 157 stores, has tried to turn things around recently, submitting a five-year business plan in December that is now being reviewed by creditors.
"These locations have not met our targets for some time, and are unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future," Warren Feldberg, chairman and chief executive officer of Caldor said in a statement. Caldor's stock closed yesterday at $2 a share, down 25 cents.
In New York City, the number of Caldor stores will drop to six; still remaining are three in Queens and one each in Brooklyn, Staten Island and the Bronx.
The Flatbush store opened in July 1995 on a site that had been occupied by Macy's for decades. Some residents said Caldor could not quite find a niche among the neighborhood's mom-and-pop discount stores, but most said it filled a void because it offered low prices and a variety of items.
Alvin M. Berk, chairman of Brooklyn Community Board 14, said the closing would delay plans to build a parking lot linking the site to a nearby Sears store.
The story was similar in the Bronx: Caldor took over in October 1993 the former site of an Alexander's that had been vacant for several years. As with Brooklyn, the store seemed popular to many, but the numbers were not enough.
One customer, Maria Hernandez, 65, said she and her friend Anna Rivera had visited the food court in the store for many years, going back to when it was run by Alexander's.
"First, we had Alexander's, and that closed. Then this opened, and we like it, and now it'll be gone," she said. "The neighborhood will be empty without it. It's lonely to think of it as gone."

HEADLINE: U.S. Admiral Says Iraq, Aided by Iran, Is Smuggling Oil in Gulf

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain, Feb. 11

 BODY:
With help from Iran, tankers are smuggling oil out of Iraq in violation of United Nations sanctions, an American admiral said today.
The Iraqis and their Iranian protectors have had two confrontations with Navy warships in the last two weeks, ramming a United States frigate in one showdown. 
 While the amount being smuggled is modest, "our indications are that this is a rather sophisticated effort, centrally controlled within Iran," said Vice Adm. Thomas B. Fargo, commander of the Fifth Fleet.
The smuggling is one sign of the cooperation between the two former Persian Gulf enemies in trying to evade efforts to enforce the United Nations trade sanctions on Iraq.
But the main motive is money. Iraq, desperate to circumvent the embargo, is willing to sell the oil cheap, and a 2,000-ton shipment of oil can net $50,000, Admiral Fargo estimated. All together, the tankers are smuggling tens of thousands of tons of fuel oil every month, he said.
But the amount is small compared with the restricted sales of $2 billion of oil over six months that the United Nations has allowed. And that amount is about one-fifth of what Iraq exported before the gulf war.
Another Navy official in the gulf area, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Iraq also has other ways of smuggling oil. This official said that more contraband oil was being smuggled through other countries in the region, especially Jordan.
According to American investigators, crews of intercepted vessels have said that Iranian authorities take a cut of the profits. "A protection fee is paid to the Iranians that guarantees them safe passage through territorial waters," Admiral Fargo said.
The admiral said some smuggled oil is unloaded in the United Arab Emirates in the southern Persian Gulf.
The sanctions were imposed in 1990 by the United Nations to punish Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait. Since December, however, an exception has been made to allow the sale of limited amounts of Iraqi oil under United Nations supervision to allow Iraq to buy food and medicine.
But as legitimate shipments have begun to leave Iraqi ports, the smugglers have stepped up their work as well. "Through our reconnaissance capabilities, we can image these guys as they're loading up," Admiral Fargo said. The smuggling "has increased to 60,000 metric tons per month, due to the fact that there's a significant profit to be made," he said.
After picking up the fuel at ports on the Shatt al-Arab waterway, the ships -- not only small tankers, but also other vessels that flood their ballast tanks and compartments with the cargo -- hug the Iranian coast as they steam southward.
Admiral Fargo said some 30 vessels have been identified on this run, one having traversed the route at least nine times.
Both international law and treacherous shoals keep the deep-hulled American destroyers on patrol out of Iran's 15-mile-wide territorial waters. A watch officer aboard the American destroyer Cushing said crew members can detect the boats but cannot go after them.
Last week, the American detroyer Nicholson cut off and boarded a smuggler in international waters. An Iranian patrol boat, armed with missiles, suddenly arrived on the scene just as the Cushing steamed in to back up the Nicholson.
As the Iranian ship began to circle the American destroyers, the crews took up defensive positions on deck.
"It was hairy," a young officer aboard the Cushing recounted, speaking on the condition that he not be identified. "One little Iranian gunboat had two $800 million destroyers totally tied up."

HEADLINE: After Night in Jail, Jesse Jackson Appears Weary but Retains Old Zeal

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Looking weary in wrinkled corduroys, the Rev. Jesse Jackson flashed a thumbs-up sign this morning as he walked into a courtroom filled with sheriff's deputies, Mr. Jackson's supporters and the fading ghosts of 1960's street demonstrations.
Mr. Jackson had spent the night in the Cook County Jail, after being arrested on Monday afternoon at a protest over the treatment of black truckers at a construction site on the city's South Side. 
 The general contractor on the project, Paul H. Schwendener Inc., which was honored in 1992 by the Chicago Urban League for its minority hiring practices, "categorically" denied that its dismissal of a black subcontractor was racially motivated.
In the old days, when he was marching with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., spending a night in jail went with the job of being a civil rights worker. But Mr. Jackson is in his 50's now and is more likely to spend a night in the White House. He has a hard time remembering the last time he slept in a cell.
"I think it was in D.C. during a Free South Africa demonstration," he said. "It's been a while."
He may be out of practice at getting some sleep in jail, but Mr. Jackson always knows how to turn any event into a one-man show. Today was no different. He used his brief court appearance to address what he calls the new civil rights movement: the struggle for economic opportunity. "We want fairness," Mr. Jackson told the judge. "We want to open these markets up to everyone. These patterns of racist, sexist discrimination must end or I'll be back."
The judge shook Mr. Jackson's hand for the second time in 10 minutes and released him on a $5,000 bond.
Mr. Jackson, along with two other men, was arrested for blocking workers entering the site, a $43.7 million underground parking garage project at the Museum of Science and Industry. Mr. Jackson twice refused to be released on a signature bond, which would have spared him his night in jail.
The Monday afternoon protest had been brewing for months as Mr. Jackson and his Rainbow Coalition negotiated on behalf of the black subcontractor, Willie Carter, owner of Carter's Excavating & Grading. Schwendener said in a statement today that Mr. Carter had been dismissed because he Mr. Carter had failed to perform such obligations as paying vendors and keeping proper records.
Mr. Jackson said that the accusations against Mr. Carter were not true and that his dismissal was a blow to black economic development. "There's been a lot of focus on deadbeat dads who don't pay to support their children," Mr. Jackson said at a news conference shortly after he was released from jail. "But what about deadbeat corporations that don't honor the law, that don't hire?"
The company offered to rehire black truckers who had been hired by Mr. Carter. The truckers, however, have joined Mr. Jackson's protest and this morning they circled the construction site in a fleet of 20 horn-blowing dump trucks. At the urging of Mayor Richard M. Daley's office, the museum construction site was shut down today and the two sides are scheduled to resume negotiations on Friday.

HEADLINE: Memo From Prague;
Of Czechs and Jews and the Blinding of Memory

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Feb. 8

 BODY:
In the cemetery of the small Bohemian town of Letohrad, which was home to Madeleine K. Albright's forebears, there is a simple marble slab tucked away in a corner where the snow is untrodden. Dated 1930, it reads simply: "1914-1918: We gave our lives. You give love to your homeland."
The theme of one generation's sacrifice for the next has been a constant one in this waning century, not least in the bloodstained center of Europe from which the new Secretary of State's family came. 
 Josef Korbel, Ms. Albright's father, took the exhortation to heart, loving and serving the Czechoslovak state born out of World War I.
He later described the state as rising "phoenix-like from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian empire," rich in its "heritage of freedom." An assimilated Jew, he seems to have seen in Czechoslovakia's democratic gathering-in of diverse ethnic and religious groups -- Czechs, Germans, Slovaks, Ruthenians, Magyars and Jews -- a moving symbol of the progress and emancipation his own merchant family had enjoyed.
Then, within a decade of each other, the twin totalitarian forces of this century -- Nazi Fascism and Soviet Communism -- engulfed Czechoslovakia. The former annihilated his Jewish family, the latter the interwar democratic state he loved.
Mr. Korbel, having fled to America in 1948, chose to recall for his daughter Madeleine, and to write about, "the total perfidy of the Communist mind." What Nazism did to the Jewish Korbels was suppressed.
In his book, "The Communist Subversion of Czechoslovakia (1938-1948)" -- dedicated "to the Memory of my Parents" -- Mr. Korbel repeatedly assails "the long night of Communist totalitarianism."
He also deplores the killing of "patriotic leaders," the Germanization of Czech culture, the closing of universities and the pillaging of the economy under Nazi occupation.
But he does not mention the fate of the more than 100,000 Jews in his homeland, most of whom, like his mother and father, were killed by the Nazis during the period covered by the work.
This, it seems, is a selective kind of history, one that left his daughter unaware of the fate of her grandparents. Certainly, it appears to shun the solemn admonition of Vaclav Havel, the Czech President, who has written that the "special union" between ancestors and descendants "is one of the foundations of the existence of every sound human community aware of its identity."
But the extent to which such generational links were severed or distorted in this century by waves of violence and ideological warfare is becoming gradually clearer.
The cold war was also a war on history, on both sides of the divide. Somewhere in this struggle, Ms. Albright's past was buried. So, too, was the history of Nazi gold and plundered paintings in French museums.
This was, of course, particularly true behind the Iron Curtain. Communist morality, Lenin once said, is "the morality that serves the struggle." The same was true of Communist history.
One example is Terezin, known in German as Theresienstadt, the small fortress town 50 miles north of Prague where Ms. Albright's grandparents were persecuted as Jews and where her grandfather, Arnost Korbel, died.
For decades after the war, Czechoslovakia's Communist authorities distorted its history. A memorial recalled the suffering of Czech resistance fighters, particularly Communists, imprisoned there but scarcely mentioned the Jews. Lists of Jewish deportees were kept secret. The history of Terezin, as the place where Czechoslovakia's Jewish community was annihilated, was subordinated to the dictates of "anti-imperialism" and "anti-Zionism."
Today, a monumental cross towering over a field of graves -- dwarfing a Star of David -- suggests a certain ambiguity. But much has now been clarified. Within two years of Communism's fall in 1989, a new museum recalling the Jewish ghetto was opened. In 1995 a list was published of the more than 70,000 Jews who perished in Terezin, or after deportation from the town.
The names of Ms. Albright's paternal grandparents -- Arnost and Olga Korbel -- are in the 1,559-page list. Of the 999 Jews who arrived in Terezin with them on July 30, 1942, only 66 survived the war. Arnost Korbel perished in Terezin; several of Ms. Albright's relatives died at Auschwitz.
In the Czech Republic, which separated from Slovakia in 1993, the repeated oppression of this century has bred a deep understanding of the forces that lead to personal decisions like that of Josef and Mandula Korbel to convert their family to Catholicism and hide their Jewish descent.
The conversion took place in 1939 in London, when Madeleine Albright was 2, her cousin Dagmar Sima said. Mrs. Sima lived with the Korbel family in London during the war.
Lenka Matusikova, an archivist at the Central Archive in Prague, is not surprised by the Korbels' silence. "After the war," she said, "people were afraid to talk about their Jewish origin. Many Czechs only found out about their Jewish roots after the democratic changes. Now my desk is full of applications for genealogical research."
Shortly after the war, when Mr. Korbel was the Czechoslovak Ambassador in Belgrade, Josef Marek attended the baptism in the embassy of Ms. Albright's younger brother, Jan. Mr. Marek, chosen as godfather to Jan, had long known the Korbel family as Jews before the war. "But I found nothing strange in the ceremony," he said. "After all, they were completely assimilated Czechs. Madeleine's mother told me to be Jewish was always to risk persecution."
Even Dagmar Sima said the death of her parents at the hands of the Nazis "did not make me feel Jewish." Reared, like the Korbels, in an assimilated family, and baptized during the war in the quest for survival, she remained a secular Czech. But unlike Ms. Albright, she knew the family history and passed it on to her children.
She said: "My parents, my grandparents, Madeleine's family -- they all belonged to me in some way. My heart grew bigger for all of them. It is this, I think, that should be passed down the generations -- not the Jewish feeling necessarily, but the remembrance of the dead. I never for a moment suspected that she did not know."
In Terezin, as at Letohrad, the generations speak to each other across a gulf of suffering. A sign engraved on marble in the midst of the graves says: "The blood we lost flows again. We died so that our relatives could live."
Now, by a strange twist of fate, one of those relatives, Ms. Albright, appears likely to have the task of steering the Czech Republic into NATO, the Western alliance born out of the battle against Nazism to fight the battle against Communism.
Of such union with Western nations her father dreamed. Like much history these days, her own appears to have come full circle.

HEADLINE: Six Figures Of Fun;
It's Bonus Season On Wall Street

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
There they are again, the brash young men with slicked-back hair, prowling among the exotic sports cars in Steven Kessler's East 34th Street showroom. They finger the buttery leather seats of an $84,900 1993 Ferrari Mondial, or dicker over the $179,000 price of a 1994 Lamborghini Diablo.
From late December through March, Wall Street's bonus-paying season, when executives receive as much as five or six times their base pay in a lump sum, Mr. Kessler says he makes 80 percent of his sales to stock and bond traders with money burning holes in their pockets. 
 "They are young, aggressive people who are able to make decisions spontaneously," Mr. Kessler said. "They come to see what's in inventory, and when they receive their bonus checks -- bingo."
Unlike most businesses, Wall Street rewards its workers strictly according to the previous year's results, and 1996 was spectacular. The securities industry's 150,000 workers in New York City are expected to pull down bonuses of more than $8.1 billion, 30 percent higher than the previous high of $6.2 billion in 1995, according to the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall. (That's an average of $54,000 a person, with bonuses ranging from $10 million or more for the biggest winners to a few thousand for the lowliest clerks.)
Although Wall Street employs only about 5 percent of the city's private work force, the big year-end paychecks have a disproportionate effect on the local and regional economy, buoying everything from apartment prices to windfall tax revenues that can be sprinkled like stardust by City Hall in an election year.
Big bonuses also have an effect on the cultural climate of the city. In stores and restaurants there are numerous signs of a return to luxe. New York magazine recently published a buying guide to custom goods, which included "basic" dress shirts for $190 and shoes made on hand-carved lasts of Canadian maple for $1,350.
There is much discussion on Wall Street of how the prosperity of the late 1990's differs from that of the often vulgar 80's, the era of "greed is good," when many thought the party would last forever. Now many Wall Streeters say they are spending bonuses less flamboyantly, investing for the long term in the knowledge that what goes up also comes down.
But in the full flush of bonus season, when 25-year-old Masters of the Universe roam the city, ordering $12 martinis made with Ketel One vodka at the Four Seasons Hotel bar and $125 tasting dinners at Nobu in TriBeCa, self-restraint can be hard to find.
Dan Rubin, who had parked his Acura NSX-T sports car outside Steven Kessler Motor Cars on East 34th Street in Manhattan recently, entered the showroom of bright red Ferraris and sleek Lotuses with his fiancee and said, "We're looking for something more fun."
Mr. Rubin dropped out of Princeton in 1994 to start Rubin Investors Group, a private company that had a banner year, he said, thanks in part to betting on the Internet. "I trade big positions in small companies and terrorize the chairman," he said with a supreme air of assurance.
Besides shopping for a new car, he had just bought a ski house at Stratton Mountain, Vt.
Many on Wall Street, of course, are not making extravagant sums. Only about 1,500 in the top tier of traders, analysts and investment bankers take home more than $1 million in total pay, according to compensation experts.
At the very top, the nearly 200 partners of Goldman, Sachs & Company made between $4 million and $8 million apiece, according to people at the firm, although much of it is reinvested in the firm until they leave. Alan C. Greenberg, the chairman of Bear Stearns & Company, which had a record year for profits, made $18.8 million in 1996, according to the company.
The bonus system is deeply ingrained on Wall Street.
"In a five-minute meeting, they give you a piece of paper with a number on it," said an analyst at a major investment bank, who spoke on condition that neither he nor his firm be identified. "It's awesome. In some cases it's five, six or seven times your salary, your whole year in one payment. Since many people on Wall Street derive psychic pleasure chiefly from their earnings, it's a lot more significant than, say, a schoolteacher finding out she got a 3.5 percent raise. It is the score."
Most investment banks promote a culture of extreme discretion, playing down any flashy displays of wealth. Even in a champagne-popping year like the most recent one, when Wall Street's total profits were a record $12.5 billion, bonuses are discussed only tersely, in a kind of code. "Are you happy?" one Wall Streeter will say to another. "Yes, I'm happy," the colleague will reply.
Many Wall Streeters declined to speak publicly about bonuses. In part that is a measure of the industry's traditional conservatism. But it is also a reaction to the late-1980's, when Wall Street was scorched by recession, as well as by public opinion, which tagged its players as money-hungry Gekkos after the character popularized by Michael Douglas in the movie "Wall Street."
"You still don't have the ugly behavior of the 80's," said an equity trader at a major house who spoke on condition of anonymity. "People have all been sobered by the layoffs and entrenchment in the business. Everybody knows we made a lot of money, but it's 'When is it going to end?' rather than 'This could go on forever.' "
Economists said that Wall Street's good times have been a bonus for the city in general, but the rising tide has not lifted all boats equally.
The city expects a windfall of $450 million in additional personal income and corporate taxes from the securities industry. Aides to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have said the money would be spent on everything from new schoolbooks to closing the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island.
"When Wall Street's having a good year," said Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at New York University, "more people are employed, and they buy more takeout meals, they buy more Brooks Brothers suits, they buy more one- and two-bedroom apartments.
"But it can't undo basic trends -- we've lost manufacturing jobs and the economy that goes along with it, and that's never coming back."
The spending of individual Wall Streeters depends to a great extent on age, according to interviews with securities workers. Young associates recently out of business school, who in very good years can receive total compensation of up to $250,000, are the ones most likely to seek instant gratification, spending on fast cars, Charvet ties, Hamptons summer rentals.
"You have a young couple in their 20's who both have significant income and they just bought a city co-op and they'll come out and rent a house for $60,000, $70,000 for the summer," said Diane Saatchi, president of the Dayton-Halstead real estate agency in East Hampton, L.I. The traditional bonus-season hunt for a summer property fashionably south of the Montauk Highway has gotten off to a very fast start this year, she said.
Real estate brokers say that the inventory of super-luxury properties in the city has not been so low in memory.
"Last January there was a lot of money, but this January there's euphoria," said Dolly Lenz, Sotheby International Real Estate's top salesperson, who says she has made more than a dozen bonus-driven deals for luxury apartments since late last year.
She said she sold a 33-year-old single investment banker two side-by-side condominiums, for $1.9 million and $1.2 million, in the Trump International Hotel and Tower on Columbus Circle, Donald Trump's latest gold-hued edifice. Another client, a single young woman, bought a two-bedroom apartment on East 76th Street for $700,000, an all-cash deal paid for mainly with a $1 million-plus bonus.
"A lot of these people have also just bought high-end luxury cars: 740i's, Jeeps," Ms. Lenz said. "In one instance a guy just bought an apartment, a Jeep and a BMW."
Merchants House in TriBeCa, two former industrial buildings on North Moore Street that were converted to 23 large condominiums last year, have nearly sold out, many to Wall Streeters, at asking prices from $750,000 to $2 million.
"There is much more disposable income around," said David Teolis, one of the buyers, who is a 30-year-old co-manager of a high-risk hedge fund. He described his spending as "pretty modest," although he plans to fly to Vail, Colo., for the weekend this month and in the last year has visited Europe five times to see a girlfriend.
Not everyone applauds rising property values, which benefit owners but can price middle-class residents out of the city. Michael McKee, an official of the New York State Tenants and Neighborhood Coalition, recalled that many renters were forced to move by the wave of co-op conversions of the 80's. "It hasn't heated up to that stage yet," he said. "But it will."'
As Wall Streeters enter their 30's, winning promotions to vice president, many move to wealthy suburbs in Fairfield and Westchester Counties. Their base salaries range from about $80,000 to $150,000, and in good years, bonuses based on the income they generate for their firms can boost their total pay to $1 million or more. Their wealth is often invested for the long haul: in securities, a second home, trust funds for their children.
"What I see is many of my friends are now in their mid- to late-30's, as well as early 40's, and you see nesters doing what wealthy nesters do," said Jeffrey T. Leeds, the founder and president of Advance Capital, a private investment fund. "You see them with the round-the-clock live-in nanny, the second house well appointed. I'm getting a lot of change-of-address cards in the mail."
Last year was a very good one for Mr. Leeds, who is 40 and unmarried. He helped broker the sale of the Hard Rock Cafe chain for $410 million and in the same month moved into a seven-room co-op on Park Avenue.
Eli Halperin, 48, vice president of information technology at Goldman, Sachs, said: "I know people who paid off their mortgages with their bonuses so if something happened they won't be dependent. Ten years ago, they used to go to Hawaii for a month or two. People want to be sure if they lose their job they don't go bankrupt."
Still, some Wall Streeters said that the only real difference from the 80's is that the lavish spending is better hidden from the censorious and envious gaze of outsiders. Mr. Leeds, a former law clerk to Justice William J. Brennan Jr. of the Supreme Court, is one of the very few on Wall Street who openly questions the extraordinary sums received. "It's obscene," he said. "Of course it is.
Will there be a backlash against this wave of fat and happy bonus babies? So far, there are no signs of one. After the city's long recession, too many people in all walks of life seem to be benefiting from the fruits of Wall Street's roll.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Republican Leaders Agree on Five Goals

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
President Clinton and Congressional leaders agreed today on a five-item list of issues, from the quite specific to the very general, where they hope to work out agreements.
The list comprised a tax credit for employers who hire people off welfare, education, tax cuts for individuals, juvenile crime and justice and using the District of Columbia as a laboratory to test new ideas for education, employment and economic growth. 
 But just as pointedly, it did not include three issues where the participants were far apart.
The Republicans paid little attention to Mr. Clinton's suggestion that they include legislation to revise the way campaigns are financed.
Vice President Al Gore poked holes in the suggestion of Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, that legislation dealing with the Superfund program to clean up toxic waste disposal be given a priority.
And Republicans did not agree to include measures to expand health insurance for children, the suggestion of Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader.
After the meeting, leaders from both parties said it had been a resounding success, at least atmospherically.
"The tone was really uniformly excellent," Mr. Gore said. And Senator Lott said, "It was an overall good session, and the atmosphere was the best I've seen it in quite some time."
The comparison was plainly to the time, barely more than a year ago, when Mr. Clinton and Republican leaders met again and again at the White House, arguing about shutdowns of the Government and how to balance the budget. Today's meeting, which took as a given the idea that all sides wanted a balanced budget, was never contentious.
But for all their approval of the tone of the meeting, held among the Turkish-style drapes of the President's Room, just off the Senate chamber, they were cautious about predicting the results to be achieved on an undetermined schedule by task forces whose composition they have not yet figured out.
Speaker Newt Gingrich said at a news conference, "There is a possibility here that we could actually begin a bipartisan process that would be helpful to the national capital, that would be helpful to helping people get off welfare and go to work, that would help young people get educated better, that would be useful in small business being able to hire more people."
Mr. Gingrich added: "That's not a small step, but that's the most we want to say for today. And if we go beyond that, we could end up starting an argument over how we're cooperating. So I think we're better off just to sort of relax. This is a nice step for one day, and we'll come back another day."
Senator Daschle said, "This is a very productive beginning. But it's only that; it's the beginning. It's an opportunity for us to compare priorities, to address those areas of common ground and to find a way with which to resolve the differences and those problem areas that will exist in each of our goals."
Mr. Lott said, "We're going to begin to get groups sitting down together, House and Senate with the Administration, and begin to see where we have the commonality rather than where the differences are."
But education is an item where the commonality is mostly rhetorical and the partisan differences quite specific.
"We all agree that 8-year-olds ought to be able to read," Mr. Gingrich said later, praising the President for raising the issue and saying he "began to give us a measurable way of focusing."
But Mr. Clinton's call for national standards in education has been resisted by Republicans on the ground that they would lead to Federal control of local schools. And they have scoffed at his plan for attacking in-school illiteracy with an army of one million literacy volunteers.
Indeed, Mr. Gingrich quoted one scoffer, Representative Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, as noting that "there are at least 32 Federal literacy programs that already exist."
Republicans, for their part, have urged support for vouchers that would help poor children escape bad public schools, an idea that Mr. Clinton and other Democrats have condemned as a threat to public education.
At the other end of the scale of difficulty is the tax credit for employers who hire welfare recipients. When Democrats propose tax breaks for business, Republicans rarely disagree.
Mr. Gingrich said that at today's meeting, the President made a "very, very helpful point on his part to emphasize that we need to reach out, particularly to small business, which is the primary employer of people who are entering the work force, and find ways to dramatically enhance the opportunity for people currently getting welfare to go to work and get their first job and to begin to rise."
It was much less clear what the leaders meant when they talked about juvenile crime and juvenile justice, which Senator Lott persuaded them to put on the list.
Reviewing the ideas all parties have for tax cuts is clear enough, but where it leads is not, especially since the participants emphasized that all the goals on today's list must be pursued within the overall framework of balancing the budget by the year 2002.
Participants said Mr. Gingrich's suggestion of focusing on the District of Columbia drew widespread support, from the President and from Congressional Democrats and Republicans.
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said he told Mr. Clinton during the meeting that for this process to succeed, both sides have to be wary of being goaded by their core supporters. He said, "I pointed out to the President that I am already picking up signs from my base that since they don't hear my thunder, they are not sure I am here, and I expect he is having the same experience himself."
The discussion, which lasted about an hour, was preceded by a description of the President's room by Donald A. Ritchie, associate historian of the Senate. He said Presidents had used the room chiefly for signing bills when the end of a Congressional session coincided with the end of a President's term in office. He also recounted the occasion in 1921 when President Woodrow Wilson, furious at Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, a Massachusetts Republican who was the majority leader, for defeating the League of Nations treaty, refused to look at him when the Senator came to the room to advise him that Congress was ready to adjourn.
The Senate's chaplain, Dr. Lloyd J. Ogilvie, offered a prayer asking a blessing for the assembled leaders and for the unity they sought.
After that, the atmosphere was so cordial that Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the minority whip and for two years Speaker Gingrich's most insistent antagonist, praised one of the suggestions offered by Mr. Gingrich. The Speaker, for his part, accepted some water Mr. Bonior passed him and drank it.

30 Palestinian Women Are Released by Israel
 
After more than a year of delays and a day of last-minute legal challenges, Israel freed 30 Palestinian women from prison, carrying out part of its agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization. To pacify Israeli hard-liners, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would seek pardons for Jews who killed Arabs. A3
 
Iraq Said to Smuggle Oil
United States Navy officials said Iraq had been exporting oil, with Iranian help, in violation of United Nations sanctions. They said the Iraqis and their Iranian protectors had had two confrontations with Navy warships in the past two weeks, ramming a United States frigate in one showdown. But the officials said the smugglers often avoid American warships by hugging Iran's shallow, treacherous coast. A7
 
Ecuador Gets Newest President
The President of Ecuador's Congress, Fabian Alarcon, was named President of the country for the second time in under a week. His first promotion came the night that the elected President, Abdala Bucaram, was ousted, but was eventually set aside in favor of the Vice President, Rosalia Arteaga. After the vote, Mrs. Arteaga returned, angrily, to the Vice Presidency and called for a plebiscite on who should run the country. A9
 
Peru Talks With Rebels
A Peruvian Government negotiator met face to face with rebels holding 72 hostages in the Japanese Ambassador's compound in Lima. The talks, the first of their kind in over six weeks, took place in a house across the street from the compound. Representatives of the Red Cross, the Vatican, Japan and Canada took part. A8
 
Croats Force Out Muslims
Croats in the divided Bosnian town of Mostar evicted some 100 Muslims from their homes, hours after firing on 200 Muslims who were visiting a cemetery at the end of the holy month of Ramadan. NATO-led forces and United Nations police began patrolling the streets to prevent more violence. The Mayor of Croat Mostar said the Muslims were disguised soldiers. A11
 
Charges for Honduran Ex-Chief
Prosecutors in Honduras said they would charge a former President, Jose Azcona Hoyo, with illegally extraditing a drug trafficker to the United States. The case grew out of the kidnapping, torture and murder of a United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent in Mexico in 1985. The Honduran Constitution says no citizen can be turned over to a foreign country. (AP)
 
China Seals Off Muslim Town
China sealed off the northwestern town where at least 10 people were killed in a Muslim separatist riot. An exiled leader said the troubles were set off by the public execution of 30 ethnic Uighurs. (Reuters)

Clinton and Congress Seek Agreements on 5 Issues
President Clinton and Congressional leaders agreed to try to agree on five issues: a tax credit for employers who hire people off welfare; education; tax cuts for individuals; juvenile crime and juvenile justice, and using the District of Columbia as a laboratory to test new ideas for education, employment and economic growth. They did not agree on changing campaign finance laws, health insurance for children or toxic waste disposal. A1
 
Campaign finance reformers faced other difficulties on Capitol Hill. Democratic and Republican leaders clashed on the terms of an investigation into the alleged abuses that occurred during the 1996 campaign. And supporters of a bill to revise the laws worried that it seemed to be losing momentum. A1
 
Hearings for Nominee Delayed
The chairman of a Senate committee postponed hearings on the nomination of Anthony Lake to lead the Central Intelligence Agency until March 11. He said there were many "unanswered, perplexing questions" about Mr. Lake's conduct as national security adviser during President Clinton's first term. A19
 
A Losing Cosmological Bet
Dr. Stephen W. Hawking, the cosmologist, conceded defeat in a famous bet he made six years ago with two professors at the California Institute of Technology. He bet that naked singularities -- places other than the centers of black holes where space and time are infinitely distorted and matter is infinitely dense -- could not exist. A scholar in Texas showed that, in theory, they could. A1

China Reported Ready to End Some Barriers

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
China has quietly told American officials that it is willing to abandon many of its largest trade barriers, including some of the laws that protect state-run and military-run industries from foreign competition, in return for membership in the World Trade Organization, according to senior Administration officials.
The offer, conveyed to an American negotiating team over the last two weeks and repeated to European and Japanese officials, marks the first time that China has discussed eliminating specific laws that have long been the subject of complaints by foreign investors. These include a requirement that the investors export the great majority of the goods they produce, rules that have contributed to China's rising trade surplus with the United States. 
 But the Chinese have yet to indicate any willingness to tackle the most politically explosive problem in opening China's market: ending the big subsidies Beijing gives state-run industries, which employ a significant portion of the country's workers.
Officials on several continents warn that the offers have so far only been conveyed in conversations between Chinese and American officials, and that they are wary of the Chinese officials' willingness to follow through on the changes they have discussed. "There always has been a dysfunction between what they say and what they put in writing," Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States trade representative, said today. "And for W.T.O. accession, what they put in writing is what counts."
Nonetheless, Ms. Barshefsky said: "Obviously China's rhetoric has improved significantly, and its willingness to begin to discuss issues of importance has increased." Others in the Administration say they believe that China -- in part to engage the United States on a subject other than human rights and arms sales --- may have decided to put entry into the club of trading nations atop its agenda.
The United States can effectively block the entry of any country into the trade organization by arguing that its plans to open markets do not meet the group's requirements.
"They didn't think we were serious about it last year because of the election," a senior Administration official said. "I think they now believe that we will not stand in the way of their entry to the W.T.O. on political grounds if their offer is sufficient."
Indeed, many in the Administration hope a deal to open China's economy will be the centerpiece of the President's first trip to China, late this year or early in 1998.
But there are many obstacles ahead, officials say. The United States believes China's leadership is deeply divided on whether joining the World Trade Organization, which China has demanded for several years, is worth the high price. The leaders are especially worried that any deal that weakens the already noncompetitive state-run industries could result in widespread unemployment and political instability.
For China, membership in the trade organization is partly a matter of prestige and partly a matter of economic good sense. It can benefit from low or zero tariffs, but membership also subjects it a judicial process to settle trade disputes.
The United States, Japan and the European Union are also doing a delicate pirouette around the rules of entry, each worried that the other could gain some kind of political advantage in dealing with the world's biggest emerging market.
According to negotiators, here is what Chinese officials said they would agree to do during the recent round of talks, which were intended to preview more formal negotiations in Geneva starting on March 4:
*They have agreed to eliminate, over time, the requirement that foreign companies building factories in China export the majority of their output. Companies like Fruit of the Loom, the underwear maker, are required to export 70 percent or more of their output; electronics companies are often required to export even more. It is unclear how quickly China would phase out such requirements or whether individual contracts with companies might still require such exports.
*They have agreed to phase out rules requiring foreign companies to bring big amounts of foreign currency into China and keep it there and that require them to "balance" their foreign trade -- that is, to export more goods than they import -- and that require high levels of "local content" for goods made in China.
*They have agreed to scrap laws that bar many foreign companies from freely trading in China. For example, American food producers like Cargill Inc. are required to buy their wheat through China's state-run trading agencies, rather than importing it directly.
In each of these areas, the scope of the concessions China is offering cannot be measured until it has filed proposed wording for an "accession agreement" in Geneva. That is expected to begin next month, and it will touch off a worldwide negotiation in which Europe, Japan and the United States all have somewhat differing agendas.
China has not yet submitted data to the trade organization that would quantify its subsidies to state-run industries, which range from manufacturers of heavy industrial equipment to computer makers to a manufacturer of tofu that is run by the military. And even when those data are submitted, they would be difficult to verify, especially because the ownership of many enterprises in China is murky.
One complexity in this negotiation is that American officials and their allies are uncertain how much power the chief negotiator -- Wu Yi, China's Trade Minister -- actually holds. She has managed to push through smaller agreements, including one last year that led to a continuing crackdown on the piracy of foreign-produced software, music and videos. But accession to the World Trade Organization is a far bigger and politically sensitive undertaking.
"The mystery," one senior American official said, "is at what point does the top political leadership get involved to make the hard decisions." The hardest of those will be the World Trade Organization's rules against many types of subsidies for domestic industries, including state-owned enterprises.
The Administration's position on China's membership in the trade organization has been that Beijing should become a member on "commercially acceptable terms," a position President Clinton repeated to President Jiang Zemin when they met in Manila in November. The two leaders engaged in their lengthiest conversation yet about China's membership, and that appears to have sparked the talks that American negotiators began two weeks ago in Beijing.
But Mr. Clinton is not operating with an entirely free hand. Many in Congress have expressed deep reservations about China's entry into the trade organization. Of the 18 written questions Ms. Barshefsky received from senators during her confirmation hearings as the permanent trade representative last week, all but one concerned concessions China must make. Senators from agricultural states were particularly insistent that the Chinese lift obstacles to importing American beef and other agricultural products.
The other potential obstacle lies in China's political behavior in coming months. "If Hong Kong becomes a problem or if there is a new arms scandal, you could kiss this goodbye," one senior American official said. "But if there is anyplace where we can get the Sino-American relationship back on track, this is it."

The Surging Dollar? In U.S., Most Companies Shrug It Off

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 11

 BODY:
When the American dollar was soaring a dozen years ago, many American manufacturers warned that their businesses would be severely injured by an influx of cheap Japanese tractors, cars and other imports.
The dollar has been soaring again this winter, but this time, the number of American companies expressing alarm has been surprisingly small. In recent days, officials at the Boeing Company, the General Electric Company and the Intel Corporation have dismissed worries about the dollar. Even Caterpillar, which led the complaints in the mid-1980's, has said almost nothing lately about the dollar's surge, although its chairman, Donald V. Fites, indicated some concern last summer. 
 The dollar continued to climb today even after Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin declared that it "has now corrected itself" after hitting a record low against the yen nearly two years ago. His comments came three days after global finance officials meeting in Berlin suggested that the dollar's rally was over.
While the dollar's rise still threatens grave harm to some industries, notably auto makers here, many other American companies are insulated from the dollar's effects by their expanded production overseas, a decade of aggressive cost-cutting and active hedging of currencies.
American machine-tool makers, many of which were nearly driven out of business in the mid-1980's by low-priced Japanese imports, have been remarkably quiet about the latest rise in the dollar. "We can export our machines to Japan and Europe with a landed cost that is competitive," even at current exchange rates, said James S. Gleason, the chairman of the Gleason Corporation, a big machine-tool manufacturer based in Rochester.
Mr. Gleason gave several reasons, echoed by executives at other companies, for the failure of the rising dollar to inflict much harm so far. The Gleason Corporation has sharply reduced its costs over the last decade and has abstained from making significant price increases, he said. Japanese machine-tool producers have had little room to cut prices lately with a strong dollar because they never raised them much when the dollar was weak. And Gleason has significantly expanded its production overseas.
Low-cost foreign production allows companies to sell competitively priced goods and hold on to market share even when the dollar is rising, although the profits from foreign operations may be worth less when converted into dollars.
Some economists also note that while the dollar has risen 54 percent against the Japanese yen since its low in April 1995, it has appreciated only 17 percent in trade-weighted terms. The American dollar is nearly unchanged against the Canadian dollar, for example. And the dollar's recent rise against the yen has not yet put the dollar at the vertiginous levels reached in the mid-1980's.
So while some companies, notably auto makers, are very worried now by the dollar's strength, others are not, particularly those that have moved part or all of their manufacturing operations offshore. "I wouldn't characterize my phone as ringing off the hook," with manufacturers worried about the dollar, said Marino P. Marcich, the director for international investment and finance at the National Association of Manufacturers. "Perhaps the rhetoric concerning globalization is a bit closer to reality than it seemed."
Yet it remains possible that American companies are simply slow to recognize the dangers, as they were in the 1980's. Higher inflation in the United States and Japan means that the dollar should be falling by 2 or 3 percent a year just to keep price levels in the two countries comparable. Adjusted for differences in inflation, the dollar-yen exchange rate is near a six-year high.
The rising dollar is clearly harming some sectors of the economy already. And some economists argue that it hurts American workers even if it does not hurt multinationals based in the United States.
The businesses that are suffering from the strong dollar now fall into three sometimes overlapping categories. Commodity producers that operate on small margins are finding their profits eroded by foreign competitors. Businesses without international operations that export or compete with imports suffer many of the disadvantages of a strong dollar without the ability to expand production in countries with weak currencies. And some companies that compete mainly with imports from Japan are also struggling.
The loudest complaints lately have come from Detroit's Big Three auto makers because they fall into all three categories of vulnerability. They mainly compete with Japanese imports in the American market, and have been steadily losing market share to them recently. While the Big Three have extensive operations in Europe, they have minimal sales in Japan and do not directly own any assembly plants there, so they are not insulated against the yen's decline. And there are some signs that cars are becoming commodities, sold as basic transportation at razor-thin margins that can evaporate when exchange rates change.
The Big Three have also not been shy about raising prices to raise profits now, sometimes at the expense of market share. A study released on Monday by Automotive News showed that the Big Three raised their vehicle prices by an average of $39 since Jan. 1 while Japanese auto makers have left their prices unchanged. The Big Three also raised their prices by an average of $386 at the beginning of the current model year on Oct. 1, while their Japanese rivals did so by an average of just $8.
Not surprisingly, the Big Three's inventory of unsold cars has ballooned, to 85 days of sales at the end of January, up from a more typical 60 days at the end of September.
American auto executives have begun hinting at stepping up their cost-cutting efforts if the dollar continues to rise, although they have not yet mentioned the possibility of layoffs. When the dollar was trading at 114 yen early last month, John F. Smith Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the General Motors Corporation, said, "If the yen continues to weaken, we'll have to take a relook at accelerating that process."
If layoffs do come, they would be one sign that American workers may be bearing the brunt of a rising dollar, even if big corporations with global operations are not. Jobs in export industries and manufacturing jobs also tend to pay considerably more than the national average.
To the extent that these jobs are eliminated now because of the rising dollar, "You actually hurt the average wage level of the median family," said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based research group.
Yet a rising dollar does help a few industries. Cheaper imports tend to mean less inflation. That means lenders are willing to accept lower interest rates, because they have fewer worries that their principal will be repaid in dollars devalued by inflation. And many industries whose customers borrow a lot of money benefit from low interest rates, notably home builders.
Trucking companies have also been pleased because they tend to haul a lot of building materials and imported products, like videocassette recorders and cars. Even if the strong dollar produces an offsetting fall in exports, truckers may not be hurt much because exports tend to move by air freight.
And in a few industries that seem at first glance like clear victims of a strong dollar, the effect has actually been the reverse. California wine producers now face competition from slightly cheaper French wines. Yet several winery executives said that they were delighted by the dollar's rise because it would lower the cost of imported French oak barrels and other wine equipment. Any loss of sales to foreign competition, they predicted, would be minimal.
"We are just high-fiving each other; this is great," said Tom Rinaldi, a wine maker at Duckhorn Vineyards in St. Helena, Calif.

HEADLINE: Family Planning and Foreign Policy Are Linked, Albright Tells House Panel

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
In her first public appearance on Capitol Hill as Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright today asserted that family planning was an important component of the United States' foreign policy and urged Congress to support an Administration-backed measure that would speed the release of money for family-planning programs overseas.
The House is to vote on Thursday on such a measure, as well as on an alternative that would bar aid from the United States to groups that perform abortions, even if they use private money for that purpose. 
 Ms. Albright, making the Administration's strongest statement yet on family planning, called it an important tool by which the United States could demonstrate world leadership.
"One of the most important ways we contribute to sustainable development is through our support for international family planning," Ms. Albright told a packed hearing of the House International Relations Committee as she sought an increase in the State Department's budget.
"By stabilizing population growth rates, developing nations can devote more of their scarce resources to meet the basic needs of their citizens," she said. "Moreover, our voluntary family-planning programs serve our broader interests by elevating the status of women, reducing the flow of refugees, protecting the environment and promoting economic growth."
The family-planning programs have come under fire from anti-abortion forces, who contend that they are actually conduits for what many of them call President Clinton's worldwide "abortion crusade."
In addition, some opponents of the Administration's measure, like Steven W. Mosher of the Population Research Institute, which opposes contraception, accuse the United States of a "contraceptive imperialism." At a news conference on Monday that featured Representative Christopher Smith, Republican of New Jersey, and Senator Tim Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, Mr. Mosher said that overpopulation of the world was a "myth" and that money from the United States was used disproportionately for family planning at the expense of basic health and hygiene.
The Administration-backed resolution would speed the release of money allocated last year but withheld until July 1997. If released on March 1, as the Administration wants, the money available between then and Sept. 30, the end of the 1997 fiscal year, would amount to $215 million. If delayed until July, the sum would amount to $92 million, a loss of $123 million.
An alternative measure, offered by Mr. Smith, would provide $385 million for family planning, but only on the condition that none of the money go to any organization that performs abortions, even if it finances them with money from other sources.
While both measures could conceivably pass the House, the Smith bill would face a tougher time in the Senate and would be vetoed by President Clinton.
At today's hearing, Mr. Smith pointedly questioned Ms. Albright as he asserted that the Administration was bent on undermining anti-abortion laws in many of the countries where the United States sends family-planning money through the Agency for International Development.
"I believe the real consensus is with providing family planning funds," Mr. Smith said, "but not, however unwittingly, empowering the pro-abortion movement overseas to bring down the right-to-life laws as they exist in approximately 100 countries of the world."
Ms. Albright responded: "The U.S. does not fund the performance or promotion of abortion anywhere in the world. And what we are concerned about is that the restrictions that are envisioned in your language would preclude U.S.A.I.D. from working with organizations that provide effective, voluntary family planning and women's health services in countries where abortion is legal."
She added, "I think the issue here, sir, is that we desperately need the money in order to try to get women out of the terrible poverty that has existed."
Planned Parenthood took two Russian pediatricians to Congress on Monday to brief legisators on what they described as the benefits of the United States-backed family-planning efforts. The Russians said that since contraceptives had become more available, abortions in Russia had dropped to 2.7 million in 1995, from 4.4 million in 1989.
One of the doctors, Inga I. Grebesheva, director general of the Russian Association of Family Planning in Moscow, said Russia's birth rate had dwindled as a result of post-abortion complications that had left women infertile. Unlike in other countries, where family planning was intended partly to check overpopulation, she said Russia hoped that family planning would help rebuild the population by preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and curbing the need for abortions, which are often performed in unsanitary conditions.
Mr. Smith and his supporters have characterized Thursday's vote as the first abortion-related vote of the new Congress, a characterization that may help pressure some abortion opponents in the House into voting with them.
For that same reason, supporters of family planning strongly reject such a characterization. If the vote is cast in terms of abortion instead of family planning, they would probably lose votes in the House, where a majority of members oppose abortion. As a matter of policy and law, the Federal money cannot be used for abortions, even though Mr. Smith argues that because money is interchangeable, the Federal money frees up other money to be used for this purpose.
Kate Bunting, a spokeswoman for CARE, one of the international relief and development organizations that receives Federal money for family planning overseas, said, "We do not pay for abortions with our private money; we don't even have an organizational position on abortion."
Ms. Bunting said approval of the Administration's resolution on Thursday would depend on "pro-life members' making the distinction and understanding that providing family-planning services will in fact reduce abortion."

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
Clinton Seems to Keep Running Though the Race Is Run and Won

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Last year, President Clinton waged a campaign that looked like government, announcing initiatives at his political rallies and virtually never mentioning his opponent. Now, with his last election behind him, Mr. Clinton is running the White House in a manner that looks like a campaign.
Some of the President's recent national appearances to highlight his education proposals have been indistinguishable from the re-election rallies of 1996. When he traveled to the northern suburbs of Chicago last month to call for testing to assess education standards, Mr. Clinton dropped into a classroom briefly, just as he did before campaign rallies, then delivered a speech in a gymnasium bedecked with a giant American flag. 
 Even the music is sometimes the same. When Mr. Clinton made a similar appearance at a college in Georgia last week, the school band struck up one of his campaign theme songs, Fleetwood Mac's, "Don't Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow)."
Although Mr. Clinton will not run for office again, he is still using his campaign polling firm of Penn & Schoen Associates to gauge public opinion and help him test and craft language for his speeches. On Monday, in fact, officials of the Democratic National Committee met with Mark Penn to discuss payment terms and a plan for polling in 1997 for both the White House and the Democratic Party.
The weekly evening meeting in the White House residence, where Mr. Clinton once gathered his aides and strategists to plot his campaign, is run by Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff. Along with other White House officials, the pollsters and the campaign media team of Robert Squier and Bill Knapp, of Squier Knapp Ochs Communications, still attend, officials say.
White House officials say that while they are now trying to promote Mr. Clinton's policies instead of winning his re-election, they still need to use forms of public persuasion similar to those used in a campaign -- with attention to everything from television images and mobilizing support, to using language that resonates well with the public.
"In the campaign year, campaigns are about framing a choice for the American people -- why me and not the other guy," said Michael D. McCurry, Mr. Clinton's press secretary. "When you are responsible for governing you have to use the same tools of public persuasion to advance your program, to build public support for the direction you are attempting to lead."
Mr. Clinton is not the first President to use these techniques; Ronald Reagan's master stage manager, Michael K. Deaver, elevated the theme of the day and the telegenic backdrop to a political art form.
But Mr. Clinton not only has hewed to the same path, he has made such tools more important. That is because so much of the success of his current program, designed for the era of deficit reduction, depends not on traditional legislative and executive action but on his success in urging groups like state legislatures or individual school districts or citizen volunteers to take action.
For this effort to work, some officials argue, the President must be perceived as riding a wave of public support. "Clinton has come to believe that if he keeps his approval ratings up and sells his message as he did during the campaign, there will be greater acceptability for his program," said one aide to the President. "The idea is that you have to sell it as if in a campaign."
Dick Morris, the political strategist who helped Mr. Clinton develop the technique of the permanent campaign -- using polling and paid commercials as tools of governance -- during Mr. Clinton's years as Governor of Arkansas and then in the 1996 campaign, put it this way: "A President doesn't just need a majority on Election Day. The President needs a majority every day of the week behind every bill that he has."
It is that notion which explains one curious fact about the way Mr. Clinton has been promoting his education ideas. In his three stops around the country, Mr. Clinton has spoken not to those who doubt the efficacy of the programs he is supporting but to the already converted. He has gone to a school consortium that has already embraced testing standards; to Georgia, the state that was the model for his proposal to give tax credits for higher education; and to the Maryland State Legislature, which already supports his education goals.
The education appearances, at least at this early stage, are not designed to confront and convince doubting state legislatures or school districts to adopt national education standards. Rather they are conceived as events that mobilize Mr. Clinton's supporters and give his ideas an aura of inevitability and public support.
They also usually generate large doses of favorable coverage in local television markets, causing a regional surge of support.
To measure how he is interacting with the nation, Mr. Clinton has long favored public opinion polling to gauge the shifts and turns of the public pysche. And polling is continuing in the White House.
White House officials argue that the President uses polls not to set his positions, but to figure out how best to sell them. Before Mr. Clinton delivered his State of the Union Message, Mr. McCurry said the White House was polling on speech themes to make the President's arguments "as crisp and as sharp and as persuasive as possible."
Such polling has helped the White House discover, for example, that the President had a better chance of marshaling public opinion for an assault-rifle ban if he portrayed it as an anti-crime measure, as opposed to a gun-control measure. During the campaign, Mr. Clinton learned that he drew more support by speaking about the strength of the economy under his stewardship than by highlighting the concerns of those left behind in the information age economy.
Mr. Clinton's aides say polling will be conducted with far less frequency now than in 1996. Amy Weiss Tobe, the spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, declined to discuss the exact amount Penn & Schoen will be paid by the party, and both Mr. Penn and his partner Douglas Schoen refused to comment. But Democrats familiar with the pollsters' billings in the campaign said a one-year total was likely to run from $750,000 to $1.25 million and that the pollsters were not being given a retainer or a firm contract.
Mr. Clinton, of course, has not eschewed the traditional forms of Presidential persuasion. In fact, he has made a concerted effort since he began his second term to have better relations with members of Congress. He invited a small group of Republicans and Democrats to watch Super Bowl XXXI with him in the White House and he has been holding a series of one-on-one meetings with lawmakers to hear their concerns.
The President has also made an effort to patch up his prickly relations with the press. He has been inviting reporters and columnists to off-the-record discussions inside the White House and he has been holding a news conference a month since Election Day.
What remains to be seen is whether Mr. Clinton will include paid television commercials as the final weapon in his arsenal of persuasion techniques. Mr. Morris, who left the Clinton campaign last August in the wake of a tabloid report that he had had dealings with a prostitute, said that he had advised the President that he should continue to run ads about issues during his second term. "I don't think he has to dominate the airwaves," Mr. Morris said. "I do think he should do some advertising at crucial junctures."
White House officials said they would not rule out such a move.

Time Warner Reports Profit And Seeks to Cut Debt Load
Time Warner reported a 79 percent rise in profit, and said it was determined to improve cash flow in an effort to pay off its $18 billion in debt. The company posted net income of $59 million, or a loss of 3 cents a share after the payment of preferred dividends for the quarter ending Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $33 million, or 1 cent a share, a year earlier.
Perhaps the news that heartened Wall Street most was the appointment of several prominent new board members. [Page D6.] 

Stocks Rise on Late Buying
Stock prices rebounded, despite an early selloff in some technology issues. The Dow Jones industrial average found its momentum in the last hour of trading to close up 51.57 points, at 6,858.11, 25 points shy of the closing high set on Jan. 21. The Nasdaq composite index finished modestly lower. [D8.]
 
Treasury prices ended little changed, as a sale of new three-year notes largely matched expectations. The yield on the 30-year bond was unchanged at 6.70 percent. [D18.]
 
An Air Strike's Effects Feared
A strike by the pilots' union of American Airlines would not only shut down the carrier but would also severely inconvenience tens of thousands of passengers throughout the nation's crowded air-transportation system. The airlines are already filling a higher percentage of seats than they have in years, and with the Washington's Birthday weekend at hand, several carriers expect to be crowded even without an American Airlines strike. Edwin McDowell: Business Travel. [D7.]
 
New Goal on Air Safety
Two years after the Transportation Secretary proclaimed a goal of eliminating airline accidents, a White House commission will set a revised target that experts consider more realistic: cutting the rate 80 percent. [A16.]
 
U.S. Productivity Grew Significantly
Worker productivity grew at the fastest rate in three years at the end of 1996, the Government said, reinforcing a picture of a healthy economy with little inflation. Productivity outside of agriculture rose 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, a sharp improvement from the third quarter, when productivity was flat. [D2.]
 
Westinghouse Posts Loss
Westinghouse said that its fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations declined 17 percent, as an operating loss at CBS offset stronger results at the company's local television and radio stations. [D6.]
 
Chief Ousted at Computer Company
Centennial Technologies, a maker of personal computer equipment, whose stock soared last year, said it had dismissed its chairman and chief executive, Emanuel Pinez, and had begun an investigation into the accuracy of its financial statements. [D4.]
 
Auto Makers Sue on Electric Cars
A group representing the Big Three auto makers has sued New York State over rules requiring the car makers to include some electric vehicles in their fleets beginning next year. It contends that the rules violate the Federal Clean Air Act. [B5.]
 
Jeans Maker Plans To Combine Businesses
The VF Corporation, the maker of Lee and Wrangler jeans, said it would combine its 17 businesses into 5 as part of a streamlining expected to cut costs $150 million a year. The company also said it would increase spending on marketing and research 25 percent. The moves are not expected to result in charges against earnings. [D4.]
 
A New Take on the 3 Musketeers
Until now all three musketeers who represented the 3 Musketeers candy brand have been white. Now, though, one of the three actors who portray the characters in television commercials and print advertisements is black. The campaign was created by a company that specializes in work aimed at black consumers. The 3 Musketeers ads, however, are for the general market -- that is, aimed at all consumers. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D6.]

HEADLINE: Bulgaria's Socialists Block Change for Better

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Bulgaria Party Blocks Action on Economy" (news article, Feb. 7) doesn't make clear the desperate straits of the Bulgarian people. The statement that "the average salary is $10" doesn't indicate that this is not a daily or even weekly wage but a monthly income. Heat and electricity for a small apartment costs more than $13 a month. My wife's 70-year-old mother must live on a stipend of $3 a month. 
 The Bulgarians are hungry and cold, but the Socialist Party fights to remain in office. Its agenda makes it unwilling to accept the changes necessary to conserve the country's meager resources and attract investments. Can it be that the Socialists fear that when they no longer carry the cloak of office they will be brought to justice?

HEADLINE: Whitman's Fiscal Mentor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Fiscal Chicanery in New Jersey" (editorial, Feb. 8) refers to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's invention of a "new category of borrow-and-spend conservative." I'm afraid that honor goes to her mentor, President Reagan, the greatest borrow-and-spend conservative our nation has ever known. His fiscal policies increased the national debt more than those of all his predecessors combined, despite his repeated rhetorical calls for balanced budgets.

Yawn. A global-warming alert. But this one has solutions.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
STERNLY worded petitions and ringing screeds of principle are as much a part of campus life as grade inflation -- which is why Washington rarely takes them seriously. But the nation's movers and shakers would do well to pay attention to a statement on global warming by some 2,000 mostly academic economists.
For one thing, the signatures collected by Redefining Progress, a group of policy-minded social scientists based in San Francisco, range from the newish left (Duncan Foley of Barnard College) to the skeptical center (James Heckman of the University of Chicago) to the libertarian right (Gordon Tullock of the University of Arizona). "Market-based approaches to coping with climate change generate as much consensus among economists as free trade," explains Paul Krugman of M.I.T., one of the organizers of the statement. 
 More important, the statement focuses on what is now regarded by insiders as a make-it-or-break-it issue in slowing atmospheric warming: designing an international system that permits rich economies to contribute cash in lieu of emissions reductions. "Allowing some to pay others to reduce greenhouse emissions could reduce the total cost by 80 to 90 percent," estimates William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale and another organizer of the statement.
Like any committee looking for consensus, the drafters of the climate statement cast their net widely. "We believe that global climate change carries with it significant environmental, economic, social and geopolitical risks, and that preventive steps are justified," the unshocking introduction reads.
Those who read on, however, will discover there is meat on these bones: "Sound economic analysis," the authors argue, "shows that there are policy options that would slow climate change without harming American living standards."
And what might these policy options be? Here, the drafters stake out a position that seems almost obvious to economists, but has barely entered the consciousness of environmental policy makers. "A cooperative approach among nations is required -- such as an international emissions trading agreement," the statement asserts.
To understand where the economists really want the diplomats to go, consider where we are now. Current rates of deforestation and combustion of carbon-based fuels -- coal, oil, gas -- are adding carbon dioxide into the atmosphere faster than the oceans can absorb it. The higher carbon dioxide concentrations trap solar energy. Rising temperatures will likely change weather patterns radically and raise the level of the oceans.
Governments of all the major economies are vaguely committed to containing greenhouse gas emissions before once-a-century hurricanes become an annual event in the Caribbean, Kansas turns into a dust bowl and the Bay of Bengal doubles in size at the expense of Bangladesh. But the emphasis is on the vague: the process of setting emissions targets or creating political institutions to enforce the targets is in the talking stage.
That's where the economists' statement fits in. "We wanted to be there early," said Stephen DeCanio of the University of California at Santa Barbara, "before governments and politicians were locked into positions." Specifically, the statement is intended to give the Clinton Administration some help in pressing the idea of creating an international market in emissions permits at the next global meeting on climate change, set for Kyoto, Japan, in December.
The idea is simple. If and when world leaders start to deal with the practical issues, they are apt to set national targets for containing emissions that will be very expensive to meet in the rich industrial economies, and probably won't be honored in the large emerging economies like China, Russia, India and Indonesia.
Creating an emissions trading system that allows already rich economies to pay the emerging economies to use less energy and less carbon-intensive fuels as they develop offers a double dividend. It reduces the cost for developed countries, in turn reducing the chances their legislatures will balk. And it creates a pool of capital to be used as an incentive to push emerging economies toward environmentally benign growth.
Translation: Getting, say, China or India to switch from coal to natural gas, or to encourage energy conservation by charging world market prices at home would be a lot easier if they were paid billions of dollars each year to do it.
Not every economist who favors emissions trading signed the statement. "I'm worried it will be used at Kyoto to commit America to useless, expensive unilateral actions in reducing emissions," says Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute.
But Mr. Nordhaus has very different worries. "Economists haven't been important players in environmental policy over the last 30 years," he said. "This time we could make a difference."

HEADLINE: Lott Says He Sees Chance for Broad Cut in Capital Gains Taxes

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
One day after agreeing to accelerate negotiations with the Clinton Administration over taxes, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said today that he saw cracks in the Democrats' long-standing opposition to a broad cut in capital gains taxes.
Republicans have long sought such a cut. Senator Lott, alluding to several recent proposals by Congressional Democrats, said there might be enough bipartisan support to overcome the opposition of Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. 
 Mr. Rubin supports only a narrow capital gains measure, offered by the Administration in its latest budget proposal, that would benefit some people who sell their homes.
"The Democrats have also been tiptoeing into the capital gains area," Mr. Lott said after a meeting of the Senate Finance Committee, adding that any compromise would ultimately depend on President Clinton's flexibility. "If we can get the staff and the Secretary out of the way, I think maybe we have something to agree about here."
But in an appearance before the committee, Secretary Rubin did not budge from the Administration's official line that it sees few economic benefits -- and potentially huge costs -- from a sweeping reduction in the tax on profits from the sale of stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets.
While Mr. Rubin continued to leave the door open to a compromise, the conflicting statements suggested the difficulty that the Republican leadership and the White House face in trying to reach agreement on the issue, a primary impediment to any deal to balance the budget by 2002.
Tax policy was one of five issues -- along with education, juvenile crime and justice, aiding the District of Columbia and efforts to encourage employers to hire welfare recipients -- listed on Tuesday by Mr. Clinton and Congressional leaders as issues on which they would seek quick agreement as a start toward bipartisan cooperation on the budget. The talks are tentatively scheduled to begin after Congress returns from a one-week recess next week.
The Administration has proposed $98 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, paid for in large part by $76 billion in new or extended taxes or closed loopholes.
The latest Republican proposal, backed by Senator Lott, calls for $193 billion in tax reductions over the same period, including a $33 billion cut in the capital gains tax. The Republicans have not said how they would pay for their plan.
The Administration's plan would exempt from capital gains taxes the profits on sales of homes up to $500,000, but would not cut the top 28 percent capital gains rate on the sale of other assets. The Republican plan calls for the top rate on all capital gains to decline to 19.8 percent.
A possible compromise was offered today by Senator Wendell H. Ford, Democrat of Kentucky. Senator Ford's plan would reduce the capital gains tax based on how long a taxpayer had owned an asset before selling it.
The plan would be most appealing to long-term investors and to farmers and small-business owners. It would be of little benefit to short-term investors in the stock market.
"I believe the impact will be to provide the greatest benefit to middle-class families and not Wall Street," Senator Ford said.

Prices Lower As Auction Disappoints

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended lower yesterday, following poor results at a Treasury auction of new 10-year notes.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/32, to 97 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, edged up to 6.71 percent from 6.70 percent, where it had stayed the previous three session. 
 The $12 billion sale of 10-year notes yesterday afternoon was met with weak demand. The bid-to-cover ratio, or the amount of bids compared with the amount of securities available, was just 1.90 to 1, down from 2.41 to 1 at the last auction of 10-year notes and the smallest since May 1995, when it was 1.67 to 1. Noncompetitive demand was considered decent and amounted to about $424 million. The average yield at auction was 6.374 percent, a little higher than expected, as some selling in the cash market pushed yields a bit higher.
Investors seized on the auction's poor results as an excuse to sell Treasury securities before today's retail sales report for January and the final auction in the Treasury's quarterly refunding. Today, the Treasury sells $10 billion of 30-year bonds. In when-issued trading ahead of today's sale the 30-year bond was priced to yield 6.64 percent.
Traders note that the 37 primary securities dealers who are required to bid at the auctions often try to punch yields higher before the sale to make Treasury securities more attractive to investors and insure demand for the issue. But with a number of important economic reports coming out this week, few investors were willing to buy actively.
Today the Government will report on retail sales in January, and tomorrow on producer prices and industrial production. Recent signs of economic growth have not driven prices higher. The market received more indications of economic strength early in the session yesterday, when the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta released its survey of business conditions within its region. The index had a strong reading of 11.1 for January, compared to a negative 18.7 reading for December.
Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president of the taxable-fixed-income department at Advest Inc. said the trading so far this week was typical of a three-part quarterly refunding. "The 3-year is successful, the 10-year maturity is disappointing and the balance of whether it will be a successful refunding or not hangs on the 30-year issue," he said. "The short-term benchmark of success is whether or not the three issues sell above their average auction prices on settlement day, which is Feb. 18."
The generally mediocre results of the Treasury refunding so far -- an auction on Tuesday of three-year notes came largely within expectations -- have left investors concerned that demand from foreign investors may be diminishing. Such fears have weighed on bond prices. Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 10-year notes:

HEADLINE: The Ebbing Hudson River Park

 BODY:
The edge of Manhattan along the Hudson River may be one of the most precious strips of land in the nation. Ever since the Manhattan waterfront became moribund, New Yorkers have dreamed about its potential for open parkland and recreational use. But that promise is slipping away.
The riverside between Battery Park and 59th Street is owned by the state and the city. For years it has contained a depressing mixture of ruined piers and unlovely facilities like a cement plant and a parking lot for sanitation trucks. The city and state agreed long ago that when a new highway was built along the West Side, the waterfront would be recaptured for a mixture of open space and ball fields. The new park would be maintained with income from a modest amount of recreation-based business development. 
 Now the road is being built, but the park is floating in a vacuum. Gov. George Pataki says he supports the project, but he has neither publicly endorsed the park plan nor included any money for it in his budget. The Governor says there will be time for that once an environmental impact statement is completed.
A $200 million project that is moving forward bureaucratically but without strong political backing is a project in trouble. Pieces of the intended park have already been nibbled off for development. The city recently took over several piers from the Port Authority, which had been running a money-losing passenger ship terminal. It intends to lease part of the space for a new film studio. The Chelsea Piers recreational facility wants to use a slice of the intended parkland for a traffic rotary. Restaurants are being given temporary leases along the water in lower Manhattan.
Unlike the state, New York City has made a clear economic commitment to the park, including its share of the construction cost in its long-term budget. But in the absence of strong state leadership, it has not been acting as though it believes the project will really happen.
The initiative should come from Mr. Pataki. Skeptics have a right to be dubious about his commitment since he has never publicly endorsed the park plan. A press conference about the waterfront would take care of that problem. The Governor should also include the state's $100 million share of the construction price in his long-term budget.
The future Hudson River Park's promise is too great to be frittered away. Every city resident or tourist who has visited Battery Park in Lower Manhattan realizes what a resource the Manhattan waterfront can be, and how little use New York has ever made of this precious asset. Saving the park will reinforce Mr. Pataki's reputation as an environmentalist and boost Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's efforts to improve the city's quality of life.
Mr. Pataki is right when he says that the state cannot begin building a park along the river until an environmental impact statement is completed and expected legal challenges are overcome. But there is a great deal he can do to make sure that when the time is right, all the pieces are still there.

HEADLINE: Congressional Panel Hears Options for Delayed Space Station

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
If Russia further delays or fails to produce a major component of the planned international space station, the United States is considering several steps to minimize the impact, including possibly delaying the launching of the first elements of the project by several months, officials said today.
Clinton Administration officials told skeptical members of Congress attending a hearing of the House Science Committee that they received solid assurances from Russian officials last week that $100 million would be provided, starting at the end of the month, for work on a service module that is running behind schedule. 
 If it appears that the launching of the service module, initially set for April 1998 and now eight months behind schedule, will be further delayed, the United States will decide in March on pursuing one of two contingency options for interim modules, Dr. John H. Gibbons, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told the hearing.
Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia promised Vice President Al Gore at meetings in Washington last week that money to continue work on the Russian module would be provided by the cash-strapped Russian Government by the end of February, Dr. Gibbons said.
"We will be looking very closely at whether the Russian space agency receives the promised funding by the end of the month," he added.
"If it does, we will adjust our contingency plans accordingly," Dr. Gibbons said. "If it does not, we expect to be in a position to decide on the two options."
The Russian-made service module, the third component of the space station to be lifted into orbit, is designed to maneuver and control the multipart station as it is being built and to provide temporary crew quarters during the building phase.
One option for an interim control module is adapting a military satellite maneuvering unit developed by the Naval Research Laboratory to control the station. The other option, officials said, would be to contract with a Russian group, the Khrunichev Design Bureau, to build a version of its FGB space module to serve as a maneuvering unit.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has paid Khrunichev more than $200 million to make an FGB to serve as the first station element to be launched, and NASA said the component is on schedule and within its budget. Agency officials said they believed an FGB-2 unit could be built for substantially less money to serve as an interim control unit until the service module is ready.
Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the Science Committee, said Russia's inability to finance its part of the space station adequately was threatening the entire project. The Russians have given repeated assurances in the past that they would make up deficits for the station, he said, but have not kept their promises.
Mr. Sensenbrenner and several members of the committee plan to go to Russia next week on a fact-finding mission concerning the space station and other issues.
"I support building the international space station, with or without the Russians," Mr. Sensenbrenner said. "I would prefer to have the Russians in as a full partner, but we must ask whether we can wait any longer for them to decide whether to fund their part of the program."
Daniel S. Goldin, the Administrator of NASA, said he had also been frustrated by past assurances from Russian officials that the lack of funds would be resolved. Last week, he said, the Russians made very specific commitments about what amounts of money would be paid on certain dates, and the United States made arrangements to monitor the flow of money to contractors to insure that they were paid and work on the service module restarted.
"While I remain cautiously optimistic that, this time, the commitment will result in funding," Mr. Goldin said, "we will take action based only on observed performance, not on mere statements of intent."
In addition to looking at interim modules to control the space station, Mr. Goldin said, NASA is also considering other options to keep construction close to its original schedule and cost. One option, he said, is the possibility of delaying launching of the first elements of the space station, now scheduled for this fall.
The current schedule calls for beginning construction of the orbital laboratory in November, with a Russian rocket launching the FGB module in November and an American shuttle flying the first American component, a docking module, in December. If the Russian service module slips further, Mr. Goldin said, station officials might consider delaying the flights of the first elements until the spring of 1988.
A delay of these launchings would require storing and maintaining the completed segments, which adds cost to the project, and rearranging a tight schedule of space shuttle launchings for 1998 and beyond, he said. But it would still be possible to complete construction of the station, now scheduled for the year 2002, on time, and not disrupt space science planned in the interim, he said.
"We will not prematurely launch, even if we are ready," Mr. Goldin said after the hearing. "We have many options to consider."
Mr. Goldin reminded lawmakers at the hearing that Russia attaches great pride to its space program, even in hard economic times, and gave up plans to build a follow-up to its 10-year-old Mir space station to take part in the international project. There are indications that Russia would resist suggestions to downgrade its role in the project from that of a full partner to one of merely being a contractor providing parts for other nations who can afford to pay for them, he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Clears U.S. Media To Set Up Cuba Bureaus

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration announced today that it would allow American news organizations to open bureaus in Cuba for the first time in nearly 30 years, hoping that the presence of a foreign corps of journalists will increase diplomatic and political pressure on the Communist Government of Fidel Castro.
The White House signaled the change in policy as the Treasury Department granted special licenses to 10 organizations to open what are essentially commercial enterprises in Cuba, despite the economic embargo that prohibits Americans from spending money on the island. 
 The announcement did not clear the way for a new flood of news reports on conditions in Cuba after 38 years of Communist rule. Although 10 news organizations have applied to the United States for permission, Cuba has so far agreed to allow only one -- Cable News Network -- to open an office and begin reporting.
The decision nonetheless represented a significant break in the longstanding American effort to isolate Mr. Castro and his Communist Government. The Administration, supported by prominent Republicans on Capitol Hill, argued that the benefits of exposing Cuba to more regular scrutiny by American journalists outweighed the drawbacks of letting Mr. Castro's Government receive the hard cash that news organizations would spend to rent offices or buy supplies.
The President's spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said: "The Administration believes that news gathering and reporting by U.S. news organizations will keep international attention focused on the situation in Cuba and on the realities of economic and political conditions there and will bring greater public exposure to those who are advocating a democratic change in Cuba."
Assuming Mr. Castro keeps a promise he made about CNN last November, the television network would become the first American news organization formally granted permission to open a permanent bureau in Cuba since 1969, when Havana expelled the last correspondent from The Associated Press. The United States retaliated by barring Cuban news organizations from having bureaus in the United States.
Today's decision did not lift that restriction, which Administration officials said would remain in place until Cuba opened the door to "a representative sampling" of American news organizations, including Radio and TV Marti, the Federally financed anti-Castro network.
Eason Jordan, CNN's executive vice president for international news, applauded the Administration's decision and said the network planned to open a full-time bureau in Havana in March.
Until now, journalists have been allowed to enter Cuba temporarily with special visas granted by the United States on a case-by-case basis. The new licenses would allow their organizations to station them there permanently, but only if the organizations confine their spending to activities directly related to gathering news and insist on having "unconditioned and unrestricted" work conditions in Cuba. The licenses are valid for only a year, but Mr. McCurry said he did not foresee problems in renewing them.
The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces the embargo, granted licenses to every organization that had formally requested one. In addition to CNN, they are ABC News, CBS News, The Miami Herald, The Associated Press, Dow Jones & Company, The Chicago Tribune, The Sun Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Univision and Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, which publishes a newsletter called Cuba Info.
The New York Times has discussed opening a permanent bureau in Havana with the authorities in Cuba in recent years, but has not formally requested a license to do so from Washington, a spokeswoman said today. "Now that we know that approvals are being issued, we will be applying," she said.
The decision has won support from Republicans otherwise staunchly opposed to any easing of pressure on Mr. Castro. In a letter to Mr. Clinton last week, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, strongly supported the opening of news bureaus.
"If Castro wants to open Cuba to the roving eye of the American news media, we should by all means give him the rope with which to hang himself," Mr. Helms wrote.
In lifting the prohibition on bureaus, the Administration had to weigh objections from news organizations other than CNN that the United States was essentially allowing Cuba to choose who reported on it. Acknowledging that Cuba would probably exclude some, officials said the Administration decided that letting some in would inevitably increase pressure on Mr. Castro to open the door to more.

HEADLINE: Tyson Set to Join Ameritech Board

 BODY:
The Ameritech Corporation plans to announce today that it expects its newest board member to be Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former top White House economic adviser.
Ms. Tyson stepped down in December as head of the National Economic Policy Council and was previously chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. 
 She will seek election to the board of Ameritech, a regional telephone operating company based in Chicago, at the company's annual meeting on April 16.
Ms. Tyson holds an endowed chair in economics at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley. Ameritech's offer is the first she has accepted, although recruiters predicted that as a high-profile woman she would be widely courted.
Already on the board is Lynn M. Martin, a former Republican Congresswoman and the Labor Secretary under President George Bush.

HEADLINE: A Rental Tower Is Planned for West Side

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A block of Broadway in the 50's that has frustrated developers for more than 30 years with failed plans for an office building, a Planet Hollywood restaurant and a luxury hotel would become a 45-story rental apartment tower under a plan by Related Companies.
Related, which won out in fierce bidding for the site amid an increasingly hot rental market in Manhattan, would build the tower on the site between 55th and 56th Streets on the west side of Broadway. The new building would sit above a five-story retail complex that would include a movie theater, a theme restaurant and large stores. Related has five other residential projects under way. 
 "I think the retail, entertainment and mixed-use combination will make the site successful," said Jeff Blau, a senior vice president of Related. "That's what enables us to make this economically feasible despite the high land prices."
Related's bid, which was not disclosed, topped those of more than a half-dozen other prospective buyers who have been scrambling from one rare development site to another in Manhattan hoping to cash in on the current boomlet in rental apartments, retailing and hotel rooms.
The Chase Manhattan Bank, which foreclosed on the property last year, put it on the auction block in January. Real estate executives familiar with the transaction say that the Jack Parker Corporation, Ian Bruce Eichner, Rose Associates and Donald Trump all expressed interest in the site but that only Related was willing to pay almost $18 million.
"We got a very strong investor response that clearly reflects growing confidence in Manhattan," said Hugh Balloch, a managing director at Chase Manhattan. "It certainly encouraged us."
Related had already formed a joint venture with the owners of the south end of the blockfront, a group led by Doug Oliver and Jon Hanson. That deal let Related propose a large structure for a site where low-slung buildings now squat amid residential and commercial towers. Mr. Blau said he hoped to come to terms with the owner of a small pizzeria in the middle of the block, although, he said, the tower could still go up around it.
Like other residential developers today, Related included a large commercial component because big retailers are willing to pay high rents to get into lucrative Manhattan neighborhoods, which offsets the construction of more costly residential space.
But with so little housing built in recent years, demand for apartments has driven rents up 38 percent on the West Side since 1993. The rent for the average two-bedroom apartment in a doorman building rose during that time to more than $2,900 from $2,100, according to Clark Halstead, managing director of the Halstead Property Company.
"The rental market is very strong and there's a shortage of apartments," Mr. Halstead said. "Rents have gone up to the point where it's very feasible to develop market-rate rental buildings. So developers who have sites are rushing to put up rentals."
For that reason, Mr. Blau of Related may have far more success than the developers who came before him. The late Seymour Durst, who purchased the land in the early 1960's, considered putting up an office building on the block. After those plans fell through, however, the Dursts entered lengthy negotiations with Planet Hollywood.
At the last moment, the theme restaurant opted to move onto West 57th Street. The Durst family sold the parcel in 1990 for about $30 million to William Zeckendorf, the developer, and the Swig real estate family, who planned to build the latest addition to the Swigs' Fairmont Hotel chain. But those plans went awry with the recession in 1991.
Related's proposed project on Broadway in many ways resembles the complex it is building in Union Square, on a block bounded by 13th Street, Broadway and Fourth Avenue. Union Square South, as it is known, will be a 21-story tower made up of 240 apartments, a Virgin music and entertainment store, a 14-screen theater and a large electronics store, Circuit City.
The company is also finishing up the Strathmore, a 43-story tower at 400 East 84th Street near First Avenue, and is starting work on an 18-story apartment house at 89th Street and Amsterdam Avenue and 400 apartments at Battery Park City.

HEADLINE: We Are Not the World

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman; Paul Krugman, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the author of "Peddling Prosperity" and "Pop Internationalism."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
It is a truth universally acknowledged that the growing international mobility of goods, capital and technology has completely changed the economic game. Nations, conventional wisdom tells us, no longer have the power to control their own destinies; governments are at the mercy of international markets.
Some celebrate this development, saying that both rich and poor nations benefit. At the same time, a growing number of journalists, union leaders, politicians of both parties and even businessmen deplore it, blaming globalization for instability, unemployment and declining wages. 
 But both sides have it wrong. They take the omnipotence of global markets for granted -- not realizing that reports of the death of national autonomy are greatly exaggerated.
A certain fascination with the march of globalization is understandable. For half a century, world trade has grown faster than world output, and international capital now moves more quickly than ever before. The rapidly expanding exports of newly industrializing economies have put pressure on less-skilled workers in advanced countries even as they offer unprecedented opportunities to tens of millions in the third world. (The wages of those workers are shockingly low but nonetheless represent a vast improvement on their previous, less visible rural poverty.)
But while global economic integration is increasing, its growth has been far outpaced by that of "global economy" rhetoric. Two recent books by economic journalists, William Greider's "One World, Ready or Not" and Robert Kuttner's "Everything for Sale," are jeremiads about the evils of unfettered economic globalism. Politicians like Patrick J. Buchanan and Ross Perot have made careers out of assailing open markets. Even the financier George Soros warns, in the current issue of The Atlantic Monthly, that global capitalism is now a greater threat than totalitarianism to "open society."
Such oratory has become so pervasive that many observers seem determined to blame global markets for a host of economic and social ills in their countries, even when the facts point unmistakably to mainly domestic -- and usually political -- causes.
For example, critics of globalization often cite France, whose Government has taken no serious action to reduce its double-digit unemployment rate, as the perfect example of how states have become powerless in the face of impersonal world markets. France cannot act, according to a recent New York Times article, because of the demands of "European economic integration -- itself partly a response to the competitive demands of the global marketplace."
French policy is indeed paralyzed -- not, however, by impersonal market forces but by the determination of its prestige-conscious politicians not to let the franc decline against the German mark. Britain, which has been willing to let the pound sink relative to the mark, has steadily reduced its unemployment rate with no visible adverse consequences.
The cause of France's paralysis, in other words, is political rather than economic. True, the country must meet the conditions laid down by the Maastricht treaty of 1991, which is supposed to lead to a unified European currency. But creating this currency is more a political than an economic project. Its main purpose is to serve as a symbol of European unity, and many economists think that the costs of the common currency will exceed its benefits. It would actually be more accurate to say that French politics has battered markets rather than the other way around.
And what about the United States, where the continuing power of the Government -- or at any rate that of the Federal Reserve -- to push the economy around can hardly be questioned? Critics of the global economy invariably reply that America may be creating lots of jobs but that they are tenuous because of the prevalence of downsizing, which is a reaction to international competition (a line of reasoning that also provides a good excuse for companies undertaking layoffs).
Come again? Newsweek ran a story last year, titled "The Hit Men," about executives responsible for massive layoffs. The chief executives of AT&T, Nynex, Sears, Philip Morris and Delta Air Lines were high on the list. Of course, international competition plays a role in some downsizings, but as Newsweek's list makes clear, it is hardly the most important cause of the phenomenon. To my knowledge there are no Japanese keiretsu competing to carry my long-distance calls or South Korean conglomerates offering me local service. Nor have many Americans started buying their home appliances at Mexican stores or smoking French cigarettes. I cannot fly Cathay Pacific from Boston to New York.
What explains this propensity to overstate the importance of global markets? In part, it sounds sophisticated. Pontificating about globalization is an easy way to get attention at events like the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Renaissance Weekends in Hilton Head, S.C.
But there is also a deeper cause -- an odd sort of tacit agreement between the left and the right to pretend that exotic global forces are at work even when the real action is prosaically domestic.
Many on the left dislike the global marketplace because it epitomizes what they dislike about markets in general: the fact that nobody is in charge. The truth is that the invisible hand rules most domestic markets, too, a reality that most Americans seem to accept as a fact of life. But those who would like to see us revert to a more managed society in all ways hope that popular unease over the economic influence of people who live in far-off places and have funny-sounding names can be used as the thin end of an ideological wedge.
Meanwhile, many on the right use the rhetoric of globalization to argue that business can no longer be expected to meet any social obligations. For example, it has become standard for opponents of environmental regulations to raise the banner of "competitiveness" and to warn that anything that raises costs for American businesses will price our goods out of world markets.
But even if the global economy matters less than the sweeping assertions would have us believe, does this "globaloney," as the cognoscenti call it, do any real harm? Yes, in part because the public, misguided into believing that international trade is the source of all our problems, might turn protectionist -- undermining the real good that globalization has done for most people here and abroad.
But the overheated oratory poses a more subtle risk. It encourages fatalism, a sense that we cannot come to grips with our problems because they are bigger than we are. Such fatalism is already well advanced in Western Europe, where the public speaks vaguely of the "economic horror" inflicted by world markets instead of turning a critical eye on the domestic leaders whose policies have failed.
None of the important constraints on American economic and social policy come from abroad. We have the resources to take far better care of our poor and unlucky than we do; if our policies have become increasingly mean-spirited, that is a political choice, not something imposed on us by anonymous forces. We cannot evade responsibility for our actions by claiming that global markets made us do it.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Hopeful Cities Explore Bidding for Games

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 12

 BODY:
In the roomful of Billy Payne wannabes, men and women from eight American cities gathered today to learn how to become the host of the 2008 or 2012 Summer Olympics. It is a numbing process, one that is more precise, difficult, restrictive and professional than when Payne led an audacious campaign in the late 1980's to bring the 1996 Summer Games to Atlanta, beating Athens, the sentimental favorite.
"The prize here is so big, and the financial rewards of hosting the Olympics have gotten so much bigger," said Daniel Doctoroff, president of New York City 2008, which is conducting a 10-month study of a potential Olympic bid. "It's very attractive." He said his group's plan envisioned the construction of an Olympic stadium. 
 Doctoroff met last week in Colorado Springs with Dick Schultz, executive director of the United States Olympic Committee. "We were encouraged," he said.
Representatives of potential bidding groups from New York, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Baltimore, Washington, Seattle and Houston attended the U.S.O.C. seminar. All of the groups are in the early stages of their quest. They cannot even begin the race for approval by the U.S.O.C., and then, by the International Olympic Committee, until after the I.O.C. selects the site of the 2004 Summer Olympics in September.
"But we're a year and a half behind other countries looking to bid for 2008," Schultz said. Still, the I.O.C. won't pick a host city for the 2008 Games until the fall of 2001.
For now, the process is entirely directed by the U.S.O.C., which administers the I.O.C.'s criteria. The heart of that criteria is a questionnaire covering more than 500 subjects, with the emphasis on answering all queries in the affirmative. "If you have a flaw," said Roger Jackson, a Canadian Olympic official, "the I.O.C. isn't looking to accept your bid."
One of the crucial challenges for any bidder seeking Payne-like glory will be the I.O.C.'s new requirement that the budgets for all host cities be guaranteed by their local and federal governments. It is unclear whether the I.O.C. expects direct public investment, unless an organizing committee cannot meet its financial commitments.
"The I.O.C. didn't like the risks" that came with the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games' raising $1.8 billion privately without a governmental guarantee, or an indemnification against any losses by the group, said Charlie Battle, the Atlanta committee's former executive vice president.
Several bid cities said they were awaiting word from various government officials.
"It would be helpful if the Federal Government would come forth and say what they would guarantee," said Jerry Pearlman, of Chicago 2008 Bid Review. "Our Governor and Mayor say we have their support, but they also said, 'No new taxes.' But if we can't live within the rules of the I.O.C. and the U.S.O.C., we won't bid."
John Moag, of the Baltimore Committee for the Olympics, and president of the Maryland Stadium Authority, said politicians who may be out of office or dead by 2008 or 2012 must be persuaded of the civic and economic glory of guaranteeing Olympic finances. "If it's 2012, they're going to have to wait 15 years," he said.
On Sunday, the U.S.O.C. board of directors is expected to pass a resolution that will essentially begin the 2008 bidding process.
"They tried to scare people off today," Moag said. "They're not doing their job if they don't cut this list in half."

HEADLINE: Economist's Survey Supports Theory That Inflation Is Overstated

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
In an effort to bolster his case that the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation, Michael J. Boskin, the head of a panel that examined the issue last year, is circulating the results of a survey of fellow economists that backed his conclusions.
The survey is the first formal effort to document whether there is a consensus among economists in support of the the Boskin Commission's estimate that the index overstates actual inflation by 1.1 percentage points each year. 
 The survey, which agreed with this number, is a step in the effort to sway the political debate over whether the Government should cut back cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other Federal benefits, saving the Government tens of billions of dollars a year.
The Senate Finance Committee appointed the commission, which submitted its report in December. But the Clinton Administration, and some members of Congress, have pressured the commission to line up support among other economists for its finding, before considering legislation that would end the indexing of Social Security benefits to the Consumer Price Index.
Mr. Boskin, a Stanford economist who was President George Bush's chief economic adviser, said, "It was an attempt by me to respond more carefully to a question that keeps coming up, that I keep getting asked in testimony."
Mr. Boskin sent the results of his survey to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and members of Congress, among others. A spokesman for Mr. Rubin said the fax from Mr. Boskin arrived on Tuesday night, and that Mr. Rubin had not yet seen it. Mr. Rubin said in December that a broad-based agreement among experts would be needed to justify making an adjustment in Social Security benefits that better reflected actual inflation.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, put the survey's results into the Congressional record. An aide to the Senator said, "We all agree that we need a concensus among experts, and this is part of the consensus that is building up." Senator Moynihan, the ranking minority member of the Senate Finance Committee, has strongly endorsed the commission's report.
Mr. Boskins sent a questionnaire to 24 people he described as experts in the field. Eighteen responded, and their findings averaged 1.2 percentage point. The median finding was 1.1 percentage point, matching exactly the commission's. But the survey quickly drew criticism. Mr. Boskin did not release the names of those to whom he sent the survey, but the 24 included the four other commission members, at least two of whom declined to respond.
"That was an oversight to send a poll intended for other professional economists to members of the commission," said Robert Gordon of Northwestern University, one of the commission members who declined to answer the questionnaire.
In addition, at least three economists recognized as experts in the field but critical of the Boskin Commission's report, said they had not been sent the questionnaire.
One was Jack Triplett, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who has done research on product quality. The commission held that more than half of the upward bias in the Consumer Price Index was because of the failure to subtract from price increases the value of quality improvements. "I would not have responded if I had been asked," Mr. Triplett said. "I don't think we know enough to come up with a number."
Mr. Boskin's survey asked for each person's "best judgment on the likely bias in using the change in the C.P.I. as a measure of the change in the cost of living."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Increase Funds for Anti-Milosevic Media and Unions

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The United States is significantly expanding its support of newspapers, radio stations and trade unions opposed to President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, senior American officials said today.
While the money to be distributed in 1997 is small -- about $2 million -- it is five times the $400,000 provided last year. The officials said the increase was a direct result of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Belgrade and other cities against the authoritarian rule of Mr. Milosevic. 
 The aid is another indication of a shift in policy away from Mr. Milosevic, who was a crucial supporter of the Dayton peace accords of December 1995, which halted the war in Bosnia. American officials now say Mr. Milosevic is no longer critical to stability in Bosnia.
"His days are numbered," one official said. "Now it's a matter of when his era ends, not if, and how it does. Even if he survives, he won't be able to exercise the same unbridled rule. The rules have changed."
Some of the money can be delivered immediately through the American Embassy in Belgrade in small grants valued at $5,000 to $10,000, the officials said. The support is to be given not in cash but in goods, like computers or newspaper ink, and technical assistance.
Most of the aid, which has already been appropriated, is to be funneled through American groups like the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems. These foundations can usually provide support faster than the Agency for International Development.
The groups, officials said, will organize programs to train journalists, union leaders and political parties in the ways of democracy. In other countries this has included teaching political parties how to use polling data and advertising, and to draw up party platforms.
While praising the program, some representatives of the groups criticized the Administration for being so late. In 1996, they point out, the Government aid of $400,000 was dwarfed by funds provided by the private Open Society Institute, led by the financier George Soros, and by European countries.
Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, has been prominent in urging more support for independent news media in Serbia.
The effort was hampered last year by American sanctions against Serbia and by the general atmosphere of suppression, American officials say. Efforts by the Embassy to find worthy recipients independent of the Government were made difficult by the "reticence" of Serbian organizations to seek or accept aid from Americans, a senior official said.
But after the demonstrators, who demanded the reinstatement of opposition victories in local elections in November, began to chip away at Mr. Milosevic's rule, Serbian organizations were more willing to come forward.
And American credibility with the opposition was helped by the decision in December to incorporate reports from the independent radio station B92 into transmissions of Radio Free Europe when Mr. Milosevic tried to shut it down.
"People have shed their fears about operating in public," one senior official said. "People are more approachable, and more willing to take risks in approaching American officials."
A successful program will still require the tolerance of the Serbian Government, which could withhold visas for American aid workers and experts working for the American groups, or prevent Serbs from traveling to the United States for training and study.
"If they do that, we have big problems," the official said. "But we're plunging ahead in expectation of approval of the Serbian Government to work in Belgrade."

HEADLINE: It's Not Real Big, but Texas Takes to It

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
New York has its official state muffin (apple), Arizona its official neckwear (bolo tie), and Massachusetts its official dog (Boston terrier).
Kansans are proud to call the ornate box turtle their official reptile, while Ohioans who drink tomato juice are downing the state beverage. 
 Now Texas is on the verge of getting an official state molecule: the buckyball.
The buckyball, a soccer-ball-shaped compound of 60 carbon atoms also known as the Buckminsterfullerene, is so named because its contour resembles those of R. Buckminster Fuller's geodesic domes. It was discovered by two Rice University professors, and, just months after they earned a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for that discovery, a State Representative from Houston is unveiling a proposal to designate the buckyball the molecule of Texas.
The legislator, Scott Hochberg, an alumnus of Rice, says he has broad support for the measure and expects it to sail through the Legislature.
It probably will, although a group of University of Texas alumni point out that the Texaphyrin, an engineered molecule invented by chemists at -- guess where -- the University of Texas, might make a worthy competitor, for its use in cancer treatment. "The buckyball is a wonderful molecule," said one of the inventors, Prof. Jonathan Sessler, "but our molecule is going to be better."
"I don't think so," Representative Hochberg said. "Nobody won the Nobel for discovering that," at least not yet.
Official designations can make for remarkably contentious battles.
In New York, it took a highly persistent group of fourth graders from Syracuse to prevail upon Mario M. Cuomo, then the Governor, to sign the apple-muffin bill in 1987.
New Jersey remains without an official anthem after years of legislative battles. "The Jersey Bounce," a 1940's swing hit, never made it. Bruce Springsteen's classic "Born to Run" was a strong contender a few years back, but a group of legislators offended by some of the lyrics ("Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims and strap your hands across my engines") blocked it.
And perhaps most famously, amid a debate that stretched back to the 19th century, the United States went without a national flower until the Reagan Administration. Lawmakers simply found the competition -- among the rose, the marigold, the corn tassel, the mountain laurel, the columbine, the dandelion and a host of other candidates -- too hot an issue to touch. Congress finally put an end to the matter in 1986, settling on the rose as the official "national floral emblem."
Mr. Hochberg said he believed that Texas would be the first state with an official molecule. (Indeed, none are listed in "Facts About the States," an exhaustive compendium of official designations.)
The buckyball, discovered in 1985 by the Rice chemists Dr. Richard E. Smalley and Dr. Robert F. Curl Jr., has a range of important possible applications, including the conducting of electricity and the delivery of medicines to precise locations within the body.
"Yes, it is a fun thing to do," Mr. Hochberg said of the designation, "but it also recognizes where the state is going in terms of economic development and our high-tech future."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Continued Rise In the Dollar May Compel Officials to Act

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and his allies in the Group of Seven industrial nations are trying to rein in the dollar, which has jumped 14 percent against the German mark and 16 percent against the Japanese yen in the last year.
But in the statement they issued in Berlin backing this goal, they included one sentence that may have unintentionally given currency traders a reason to push the dollar even higher -- particularly against the German mark and other European currencies. 
 The key words are these: "We reaffirmed our views that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals."
By yesterday, the fourth trading day since Mr. Rubin switched from strong dollar to strong enough, traders were looking at those 11 words, along with new indications of a weakening in the economic fundamentals that can support currencies -- higher interest rates and attractive economic growth.
"This highlights the thought that the dollar should be able to trade higher" against European currencies, said Audrey McNiff, vice president in foreign exchange sales at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
And yesterday the dollar did trade higher, moving well above where it was on Friday against the German mark and higher against the Japanese yen.
"The one thing that we took away from that statement was that the central banks are serious and that they think that fundamentals should drive the dollar," Ms. McNiff said. And, she added, "You made a lot of money last year by listening to the central banks."
She said that recent gains in unemployment in Germany and Switzerland and pessimistic reports from the business communities in both countries were being taken as signs "of a worsening of the economic situation in Europe." That means interest rates are more likely to fall or remain stable and growth could be sluggish, all factors that favor the dollar.
What this means for Secretary Rubin and the Clinton Administration is that they, together with their allies, could be forced sooner than they might like to follow their words with actions.
That effort could begin with clearer verbal jawboning from Mr. Rubin and other finance ministers and follow with intervention by the United States and other countries that would sell dollars to lower the value. But those actions are likely to have no more than a temporary effect, analysts say, if the economic fundamentals that move currencies -- interest rates, economic growth and global capital flows -- do not cease to favor the dollar, as they do now.
"As long as investors assume the outlook is for solid U.S. growth and lower inflation, disappointment about the outlook on European growth and pessimism about Japan's economy and policy outlook, there is no reason to see a turn in the dollar's climb," said John Lipsky, the chief economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
"The intriguing question is when the G-7 ministers think their credibility is at stake and they have to do something," he said.
"The notion that there might be some new policy action behind the new policy is highly inconceivable," Mr. Lipsky said, adding that he would not expect the Federal Reserve to undermine the dollar by lowering its target for short-term interest rates.
In trading yesterday, the dollar jumped as high as 1.6940 marks to the dollar, its highest level in almost three years, after a report suggested that the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, would not mind the dollar moving into the 1.70 range.
The dollar lost much of its gain after a spokesman for the Bundesbank denied the report. But the currency ended higher on the day, at 1.6846 marks, up from 1.6766 Tuesday and 2 percent higher than last Thursday, the day before Mr. Rubin made his policy switch. Against the yen, the dollar was at 124.17 in late New York trading, up from 123.15 Tuesday and half a percent higher than last Thursday.
Ms. McNiff said that the short-term outlook against the yen should be more stable than against the mark, unless there is new information showing that the Japanese economy is in worse shape or that policy initiatives are floundering. "Traders will give the benefit of the doubt in the short term," she said, because the current Japanese negatives versus the dollar -- a weak economy, lower interest rates and uncertain government policies -- all are well known.
"The next step we go," she said referring to the mark and the yen and the Group of Seven statement, "has to be on new fundamentals.
Analysts and traders noted that the statement issued by the Group of Seven, which includes Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada, was not very strong. Mr. Lipsky called it "indistinct." Carl B. Weinberg, the chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said all it had was "six verbs."
The key sentences about their concern about the dollar were these: "We believe that major misalignments in exchange markets noted in our April 1995 communique have been corrected." And, "We agreed to monitor developments in exchange markets and cooperate as appropriate."
In the April 25, 1995, statement, when the Group of Seven met as the dollar was falling to its lowest levels since World War II, their statement was more forceful. They said that the dollar had fallen "beyond the levels justified by underlying economic conditions in the major countries." And the Group of Seven "agreed that orderly reversal of those movements is desirable."
Nicholas P. Sargen, J. P. Morgan's market strategist for private clients, thinks the Group of Seven "is worried about the foreign exchange market overshooting" and is telling traders, "Let's not get the dollar too strong."
But he adds "that is their dilemma, because the fundamentals support a stronger dollar."

HEADLINE: Beach Clubs and Ski Slopes Would Lose Money, Too

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
As the strike deadline fixed by American Airlines' pilots draws nearer, travel agents have been besieged by worried clients at destinations where American dominates the air-travel market.
Officials at several popular vacation spots heavily served by American -- warm-weather areas like the Caribbean and cold-weather destinations like Colorado -- said the economies in their regions could be hit hard by a strike. 
 "Strikes like this always have a wide ripple effect," said Gordon Lambourne, a spokesman for Marriott Lodging, a unit of Marriott International, which has hotels in St. Thomas and Aruba, as well as in Florida and other resort destinations. "They don't just affect travelers; they affect hotels, rental-car companies, cruise ships, desinations, theme parks, restaurants -- you name it."
In Miami, American's most recently established hub, there were predictions that a strike at the AMR Corporation unit would result in $258 million in lost revenue, assuming that it lasted a month, because 234,000 fewer visitors would come to the city. Officials also forecast $33 million in lost pay from aviation-related jobs and $16 million in lost tax money. According to Merrett Stierheim, president of the Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, American provides 50.3 percent of airline seats to Miami.
Jean Holder, secretary general of the Caribbean Tourism Organization, said a strike by American, which provides 70 percent of the airline seats to the region, "would be a disaster worse than any hurricane."
Colorado, the nation's biggest destination for skiers, is also likely to be hurt by a strike. "It couldn't have come at a worse time because this is our busiest weekend," said Lynn Bronikowski, a spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country U.S.A., a trade group. The state gets 40 percent of its ski business between Washington's Birthday weekend and the end of March, she said, and American brings 2,000 skiers a day into four mountain airports.
"A lot of those people belong to groups," Ms. Bronikowski said, "and it's harder for groups to make alternate plans. So a strike won't just affect our industry; it could ruin a lot of vacations."
Though the economic effect of a strike would be great for vacation destinations, travelers and the other airlines would obviously feel its impact, as well -- particularly because this month has been one of the busiest Februaries in recent years for the airlines.
Adding to the crush of travelers is the popularity of Valentine's cruises, many of which depart from ports in Florida or Puerto Rico, this weekend, when the strike is to begin if no agreement is reached between the pilots and the airline. The cruise industry has been frantically rebooking thousands of passengers from American onto other airlines.
In anticipation of a strike, American has stopped offering special fares to computer users on the Internet.
Some of American's competitors have been taking steps to reduce overbooking in preparation. Delta Air Lines, for example, has extended through Feb. 21 the restrictions it imposed on some tickets last week. Initially imposed for just the Washington's Birthday holiday weekend, the tickets are nonrefundable and require that customers pay for them within 24 hours of making reservations.
Even higher ticket prices do not seem to be an impediment to people who are determined to get away despite the strike threat. "A lot of our members have booked the higher-priced tickets" on other airlines, said Steve Loucks, a spokesman for the American Society of Travel Agents, "because they would rather pay more to be sure of getting to their destination."
Partly for that reason, "air fares are going to shoot up like crazy, especially for leisure travelers, because there aren't going to be any cheap seats," said Ronald J. Nordheimer, president of the Delaware Travel Agency in Wilmington.
Leisure travelers with reservations on other carriers will not lose their seats despite the crush of fliers displaced by a strike, the airlines say.
But while the carriers will attempt to accommodate the extra traffic, travelers with several types of tickets on American are likely to encounter problems, they say. These include tickets obtained with American frequent-flier miles, discount tickets on American that were purchased from consolidators or tickets given to passengers bumped from earlier flights.
 
Chart: "Tips For Travelers"
Suggestions from airlines and travel agents for those planning to fly.
 
FOR FLIGHTS TODAY AND TOMORROW
 
Take along reservations numbers of all other airlines that fly to of from your destination.
 
Show up at the airport at least two hours before flight time, carry a photo I.D., and be sure the ticket is in your name.
 
American has cancelled 129 long-haul roundtrip flights tomorow, mostly to Europe, Japan and South America, but it will fly to and from Heathrow and Gatwick airports in London.
 
IF AMERICAN SHUTS DOWN
 
Ask your travel agent if the travel agency has a toll-free number to phone for strike updates.
 
Be prepared to fly at off-peak hours and via circuitous routes.
 
Travel as light as possible, rather than risk having to lug heavy suitcases long distances in the event gates are changed -- a definite possibility as carriers struggle to cope with the confusion and crowds that often accompany a strike.
 
Do not expect to fly on a an American frequent flier ticket, a discount ticket purchased from a consolidator or a ticket given for being bumped from a flight or for voluntarily giving up one's seat. Remember, paying passengers have priority American's reservations agents and employees at airport counters will at airport ticket counters for at least the first days of the strike to help passengers make other arrangements.
 
American's toll free reservations number is: (800) 433-7300. (pg. D21)

HEADLINE: Dispute at American Airlines Draws Clinton Plea

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
American Airlines canceled most of its Friday night overseas flights today in the face of a looming strike deadline, as President Clinton urged the nation's second-largest carrier and its pilots' union to use mediation to resolve a dispute that he said "has huge implications for our country."
With a strike deadline set for 12:01 A.M. on Saturday and widespread disruptions in travel plans already apparent, pressure intensified on the parties. Mr. Clinton said he was following the matter "very closely" and ordered his Administration to study the potential economic disruptions of a strike -- a first step toward any Presidential intervention. 
 But White House aides insisted that Mr. Clinton was loath to intercede in the standoff, preferring to keep pressure on the airline and union to avert a strike that would throw the nation's air travel system into turmoil at the height of the winter tourist season.
"The time has not expired and I want to encourage the parties to make maximum use of the mediation board process," Mr. Clinton said today, in his first public comments on the matter, at an unrelated White House ceremony on air safety. "That's what ought to be done today and that's all I have to say about it."
Airline and union negotiators continued to meet throughout the day here, after the pilots rejected management's latest pay offer. An American spokesman said that the airline had canceled its overseas flights for Friday night, except for flights to London, to assure that its planes would not be stranded abroad if the pilots walk out.
A strike would cancel 2,200 flights by American on Saturday, affecting as many as 220,000 passengers.
Ken Hipp, chairman of the National Mediation Board, which is conducting the talks, said that the process was "going slowly and with increasing difficulty," and that even the discussion of possible Presidential involvement "makes it much more difficult to get an agreement at the table."
Under the Railway Labor Act, Mr. Clinton could intervene to name a three-member Presidential emergency panel to recommend a nonbinding resolution of the dispute, if the mediation board found that the strike threatened a region's central transportation system and recommended intervention. Such a panel would have 30 days to devise recommendations and the parties would have another 30 days to consider them, with no work stoppage in the meantime.
Such boards are relatively common in rail strikes, but the White House said today that none had been convened in an airline strike since a machinists' strike against five carriers disrupted service for 40 days in 1966. President George Bush twice declined to appoint such a board during a machinists' strike against Eastern Airlines in 1989.
In recent years, a far more common practice has been jawboning and arm-twisting, such as Mr. Clinton informal intervention after a five-day flight attendants' strike against American on the eve of Thanksgiving in 1993, in which he persuaded the parties to submit to binding arbitration.
But Mr. Clinton's informal efforts to break a logjam in the Major League Baseball strike in 1995 failed, and White House aides said that there was little incentive to get involved in the current dispute unless absolutely necessary.
"There's no gain in this for us being involved," one senior aide said, "because you have every angry passenger whose flight gets screwed up blaming us. We want them to settle the damn dispute and do it before midnight Friday."
A strike against American would be particularly disruptive because of the major airlines' system of hub services, in which carriers concentrate routes through particular cities. For example, two-thirds of all flights at Dallas and Miami are American flights, while one-third of those at Chicago's O'Hare International are on American.
American Airlines carries roughly 20 percent of the nation's air travelers, or about 220,000 passengers a day. Though February is normally a slow month, the big airlines already expect to fill more than 70 percent of their seats.
Despite the prospect of such a disruption, the shares of the airline's parent company, the AMR Corporation, surged yesterday, rising $3.125, or 3.8 percent, to $82.875. Much of the gain came after the White House issued its statement.
One Administration official estimated the possibility of averting a strike by the American pilots as less than 50-50. And because the pilots earn an average salary of $120,000 a year, with resources to endure a strike, White House aides said that Mr. Clinton would have less leverage in persuading them that a settlement would be in their best interests, as he did with the less well-paid flight attendants in 1993.
A strike would put about 90,000 employees on unpaid furlough, ground the silver-skinned American fleet and roil the plans of Valentine's Day and Washington's Birthday travelers, especially in the Caribbean destinations heavily served by American and American Eagle.
The company and the Allied Pilots Association have been wrangling over the pact for more than two years. Today, the union president, Jim Sovich, said that the company's latest offer, which was made on Tuesday, was worth $43.1 million less over the life of the contract than a tentative agreement that the pilots voted down last month.
In that agreement, the company had offered to raise pilots' pay by 3 percent this Aug. 31 and another 2 percent by Aug. 31, 1999. Pilots would also get options to buy three million shares of stock at $10 less per share than the market price at the time the contract was signed and another 2.75 million shares at the Aug. 31, 1998 price.
The new offer would increase the 1999 raise to 3 percent, but drop the option to buy the 2.75 million shares, which the company said was an effort to meet the union's demands for more cash and less stock.
But a union spokesman, David Bates, told reporters, "We're very disappointed in this offer."
The union's negotiating committee is to take the proposal to its 18-member board, but has called it unacceptable.

HEADLINE: Question in New York Trial: How Long Is Arm of the Law?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
For three months, a 13th-floor courtroom on Centre Street in Manhattan has been the scene of an emotional trial of three members of one family that has received far more attention in Venezuela than it has in New York.
The family is that of Orlando Castro Llanes, 71, an influential financier in Venezuela until a banking crisis there in 1994 led to a run on that country's financial institutions, the collapse of his empire and losses of more than $15 million to depositors in banks he controlled. 
 The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, has charged Mr. Castro, his 47-year-old son, Orlando Castro Castro, and his 29-year-old grandson, Jorge Castro Barredo, with scheming to defraud Venezuelans of millions of dollars. The case is expected to go to the Manhattan jury tomorrow.
In Venezuela, a soap-opera aspect of the case has included hints of deep Venezuelan feuds and dark suggestions from the Castros that Mr. Morgenthau is carrying out a vendetta for unspecified powerful Venezuelans. But among lawyers in New York, the case is drawing attention for a less sensational reason: the Castros never did business in New York.
Some lawyers are criticizing Mr. Morgenthau for what they say is a bid for global influence that is excessive for a local prosecutor. But Mr. Morgenthau and his supporters say the case is nothing more than an adaptation of existing law that represents how prosecutors will have to respond to modern white-collar crime. In an age when computers can move money around the globe in a flash, they say, prosecutors who are inhibited by national borders -- let alone local ones -- risk being outrun by criminals.
Over the objections of the defense, the Manhattan prosecutors convinced Justice Edward J. McLaughlin of State Supreme Court in Manhattan that they had the power to bring the case here because many of the transactions involved checks drawn on banks in New York or electronic transfers of funds that passed through banks in New York.
In his office this week, Mr. Morgenthau argued that because of New York's role as a global banking center, he had a special duty to protect the integrity of the banking system. "If the banking system goes down, the place that's going to be most affected is Manhattan," he said. "If you let people use New York for one kind of crime -- banking crime -- they're going to use it for others."
Ronald K. Noble, who was Undersecretary of the Treasury for Enforcement until last year, sees the Castro case as little more than an application of existing law, which has long proclaimed that a prosecutor can file a case if a wire transfer of funds occurs in his territory. "What Morgenthau is saying is, 'If you want to commit fraud, stay out of the U.S. and, particularly, stay out of New York,' " Mr. Noble said.
Supporters of Mr. Morgenthau say he is a leader in establishing more aggressive policing of global finance, beginning in 1989 with his investigation of the multibillion-dollar international fraud case involving the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. That investigation ultimately led to the closing of the bank and the recovery of more than $1.6 billion for depositors.
But critics say Mr. Morgenthau's office established jurisdiction over B.C.C.I. partly because that bank had a New York office and other New York ties. The Castros had no New York office and their lawyers say none of them were ever in New York before they were arrested in Miami last spring and extradited to face Mr. Morgenthau's charges.
Some critics say Mr. Morgenthau is overreaching as he tries to recapture the attention he received after the B.C.C.I. case. And some financial experts question whether it is good policy for a state prosecutor from a single county to involve himself in foreign banking controversies.
Geoffrey P. Miller, a nationally known banking law expert at New York University Law School, said he thought Mr. Morgenthau was improperly trying to put New York in a position to regulate global financial practices. "I think he has a God complex to think he's the one who has to rescue the financial world," Mr. Miller said.
Mr. Morgenthau has alleged that the Castros stole millions from their depositors to prop up other businesses in Venezuela and misled depositors into believing their money was protected under American banking laws while they were actually losing millions in risky options trading. The prosecutors also say that Jorge Castro Barredo, the nephew of Orlando Castro Castro, used some of the depositors' money to buy such items as jet skis and a yacht.
In the courtroom, the defense lawyers have met such allegations with flat denials and differing explanations of what the complex financial records prove. But they also argue that it is unfair to force businessmen to answer for their conduct in a foreign land. And they have repeatedly appealed to jurors to send Mr. Morgenthau a message.
"If I was a New York taxpayer, I'd be ready to jump out of my skin knowing what went on here," Richard Sharpstein, the lawyer for the senior Mr. Castro said in his closing statement to the jurors on Monday.
Outside of the courtroom, there has been what amounts to a campaign by the defense to portray Mr. Morgenthau as a blunderer who was misled by a former Venezuelan official named Thor Halvorssen. Mr. Halvorssen was an anti-drug czar for the Venezuelan Government with the rank of ambassador from 1989 to 1994, and drew attention in Venezuela last fall when he told a Caracas magazine that the Castro family had arranged to have him beaten and imprisoned and that Orlando Castro Castro had come into his cell and urinated on his face.
As Venezuela's drug czar, Mr. Halvorssen knew Mr. Morgenthau from other investigations. It is also clear that old animosities exist between Mr. Halvorssen and the Castros. People who know them all say the bitterness may trace back to a takeover battle in Venezuela during the 1980's in which the Castros and Mr. Halvorsen were on opposite sides.
The senior Mr. Castro and Mr. Halvorssen have sued each other in Federal Court in Florida, with Mr. Castro contending that Mr. Halvorssen defamed him and Mr Halvorssen saying that Mr. Castro arranged to have him incarcerated and beaten.
Mr. Halvorssen has denied in previous interviews that he is carrying out a vendetta. He was not called to testify or even mentioned in the Manhattan case. He could not be reached, and his lawyers did not respond to repeated phone calls.
But in an interview this week, Mr. Castro's lawyer, Mr. Sharpstein, said the Manhattan criminal charges were based on "ridiculous allegations that began and ended with Thor Halvorssen," who, he said, falsely told Mr. Morgenthau that the Castros were money launderers for drug traffickers.
Mr. Sharpstein said Mr. Morgenthau had been misled by Mr. Halvorssen into filing the charges. "My guess is," Mr. Sharpstein said, "he was taken by the nose and led to believe this was some massive money-laundering scheme."
Mr. Morgenthau has said repeatedly that his office began studying Venezuelan banks because of an interest in pursuing money laundering operations in that country that might affect drug imports into New York. But he has been careful to say that there are no money-laundering allegations against the Castros by his office and he repeated this week that money laundering was not involved in the bank-fraud case.
Asked about Mr. Sharpstein's allegations that he had been misled by Mr. Halvorssen, Mr. Morgenthau denied that his investigation of the Castros had begun with information from Mr. Halvorssen. He said the investigation started when officials of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York expressed concerns about the New York transactions of the Castros' banking operations.
He said high officials of the Venezuelan Government had also asked him to bring charges against the Castros, who moved to Florida when their banks failed.
Mr. Morgenthau acknowledged that he had worked with Mr. Halvorssen in the past. But he said: "Halvorssen in no way played an important role in this investigation. Did he do a lot of talking about money laundering in Venezuelan banks? Yes. But did he play a key role in this investigation? No."
Prosecutors from Mr. Morgethau's office are scheduled to deliver closing statements today. Then, a jury that includes two New York nurses, an actor and an unemployed parking attendant are to begin trying to decide whether three Venezuelan bankers should be convicted of criminal charges in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Prominent Welfare-to-Work Effort Is Off to Slow Start

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

 BODY:
In his State of the Union address last week, President Clinton hailed five giant corporations for their pioneering efforts to put welfare recipients to work. But the limited progress of those companies is evidence of the daunting scope of the project.
While the five companies together employ nearly 700,000 workers in the United States, they have hired only a few hundred welfare recipients through targeted efforts since the welfare bill was signed last summer. Most of those workers were put on the payroll by just one company, United Parcel Service of America Inc. 
 Officials of all the companies -- the others are Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C.; the Sprint Corporation; the Monsanto Company, and United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation -- said they were making a long-term commitment to hire welfare recipients, though market forces would ultimately determine the number of jobs the companies provide.
"This thing is not based on getting 100 people or one million people off welfare," said Joseph Schneider, vice president of human resources for U.P.S. "It's based on our need for employees."
Since signing the landmark legislation in August that ended the Federal entitlement to welfare benefits and requiring most recipients to find work within two years, Mr. Clinton has looked to private business to create those jobs.
"I'd like to say to every employer in this country who has ever criticized the old welfare system, 'You cannot blame the old system anymore,' " the President said in his State of the Union address on Feb. 4. "We have torn it down. Now do your part. Give someone on welfare the chance to work."
The budget Mr. Clinton proposed two days later included an estimated $600 million in tax credits over the next four years intended to subsidize the hiring of 120,000 or more welfare beneficiaries by private businesses. Employers would get a tax credit of 50 percent of the first $10,000 paid to newly hired workers who had been on welfare at least 18 months.
Other companies than those cited by Mr. Clinton have more experience in hiring from the welfare rolls; indeed, with the exception of U.P.S., the five employers said they were either just devising programs or were having limited success finding job candidates who met their standards. But all expressed optimism that the new relationships they were forging with social agencies and community-based groups would bear fruit.
Officials of some business groups said, however, that more leadership was needed from government if the smaller companies that create most jobs are to enlist in Mr. Clinton's campaign.
"It's perfectly all right for the President to put the spotlight on every world-class corporation that wants to do something," said Jeffrey R. Joseph, vice president for domestic policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce, "but I don't think they really accomplish all that much on their own."
The chief executives of the companies mentioned in the State of the Union address were among the participants in a meeting with Mr. Clinton in January on welfare-to-work efforts. The public notice they received was not meant to denigrate other companies that might be doing as much, said Mary Ellen Glynn, the deputy White House press secretary.
Still, officials of one company that went unmentioned, Marriott International, were smarting.
"We were shocked and very disappointed," said Janet Tully, the hotel company's director of community employment and training programs. Long before the welfare bill gained bipartisan support, Marriott had programs to hire welfare recipients, Ms. Tully said.
Marriott's chairman, J. Willard Marriott Jr., was invited to the January meeting with Mr. Clinton but was unable to attend; Ms. Tully said a White House aide told her that was why the company was not mentioned in the President's speech.
At Marriott, the welfare-to-work program typically trains 12 to 18 participants over six weeks in classroom and occupational skills training. The program is financed by Pathways and government sources. After placement in full-time jobs, the trainees are given six months of follow-up support to help promote job retention.
So far, efforts by the five companies mentioned by Mr. Clinton are less well developed.
Sprint, the fast-growing provider of long-distance phone service, said it would hire 25 welfare recipients this year to add to its 47,000 workers. Monsanto, an international chemical and biotechnology company with 18,000 workers in the United States, has given full-time jobs to 5 former welfare recipients and helped 45 others obtain jobs with companies that supply Monsanto with contract services, officials said.
United Airlines and Burger King both said they were still developing programs.
Like other fast-food chains, Burger King, with 7,000 domestic outlets and nearly 300,000 employees, is faced with a huge turnover rate; officials said the company had to replace the equivalent of its entire hourly work force every year. United said it wanted to find ways to hire welfare recipients for entry-level jobs like handling baggage and cleaning airplane cabins, as well as jobs requiring higher levels of training, like reservation agents and sales clerks.
U.P.S., with 290,000 workers, signed up last August for a state program in Illinois to help create jobs for people on welfare, becoming the first employer to do so. The company, which is based in Atlanta, gave part-time jobs starting at $8 an hour for roughly 25 hours a week to 31 residents of the Chicago area who completed a training program.
Similar efforts led to the hiring of 80 workers at the company's Philadelphia hub, about 100 in New York City, and additional workers in other cities, Mr. Schneider of U.P.S. said.
In many parts of the country, he noted, economic growth has created a demand for entry-level manpower. But companies will not hire welfare recipients unless the applicants exhibit personal discipline and meet minimum qualifications for work, Mr. Schneider said.
Indeed, at one of its four pilot job-training sites, Monsanto rejected 11 of every 12 applicants screened by local or state agencies, said Cyndy Rosenbloom, the director of human resources at the company, which is based in St. Louis.
"One of the things we quickly discovered," Ms. Rosenbloom said, "was that a state's standards for employment were not the marketplace's standards. We were being sent people certified by state job training programs who could not do simple math equations, had little sense of grammar and were below standards in performing functions."
Sprint, along with AT&T and Gateway 2000, has agreed to hire graduates from a program recently started at Metropolitan Community Colleges in Kansas City, Mo., close to its headquarters in Westwood, Kan.
The six-week program trains welfare recipients for customer service and telemarketing positions -- skills in great demand in the Kansas City area, where the unemployment rate is less than 3 percent.
"Demand is such we could place 300 graduates a month," said Jackie Snyder, the institution's vice chancellor.
But in Kansas City, too, finding welfare recipients with suitable skills has been difficult. The first class has only 6 participants, and the second, due to start next Monday, will have 12, Ms. Snyder said.
"We don't want to put people through the program who would not be hired because they don't have the basic speaking or reading skills needed for success in a call-center environment," she said.

Europeans Postpone Case Against Helms-Burton Law
Europe decided, reluctantly, to postpone its legal challenge to American sanctions against companies doing business in Cuba. Washington had warned that the United States would declare Cuba a threat to its security, which would invoke an exemption to the World Trade Organization's jurisdiction. The Europeans fear that such a use of the national security exemption would damage the organization's authority. A1
 
The Clinton Administration agreed to allow 10 news organizations to open offices in Cuba, but will continue barring Cuban news bureaus from the United States. Cuba thus far has approved only one American news organization, CNN, to open a bureau there. A11
 
A Cuban court sentenced six people to prison terms ranging from 8 to 20 years for hijacking a tugboat and trying to flee to Florida last year. The United States Coast Guard intercepted them and handed them over to the Cuban authorities. A10
 
North Korean Said to Defect
South Korea reported that a top North Korean leader was in its consulate in Beijing and had asked for asylum. If confirmed, the defection of Hwang Jang Yop would be a spectacular coup for Western intelligence services. North Korea suggested that Mr. Hwang, the top theoretician of its ideology of self-reliance and the former tutor of its leader, Kim Jong Il, had been kidnapped. A3
U.S. to Aid Serbian Opposition
American officials said the United States would quintuple its financial aid to the Serbian opposition. The officials said the increase was directly due to the daily pro-democracy demonstrations that began in November in Belgrade and other cities. The program will require the tolerance of the Government of President Slobodan Milosevic. A3
 
Russian Tycoon Files Libel Suit
One of Russia's richest businessmen and most controversial politicians filed a libel suit in London against Forbes magazine. Forbes had published an article suggesting that the official, Boris A. Berezovsky, had built his career on corruption and links to organized crime. Forbes vigorously defended its article. A4
 
U.N. Criticizes Rwanda Tribunal
The United Nations issued a scathing report on the international criminal tribunal it set up to investigate the 1994 genocide of over half a million Tutsi and moderate Hutu in Rwanda. The report called for "substantial" changes, alleging that not a single area functioned effectively. Secretary General Kofi Annan promised further action. A13
 
Interim Government in Bulgaria
Bulgaria's president swore in a caretaker prime minister and called elections for April 19, ending two years of economically ruinous Socialist rule. Stefan Sofiyanski, the new Prime Minister, must now try to mend the nation's hyperinflation and sharp drop in living standards. (AP)

4 Balk at Fund-Raising Inquiry
A congressional committee chairman said three former members of the Clinton Administration and a fund-raiser had refused to cooperate with a House investigation into improper money-raising for the Democratic Party. The chairman, Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican, said subpoenas would be served on all four. B9
 
Gifts Campaign Goes Public
An advocacy group that wants to force Congress to change the campaign finance system said it would take its case to the public by trying to collect 1,776,000 signatures by the Fourth of July. Efforts at campaign finance reform in Congress have stalled in recent days. B9 
 
Hazards of Car Phones
Talking on a cellular telephone while driving increases the risk of an accident fourfold, the same increased risk faced by someone who drives drunk, Canadian researchers said. But 39 percent of the drivers studied used their phones to call for help after they crashed. A30
 
Cohen Defends Military Budget
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen defended President Clinton's military budget from attacks by his former Republican colleagues in the House and Senate. He said he did agree with them that too much was being spent on peacekeeping missions and not enough on modernization. B10
 
Opening Seen for Gains-Tax Cut
Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, said there might be enough bipartisan support for a cut in the capital gains tax to overcome the opposition of the Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin. His view was based on recent statements by some Congressional Democrats. A21
 
Abortion Pill Dispute Is Settled
A nonprofit group holding the right to sell the French abortion pill in the United States agreed to settle a lawsuit about control of the drug. The settlement will give control of the drug to a new company, Advances for Choice. By July, the company is to submit the material needed to win Food and Drug Administration approval to sell it.

Panel Acts on Airports Measure
The House Ways and Means Committee approved a bill to reinstate a package of expired aviation taxes, including the 10 percent tax on domestic tickets that lapsed last month. The taxes pay for airport improvement projects, and without an extension, the Government has said, the money could run out by about March 1. A Senate committee has already acted to extend the taxes.

HEADLINE: Failings in Quality

 BODY:
To The Home Section:
 "When What You See Is All You Get" is an accurate description of failings in quality in a large part of today's design/build industry.
One source asserts that the current lack of standards can be attributed to the lack of skilled labor, which he calls "the industry's largest problem." Because of this, he says, "builders are always looking for ways to decrease the amount of labor necessary." 
 Quality craftsmen have always been scarce. It is the architect who is mandated by law and tradition to find such craftsmen. Yes, they still exist. Yet, architects are often denied a central role in construction. It is a misguided economy, as your article demonstrates.

HEADLINE: EUROPE POSTPONES CHALLENGE TO U.S. ON HAVANA TRADE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
In a last-minute effort to avoid a major breach with the United States that could threaten the future of the World Trade Organization, Europe postponed today its legal challenge to American sanctions against companies doing business in Cuba.
European officials said that in the hope of reaching a compromise, they reluctantly asked the organization, the two-year-old arbiter of trade disputes, to delay for a week the naming of a panel to rule on the validity of the Helms-Burton Act, which imposes sanctions on non-American companies doing business with the Castro Government. Europe calls the act an illegal attempt to force Europe, Canada and Mexico to join the American effort to isolate Castro. 
 The postponement follows a week of frenzied and sometimes bitter negotiations between Washington and European officials in Brussels.
After failing repeatedly to get Europe to drop its case, the Administration warned officials this week that it would invoke a "national security exemption," based on an assertion that Cuba poses a security threat to the United States, saying that the organization, which is empowered to rule only on trade disputes, is thus not qualified to judge the case.
But the strategy carries considerable long-term risks for the United States. This is the first major case to come before the new Geneva-based organization, which the United States strenuously supported, and American officials have argued that it must have broad powers to rule on economic disputes.
But many European officials, and some in the Clinton Administration, have argued that the United States would forever damage the agency's authority by invoking the national security exemption because other countries often cite national security grounds to justify keeping their markets closed.
Japan, for example, has long asserted that keeping out imported rice is rooted in Japan's "food security." South Korea, China and other nations have made similar security arguments about maintaining an industrial base to produce cars and computer chips.
Today the European Union's senior trade official, Sir Leon Brittan, accused Washington of seeking "to be judge and jury in its own cause." "It is not acceptable to say this issue is too sensitive for the W.T.O. to handle," he said. "It is even less acceptable to imply than an adverse finding against any particular country would weaken the acceptability of the W.T.O. in that country."
Sir Leon was referring to arguments made by American officials that a ruling against the United States would only fuel Congressional opposition to the trade organization.
During the Presidential campaign, Patrick J. Buchanan vowed to oppose any effort to allow American laws to be reviewed by "faceless bureaucrats," and the Republican nominee, Bob Dole, periodically used similar language.
Nonetheless, European officials were insisting as recently as a few weeks ago that if the trade agency ruled against the United States, Congress would be obligated to rewrite the law, or American companies could face countersanctions.
Last week, frustrated by American unwillingness to agree on a panel of judges, Europe asked the director general of the trade organization, Renato Ruggiero, to appoint one. He was obligated to act by Thursday.
But the seven-day delay may not be sufficient to work out a compromise that would avoid a ruling on the issue. This evening a senior American official said "it's too early to tell, but there is more than a slim chance" to settle out of court. The European Union's Ambassador to Washington, Hugo Paemen, said, "On both sides there is a desire to come to some kind of arrangement."
"Will it be enough time?" he said. "That's not sure."
The Helms-Burton law has been a source of conflict between the United States and its traditional allies for nearly a year. They have objected to one provision that allows Americans to sue in United States courts any foreign firm that profits from the use of American property expropriated by Mr. Castro four decades ago. Canada and Europe have since passed laws that would retaliate against American companies that won judgments in American courts.
Another provision bars from the United States senior executives of companies that do extensive business in Cuba. The State Department has already informed executives of Sherritt International of Canada that they and their families are barred. The company responded by holding a board meeting in Havana.
At the core of the European, Canadian and Mexican complaints is the argument that the United States has no right to use its economic power to force other countries to come into line with American foreign policy. The Europeans say about Cuba what Washington says about China, that the best way to change the Government is to flood the country with investment and drown the Government in the forces of a global economy.
Although many Administration advisers made no secret of their distaste for the law, Mr. Clinton apparently felt that he had no choice after Cuba shot down two small aircraft flown by an anti-Castro group near the Cuban coast last year.
Experts disagree on whether Europe would win its case if it went before the three-judge panel in Geneva. But there is a considerable likelihood that at least part of the law would be struck down -- the part that reaches beyond American borders to punish foreign companies.
The European officials say, though, that it is the United States that has caused the problem.
"My American friends," Sir Leon said, "seem to have a hard time understanding that if they had not enacted this law, we wouldn't be discussing it."

HEADLINE: French Are Right to Question Changing World

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"For France, Sagging Self-Image and Esprit" (front page, Feb. 11) suggests that France has committed the unpardonable error of ignoring marketing lessons learned at Stanford University by a new generation of French. And France compounds the error by a less than enthusiastic embrace of the Internet. 
 Moreover, Paris is "flat" compared with the sizzling German and English capitals. Even France's position as the fourth-largest industrial economy in the world is characterized as the tired claim of an outmoded bureaucracy.
Such attitudes undercut the concerns your article raises. The political and social conflict arising from immigration challenges France's view of itself as a humanistic society, but immigration is a flash point in nearly every industrialized society, including our own.
Unemployment is a Continental European problem: the German unemployment rate is nearly that of France. There are many who argue that the United States' 10 million new jobs were created at the expense of the decent wages, job security and benefits that France has tried to institutionalize. And it is simplistic to suggest that France must choose between either Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front or European integration and obeisance to global market forces.
France's ills cannot be attributed to its resistance to unregulated free-market globalization. Indeed, many of us are relieved that in spite of the problems besetting their country, the French are at least questioning whether the role of government is to protect the global robber-baron capitalism practiced by some industrialized nations or to protect the welfare of its citizens.

To the Editor:
You argue (front page, Feb. 11) that much of the despair and unemployment in France's ghetto-suburbs, as well as the country's perceived loss of its commanding position in the world, can be traced to a prevalent anti-business attitude and fear of the cyber culture. 
 How then do we explain the horrifying conditions in America's inner cities, our crumbling infrastructure and our anemic public transportation, which stand in sharp contrast with the "manicured capital, impeccable roads" and high-speed trains of the French?
Could it be that the World Wide Web and venture capitalism are not the panacea for all of the world's problems?

What U.S. Debate?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Jean-Paul Fitoussi's reading of the American electorate in "The Anglo-Saxon Way of Life? Mais Non!" (Op-Ed, Feb. 8) is good evidence of the transatlantic "misunderstandings" he decries. 
 Mr. Fitoussi believes that the "dramatic increase in the income gap in the United States in the past 20 years has been justified by a philosophical debate over the very nature of the American social contract." What is the "substantial body of literature" he suggests would defend this concept?
Has Mr. Fitoussi acquainted himself with Kevin Phillips's "Politics of Rich and Poor" or the work of other American observers who have argued against this trend?
Although the American public has "democratically" chosen not to emulate European social programs, one wonders whether this choice has been made by an informed public. The failure of both the Clinton Administration and the Republican Party to include the option of a publicly financed health care system in the 1993 discussion on health care reform exemplifies this lack of true political debate.

HEADLINE: In Era of Belt-Tightening, Modest Gains for Workers

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C.

 BODY:
American workersdownsized, re-engineered and shoved into salary ruts -- are slowly beginning to climb back up.
Last year, they won wage gains that were the largest since 1990, keeping them ahead of inflation for only the second time in a decade. Modest though these raises were, many economists expect them to continue. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said recently that the era might be drawing to a close when workers were so worried about losing their jobs that they were afraid to demand raises. 
 For many people in Raleigh and other rapidly growing areas, it already has. As a sushi bar waiter at the Kanki Japanese House of Steaks here for three years, James E. Woodward Jr. became more like an affable host, building a steady clientele. His requests for raises from the standard dinner rate of $2.13 an hour plus tips, though, were repeatedly denied.
About a month ago, he gave his boss one last chance. "Waiters don't get raises," he was told again. Yes, they do, Mr. Woodward decided. In a strong economy like Raleigh's, he won about a 15 percent increase, with potential for more, by agreeing to join a departing sushi chef who was opening a rival establishment.
In his confidence, Mr. Woodward is hardly alone. In January of last year, 26 percent of those surveyed by the Conference Board said that jobs were tough to get, with 21 percent saying they were plentiful. The rest were in between. By December, the balance of opinions had reversed, with 29 percent seeing plenty of jobs and only 21 percent seeing scarcity.
Not that salaries are off to the races. Nationwide, hourly wages, in current dollars, are rising at an annual rate of 3.8 percent -- about five-tenths of 1 percent above the inflation rate -- to an average of $11.98.
That's nothing like the big gains of the 1960's and 1970's. Still, it is a lot better than the 2.1 percent increase for 1992, when the nation was just coming out of recession, and up solidly from the 3.2 percent gain in 1995.
Even in the tight labor markets of the South and West like Raleigh -- with unemployment of less than 2.5 percent, compared with 5.4 percent nationally -- there are no indications yet that the raises are proving inflationary.
A lot of companies, under pressure from competitors, are finding it difficult to pass cost increases on to their customers for fear of losing market share. Many have improved their efficiency so much that productivity gains are outpacing the still modest rise in pay levels.
Moreover, to keep costs under control, companies here and elsewhere have developed a variety of strategies to help restrain wages. They send recruiters onto college campuses, military bases, even into beauty parlors and barber shops. They tap immigrant labor. They stress job security. They use more temporary workers, whose pay is lower even though their wages are rising quickly. They even hand out bonuses to employees who recruit friends.
But even a gentle breeze of rising real wages, after inflation, could heat up the nation's economic climate. Involuntary worker sacrifice and unusually low inflation have been pillars of this economic expansion, now the third longest since World War II. Stagnant wages have helped corporations multiply their earnings and share prices. In the 1990's, a worker asking for a raise often seemed as hapless as Oliver Twist asking for more gruel.
Some of these trends may begin to unwind. "The predominant risk is, we're going to see higher wage growth, higher inflation and higher interest rates," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
Whether these wage demands accelerate will depend heavily on the length and strength of any further expansion. Employers are likely to face some increased expenses simply because they can no longer count on shrinking benefit costs.
Overhauls of workers' compensation and unemployment insurance, plus a sharp drop in health care inflation, kept the growth in benefits costs to 2 percent last year, the lowest on record. But the overhaul is virtually complete and medical costs are expected to creep up again.
The best pay increases are concentrated in certain regions, mostly in the South and West, and industries like high technology and construction. Managers and executives are still the prime beneficiaries.
But wage gains are also popping up all over the place. Telemarketers and customer service providers are bidding up wages for practically anyone with a voice in cities like Omaha and Tulsa, Okla. Accountants are widely in demand. Despite reports of a national lawyer glut, Atlanta law firms are finding that they have to offer more than $60,000 to new associates, up from about $55,000 a few months ago. A Raleigh supermarket chain raised its starting wage to $8.50 from $7.50. Indeed, employers seem most willing to raise their rates for new workers, making job-jumping that much more profitable.
Trucking companies, with fewer laid-off factory workers to recruit, are also offering higher pay to lessen turnover. At J. B. Hunt Transport Inc., a big national trucker based in Lowell, Ark., the costs of training and insuring inexperienced replacements were soaring. "We were not compensating our drivers enough to make it worthwhile," said Stephen L. Palmer, the company's senior executive for personnel. As of Feb. 25, starting pay for those with one year's experience will rise 48 percent, to 37 cents a mile. Drivers with at least 10 years' experience will earn even more, 41 cents a mile. J. B. Hunt expects to recover the $54 million annual cost by having safer, more experienced drivers, reducing turnover by more than half.
With labor markets so tight, the raises these days often go to those -- construction workers, restaurant and retailing help, temporary labor -- who are most willing to auction their services and switch to the highest bidder.
No longer are migrating workers always there to grab the available jobs. Labor markets in California and the Northeast have strengthened enough to diminish the flow of economic refugees to places like Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and the Rocky Mountain states -- leaving the pools of available workers in the nation's boom towns that much shallower.
Mr. Zandi, who advises companies on locations, said that as the unemployment rate had fallen in Los Angeles and New York, "those two markets are not going to provide safety valves for the rest of the country any longer."
The signs of labor shortages are obvious here in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, roughly bounded by Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill. Manufacturing wages rebounded earlier than elsewhere and are now rising at about a 4.7 percent annual rate, providing perhaps a glimpse of what is in store elsewhere.
At the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, a reception room is lined with framed magazine covers extolling the area as the best place to do business. Unions are seldom seen. Lately, however, the advantages have been tilting in favor of the workers.
At the Austin Quality Foods plant in the suburbs here, managers first blamed their agency, Monarch Temporary Services, for failing to recruit enough help at $6 an hour. "We went to barber shops, beauty parlors and churches," said Dolores Smith, a Monarch vice president. She left leaflets under windshield wipers. She checked with homeless shelters. With sales of its cheese-and-peanut-butter-cracker sandwiches growing, Austin tried another agency. The answer was the same.
Last month, Austin reluctantly raised the starting wage to $7. The higher pay and the promise of a permanent job if things work out have brought in new employees like Lara A. Nicklow. She had worked at a Hardee's for $5.30 an hour while waiting for an increase to $6.
For construction workers, the bidding is so fervent that the muddy site for a new 273-room Embassy Suites hotel near Raleigh seemed as fraught with financial calculations as a commodity pit. At their offices inside a trailer, superintendents said they were at the mercy of anyone who walked in. "A lot of people come in here and say they're carpenters," said John T. Long, the project superintendent, with a look that could saw wood. He mentioned a name. "Slow as molasses. Very limited in what he can do. I should get rid of the guy but right now I'd be a fool to."
Outside, over the rumble of drills and front-end loaders, Donald Benton, an electrician, reported that other offers were his most useful tool. He joined the project last May to win a modest raise -- electricians average about $17 an hour -- and escape a new manager he did not like. About two months ago, he and two friends announced they were ready to quit for a site that paid better still. "They made it worth it for us to stay," he chuckled. "I'll put it like that."
Count workers in the computer industry as among the most empowered. Demand for them, already strong, is accelerating. Cisco Systems, a leading maker of computer networking equipment, decided in 1992 to open an East Coast base in Research Triangle Park, in part to escape the high costs in Silicon Valley. Now Cisco finds itself competing for talent with scores of other companies that came to Silicon Hollow for similar reasons.
Clifford B. Meltzer, Cisco's general manager here, has a simple strategy to keep workers. "You pay them enough to get them to feel guilty," he said. Bill Fredenburg, a hardware engineer who joined Cisco last April, shrugged at how easy it was to win a big pay increase. He was just about to accept another job that would have increased his pay by 10 percent. Then a Cisco recruiter asked him, "What would it take?" He cited a figure more than 10 percent above his other offer. The recruiter laughed at his modesty. A few days later, he asked for thousands more, which the company topped. And that does not count the bonuses and stock options.
At North Carolina State University here, Walter B. Jones, the director of the career center, says the going rate for computer-friendly graduates is $42,000 and up, roughly 10 percent above last year. It's not just high-fliers like Cisco that are vigorously bidding, but also companies like I.B.M., which brought at least five recruiters to campus last fall. "Organizations went through a long time of downsizing and downsizing," Mr. Jones said. "Now they are looking up and saying, 'Hey, we have to get more people in the pipeline.' "
Even in unionized industries where retrenchment remains a threat, companies and union leaders sometimes misjudge workers' determination. At the Kelly-Springfield plant in Fayetteville, N.C., the largest tire factory in the nation, union members overwhelmingly rejected a proposed contract from Goodyear last month for the second time. Among the contract's irritants: the right to hire new workers at 62 percent of normal wages. "Goodyear is doing really great -- making money hand over fist," said Gary Schrump, cradling a beer at Pappy's Country Club and Sports Bar after his shift. "They don't want to give it up."
Some companies, desperate to fill their slots, find themselves signing paychecks for workers who would not have met their standards before.
John L. Moore, the director of operations at the two Kanki Japanese steak restaurants in Raleigh, said that he once insisted that teppanyaki tableside chefs -- the guys with the flashing knives -- be Japanese. Two or three years ago, he began turning to Filipinos and Vietnamese. "If they're Asian-looking, they'll pass," he said. He paid labor lawyers to help them obtain permanent residency. But now, he has exhausted his supply of Asians. So who is he hiring? "Puerto Ricans," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 21, 1997, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page chart on Feb. 13 showing recent modest gains in average hourly wages, adjusted for inflation, carried two incorrect labels, and a chart on Sunday with the Diary column of the Money and Business reflected the errors. The figures were for nonsupervisory workers, not all workers, in private industry; they were given in fourth-quarter 1996 dollars, not December 1996 dollars.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed Amid Rumors Of Central Bank Intervention

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday and the German mark strengthened as rumors circulated that central banks might intervene to stop the American currency's ascent.
But traders said the underlying appetite for dollars remained strong because of the strength of the United States economy and the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average passed 7,000 points yesterday for the first time. 
 "When you take half a step back from the market, you realize nothing has changed," said Kevin Raphael, manager of foreign exchange at Rabobank Nederland in New York. "The environment in the United States is better than it is in most of the industrialized world. We've got real nice rates of return here, low inflation, good employment; that's really not too bad."
In New York the dollar cost 1.6828 marks, down from 1.6846 Wednesday. The dollar fetched 124.35 yen, up from 124.17. The British pound slipped to $1.6239 from $1.6321.
The mark strengthened against the dollar in early trading after Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, vice president of Germany's central bank, said that the bank did not favor a stronger dollar and was concerned about the currency's rapid rise.
The mark also derived strength from broad weakness in the Swiss franc and British pound.
Nervousness over a possible sale of dollars by central banks also permeated currency trading. That nervousness has grown since the Group of Seven industrial nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- issued a statement last Saturday that the dollar's reversal from postwar lows was now complete.
Although there was no evidence of dollar selling by any of the Group of Seven central banks, many traders reasoned that it was only a matter of time before they would back up their words with actions.
But some said the central banks were likely to wait until the demand for the dollar had waned, and would try to surprise the market by selling dollars as the currency was falling.
"Stepping in front of speeding train doesn't make much sense," said Robert Katz, a currency trader at MTB Bank in New York. "At this point, they're content to jawbone it down."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Sales Up for Small and Medium Condos

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
Spurred in part by the increasing cost of rental apartments, sales of small and mid-sized Manhattan condominiums rose significantly last year, while sales numbers for bigger condos -- with a more limited supply -- remained relatively flat.
The statistics were contained in a series of year-end market reports being issued by brokerage and real estate consulting firms, which assessed the more than 2,500 condo sales for 1996 in slightly different ways. Unlike the sales of co-operative apartments, condo sales are publicly recorded. 
 The increase in the number of lower-priced apartments sold was a large factor in the overall sunny picture most companies reported for the condominiums: Yale-Robbins's reported volume was up 12.5 percent; Douglas Elliman's report, due in the next two weeks, will show 21 percent more sales than last year, according to its authors. The Corcoran Group reported that sales were up 17 percent.
According to Douglas Elliman's statistics for Manhattan condominium sales, the number of studios sold rose 29 percent; the number of one-bedrooms was up 22 percent and the number of two-bedrooms rose 21 percent. In prices, the only major upswing was in studio apartments, which the Douglas Elliman report found jumped almost 15 percent from 1995 to 1996, from $235 a square foot to $270 a square foot. Prices for one- and two-bedrooms increased only about 2 percent, while prices for three-bedrooms and up were virtually unchanged from 1995.
The reasons that smaller condominium apartments have finally begun to move include such factors as a growing economy, reasonable mortgage rates and a feeling of confidence among Manhattanites that "the job market is growing again" said Samuel E. Solie, executive vice-president of Miller Samuel Inc., the real estate appraisal and consulting firm that is compiling the Douglas Elliman report.
Other reasons, according to real-estate agents, include these apartments' poor performance during the real estate recession -- they had, in the words of one, "nowhere else to go but up" -- and the skyrocketing cost of renting an apartment, which made buying more appealing.
Meanwhile, the number of three- and four-bedroom condominiums sold remained about the same from last year -- or decreased a couple of percentage points -- which agents universally attribute to the dearth of such apartments. (The dearth, real or perceived, may not last. A number of developers, especially Donald Trump, have announced plans to build more, or to create more in rehabilitated spaces -- including old hotels and warehouses.)
Although the volume of large apartments sold did not change, the prices did -- at least in the most desirable buildings in the most desirable locations. According to a report issued by the Halstead Property Company, "selected prime neighborhoods, each with a handful of super-luxury condominiums, fared well." In the stretch Fifth to Park Avenue, 42d to 59th Street, prices rose from $530 to $684 a square foot, according to Halstead, which said prices in the same corridor from 79th to 96th rose from $476 to $591.
Yet for the stretch between 59th and 79th -- the city's "Gold Coast" -- prices fell precipitously, from $508 to $386, according to Halstead, which attributed the fall to a lack of excellent high-priced apartments on the market last year.
"For the most part, your condominium buyer is totally different than your co-op buyer," said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate. "Your condominium buyer wants new, new, new, glitz, glitz, glitz."
And the newest and glitziest is Trump International Hotel and Tower at One Central Park West at Columbus Circle.
"When Trump started getting over $1,000 a square foot in that building -- and I had to double-check the numbers, they seemed so high," said Ms. Corcoran, "that really set off prices in the upper-upper-end condo market."
But the selling price of condominiums, perhaps even more than co-ops, varies tremendously from building to building, making average price comparisons between this year and last year lose some meaning.
While Mr. Solie said that prices for all condominium sales rose only 2 percent on average, he cautioned that the figure should be interpreted cautiously. Others agreed.
"My perception is that the condo market is very uneven, that certain areas are very strong and certain areas are not very strong at all," said Mr. Peters, whose firm does not produce a report.
"New construction has done very well," said Mr. Peters "The Trump Building has done incredibly well; the Siena, the new building on 76th Street has done incredibly well." But some of the older, most expensive condominiums -- Mr. Peters named Trump Tower, Metropolitan Tower and Museum Tower -- "are not moving as quickly," he said. "The market is about the same as last year."

HEADLINE: Defense Spending Boon

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Michael Dorsey (letter, Feb. 7) says that we lavish too much money on the military. He postulates that it would be better to increase spending on foreign aid. This is a common but dangerous misconception.
Maintaining an overseas presence provides the United States the opportunity to wield political and economic influence around the world. In addition to preventing armed conflicts in many of the world's hot spots, we also insure prosperity for our own economy. 
 However, these political and economic benefits come at a price, under the auspices of military spending. The military budget must be looked at in its comprehensive whole, not simply in terms of tanks, guns and bullets.

HEADLINE: Farm Workers Hit by a Freeze and Hard Times

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla., Feb. 10

 BODY:
Dressed in jeans and muddied sneakers, and packing a lunch bag in case they found jobs today, Tereso Reyes and Evangelina Alvarez got into the car of another couple in the fog of the early morning to drop in on the farms of South Florida's agricultural fields. Car pooling saved on gas and rejection -- at each stop the two men jointly asked for work for themselves and their wives. Each time the answer was no.
Normally this time of year, the two couples would have been busy picking squash, tomatoes and pole beans. But since a freeze last month destroyed winter vegetable crops in this area, only a lucky few migrant and seasonal workers are working full-time or at all, picking or working in nurseries and packing houses. 
 The Governor's Council on Farmworker Affairs estimates that 100,000 farm workers have been affected by the freeze statewide. Most of them saw their last paycheck nearly a month ago and have begun to hurt for cash to pay rent and electric bills.
Local churches here, in the heart of Dade County's farm country, say they are getting desperate calls for basic needs, like shoes for a boy who was missing school because he lacked them. Others are pleading for intervention with landlords to avoid evictions.
"People are getting by with half what they usually make, which is next to nothing," said Jorge Lara, a counselor at Centro Campesino Farmworker Center in Florida City.
Hard times like these expose the vulnerability of migrant workers like Mr. Reyes, 47, and Ms. Alvarez, 33, Mexicans who have picked crops in Florida and Texas for the last 20 years and who have five children. From November to May, Florida is home for workers who travel on three paths the rest of the year, up the East Coast to Maine, north to Michigan or west to Texas. But with no significant work available yet elsewhere and no money made here to even finance a search elsewhere, the couple say they are stuck.
"We were told there were oranges in the north of Florida, but we need money for gas and to take all the children with us," Ms. Alvarez said.
The freeze last Jan. 18 and 19, with temperatures as low as 19 degrees, caused more than $270 million in losses in 20 Florida counties. Gov. Lawton Chiles has asked the Federal Department of Agriculture to designate the counties disaster areas in order to provide low-interest loans and other aid to farmers. But so far, no Federal aid has been forthcoming.
State officials say that in order to release Federal or state aid for the workers, they first need to gather information on the impact of the freeze on the workers, a task they say is difficult because so many are reluctant to come forward.
But while many farmers can recover losses through insurance or because of price increases at the supermarket -- prices have risen to up to 100 percent for some vegetables -- farm workers, particularly the more than a quarter estimated to be illegal immigrants, have been left largely to fend for themselves or rely on churches and local charities for sustenance.
About 20 migrant service organizations here are pooling resources to open a center next week to offer whatever aid they can muster. But much of what they have gathered so far consists of food, clothes and other goods, not the estimated $325,000 in cash assistance the organizations say they need to cover rent and utilities for affected families, most of whom are Mexicans but also Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Haitians.
"Farm workers live from paycheck to paycheck," said Sister Iliana Valdes, director of social ministry at Sacred Heart Church. "Let's face it. They're paid 50 cents for a bucket of tomatoes."
The couple teaming up with Mr. Reyes and Ms. Alvarez on job-hunting trips, a 29-year-old man and 24- year-old woman who are here illegally, are living on the $220 a month in food stamps they receive because their two young sons are American-born citizens. The couple, who said they have migrated between Mexico and Florida for the last four years, received food stamps even before the freeze -- the average farm worker makes $7,000 to $8,000 a year, state officials say. But now, the couple said they have been forced to borrow from a few relatives and friends to pay the $63 weekly rent for their trailer and are close to losing power and water because of unpaid bills. Prodded to comment on their predicament, the man pulled out a pay stub. Of $280.25 he made the first week of January, $17.38 was withheld for Social Security, $4.06 for Medicare and $8 as "Federal withholding."
"Even though one is illegal one pays taxes," he said. "But when we are in need it is as if we don't exist." As legal residents, Ms. Alvarez and Mr. Reyes are better off. In addition to food stamps, they receive unemployment benefits. But the new welfare rules that restrict aid to noncitizens have reduced their food stamps by $150 a month. In all, they and their children, ages 3 to 15, are surviving on $650 a month, down from a monthly income of about $1,600 when both parents have work. This month they had to borrow $300 from their crew leader to pay the $281 rent in their subsidized house. Meat and corn flakes are beyond their budget. "We vary," he says, "Tortillas with eggs one day, eggs with tortillas the next."
At times like these Ms. Alvarez renews her resolve to become an American citizen, a feat that she and her husband have yet to accomplish because it requires two things they are short of: money and English. Ms. Alvarez says she also yearns to go to school to become a beautician, but the family could not survive on Mr. Reyes' salary alone.
Ms. Alvarez blamed the workers' current situation partly on their failure to organize.
"You see the Cubans, if something happens, all getting together," she said. "We should do the same and go to the employment center to ask for help." In the meantime, the two couples scavenge for work in the morning and for food, and other donated goods in the afternoon. At one stop, while the men talked to a crew leader, Ms. Alvarez picked yellow squash to take home for dinner.
With no work in sight until new plants are ready for harvesting in about a month, Mr. Reyes and Ms. Alvarez are letting their 15-year-old daughter, Vanessa, look for part-time work in grocery stores that so far have not hired her because she is not yet 16. The 10th grade student at Homestead Senior High, who has helped her parents out in the fields on weekends, said she eventually would like to join the Air Force or the Marines and become an engineer.
"Picking is very hard," she said of her parents' occupation. "You work your back all day long and you get tired."

HEADLINE: Pataki Amends Budget Proposals For Medicaid Cuts and Tax Relief

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki today modified his proposed budget to soften his Medicaid cuts somewhat and include co-op owners in a program he is pushing to hold down local property taxes across the state.
Mr. Pataki lessened by $100 million the cut he had sought in state Medicaid spending, but it remains the area where he would make by far the deepest cuts in his $66.2 billion budget for the fiscal year that will begin April 1. 
 When matching Federal and local Medicaid contributions and the inflation of medical costs are calculated, the Governor's budget still means almost $2 billion less for doctors, nurses, hospitals and nursing homes.
"We'd hoped for substantially more than $100 million, but it is a small first step toward what we'd like to see," said David Rich, vice president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
New York City legislators had criticized Mr. Pataki's property tax relief program for leaving out most city residents, who either rent or own cooperative apartments. The Governor proposed including co-op owners, though he took no action to spread the benefit to renters, and his office said that New York City residents' share of the total benefits from the tax relief program would climb only from 9 percent to 12 percent. Democrats have said that New York City, which has more than 40 percent of the state's residents, should get a similar share of the tax benefits.
"It's a step toward equity, but there needs to be more," said the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat and Mr. Pataki's chief rival in state government.
The Governor's office also pledged faster implementation of the $1.75 billion environmental bond act approved by voters, saying that spending in the next fiscal year would increase about 60 percent over his original budget proposal, and would roughly double in the first five years, to about $1 billion.
Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat, noted that the amount of bond act money included in the budget had not changed, and accused the Governor's office of deceit. But officials in Mr. Pataki's budget office insisted that the point was moot, because the state could increase bond act spending without changing the text of the budget. Mr. Pataki plans to use the real estate transfer tax, which generates $117 million a year, to repay the bonds.

HEADLINE: January Retail Sales Rose 0.6%, Slightly Less Than Expected

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Retail sales rose modestly in January, following a holiday shopping season that was much weaker than retailers had hoped, Government figures showed today.
A separate report today, however, provided evidence of greater strength in the economy. The number of people visiting unemployment offices for the first time tumbled last week to the lowest point since mid-summer, another of several recent signs that the labor market continues to tighten. 
 "The economy's doing just fine," said William C. Dudley, chief domestic economist with Goldman, Sachs, pointing to swelling payrolls that in turn have raised consumer confidence and kept people spending, albeit at a more subdued recent pace.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose six-tenths of 1 percent in January, slightly less than expected, with all sectors other than apparel and grocery stores posting sizable gains. But the monthly comparison would have been weaker had it not been for a downward revision that held December's gain to three-tenths of 1 percent, half what the department initially estimated a month ago. And when the automotive sector is excluded, December shows no sales increase at all.
Analysts said that today's report put the Government closer to the disappointing seasonal results that merchants themselves had reported.
"It sure looks as if consumers have suddenly 'got religion' and tempered their buying proclivities," Kenneth Mayland, chief economist for Keycorp in Cleveland, said. "This should help keep inflation pressures from boiling over and stretch out this already-long business expansion."
The restrained retail sales number helped offset the strength seen in the weekly jobless claims number, and bond prices surged today, pushing interest rates down to their lowest yield in six weeks. The drop in interest rates bolstered the stock market's recent rally, which pushed the Dow Jones industrial average above 7,000 for the first time.
Bond and stock market investors have been encouraged by an economy that has been growing for nearly six years now without a significant acceleration of prices.
Still, policy makers and private economists watch the labor market closely for signs of wage pressure and the marked downtrend in first-time jobless claims since early in the year has caused some uneasiness.
The surprising drop of 15,000, to 309,000, in the number of claims for the week that ended last Saturday "could signal troubling further tightening in labor market conditions," Joseph Liro and Anita Ash of CIBC Wood Gundy Securities in New York advised clients. They said the Federal Reserve would be forced to raise short-term interest rates by one-quarter point without saying when.
On a four-week average, which makes the Labor Department's claims data less erratic, the decline has been to 327,750 now from 358,250 on Jan. 4.
The retail sales report showed that consumers spent $209.1 billion last month, six-tenths of 1 percent more than in December and 4.9 percent, with no adjustment for inflation, above the January 1996 level. Sales of durable goods, those designed to last at least three years, rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, while nondurables rose five-tenths of 1 percent.
Department stores and others selling general merchandise had a 1.3 percent sales increase followed by gasoline service stations, up nine-tenths of 1 percent, and drugstores, up seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Stores selling apparel and accessories, however, saw receipts fall nine-tenths of 1 percent, apparently reflecting heavy discounting, while sales at food stores were unchanged for the month, the department found.

HEADLINE: Sears to Open 110 Stores in New York by End of 1999

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Sears Roebuck & Company will open 110 stores across New York State by the end of 1999, with the largest share of the expansion -- 2 large department stores and 33 smaller specialty stores -- in New York City, the senior economic adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday.
Sears, which said a month ago that it hoped to open a large department store as part of the redevelopment of the New York Coliseum, will open the first of the new stores in Brooklyn's Kings Plaza shopping mall, where it is to begin renovating the former Alexander's department store for its own use this month. 
 Sears' expansion was described as an important milestone at a time when major national retail chains have been making fresh investments in urban neighborhoods, ranging from Manhattan's East Village to downtown Buffalo. Its plan has particularly rich symbolic value for Manhattan, where Sears has never before operated a store.
"It sends a very strong signal when a company like this -- I think it is synonymous with America -- wants to make a big commitment to New York," said Charles A. Gargano, the economic adviser to Mr. Pataki and chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. "It means we are in a period of renewal."
He said Sears would receive no special tax breaks or other financial incentives from the city or state.
The expansion plan is to be described today by Arthur C. Martinez, the chairman of Sears, at a Manhattan news conference to be attended by Mr. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Sears has reported strong earnings growth in the last year and sharp increases in clothing sales.
According to state officials, the new Sears stores will employ 5,000 people and generate $300 million in sales tax and property revenues to the city and state. Part of a broad expansion of its store network across the nation, the New York plan will be weighted most heavily toward increasing the number of Sears specialty stores, which are far smaller than its department stores and limit their merchandise to more narrow categories like hardware, automotive goods or housewares.
With 33 of the specialty stores to be opened in New York City, Sears is expected to locate a majority of them in neighborhoods that it considers as underserved retail markets, mainly poor and middle-class sections above 96th Street in Manhattan and in the other four boroughs.
Although Sears executives declined to comment yesterday, Mr. Martinez, a native of the Park Slope section of Brooklyn -- where he was a childhood acquaintance of Mr. Gargano -- said in a recent interview that he had long hoped to open a large department store at a prominent location in Manhattan.
That interest has culminated in the company's effort to become part of the huge coliseum redevelopment project on Columbus Circle, where it has teamed up with Bruce Ratner, a major developer on Times Square and downtown Brooklyn, in submitting 1 of 9 development proposals.
If Mr. Ratner's proposal is selected by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the owner of the coliseum, his project would provide Sears with the site of its Manhattan store. State officials said yesterday that Sears was exploring other Manhattan alternatives, but declined to say where. Mr. Ratner, a developer who has invested heavily in retail projects in inner city neighborhoods, is renovating the Kings Plaza department store for Sears.
The expansion would greatly increase Sears' presence across New York State, where it now operates 130 stores, 17 in the New York City metropolitan area, which includes Westchester and Long Island.
State officials said Sears would open two of its department stores on Long Island, in Yaphank and Bay Shore, but had not yet disclosed the location of its other new stores.

HEADLINE: Accounting at Pearson U.S. Unit May Force $163 Million Charge

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Pearson P.L.C., the British media company, said today that it may take a $163 million charge against last year's earnings after discovering "improper accounting" practices at its Penguin USA book publishing unit.
The news, which would cut Pearson's 1996 profits by about 40 percent, sent the company's shares sliding here as much as 8 percent before recovering to 749.5 pence, or $12.37, a share, a drop of 2 percent. 
 Pearson attributed the problems to unauthorized discounts, beginning in 1991 under a previous management, that were given to some retailers in return for early payments. The company said that the situation was being investigated by auditors from the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse.
"Those found to be responsible have been and will be appropriately dealt with," Pearson said in a statement. But Pearson would not identify any individuals.
The problems at Penguin became known after the company purchased the publisher Putnam Berkley for $336 million late last year.
As executives reviewed overlapping functions in the two companies that are to be merged as Penguin Putnam Inc., they found that things had gone awry in the Penguin USA credit department, based in Bergenfield, N.J., for several years. The publisher is based in New York.
Analysts agreed that the blame did not lie with current management. "It really reflects the loose nature of the old management," said Louise Barton, an analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite in London.
The Penguin publishing unit, the second-largest English language publisher in the world, had sales in the United States last year of more than $480 million.
The discovery of irregular accounting practices was made by Michael Lynton, Penguin's new chairman and chief executive who took his post last year, succeeding Peter Mayer, who left in June.
Some analysts said a continuing review by the new management might unearth further irregularities. "You have to hope it is not repeated elsewhere," said Caroline Slater, an analyst with the Kleinwort Benson investment firm in London.
The earnings announcement came weeks after Marjorie Scardino, a 49-year-old American, took over as chief executive. The decision to name Mrs. Scardino was seen as a generational shift aimed at shaking up a stodgy, but potentially rich, company that has been regarded as slow-moving and weighted down with many nonmedia businesses.
Mrs. Scardino had been chief executive of the influential Economist magazine, which is half-owned by Pearson, where she was credited with raising the magazine's profitability, particularly in the United States.
Mrs. Scardino, who assumed control Jan. 1, is the first woman to head a top British company. At the time of her appointment, announced on Oct. 17, shares of the company dipped by nearly 2.5 percent. But she responded by welcoming the challenge and hinting that she found the British business establishment lacking in "urgency" and wary of taking risk.
Pearson, which also owns The Financial Times and Madame Tussaud's wax museum in London, was in too many businesses that had little to do with its media and entertainment focus, analysts said.
At the time, Mrs. Scardino stated the company was well positioned "to take advantage of the opportunities in the rapidly changing digital international market."
The company said the charge will be taken against last year's pretax profits, which are expected to be in the range of $400 million.

HEADLINE: Stocks Race Past New Milestone As Dow Breaks 7,000 Barrier

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market, seemingly oblivious to worries among some Washington policy makers and Wall Street analysts that share prices are too costly, continued its blistering upward march yesterday as the Dow Jones industrial average surged past 7,000 points for the first time.
Buoyed by an economic outlook of rising corporate profits and low inflation, the stock market has long since recovered from a brief fall in December that was touched off by comments from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who asked whether prices on Wall Street were reflecting a mood of "irrational exuberance." 
 Only adding to what has already been the most impressive bull market run in history, the Dow climbed 60.81 points yesterday to close at 7,022.44. It was the fastest 1,000-point sprint ever on Wall Street, coming just 82 trading days after the Dow had reached the 6,000-point level.
"This market has unfailingly been able to defy mass consensus and historical precepts," said Eugene Peroni, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. "It is simply an unprecedented market that's making historical inroads."
Just since the beginning of the year, the Dow -- the stock market's most widely followed gauge -- has already gained more than 574 points, or 8.9 percent.
Many analysts, even those who expected the market to rise this year, expressed surprise at the recent surge. Meanwhile, those who believe that Wall Street is headed for a fall remained convinced that it was only a matter of time before stock prices turned down sharply. [Page D6.]
Traditionally, the Dow industrials have fallen significantly, or risen only marginally, after two years in which gains exceed 20 percent. But so far, the blue-chip indicator -- which is coming off gains of 33 percent in 1995 and 26 percent in 1996 -- has shown few signs of slowing down.
Indeed, reaching the 7,000-point milestone is only the latest indication that Wall Street's fortunes are still glistening, producing huge profits and bonuses for brokers, traders, and investment bankers in New York and elsewhere, and inspiring millions of middle-class Americans to trust their savings to the market.
Yesterday, even President Clinton felt called upon to comment on the huge runup in stock prices. While expressing astonishment at the climb, he said that it was yet another sign that the economy remained healthy. Pressed about whether high stock prices were cause for concern, he said, "Let's follow our strategy and let the market take care of itself, as long as there is no destructive element in it."
The unexpectedly easy rise through 7,000, if it holds, is a vindication for a group of market strategists who have advised clients to stick with stocks even though traditional performance measures have been warning for some time that equities have gotten too expensive.
These analysts have argued that market conditions are different now and, thus, that measures showing stocks to be overvalued should be viewed skeptically. The two biggest historic changes are the relentless flow of billion of dollars into mutual funds that invest in stocks and the comfort of low inflation.
The Dow has nearly tripled since the current bull market began its flight in October 1990. For the Dow, this continues to be its longest run without a 10 percent correction. In many ways, though, the market, while hit by sharp blows like the sudden plunges in October 1987 and October 1989, has been on an upward march almost without interruption for more than 14 years.
The new Dow millenium was first reached at 12:45 P.M. yesterday, with the index rising as high as 7,040.52 in the late afternoon before falling back somewhat at the end of the day. Bond prices surged as well; the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond tumbled to 6.62 percent, from 6.71 percent on Wednesday.
With yesterday's close, the Dow showed strong signs of a recovery after a late January slump. It has gained about 2.4 percent in the past two sessions, largely on the performance of some of the year's strongest sectors, like technology, financial services and pharmaceutical stocks.
It was probably fitting that on the day that the Dow topped 7,000, shares of Merrill Lynch -- one of the nation's premier brokerage companies -- soared 8 1/2, to 96 1/2. BankAmerica, Citicorp and J. P. Morgan also had banner days. BankAmerica rose 5 1/8 a share, to 123. Citicorp climbed 4, to 123 1/2, and J. P. Morgan gained 2 3/4, to 106 3/4. The Dow rise was led by Merck, up 3 3/4 a share, to 99 5/8, and Caterpillar, up 3 5/8, to 83 1/8.
Most analysts agreed that the market has enjoyed almost a perfect combination of a healthy economy, heavy cash inflows into mutual funds, a stable bond market, a strong dollar, better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, and almost no signs of inflation. There have even been encouraging words lately from Mr. Greenspan, who helped lift stock prices last month with optimistic words about how Americans were benefiting from the stock market's "breathtaking" climb.
While the Dow has led the stock market climb, most broader market indexes have been equally bullish. Yesterday, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 9.05 points to set a closing high of 811.82. The Nasdaq composite index rose 11.85 points, to 1,370.81.
Small stocks, however, continue to lag. Yesterday, the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks gained 2.78 points, to 368.18. But for the year, the index is up just 1.54 percent, while the S.& P. 500 is up 9.6 percent.
"For this to be an all-inclusive bull market, you have to have some momentum in the secondary and tertiary names -- the Russell 2000 and the midcaps," said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Company.
While small stocks have lagged, the recent blue-chip surge astounded even Wall Street insiders. In a Business Week survey of 45 market analysts published in December, only 15 experts predicted that the Dow would reach 7,000 points by the end of 1997, with the most optimistic assessment being 7,500.
The consensus estimate for mid-year was 6,384, and for the end of 1997 was 6,587, a mark that was eclipsed on Jan. 7. And of the analysts who said the Dow would rise this year, the year-end consensus was 6,976.66 -- 45 points less than where the Dow ended yesterday.
"Most people were not expecting a rerun of '96, and that's what it looks like we got," said David Shulman, the chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. His bearish forecast had the Dow at 6,200 points at midyear and 5,750 by year's end. While sticking to his forecast for now, he acknowledged that when "the market gets into these kinds of phases, you can't predict how high it can go."
Mr. Shulman, and other analysts, suggested that one unpredictable event could easily rattle a market that has already shown a good deal of volatility this year.
"Remember, in '96 you had unusual activity in the first few months," Mr. Battipaglia said. "Then we had a break in July. This is a recognition that it can happen again. The leadership is narrow, and there is a feeling among some that the market is overvalued."
But those analysts who predicted that the Dow would top 7,000 this year remained optimistic that the stock market -- while its climb might slow and even fluctuate around these levels for a while -- would rise further.
"Am I still bullish? Absolutely," said Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at Goldman, Sachs, who had predicted that the Dow would reach 7,050 points by the end of the year. "The stock market will continue to rise because the fundamentals will continue to improve."

HEADLINE: THE ARKANSAS NETWORK: A special report.;
Clinton and Friends: Strong Ties, Few Questions

BYLINE: The following article was reported and written by Jeff Gerth, Stephen Labaton and Tim Weiner. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
From the Whitewater investigation to the White House guest list, from financing his campaigns for governor to raising money for the 1996 elections, a thread runs through Bill Clinton's career: the Arkansas friends he relies on for political and financial support.
In Washington, as they did in Little Rock, some of these golfing partners, businessmen and political supporters worked hard to open the right doors for clients or raise money for Mr. Clinton's campaigns. Some tried to capitalize on their relationship with Mr. Clinton, who has said as Governor and then as President that he asked few questions about what his old friends were doing. 
 Mr. Clinton's first term as President was plagued by questions about the personal and political relationships he forged in Arkansas. His second term begins with questions about the role played by Arkansas friends in the 1996 election, some of whom helped raise millions of dollars for the Democratic campaign, from their own pockets or from clients they wanted to introduce to their friend, the President.
Their activities range from faintly comical to legally questionable.
Mark W. Grobmyer, a Little Rock lawyer and one of Mr. Clinton's former golfing partners, styled himself as an unofficial "White House liaison," printing up calling cards with that self-appointed title on them and sending policy-advice memorandums to the President.
Another Little Rock lawyer, Richard Mays, arranged through the Democratic National Committee for a client, a twice-convicted felon with ties to organized crime, to meet the President at the White House.
A Little Rock lobbyist, Paul Berry, joined a Washington lobbying firm whose Asian clients received a picture of Mr. Berry golfing with the President, and a promise that Mr. Berry's "long association with President Clinton" would provide access and insight to the White House.
Other longtime associates of Mr. Clinton from Little Rock, with ties to Asian businessmen and governments, are under investigation by the Justice Department and Congress for their money-raising activities in the 1996 Presidential campaign.
Most modern Presidents have come to Washington with an entourage of friends from back home who have raised money, done favors and sometimes sought to benefit from their proximity to power. President Lyndon B. Johnson had his oilmen and contractors from Texas; President Ronald Reagan had his executives from California.
And although Mr. Clinton has friends from all over, he remains part of the political culture of his home state.
"The Arkansas style and Clinton's political fund-raising style -- it translates very closely," said Robert A. Caro, the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of Johnson.
Arkansas has "a political culture in which the interrelation of economic forces and political forces is much more raw, much more open, and much more accepted" than most other states, Mr. Caro said.
"I think his fund raising reflects that style of politics," Mr. Caro added. "And we now see the raw, open method of fund raising carried into the White House itself."
 
The Ties
Old Friends Come Calling
Once Mr. Clinton was in office, some close friends and supporters from Arkansas pursued new opportunities in Washington and Asia.
In 1995, three months after his swearing-in, Mr. Clinton met in the Oval Office with James T. Riady, an Indonesian billionaire with old Arkansas ties to Mr. Clinton. The next day, the Riady family's main American lawyer and business partner, C. Joseph Giroir Jr., organized a new corporation, Arkansas International Development.
The corporation was intended to connect the Riady family's Asian conglomerate with American companies seeking business in China and Indonesia. It helped Wal-Mart, one of Arkansas's biggest corporations, open a store in Indonesia in partnership with the Riadys.
Mr. Giroir, in an interview, said he found an affinity between Arkansan and Asian business styles. He has donated almost $200,000 to the Democratic Party since 1993. He also paid for a bronze bust of Mr. Clinton in the National Portrait Gallery, dedicated in honor of Mochtar Riady, the family patriarch.
More recently, Mr. Giroir brought an Indonesian business associate, Peter Gontha, to the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Mr. Gontha, a media tycoon involved in a cable television venture in Indonesia with the Riadys, came to see one of the bank's directors, Maria Haley, about United States Government financing for the sale of communications satellites to Indonesia.
Ms. Haley said she always kept in touch with "old friends from Arkansas." Having served in Little Rock as Governor Clinton's chief international trade promoter, Ms. Haley knew Mr. Giroir from back home.
Ms. Haley's first job in Washington was in the White House personnel office, where she helped John Huang, the Riady family's senior American executive, get a job at the Commerce Department. At Commerce, Mr. Huang stayed in touch with his Arkansas contacts like Mr. Giroir and Webster L. Hubbell, the Associate Attorney General. And after Mr. Huang became a top Democratic fund-raiser, he kept in touch with Ms. Haley.
Ms. Haley's office calendar for last September shows she talked to Matthew Mulyanto, described in the datebook as a "friend of John Huang," about an Indonesian business deal. Mr. Mulyanto gave $3,500 last year to the Democratic Party, money solicited by Mr. Huang.
Ms. Haley has written about the Arkansas style of networking.
"I am sorry to bother you with this," she wrote in a 1994 memorandum to a senior aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton, asking her to bring a minor matter to the First Lady's attention, "but Arkansans go to their fellow Arkansans to plead their case."
 
The Promises
Pushing Access, Gaining Clients
Not all the President's friends had to leave Little Rock to reach the right people in Washington.
Officials from the President on down were peppered with memorandums from Mr. Grobmyer, the Little Rock lawyer and golfing friend of the President. Two months after Mr. Clinton took office, Mr. Grobmyer returned to Little Rock from a trip to Indonesia with the Riadys and sent the President a policy memorandum about ways for the Government to help United States corporations make money in Asia.
In 1993, Mr. Grobmyer set up a corporation in Arkansas to expand his international trade business. He won new clients like the American Ecology Corporation, American Gas Association and Alltel, an information-processing company. These clients say they hired Mr. Grobmyer because he promised access to powerful Asians like the Riadys and avenues through Federal agencies like the Export-Import Bank, where he had a close contact in Ms. Haley, his fellow Arkansan.
Steve Bova, who hired Mr. Grobmyer for Alltel, said the company retained him to "navigate around how do we get things like Ex-Im guarantees."
Across Asia and in Washington, Mr. Grobmyer passed out calling cards describing himself as "Liaison to the White House for the Center for the Study of the Presidency," a small, nonprofit educational foundation. Center officials said he arranged a $30,000 contribution from Mr. Riady to the center shortly after Mr. Clinton became President.
Some of Mr. Grobmyer's memorandums involved protocol minutiae. In anticipation of a Presidential visit to Asia, one memorandum asked the State Department to track down a Japanese man who, as a child a decade previously, had been photographed with Governor Clinton on an earlier visit to Asia.
Some were business-minded. In September 1993, he asked Mr. Hubbell, the No. 3 official at the Justice Department, to call an underling and alert him that Mr. Grobmyer and a client from Arkansas, an executive of Stephens Inc., were about to arrive, according to Mr. Hubbell's telephone logs. At the Justice Department, Mr. Grobmyer and his client discussed the Administration's plans for private companies to manage prisons. Stephens Inc. is a leading financier of private prison operators.
"It was thought that privatization might help save the Government money," Mr. Grobmyer said in a recent statement, so "Mr. Hubbell was asked who should be contacted to receive such information."
Mr. Hubbell was forced to resign in 1994. Facing fraud charges and huge legal fees, he asked a longtime friend in Arkansas for a consulting job with the friend's Wall Street investment firm. Mr. Hubbell claimed he was still "on good terms with the President," and said he thought there was lots of money to be made in Indonesia, recalled two people who know about the conversation and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The Washington office of the investment firm vetoed the idea because Mr. Hubbell was "too hot," the two people said.
But another Little Rock connection came through. In June 1994, the Riady family retained Mr. Hubbell, who a decade earlier had done legal work for a bank the family co-owned in Little Rock.
A Federal grand jury is investigating how the Riadys came to hire Mr. Hubbell in 1994 and what he did to earn more than $100,000 from them.
This week, Mr. Hubbell was released from Federal custody after serving 18 months for two felony counts.
Mr. Berry, the Little Rock lobbyist, was another golfing friend of the President. In 1993 he joined the Washington lobbying firm Global USA, which sent its Asian clients a picture of Mr. Berry on the fairways with Mr. Clinton, along with a letter promising that "Paul's long association with President Clinton and many of his top staff will provide you with unique and fresh insight into the workings of the Clinton Administration," said two Global executives.
Mr. Berry now helps Mr. Giroir find Americans who are looking for business with the Riadys. Mr. Berry said recently that he also represented a Taiwanese investment group, a client he got last year in part through James Wood, the Arkansan appointed by the Clinton Administration to represent the United States Government in Taiwan.
Another Arkansas lawyer and Clinton friend, Mark E. Middleton, joined the Administration in 1993 as a White House aide. Mr. Middleton helped organize the President's 1994 meeting with Asian leaders in Indonesia. In 1995, he left the Administration to pursue Asian business deals, but until late last year, he had a telephone line at the White House that directed callers to the trade company where he works.
Administration officials recently banned Mr. Middleton from using the White House dining room after they said he might have used it to entertain clients.
Richard Mays, yet another Arkansas lawyer who raised money for and befriended Governor Clinton in Little Rock, also came to Washington in 1993. He joined a lobbying firm, Cassidy & Associates.
"I'm sure Richard had a number of contacts with the White House," said Tim Dickson, a spokesman for Cassidy, which no longer employs Mr. Mays. Among the clients Mr. Mays aided was Eric Wynn, a twice-convicted felon with ties to organized crime. Through Mr. Mays, Mr. Wynn attended a White House coffee with the President, which was arranged by the Democratic National Committee.
Mr. Mays did not return phone calls seeking comment.
 
The China Link
From Restaurateur To Trade Promoter
Charles Yah Lin Trie owned a Chinese restaurant in Little Rock frequented by Governor Clinton in the 1980's. He later sought to parlay his relationship with the President into a profitable business linking American companies and China.
After Mr. Clinton's election, Mr. Trie opened a Washington office in the Watergate complex, armed with a letter of congratulations about his business successes from the President-elect. One of Mr. Trie's clients said Mr. Trie bragged about his ties to Mr. Clinton.
These were not empty boasts. In April, as Mr. Trie raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Democratic Party in the 1996 campaign, the White House formally announced his appointment to a Presidential Commission on Asian trade.
In 1994, he organized a 20-day trip to the United States for a delegation of Chinese trade officials, and booked them for a week in Little Rock.
"These officials could have chosen anywhere in the United States," Mr. Trie's promotional materials said, "but because of the relationship they have with Mr. Trie, they agreed to come to Little Rock."
Mr. Trie so impressed the Chinese Government that he became the liaison by which one of its most powerful officials came to meet the President at a White House coffee organized by the Democratic committee. The official was Wang Jun, the head of a Chinese state conglomerate that buys and sells weapons. After belated news reports of Mr. Wang's February 1996 visit, Mr. Clinton said it was "clearly inappropriate."
On March 21, Mr. Trie delivered the first installment of $639,000 he had raised -- mostly from a religious association based in Taiwan -- to the private legal defense fund set up to pay Mr. Clinton's legal bills from the Whitewater investigation. Unlike political parties, the fund has strict rules to keep people from making donations to curry favor. Unable to verify the source of the money, the fund decided to return all of it.
The way in which Mr. Clinton raised money to stay in power as President is not very different from the way he raised money to remain Governor of Arkansas.
 
The Method
In the Capital, A Down-Home Way
As he and his top aides set out to raise tens of millions of dollars from untapped sources for the 1996 election, the office of Truman Arnold -- the Arkansas businessman Mr. Clinton chose as the Democratic Party's chief fund-raiser -- began inviting big donors and potential contributors to have coffee with the President at the White House, said the party's spokeswoman, Amy Weiss Tobe.
One coffee, in May 1996, brought some of the nation's biggest bankers together with Mr. Clinton and the bankers' top Federal regulator. No one asked if the gathering might be inappropriate -- which Mr. Clinton acknowledged it was after the guest list became public last month.
The chief executive mingling with bankers and regulators and fund-raisers, the confluence of politics and money, was the way things were done in Arkansas.
In the mid-1980's, Mr. Clinton relied on a savings and loan operator, James B. McDougal, for political and personal support. While Mr. McDougal's savings and loan was failing, he was recommending the appointment of state savings and loan regulators to Mr. Clinton.
Mr. McDougal paid most of Mr. Clinton's debts in their jointly owned Whitewater land investment. Mr. Clinton has said he never asked how that debt was paid.
Mr. McDougal raised the money to retire Mr. Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign debts at a 1985 party in the lobby of his failing savings and loan. Some of the money was in cashier's checks from the savings and loan. Some came from the savings and loan's executives and customers. Mr. Clinton has said he never asked about the source of the donations.
Mr. McDougal was convicted on 18 felony counts in connection with the failure of his savings and loan. He has not been sentenced.
In July 1996, not long after after the bankers' White House coffee, Mr. Clinton gave a videotaped deposition in a separate case. He described a December 1990 meeting he had with an Arkansas banker and his accountant in the Governor's office that was arranged by Mr. Clinton 1990 campaign treasurer, Bruce Lindsey.
The banker and the accountant raised campaign money and received appointments to state patronage jobs. The banker was appointed to the bank regulatory commission. The two men walked into the Governor's office, discussed a patronage post for the banker's boss, and handed Mr. Clinton more than $15,000 in checks to help retire his 1990 campaign debt.
Mr. Clinton was asked under oath whether he thought it was right to reward his financial supporters. The President turned the question around. To deny people plums "just because they'd supported the Governor," he said, was wrong. It was "just the reverse of how the democratic process ought to work."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Forecast of Surplus Is Disputed by Capitol Agency

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said today that President Clinton's budget plan would leave the Federal Government with a deficit of at least $49 billion in 2002 instead of the $17 billion surplus the White House projects.
The budget office's estimate was in line with those issued by Republicans last week, and illustrates the gap between what the White House says must be done to balance the budget and what Republicans insist is necessary. 
 June E. O'Neill, the budget office's director, said its deficit estimate was based on a comparison of the Administration's projected savings in 2002, from spending cuts and revenue increases, against the budget office's projection of what the deficit would be if current spending and taxation policies continued unchanged.
The Administration says its proposals would save $118 billion in 2002. Without those savings, the Administration says, the deficit that year would be $101 billion; but the budget office says it would be much higher, $167 billion.
The budget office has not yet analyzed the Administration's savings claims in detail, Ms. O'Neill said, but when it does so it will most likely conclude that they are inflated. As a result, she said, the budget office's estimate of the deficit that the Administration's plan would leave is likely to grow.
As it has throughout two years of debate over balancing the budget, the Administration defended its deficit estimates today as having been more reliable in recent years than those generated by the budget office.
"We would note that over the past four years, the projections of our own Office of Management and Budget have been more on the money than alternative economic assumptions and forecasts," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary.
Moreover, Mr. McCurry said, the differences between the Congressional Budget Office and the Administration are relatively small in the context of a Federal budget of $2 trillion, roughly the spending sum projected for 2002.
"That's only a fraction of a difference between the two sets of assumptions," he said, "and not any barrier to achieving an agreement about a balanced budget."
Speaking before the House Budget Committee, Ms. O'Neill also said that the differing deficit estimates resulted from "relatively small differences in economic assumptions" and that the Administration's budget was an "honest effort" to eliminate the deficit by 2002, the target that both sides have settled on.
The Administration's plan relies on forecasts of lower unemployment and inflation than the assumptions the budget office uses.
Demanding the use of conservative economic assumptions has been something of a crusade for the chairman of the House Budget Committee, Representative John R. Kasich, Republican of Ohio, and today he warned his own party as well as the Democrats against tinkering with the numbers to make balancing the budget easier.
He said his fellow Republicans, some of whom view deep tax cuts as more important than eliminating the deficit, should not "try to fudge the numbers" to justify a big tax cut or to avoid the "excruciatingly hard" decisions that balancing the budget will require.
A demand by Senate Republicans for $193 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, Mr. Kasich said, may not be politically feasible, because it would require deeper spending cuts than the Administration is likely to accept. The Administration has proposed about $100 billion in tax cuts.
Mr. Kasich also said Congress and the Administration should consider reducing cost-of-living adjustments paid to recipients of Social Security and other benefit programs, to reflect a widespread belief among economists that the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation.
Reducing the adjustment would save the Government billions of dollars a year and make reaching a budget agreement considerably easier. But any reduction would encounter strong opposition from the elderly, among other groups.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Looks at Whether China Funneled Money to Democrats

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining whether Chinese officials or their agents may have used people close to President Clinton to give money secretly to the Democratic Party over the last five years, Government officials said today.
As part of that inquiry, the bureau is investigating connections among the Chinese Government; the Lippo Group, part of a $12 billion empire based in Indonesia and run by the Riady family, longtime campaign contributors to President Clinton, and the Democratic fund-raiser John Huang, once Lippo's top American executive. 
 "It would be a very serious matter for the United States if any country were to attempt to funnel funds to one of our political parties for any reason whatsoever," President Clinton said today after being asked about the F.B.I. investigation. "So I think we have to let the investigation proceed."
The F.B.I. investigation was spurred by a request last month from Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, Republican of New York. Mr. Solomon asked the bureau to find out whether campaign contributions financed "economic espionage" -- whether China, by funneling money through politically connected people, had bought access to sensitive, commercially useful United States Government information.
The investigation is at a very early stage and has uncovered no hard evidence tying Chinese Government money to the 1996 campaign, Federal officials said. The Washington Post reported today that the investigation was focusing on the Chinese Embassy. The embassy spokesman, Yu Shuning, described the assertion as "groundless," and United States officials said F.B.I. counterintelligence agents assigned to watch the embassy were not part of the inquiry.
The ties binding the Riadys, Mr. Huang, the Democratic Party and Mr. Clinton are strong. So are the ties between the Chinese Government and the Riadys. But no one has connected those two sets of relationships.
Mr. Clinton first met James T. Riady, now one of Lippo's top executives, nearly 20 years ago, when Mr. Riady was a trainee at Stephens Inc., the most powerful financial institution in Arkansas. In the 1980's, the Riady family set up an international trade operation in Little Rock, Ark.
The Riadys and one of their American companies gave the Democrats at least $225,000 for the 1992 elections and assigned Mr. Huang, then their senior American executive, to raise money for the campaign, according to campaign records and an associate of the Riadys. Mr. Riady and Mr. Huang contributed $100,000 more for Mr. Clinton's 1993 inaugural celebration.
The Riadys have a number of Chinese dealings, including real estate, department stores, electronics plants, a small bank -- the first licensed to exchange foreign currencies -- and a huge tourism complex on an island in Fujian, the province that was once home to the Riady family.
Shortly after Mr. Clinton was elected, Mr. Riady urged the President to renew China's status as a most favored nation for American trade, according to a Riady associate. During the 1992 campaign, Mr. Clinton said President Bush was "coddling dictators" by granting China most-favored-nation status.
Then, on May 28, 1993, President Clinton reversed his campaign stance and renewed China's most-favored-nation status. A few weeks later, China Resources (Holding) Company, one of the Chinese Government's oldest and most powerful trading companies, acquired 50 percent of Lippo's holdings in a Hong Kong bank where Mr. Huang had been a vice president.
China Resources has occasionally served as cover for espionage activities by the Chinese, some intelligence analysts said.
In September 1993, Mr. Huang asked Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown to meet with Shen Jueren, the chairman of China Resources, Commerce Department records show. Commerce officials said today that the meeting apparently never happened.
In 1994, the Riadys have said, they helped place Mr. Huang at the Commerce Department as Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Economic Policy. Mr. Riady and his father, Mochtar, have told associates that they asked the Clinton Administration to hire Mr. Huang in consideration of their financial support in 1992. The Riadys have also told associates that they wanted Mr. Huang in that job because of their interest in United States-China policy.
Records of Mr. Huang's work at the Commerce Department show that he visited the Chinese Embassy twice and the Chinese Ambassador's residence in Washington once in 1995. In July 1995, he received a telephone call from Arkansas from the daughter of the Chinese Ambassador.
In September 1995, in the Oval Office, Mr. Huang told the President that he would serve him better as a major Democratic Party fund-raiser. With him were Mr. Riady and Bruce Lindsey, the Clinton confidant and White House official whose former Little Rock law firm has worked for Lippo.
Mr. Huang solicited hundreds of thousands of dollars from Chinese-Americans, ethnic Chinese living in the United States and Indonesian business associates of the Riadys. His unchecked fund raising led to $1.2 million in questionable campaign contributions, the biggest sum since Watergate. That put him and the Riadys squarely in the middle of Congressional and Federal inquiries into campaign financing.
This chain of connections -- from China Resources to Lippo to Mr. Huang to the Commerce Department to the Democratic National Committee -- warranted an F.B.I. investigation, Mr. Solomon said in his letter to the F.B.I.'s Director, Louis J. Freeh.
The investigation, Government officials said, is also looking at links between the Chinese Government and Charles Yah Lin Trie, who owned a Chinese restaurant in Little Rock where Mr. Clinton often ate when he was Governor. Mr. Trie, working at times with Mr. Huang, raised hundreds of thousands of dollars during the 1996 campaign. That included $639,000 returned last year by Mr. Clinton's legal defense fund, which could not verify the true sources of all the money.
Mr. Trie, who runs an international trading company in Little Rock, boasted of his ties to top Chinese officials as he sought to broker deals for companies including Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street investment house.
In a resume he gave the Commerce Department in 1994, Mr. Trie said he had had "a personal relationship with a number of senior government officials in China." Mr. Trie played host to 21 senior economic and trade officials from China who visited the United States in 1994. Their 20-day trip included a week in Little Rock.
In February, Wang Jun, the head of the Chinese Government's arms company, came to Washington. He had been invited by Mr. Trie and Ernest Green, a Lehman Brothers official who is a native of Arkansas.
Mr. Trie invited Mr. Wang to meet Mr. Clinton at a White House coffee organized by Democratic Party fund-raisers. Mr. Green gave $50,000 to the Democratic National Committee shortly afterward. In April, the White House formally appointed Mr. Trie to a Presidential commission on Asian trade.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Urges Lobbying Ban For Agencies

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he wanted to prohibit all lobbying of city agencies, asserting that his administration was so accessible and fair that there was no need for anyone to hire lobbyists. But the Mayor conceded that he did not know how such a ban would work and that the concept raised knotty questions about free speech.
Mr. Giuliani made his impromptu proposal after Democrats criticized him over his relationship with two prominent unpaid advisers, Raymond B. Harding and Herman Badillo. News accounts in recent days have detailed how the two men have set up a thriving business lobbying city agencies that Mr. Giuliani oversees, even as they continue to advise him on politics and policy. 
 Mr. Giuliani insisted at a news conference that his administration had shown no favoritism to Mr. Harding, Mr. Badillo or any other lobbyist. But his announcement appeared to be an effort to blunt any attempts by his potential Democratic opponents in the coming mayoral election to use the lobbying to impugn his ethics.
Yesterday morning, in fact, one Democratic contender, Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said she would push legislation in the City Council that would require unpaid mayoral advisers like Mr. Harding and Mr. Badillo to abide by the city's strict financial disclosure and conflict of interest rules.
And the informal nature of the Mayor's proposal quickly brought accusations from the Democrats that he was trying to divert attention from the controversy over Mr. Harding and Mr. Badillo.
In an interview after the news conference, Mr. Giuliani denied that his proposal was a response to attacks over his ties to the two men, saying that he had long believed that lobbying could largely be eliminated from city agencies. He said he had instructed his aides to draft legislation that he would give to the City Council in the coming weeks.
"As a practical matter, you do not need intermediaries to deal with the executive branch of government," Mr. Giuliani said. "People are turned down just as often when they have lobbyists as when they appear themselves." Some lobbying experts said they doubted that the Mayor would be able to compose legislation that would withstand a court challenge.
But Mr. Giuliani said he recognized that any such prohibition would have to be written so it did not violate constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech. Another problem would be to distinguish between legal representation and lobbying.
"We don't know yet how it will work," Mr. Giuliani said, acknowledging that he had decided to make the proposal only 15 minutes before he actually announced it.
The Mayor could conceivably prohibit lobbying of city agencies without legislation, simply by issuing an executive order banning officials from dealing with lobbyists. He could even informally instruct them not to do so. But he said the strongest possible ban would be one that was in law, so he wanted to try that first. If approved, such legislation might smother a prosperous industry that in recent decades has become such a fixture that it is almost regarded as another branch of the municipal government. In 1995, the last year records were compiled, lobbyists who registered with the city billed their clients more than $9 million in fees, officials said.
The top 10 firms, which include the one led by Mr. Harding and Mr. Badillo, reaped more than $5 million in lobbying fees. Those figures include lobbying of the Council, which the Mayor did not propose banning.
The debate over Mr. Giuliani's relationship with Mr. Harding and Mr. Badillo heated up following news reports that the law firm where the two are senior partners, Fischbein Badillo Wagner Harding, had seen a sharp rise in its lobbying clients since Mr. Giuliani took office. In 1993, the firm had 3 such clients; it now has nearly 60.
Some Democrats charged that the Mayor let the firm lobby his administration because he did not want to alienate Mr. Harding, the leader of the state Liberal Party and Mr. Giuliani's closest political adviser.
Mr. Giuliani's remarks yesterday were in contrast to recent comments by one of his top advisers, Fran Reiter, the Deputy Mayor for economic development and a protege of Mr. Harding. In an interview, Ms. Reiter said lobbyists were helpful because they assisted clients in navigating the municipal government, saving time for administration officials. "The lobbyists that are really good can make everybody's life easier," she said.
Asked about Ms. Reiter's remarks, Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he strongly disagreed with her.
Mr. Harding said he supported the Mayor, adding that he was first a lawyer, then a lobbyist, so he would not suffer if he were barred from lobbying the administration. Mr. Badillo declined to comment.
Some of the potential Democratic contenders scoffed at Mr. Giuliani's proposal. They said there was nothing wrong with lobbying, so long as it did not involve a conflict of interest.
"Giuliani is in a bit of a panic," said Leland T. Jones, a senior adviser to Ms. Messinger. "He is so panicked that he is doing the equivalent of banning winter."

HEADLINE: AOL's Flat Rate Makes Sound Business Sense

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In seeking to explain "AOL's Bottom Line" (Op-Ed, Feb. 6) and how to price on-line information in general, Art Bechhoefer (letter, Feb. 11) risks adding to the confusion. 
 While it is true that for some types of information, like stock tips, "the more widely information is distributed, the less value it retains," one of the paradoxical aspects of the information age is that many types of information become more valuable as more people learn them.
For instance, in a recent study a colleague, Chris Kemerer, and I found that the value consumers placed on a particular brand of spreadsheet software was strongly correlated with the number of other people who used the same brand -- everyone wanted to know the set of commands everyone else was using. Similarly, few people would pay to join a newsgroup or chat room on AOL if no one else was participating.
Mr. Bechhoefer also asserts that "flat-rate pricing is the ultimate degradation" of information value. When a colleague, Yannis Bakos, and I began researching the economics of information access, we also expected metering information to be more profitable than offering thousands of information goods for a single price. To our surprise, we found that bundling information goods could be more profitable and efficient than selling them separately. This result was heavily dependent on the nearly zero cost to replicate information -- it costs AOL no more to offer its subscribers access to a complete bundle than to only a few bits.

HEADLINE: N.J. Budget Proposal Isn't 'Fiscal Chicanery'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Fiscal Chicanery in New Jersey" (editorial, Feb. 8) makes some wrong assumptions. The budget that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has proposed reflects the choices made to insure support for education, the environment and the economy, among others. One such choice, our plan to fully finance the state's pension obligations, in no way resembles "fiscal chicanery." 
 You assume that the proposed bond issue adds to the state's payment obligations. But New Jersey will issue $3.4 billion in taxable bonds for 36 years to pay off this liability in full immediately. This will result in a shortened payment period and provide future taxpayers substantial savings. When the proceeds of the bond sale are placed into our pension funds, New Jersey will join a special group of large, fully financed public pension funds.
It is imprudent for New Jersey not to take advantage of such a program when the bond market offers favorable financing rates. Not a dollar of additional payment obligations will be placed on future generations, and real savings will be realized.
You wrongly assume that the proceeds of the refinancing bond issue will be handed over to the pension funds with the hope that the market keeps rising. We are aware that the market is volatile, but we are also aware that over the long term it has provided positive returns.
It is a responsible government that takes advantage of opportunities to fully finance its obligation to pension beneficiaries while realizing substantial savings for taxpayers. Contrary to your editorial's suggestion, this proposal has nothing to do with tax cuts and everything to do with taking advantage of this opportunity.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Little Changed After a Drop and a Rebound

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday, touching a four-year high against the yen and 34-month high vs. the mark on benign inflation news, the ebullient stock market in the United States and more economic weakness in Germany.
Although rumors of a possible Bank of Japan intervention to defend the yen caused an early selloff of dollars, underlying demand for the currency remained strong and pushed the dollar back up. It closed slightly lower against the yen and mostly higher in other foreign-exchange dealings. 
 Despite the three-day weekend in the United States because of the Washington's Birthday holiday Monday, when American financial markets are closed, many traders bought dollars on the assumption the currency would keep rising.
"There's still a bias toward a firmer dollar; all the reasons for favoring the dollar are still there," said Dennis Pettit, foreign-exchange manager at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.'s New York branch. "Those factors are expected to be in place on the other side of the long weekend."
In intraday trading, the dollar reached a high of 124.80 yen, the strongest level since February 1993 and the first new four-year high against the yen in a week, before settling in New York at 124.22 yen, off from 124.35 yen Thursday.
Against the mark, the dollar reached an intraday high of 1.6945 marks, the strongest since April 1994, before settling in New York at 1.6885 marks, up from 1.6828. The British pound cost $1.6221, down from $1.6239.
The dollar received early help in Japan after the Dow Jones industrial average raced past 7,000 points and drew more interest from Japanese investors to invest in the United States.
Traders said the dollar derived further strength from German retail sales figures that fell 3.2 percent in December from the month before, underscoring the pervasive weakness that has pushed unemployment there to record highs.
The dollar has finished mostly stronger for the last four days, reflecting the foreign-exchange market's willingness to test the tolerance for a rising dollar among the world's richest industrial nations.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
An Old Dream For the Arts, A New Chance For the City

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
Is any site in Manhattan more vexed than 2 Columbus Circle, Huntington Hartford's pseudo-Venetian palazzo, which in 33 years has never become the cultural center it was once called? In May the Department of Cultural Affairs, which has occupied it since 1979, will make way for whoever the city decides may buy the building.
It ought to be given to an art museum or an arts organization. Or at least the city should guarantee a place for art somewhere at the redeveloped Columbus Circle, as part of the future Coliseum site if not at 2 Columbus Circle itself. 
 Why? Recall the history of 2 Columbus Circle, which dates from 1964, when Mr. Hartford, the A.&P. supermarket heir, opened the Gallery of Modern Art at a cost of $7.4 million to challenge the authority of the Museum of Modern Art, which he despised as an archfiend for its embrace of abstraction.
His architect was Edward Durell Stone, a co-designer of the Museum of Modern Art in 1939. Stone's subsequent rejection of purist modernism made him an ideal partner. Mr. Hartford installed his own collection of academic and figurative paintings in Stone's decorated marble building.
As everyone knows, the result was a catastrophe. Critics lambasted the building's design, the art collection and Mr. Hartford, whose gallery became a money pit. Within a year he was nosing around for a partner or buyer.
In 1969 he gave the building to Fairleigh Dickinson University, which optimistically renamed it the New York Cultural Center. It organized some poorly received shows but also some unusual ones that other New York museums wouldn't take on (a Tissot show, for example). After seven years, it left the building in a state of acute fiscal anemia.
Gulf & Western then bought 2 Columbus Circle for the city, the gift specifically restricting the site's use to cultural purposes, and the city installed the Department of Cultural Affairs and the Convention and Visitors Bureau.
The point here is not to argue for the building itself, though the scorn heaped upon it and on Mr. Hartford's gallery certainly derived, in part, from the stranglehold that orthodox modernism had on critical opinion at the time.
Today we live in a more pluralist era. Mr. Hartford's collection, though eccentric, included works by pre-Raphaelites and the Venetian painter Bellotto that New York museums would now be glad to own. Hard up for cash, Mr. Hartford sold the works for a song when the art market was weak; that no museum here bought them was a failure of foresight that cost the city.
What matters now is the use of the site. This is soon to be decided by the city's Economic Development Corporation, which is keeping the process secret. The Dahesh Museum, occupying a small space on Fifth Avenue for its collection of 19th-century academic art, has made public its interest. It has been bruited about that Donald Trump is one of the other bidders.
When asked, a spokesman for the E.D.C. turned vague about why the city was now free to sell 2 Columbus Circle to whomever it wants. The facts are that a few years ago Viacom Inc., which had acquired the company that had been Gulf & Western, waived its restriction on the use of the building in return for tax breaks, a Viacom spokesman said.
The real question isn't legal, anyway, it's about cultural stewardship: will the city do the right thing and seize the opportunity of Columbus Circle's redevelopment to create what might be called an avenue of culture on the West Side, with Lincoln Center at one end and Columbus Circle at the other? This was the prospect 30 odd years ago, and it never came about.
A strong visual arts presence has always been missing from the area. Only the Museum of American Folk Art, a fine but small institution in a kind of storefront space on Columbus Avenue, facing Lincoln Center, is there now. But it has long talked of returning to 53d Street, and already has raised money to build on the site it owns at 45-47 West 53d Street, with the idea that it would keep a branch where it is now.
One of the proposals for redeveloping the Coliseum site, by Murphy/ Jahn Architects, includes a new home for the Folk Art museum around the corner from Columbus Circle, on 60th Street. But startlingly, neither the developer, Tishman Speyer, nor the architects consulted the museum, whose incredulous director, Gerard Wertkin, says it has no intention of moving there.
Even if it did, moving Folk Art several blocks south would not increase the overall visual arts presence on the West Side, the issue at hand. The Murphy/Jahn proposal includes space for Sotheby's, which figures in other proposals as well. But whether or not Sotheby's moves from the East Side, a commercial auction house is a business, not a museum.
And that, after all, was what 2 Columbus Circle was intended to be. True, its inherent problems as an art venue went beyond even the idiosyncrasies of Stone's design or of Mr. Hartford's vision, and they must still be taken into account. The site is a narrow traffic island with a height restriction, so that no building there can include the wide-open interiors that many exhibitions, especially of contemporary art, demand.
Only a small museum might fit comfortably into it, like the Dahesh, which proposes to renovate the decrepit building rather than tear it down and start anew. There would be a symmetry to its tenancy: Dr. Dahesh, who died in 1984, was the adopted name of Salim Moussa Achi, a rich Lebanese writer and charismatic religious leader with a cultish following and a taste for academic and anti-modernist art. On art, at least, he and Mr. Hartford might have seen eye to eye.
But Dahesh or not, it's fair to ask whether, if an appropriate art institution cannot be found for 2 Columbus Circle, the city doesn't have an obligation to acknowledge the spirit in which it accepted Gulf & Western's gift and to donate a place in the enormous Coliseum redevelopment to a cultural organization that puts on art exhibitions.
At the least, some of the millions of dollars the city will no doubt receive for 2 Columbus Circle should go toward enhancing art there. That would also be faithful to the urban renewal law that permitted the Coliseum to be built in the first place.
Several public agencies share responsibilities for the circle. The Metropolitan Transit Authority oversees the Coliseum redevelopment, the Department of City Planning oversees the renovation of pedestrian and traffic areas around it, and the Parks Department, of course, is landlord to the northeast quadrant of the circle. The good news is that the Economic Development Corporation has lately decided to delay its decision on the disposition of 2 Columbus Circle for a few months, until the M.T.A.'s plans for the Coliseum are clearer.
After decades of urban planning failures at this crucial Manhattan crossroads, a couple of months of careful coordination seems like the least that ought to be done. Perhaps in this interim the agencies can mutually find a way to turn Huntington Hartford's original misbegotten idea for a museum on Columbus Circle into a cultural boon for the city.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Move Higher Again on Good Economic News

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities continued to forge ahead yesterday on good economic news, but further gains were stymied by profit taking in a shortened trading session ahead of the long Washington's Birthday weekend.
With the Government's quarterly refunding now complete, traders were willing to bid up prices and their mood was strengthened by weaker than expected economic data concerning price pressures at the manufacturing level that were released yesterday. The data, which showed an unexpected drop in producer prices, lowered fears about a move by the Fed to raise interest rates over the near term. 
 The newly issued 30-year bond rose 17/32 , to a price of 10110/32 to yield 6.53 percent, down from 6.62 percent on Thursday and down 17 basis points from the week before. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Rumors of a large leveraged seller of a block of five-year Treasury securities, worth between $600 million and $1 billion, circulated among traders yesterday morning. The rumor, which contributed to profit taking by traders, helped cut short the rally that began on the news of falling producer prices.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said bond traders had been expecting the producer price report to show higher food and energy prices, even if the core rate, which excludes food and energy, was low. But energy prices actually fell and food prices rose less than expected, providing a welcome surprise for credit market investors.
Even so, Mr. Chan was skeptical, saying that he expects pressure to build for sharply higher prices in the future. But he said it was likely that the Fed would wait for real price increases to reach the consumer level before acting on interest rates.
"It is clear that today's P.P.I. report should permit the Fed to remain on hold even in March, when they next meet," he said. "Consequently, what the report really suggested to most market investors is that the central bank is unlikely to rock the boat until at least the end of the first half of the year at the earliest."
The next most important piece of market-friendly data after the P.P.I., he said, is industrial production in January. "Everyone knew that overall manufacturing employment only rose modestly while manufacturing employment and overtime hours sharply declined, thereby pointing in the direction of moderate industrial production growth," Mr. Chan said. Total industrial production was flat in January.
Yesterday's economic reports strongly suggest that the economy is definitely slowing down from its strong growth pace in the fourth quarter of 1996. It gave bond investors a big enough comfort zone to buy securities without fear that the Fed would suddenly raise interest rates. "However, what today's numbers don't tell you is whether this slowdown will be swift enough to help the economy avoid any significant increases in inflation throughout the entire year," Mr. Chan said.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fall and Industrial Output Is Flat

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Largely reflecting a big drop in the cost of food, the prices charged by American producers fell in January, the first monthly decline in more than two years, the Labor Department said today.
Separately, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production was flat in January, providing evidence that the economy was slowing. 
 The surprisingly benign results were regarded by many analysts as further confirmation that inflation posed little threat despite a tight labor market and that the economy's growth rate had eased from its rapid pace in the fourth quarter of 1996. The news caused the bond market to rally, sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.53 percent, from 6.62 percent on Thursday.
"Never, never, never has inflation been so low at such an advanced stage of a business cycle," Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said. "We believe it will remain low."
The Producer Price Index for Finished Goods fell three-tenths of 1 percent, the report said. The core index, which excluded the volatile food and energy sectors, was unchanged. Food prices had their biggest decline in more than five years and energy prices eased for the first time since last spring.
Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers.
Some analysts said they were a bit disconcerted by a big jump in the price of raw materials, particularly scrap metal. Prices for raw materials rose 5.2 percent, the biggest increase since October 1990, during the Persian Gulf war. Excluding food and energy, raw materials prices rose 2 percent.
They said this should not be considered an alarm bell but should be monitored closely in case such pressures started to move through the manufacturing pipeline.
The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production, which was unchanged in January, was less in December than it had previously estimated, now putting the figure at five-tenths of 1 percent.
Industrial production was held down by extreme weather -- floods in the Northwest and blizzards in the Upper Midwest, the Fed reported. Analysts regarded this as more evidence that the economy was slowing from its unsustainably rapid fourth-quarter pace.
The Fed also found that industry -- factories, mines and utilities -- operated at 83.3 percent of capacity last month, down from 83.5 in December and less than a percentage point higher than in January 1996. Capacity expanded 3.7 percent over the last 12 months, the Fed said.
Still another set of figures, this one from the Commerce Department, showed that inventories edged down one-tenth of 1 percent in December. This suggested that that fourth-quarter gross domestic product would be revised downward from its reported 4.7 percent pace -- to about 4 percent, according to J. P. Morgan -- but that relatively lean stockpiles could underpin growth this quarter.
The report on producer prices showed that food, which accounts for nearly one-quarter of the finished-goods index, tumbled 1 percent as fresh fruits and melons fell 6 percent, eggs, pork and chickens turned down, and beef and veal fell more than in December. Energy fell two-tenths of 1 percent, with lower prices for gasoline and heating oil offsetting a 5 percent increase for natural gas.
Intermediate goods, such as flour and cloth, rose two-tenths of 1 percent over all and, for the third consecutive month, one-tenth of a percent for core products. Durable items used in manufacturing slowed to an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent while nondurable factory materials edged up one-tenth of 1 percent for the third consecutive month.
In raw materials, where the hefty 5.2 percent jump followed a 4.9 percent December increase, energy was again the main factor, up 12.9 percent. But the price of iron and steel scrap soared 6.4 percent after a December decline and aluminum and copper scrap jumped 7.8 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively, after rising in December
Prices of wastepaper and softwood logs, bolts and timber also climbed but raw cotton tumbled 6.6 percent, the report showed.
Despite the rise in raw materials, lack of excess demand and strong productivity growth should keep inflation in check, Mickey D. Levy, economist at Nationsbank in New York, contended.
Maureen F. Allyn, chief economist at Scudder, Stevens & Clark, added: "Anybody worried about inflation is worried about the wrong thing. Nobody's got any pricing power."

HEADLINE: Japan Hesitant About U.S. Antimissile Project

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
After three years of exploratory talks, Administration officials say Japan has all but decided against taking part in an antimissile defense project with the United States for fear of offending China and overspending scarce military resources.
Tokyo's hesitation stems from reluctance to spend billions of dollars when its own economy is weak, and concerns that developing a missile system would anger Japan's deeply pacifist electorate and frighten Asian neighbors wary of any signs of a Japanese military buildup. 
 A decision not to join the project would be a setback to American military contractors that hope to supply Japan with hardware. And it could swell United States military budgets for Asia because the United States would have to bear the cost of such a system alone.
Senior Administration officials said that no Japanese decision would be announced for months and that the United States would press ahead with its own plans to develop antimissile systems to protect American forces in Japan from any North Korean or Chinese attack.
The feasibility of an effective antimissile shield is still a matter of debate, but Pentagon officials say the Patriot missiles, which displayed a mixed record during the Persian Gulf war, have been updated and improved in recent years.
Administration officials also say a decision by Tokyo not to take part would not hurt its relations with Washington.
Discussions on how to pool technology, engineering talent and money to set up a "theater missile defense" began shortly after North Korea test-fired a Rodong 1 missile 300 miles into the Sea of Japan in 1993. A middle-level working group of Japanese and American defense planners has met nine times to discuss regional threats, deployment timetables and various types of land- and sea-based antiballistic weaponry.
Japan has been wary of the project ever since the Clinton Administration first broached the idea in October 1993. But American hopes were raised after Japan allocated $2.7 million in its 1996 budget to study building an antimissile system, 20 times what Tokyo spent the year before on the project. American officials were also encouraged when President Clinton and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto met in Tokyo last April and promised to broaden their military alliance.
A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said the group would continue meeting until the summer, after which time Tokyo would decide what role to play. "At this moment, we have not made any decision and we cannot predict or prejudge any result or conclusion," he said.
But after a meeting in Tokyo last weekend, senior American officials have concluded that Japan is simply not ready to pursue a project that could cost them as much as $10 billion a year -- more than one-fourth of Japan's current $35 billion military budget -- for four or five years. They said the project has a few powerful supporters in Japan's military establishment, but is opposed by many in the Foreign Ministry and by most of the nation's top economic officials.
"Japan is financially constrained, and they don't have the strategic consensus," said a senior Pentagon official involved in making Japan policy. "Japan is most nervous about China, even though they talk about North Korea. A decision to build this would be perceived by the Chinese to be a blatant act. So I'm sure Japan will not go down this line."
Another Administration official, who noted that China has repeatedly warned Japan that it would view deployment of an antimissile system as a hostile act, added, "This is not something that will happen anytime soon."
The Chinese have argued that a Japanese antimissile program would undermine regional arms-control efforts.
Given the pacifist strain that runs through the Japanese electorate, American officials said, Prime Minister Hashimoto and other members of the political elite cannot be expected to commit themselves to any such program without a thorough debate in Parliament. And there is no sign, they said, that Parliament will take up the issue any time soon.
The Pentagon has proposed at least four antimissile options for deployment by 2004, including enhanced Patriot surface-to-air missiles designed to intercept low-altitude missiles and Thaad antiballistic systems for high-altitude interceptions. American officials have also discussed the possibility of sharing with Japan early-warning data from satellites that are now being developed to detect infrared radiation at the time of a launching.
"Our interest is that we would like to see American troops in Japan protected from ballistic missile attacks," said Joseph Nye, a former Assistant Secretary of Defense, who is dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. "But Japan is very sensitive to the political repercussions in China and North Korea."
Many American military experts still say Japan will eventually join the project, but perhaps not for another five years or more.
"These things take time," said John M. Deutch, the Director of Central Intelligence, who pushed for a joint project when he served as a senior Defense Department official in the early 1990's. "Inevitably, the Japanese Government will see that it needs to be concerned with antimissile defense."
Despite the setback, Administration officials say they are committed to building or upgrading regional antimissile systems to protect American troops in all potentially hazardous regions, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and South Korea. The Administration's proposed $265 billion military budget for 1998 calls for a 3 percent cut in spending from the 1997 budget, but it adds $320 million for antimissile systems.
"The goal is to develop, procure and deploy systems that can protect forward-deployed U.S. forces, as well as allied and friendly nations, from theater-range ballistic missiles," Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said this week while testifying on the budget before Congress. "These programs are structured to proceed at the fastest pace that technology will allow."

HEADLINE: Market Luster Fades a Bit as the Dow Retreats by 33.48

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
The euphoria that swept Wall Street into a new millennium this week ended not in a bang, but with a whimper.
After gaining more than 574 points, or 8.9 percent, in just seven weeks, and reaching the 7,000 milestone on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average slumped yesterday, closing down 33.48 points, to 6,988.96. For the week, the Dow was up 133.16, or two-tenths of 1 percent. 
 "If you're going to take a breather, today was the logical day to do it," said Larry Wachtel, a Prudential Securities market analyst, noting that the markets will be closed through Monday, in observance of Washington's Birthday. "Remember, the Dow was up 216 points in three days, so 33 points wasn't a big deal."
Coming off a historic week, Mr. Wachtel and other analysts said that few on Wall Street expected the stock prices to continue to rise at such a phenomenal rate: nearly 9 percent in less than two months. But many agreed that strong economic fundamentals -- moderate growth and few signs of inflationary pressure -- bode well, even for a market that is considered quite expensive.
With the Dow hovering around 7,000, analysts said that investors were going to approach the market with increasing scrutiny, but as long as those economic fundamentals prevail, stock prices should remain at least stable.
While stocks declined yesterday, the bond market rallied after the Labor Department reported that the prices paid to factories, farms and other producers fell more than expected. It was yet another indication that inflationary pressures are tame.
Yesterday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.53 from 6.62 on Thursday. On Jan. 27, the yield peaked this year at 6.94. It is believed that when bond yields fall, stocks become more attractive to investors, and this week's historic run was certainly helped by falling yields. But what is interesting about this year's stock market gains is that they have come with the aid of a stable bond market, yet one that has been less than spectacular. Indeed, last year -- when the Dow saw similar gains of about 9 percent in the first seven weeks of the year -- the yield on the 30-year Treasury averaged 6.07, far below its average this year of 6.78.
But some analysts contend that healthy corporate earnings have offset some of the bond's influence. "We got used to in the past the stock market and bond market went up in lock step," said Greg A. Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential Securities. "But as long as the economy allows companies to produce profits all you need is a stable bond market. It's not important that interest rates constantly go down, it's important that they're not going up."
One theme that is being offered up again and again on Wall Street is that this year has been a replay of last year's stock market: impressive early year gains, record cash inflows into mutual funds and an almost exclusive interest in large-capitalization stocks.
Yesterday, however, broader market indexes fell. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was down 3.34, to 808.48, and the Nasdaq composite was down 3.62, to 1,367.19. But the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks -- which has lagged all year long -- was up slightly, 0.95, to 369.13, defying yesterday's trend in what some hope is even the smallest signal that small caps could rejuvenate.
Technology stocks, however, continue to wobble. Since January's impressive run-up -- with Microsoft and Intel leading the charge -- technology stocks have gone through spurts and sputters. Yesterday, Intel and Microsoft were both off, and so were many other technology stocks. Intel lost 2 1/2, to 154 1/2, and Microsoft was down 2 1/8, to 97 7/8.
Among Dow stocks, Caterpillar, Merck, Du Pont and Procter & Gamble -- all of which figured heavily in the Dow's 7,000 run -- fell yesterday. Caterpillar was down 3 3/8, to 79 3/4; Merck lost 2 1/4, to 97 3/8, Du Pont was down 2 5/8, to 109 5/8, and P. & G. was off 2, to 124 7/8.

HEADLINE: Germans Wonder: Twilight for Kohl?

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, Feb. 14

 BODY:
A tantalizing question has burst forth from Bonn's placid politics: is Helmut Kohl politically mortal?
Only last October, when the 66-year-old Mr. Kohl overtook Konrad Adenauer as Germany's longest-serving Chancellor since Bismarck, even his critics acknowledged the durability of what one adversary begrudgingly called "the eternal Chancellor." 
 Still basking in the afterglow as the architect of Germany's reunification in 1990, Mr. Kohl appeared unassailable, an emblem of confidence in an uncertain world, a political fixture who would see the country through the rigors of European integration and the triumphant return of its capital to Berlin at the start of a new millennium.
But the pendulum has swung rapidly. With unemployment topping 4.6 million -- at 12 percent its highest rate since in 1933, the year Hitler took power -- the talk is of what Joschka Fischer, leader of the Green Party, termed "the twilight of the Chancellor."
Now the issue is whether Mr. Kohl will run for a fifth term when Germany holds national elections next year. And with that comes a much broader question: if Mr. Kohl withdraws from the fray, can Europe's striving for unity survive without its dominant champion?
The mood changed in early January, when Wolfgang Schauble, Mr. Kohl's senior lieutenant in the governing Christian Democratic Union, deliberately let slip that he might "not be able to resist the temptation" to assume Germany's political leadership.
To outsiders, Mr. Schauble's aside might have seemed innocuous. But in the regimented world of Mr. Kohl's close advisers, the remark took on Delphic proportions. Mr. Schauble was raising a question that the Chancellor himself refuses to address in public. A debate, once taboo, was opened.
With some embarrassed squirming, Bonn's pundits addressed the sensitive question of whether Mr. Schauble -- a 54-year-old paraplegic who has used a wheelchair since a gunman shot him in 1990 -- was physically capable of running Europe's economic and political powerhouse. "A cripple as Chancellor?" Mr. Schauble himself said, unabashed. "That's a good question."
The remarks inspired younger members of the Christian Democratic Union to openly challenge their party leader's policies. Whisperers filled the salons here with suggestions that after 14 years in office, Mr. Kohl was tired and looking for a way to bow out.
The weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel broke another taboo, speculating openly that contrary to adamant official denials, Mr. Kohl may be hiding his doctors' suspicions that he is suffering from cancer -- just as the late President Francois Mitterrand of France did.
Alongside Mr. Schauble, who is widely considered Mr. Kohl's favorite, the names most frequently mentioned as likely successors are Edmund Stoiber, 55, the Governor of Bavaria, and Defense Minister Volker Ruhe, 54. Neither has announced an open challenge to Mr. Kohl.
Mr. Kohl himself is not saying much. Last week, when he journeyed to Berlin for the groundbreaking of a new Chancellery building, he was asked who would turn the key in the front door when the Government moved from Bonn in 1999. "We can leave that safely to the good Lord," he replied.
In any other political system, the omens might look bad. The latest opinion surveys say 55 percent of respondents do not want Mr. Kohl to run for chancellor again. And, despite his party's triumphs in important local elections last fall, opinion polls now show the opposition Social Democrats running even with the Christian Democrats.
But Mr. Kohl's allies argue that he has been here before. "Midterm blues are nothing new to Helmut Kohl," said a confidant who spoke in return for anonymity, referring to earlier challenges to Mr. Kohl's tenure. "He's been through this kind of thing and lived to tell the tale."
In 1989, for instance, Mr. Kohl was at a political ebb when the fall of the Berlin wall offered him a chance to carve a place in history and revive his fortunes through the enormous popularity of the prospect of reunification.
This time, though, the issues are nitty-gritty economics that promise no such political credits with voters long used to Europe's highest standard of living.
After years of complacency, Germany has been brought up short against hard realities. Its economy, says Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, the central bank, is inflexible, uncompetitive in global terms and burdened by social welfare programs that it can no longer afford.
The population of 80 million is aging, the reunification of 1990 continues to soak up more tax money than Mr. Kohl ever publicly projected and the stringent economic qualifications for the creation of a single European currency -- a process due to start next year -- have further strained the Government's ability to pay for social programs.
The criteria for a single currency include severe limits on deficit spending, so Germany has been pressed toward what many economists view as a long-overdue reform of its interlinked taxation, pension and welfare systems.
At the same time, though, Germany's unemployment -- driven, Mr. Tietmeyer and others say, by the same structural inflexibilities and high costs that underpin its social systems -- has soared to record levels. And that, in turn, means there is less tax revenue to pay for social costs, including the increased demand for unemployment benefits.
The combination of uncertainties over Germany's and Mr. Kohl's future, thus, have much wider consequences, raising the possibility that Europe's putative political integration will falter.
"If Kohl is not available for a further term, then it becomes much more difficult to push through monetary union," said Werner Becker, senior economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt.
But at this junction, Mr. Kohl's coalition Government seems paralyzed, caught in internal feuds over what it calls the economic "reforms of the century."
Others liken Mr. Kohl's plight after 14 years in power to that of Mr. Adenauer in his final days -- a symbol of his land abroad, yet undermined within his own party.
In Parliament last month, Mr. Kohl called out to Oskar Lafontaine, the leader of the Social Democrats: "You'd like me to go, wouldn't you?"
"Mr. Chancellor," Mr. Lafontaine replied, "it's true we would like you to go. But your problem is that there are even more people on the Government side who would like that too."

HEADLINE: U.S. Aide Assails Colombia as New Drug Sanctions Are Studied

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
A senior State Department official lashed out at the Colombian Government today for "cooperating" with drug traffickers and stopped just short of predicting that the Clinton Administration would impose economic sanctions on Colombia for the second year in a row.
In testimony before a House subcommittee, Assistant Secretary of State Robert S. Gelbard painted a picture of a Government that he said puts obstacles in the way of its police and prosecutors and allows drug kingpins to run their operations out of comfortable jail cells. The charges were not entirely new, but they came only two weeks before President Clinton is scheduled to decide whether Colombia should be "certified" as a trustworthy ally in the international fight on drugs. 
 "The Government of Colombia has failed," Mr. Gelbard said, "to follow through on promised counternarcotics action or to confront fully the drug interests that contributed millions of dollars to President Ernesto Samper's campaign."
Mr. Gelbard is receiving and reviewing reports from various law enforcement agencies as he prepares his recommendation on certification to the President. A State Department official who monitors Colombian affairs said Mr. Gelbard, who is well respected in the White House, is virtually certain to recommend decertification.
Last year, Mr. Clinton decertified Colombia, putting the traditional United States ally in the company of Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Nigeria and Syria. Some economic sanctions were applied, delaying American assistance for many months and making it more difficult for Colombia to attract international loans.
Should Mr. Clinton decide to decertify Colombia a second time, he could apply more stringent sanctions like cutting off landing rights for Colombian planes, putting Colombian travelers through onerous searches when they enter the United States and rescinding tariff preferences on coffee and other Colombian products.
An estimated 80 percent of the cocaine used in the United States is processed in Colombia, mostly from coca leaves produced in Peru and Bolivia. As eradication and interdiction efforts in Peru and Bolivia have increased in the last three years, Colombia has grown an increasing amount of coca.
And with the cocaine market in the United States peaking in recent years, Colombian cartels have stepped up shipments of heroin to the United States, undercutting traditional Asian traffickers with lower prices and purer product. An estimated 60 percent of the heroin now seized in the United States can be traced to Colombia, and that figure appears to be increasing quickly.
"There is as much cocaine coming into the United States or being produced in Colombia as ever before," said Mr. Gelbard, who heads the State Department's international narcotics and law enforcement affairs bureau. "There is more heroin being produced in Colombia than ever before. That's the bottom line."
Mr. Gelbard had kind words for Colombian officials, including the nation's top narcotics prosecutor and the head of the national police. But he made no effort to hide his disdain for President Samper, who was accused of receiving $6 million in donations from the Cali cartel during his campaign two years ago but has been absolved by the Colombian Congress.
He characterized Mr. Samper as "a truly corrupt President who has had a clear history of cooperating with drug dealers and receiving drug money back to 1982."
In recent weeks, Colombia has made a concerted effort to avert decertification. In December the Colombian Congress passed an asset-forfeiture law to take wealth away from convicted drug dealers. In the last two weeks, the Colombian police have shut down two huge cocaine-refining laboratories in the Andean jungles.
In a radio interview in Colombia today, Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia said, "Colombia has demonstrated that it's making serious progress." Ms. Mejia had just returned from a trip to Washington, where she tried to persuade Mr. Gelbard to certify Colombia this year.
A senior Administration official acknowledged that "some of the recent developments have been helpful" and added that no firm decision on decertification had been made.
Colombian and United States officials are now negotiating a maritime interdiction treaty that would allow American law enforcement agents to board and search Colombian-flagged ships in Colombian waters.
Speaking after Mr. Gelbard at a hearing of a House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee, Gen. Harold Bedoya, the commander of the Colombian armed forces, said decertification would demoralize his troops and deny them needed resources to fight traffickers.
"We are not the enemy," he said. "The enemy is international narcotics."

HEADLINE: Amrom H. Katz, 81, Early Expert on Space Reconnaissance

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Amrom H. Katz, whose studies prepared the way for space reconnaissance -- the use of space satellites to collect intelligence by photography and other means -- died on Monday in St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 81 and lived in Los Angeles.
The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, said his son, Michael, of Santa Monica. 
 Mr. Katz was also an authority on the detection of weapons systems and other military capabilities of cold-war opponents.
From 1941 to 1954 he played a central role in improving photographic reconnaissance equipment and systems at Wright Field, now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton, Ohio, becoming the chief civilian physicist of an aerial reconnaissance laboratory there.
In 1954 Mr. Katz joined the staff of the Rand Corporation, a research organization based in Santa Monica, and specialized in reconnaissance systems for airplanes and spacecraft; he was a senior scientist at Rand until 1970. Later he worked for Rand as a consultant.
He went on to become an assistant director of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and was its ranking expert on determining how fully arms control treaties were carried out. He served with the agency from 1973 until he resigned in 1976.
John Pike, an authority on space policy who is the director of the space policy project at the Federation of American Scientists, an organization that is based in Washington, said on Thursday that Mr. Katz's "early studies made possible the reconnaissance satellites that were a mainstay of intelligence collection and treaty verification during the cold war."
Most of those studies were done at Rand in the 1950's. Mr. Pike said they were important because they "identified how one would do photographic intelligence from space."
William R. Harris, a Rand consultant who is an expert on arms control treaties, said of Mr. Katz: "In the 1950's and early 1960's, he was really the world's pre-eminent expert on the use of photographic systems in piercing cold-war secrecy. His expertise helped others in the West to construct reconnaissance systems that enabled successive Western political leaders to manage cold-war crises more effectively in the nuclear age."
Mr. Katz was born in Chicago, grew up in Milwaukee, received a bachelor's degree in 1939 from the University of Wisconsin and did graduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In 1946 he supervised the Army Air Forces' photography of the atomic bomb tests at Bikini atoll in the Marshall Islands in the western Pacific.
During the Korean War, in preparation for the successful amphibious landing of American troops at Inchon, South Korea, Mr. Katz devised a plan to measure the height of a sea wall at the harbor without alerting enemy forces of the impending attack. He did it by having airplanes take photographs of Inchon at carefully timed intervals, and then using trigonometry to calculate the height of the wall and to show that it would not be a major obstacle to the Marine Corps landing on Sept. 15, 1950.
In 1957, Mr. Katz and a Rand teammate, Merton E. Davies, advocated the use of cameras and film-recovery systems in space reconnaissance to gather intelligence about the Soviet Union from places where intelligence-gathering had not been possible before. Rand's recommendations were promptly accepted by the Air Force.
Mr. Harris said Mr. Katz "was among the earliest champions of the use of reconnaissance by spacecraft to take the place of inspectors on the ground as the main means of monitoring the implementation of proposed arms control treaties."
Mr. Katz was sometimes a critic of American reconnaissance techniques in the cold war, too. Mr. Harris said that in 1964, Mr. Katz "did a study for Walt Rostow, then the special assistant to President Lyndon Johnson for national security," in which Mr. Katz "assessed and summarized Soviet knowledge of U.S. reconnaissance, and he argued that much of what we learned, the Russians wanted us to know; and much of what we didn't learn, they wanted us not to know."
Over the years, Mr. Katz was also quick to discern possible civilian applications of reconnaissance technology -- notably in conserving water, forests and other natural resources and in helping victims of natural disasters.
Besides his son, Mr. Katz is survived by his wife of 56 years, the former Louise Klibanow; two daughters, Barbara Katz of Santa Monica and Deborah Kovar of Canoga Park, Calif.; two brothers, Yale, of Bellingham, Wash., and Matty, of Milwaukee, and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Gov. Wilson Backs Bay Bridge Project

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Gov. Pete Wilson announced his support of a $1.5 billion plan on Thursday to rebuild part of the 61-year-old San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, rather than strengthen it to withstand earthquakes.
Mr. Wilson accepted the California Department of Transportation's recommendation to replace the eastern half of the bridge, a crucial commuter route that carries an average of 280,000 vehicles a day and was damaged when a 50-foot section collapsed in the 1989 earthquake. 
 "It is my belief that in order to best insure the safety of motorists and the economic integrity of the Bay Area and the state, we should proceed with the construction of a new high-tech bridge to replace the aging Bay Bridge," Mr. Wilson said.
He said he had ordered state officials to begin an environmental review for replacing the bridge's eastern span. The new section will link Yerba Buena Island, in the middle of San Francisco Bay, to Oakland. The existing western half of the bridge will remain in place and be strengthened to withstand earthquakes.

Japan Unlikely to Join U.S. In Anti-Missile System
Japan has all but decided against joining the United States in the development of an anti-missile defense project, Clinton Administration officials said. Senior officials said Japan was worried about the costs and about angering its Asian neighbors. The United States will press ahead with its own plan, they added. 3
 
Russia's Army a Catastrophe
On the heels of an appeal by Russia's defense chief for more money for the country's armed forces, a private research group in Moscow warned that the army needs urgent reform if it is not to collapse entirely. The group proposed several immediate options, including reducing the number of soldiers from 1.5 million to under 300,000. 3
 
Health Concerns in Peru
Concerns about the physical and psychological health of the 72 hostages held by Tupac Amaru rebels in Lima led to renewed calls for the Peruvian Government and the rebels to speed up talks. Aid workers laid cables to restore electricity, which had been cut off by the Government in December, so heart-monitoring equipment could be used. 6
 
Prisoner Exchange in Tajikistan
Rebels in Tajikistan began releasing hostages on Friday, easing tension a day after they announced that they had killed a prisoner. Russia's Deputy Prime Minister said he had been told that the reported killing was a bluff and that all the hostages were alive. The Tajik rebels have been holding 14 hostages, including United Nations employees and Russian journalists, and have been seeking the release of about 40 rebel fighters from Afghanistan. 3
 
Harsh Criticisms of Colombia
Stopping just short of predicting that the Clinton Administration would impose sanctions on Colombia for the second year in a row, a senior State Department official criticized the Colombian Government for "cooperating" with drug traffickers. President Clinton is to decide in two weeks whether Colombia should be "certified" as a trustworthy ally in the international fight on drugs. 6
 
Kohl's Future Uncertain
The senior lieutenant of Germany's governing Christian Democratic Union has broken the taboo over discussing whether Chancellor Helmut Kohl would run for a fifth term in national elections next year, inspiring younger members of the party to challenge their leader's policies. With unemployment at its highest rate since 1933 and polls showing the opposition Social Democrats running even with Mr. Kohl's party, the debate seemed likely to grow. 8
 
A Pittance for French Farmer
A farmer lost his three-year fight with the French Government over land surrounding the country's most spectacular prehistoric cave drawings, the state radio France Info said. A court ordered the Government to pay only about $1,750 to the farmer for land owned by his family for six generations in Pont d'Arc, in the Ardeche, a dry, rugged region in south-central France.

Unions Offer to Return
The unions that have been on strike against The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press for 20 months made an unconditional offer to send 2,000 strikers back to work. The unions said the move was made in the hope that a National Labor Relations Board ruling would eventually require the papers to pay back wages for every day they refuse to take the workers back. 9

American Pilots Walk Out; Clinton Orders Them Back
President Clinton intervened moments after midnight to halt a strike by American Airlines pilots that had threatened to disrupt air travel nationwide. The action -- the first such move by a President in an airline strike in 31 years -- will keep American's planes flying for at most 60 days while negotiations continue. Mr. Clinton took the steps after refusing to tip his hand yesterday on whether he would intervene, hoping that the pressure would force the parties to agree. [Page 1.]
 
In an era of weakened labor unions, the pilots are one segment of the American work force that may be stronger than ever. The pilots' dispute represents a rare instance in which a union in the United States holds not only extraordinary power over its employer, but also over much of the country. Pilots at American and other airlines have tried to flex their muscles before, but they have much more in their favor now.
News Analysis. [1.]
 
In the hours before the strike deadline thousands of prospective passengers at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark airports -- as well as at airports around the country -- struggled to make last-minute changes in plans ahead of a holiday weekend. [37.]
 
Canada Seeks Banking Competition
Canada plans to bolster competition in its tightly controlled banking industry by loosening restrictions on foreign banks from the United States and other countries, officials in Ottawa announced. Legislation to be introduced later this year would enable foreign banks to compete more aggressively against Canada's six large national banks in making loans, doing corporate business and offering consumer services like credit cards. [38.]
 
Shift in Detroit Newspaper Strike
Striking unions at Detroit's two newspapers -- The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News -- planned to make an unconditional offer to send 2,000 striking employees back to work after 20 months on strike. The union said it made the move in the hope of getting back pay for the workers. The newspapers said the offer constituted an end to the strike. [9.]
 
Huge Paper Company Merger
Abitibi-Price and the Stone-Consolidated Corporation said that they would merge in a transaction valued at about $1.7 billion, creating the world's largest maker of newsprint. Paper companies have been consolidating as they struggle to overcome lower prices, overcapacity and a limited number of newsprint buyers. Combined, the two Canadian companies would have annual sales of $3.6 billion, and about 8 percent of the global newsprint market. [49.]
 
Stocks End Week With a Whimper
The euphoria that swept Wall Street into a new millennium this week ended not in a bang, but with a whimper. After gaining 574 points, or 8.9 percent, in just seven weeks, and reaching the 7,000 milestone on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average slumped, closing down 33.48 points, to 6,988.96. For the week, the Dow rose 133.16. [36.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities forged ahead on good economic news, but further gains were stymied by profit taking in a shortened trading session ahead of the long Washington's Birthday weekend. The yield on the newly issued 30-year bond fell to 6.53 percent, down from 6.62 percent on Thursday and down 17 basis points from the week before. [36.]
 
Dollar Closes Mixed
The dollar was mixed, touching a four-year high against the yen and 34-month high vs. the mark on benign inflation news, the ebullient stock market in the United States and more economic weakness in Germany. [48.]
 
Coffee Prices Retreat
Coffee futures prices retreated for the first time in a week on concern that production in Brazil, the world's biggest producer, would be higher than has been expected. [48.]

HEADLINE: School Budget Is Attacked As Inadequate

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Many governors and President Clinton have pushed ambitious new education programs recently, but Gov. John G. Rowland took a different tack in the budget he presented on Thursday. He did not raise spending on state schools, he trimmed the budget for higher education and he offered a small spending increase for one of the most pressing educational issues facing the state.
Faced with an order from the State Supreme Court to desegregate and improve state schools, Mr. Rowland, a Republican, responded with $37 million in new spending. It was one of the few increases in his two-year, $20.5 billion budget proposal. 
 Today, educators, legislators and representatives of the families who brought the initial case, Sheff v. O'Neill, criticized the proposal, saying that it was too little to accomplish the monumental task at hand.
"This is rhetoric without any action," said John Brittain, a civil rights lawyer who represented the 17 families from the Hartford area that had sued the state in the Sheff case. "This is like a hamburger without any meat."
Mr. Rowland and his supporters defend his budget proposal on this issue as an important first step, but it reveals differences between him and his fellow Republican Governors in New York and New Jersey.
While Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Gov. George E. Pataki highlighted increases in education spending in their budget proposals, as did Mr. Clinton, Mr. Rowland's budget has drawn attention for the absence of such initiatives.
Among the proposals drawing fire are these:
*State aid to public schools remained the same, even though enrollment is increasing by about 2 percent a year.
*Higher education would receive a 10 percent across-the-board spending cut.
*State aid for special education would be reduced to $30.4 million next year, about $2 million less than what is projected this year.
In contrast, Governor Whitman, also at the behest of a court order, recently approved a $286 million school financing plan, in addition to a $5 billion education budget.
Last month, Governor Pataki proposed a $309 million increase in state school aid, now $10.2 billion a year.
President Clinton's budget address included items like a large increase in school construction aid, universal access to community college education and an expansion in early childhood education.
At a news conference this afternoon, the President pro tem of the State Senate, Kevin B. Sullivan, a Democrat, said Mr. Pataki and Mrs. Whitman had taken "dramatic new steps" on education.
"We just don't see the same vision," Mr. Sullivan said. "We just don't see the same direction."
But Dean Pagani, Mr. Rowland's spokesman, disagreed.
"The economic situation in Connecticut isn't the same as in New York and New Jersey," he said.
The State Education Commissioner, Theodore S. Sergi, also defended Mr. Rowland's proposal to deal with the Sheff decision, saying it represented a promising start.
Mr. Rowland's proposal features $6 million next year to expand access to early childhood education in Hartford, Bridgeport and New Haven; $1 million to support reading instruction in urban school districts; $5 million to support a voluntary busing program, and $3 million more for summer and weekend programs that draw children from a variety of school districts.

HEADLINE: New Questions On Investments For a Nominee

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
In a new set of questions about the nomination of Alexis Herman as Secretary of Labor, a Senate committee is examining why she received an ownership interest now worth as much as $500,000 in a real-estate development here without investing any money, Government officials said today.
Ms. Herman was given an interest in the $200 million project on Pennsylvania Avenue in the mid-1980's when she ran a consulting business that worked to insure minority participation in that project and in other such ventures. 
 People involved in the deal said Ms. Herman, who is now a White House aide, was one of three minority business owners who received small interests in the project in what they described as a fairly typical effort to meet Federal affirmative-action goals.
Ms. Herman was not a Government official then, and it was legal for her to accept part ownership in the project. But Senate Republicans are looking broadly at whether Ms. Herman, who was involved in the Democratic Party for a long time, ever blended her political activities with either her business dealings or her role at the White House, where she has directed the Office of Public Liaison since 1993. The office typically directs efforts to build grass-roots support for President Clinton's social and economic policies.
The questions about the real-estate deal have added to the troubles facing Ms. Herman's nomination, which has become caught in the furor over fund-raising practices in Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign.
In another development, the White House acknowledged today that one of Ms. Herman's deputies, Doris O. Matsui, went too far in sharing an official Government list of more than 350 Asian-American leaders with Democratic Party strategists and fund-raisers early last year.
"We would say that this probably shouldn't have been done," said the White House special counsel, Lanny J. Davis.
Mr. Davis and other White House officials insist that Ms. Herman, who was a political appointee at the Labor Department in President Jimmy Carter's Administration and the chief of staff of the Democratic National Committee from 1989 to 1991, has done nothing improper in either her business dealings or her work at the White House. White House officials said they still expect her to win confirmation to succeed Robert Reich as Labor Secretary.
The Senate Labor Committee has held off scheduling hearings on the nomination, however. The Office of Special Counsel, an independent Federal agency, also is examining whether Ms. Herman or her White House assistants engaged in improper political activities in helping the Democratic Party reach out to ethnic voters last year.
White House officials said the Senate Committee recently asked for information about Ms. Herman's involvement in the Pennsylvania Avenue redevelopment project, a huge office, retail and residential complex known as Market Square. The main developer, Herbert S. Miller, had close ties to the District of Columbia Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., and one of the minority partners ran a public relations company that employed Effi Barry, the Mayor's wife then.
One question on Capitol Hill is whether Ms. Herman was included in the project to take advantage of any ties she had to local or Federal Democratic officials.
Ms. Herman has declined to grant interviews while her nomination is pending. But a White House spokesman, Joseph Lockhart, said Ms. Herman did no lobbying on the Market Square project. Henry A. Berliner Jr., an appointee of President Ronald Reagan who was chairman of a Federal corporation that oversaw the choice of the developer, also said she played no role in that decision.
Inviting members of minority groups to join such projects at little or no cost to meet affirmative-action goals "was pretty common in any program at that time that involved the Federal Government," Mr. Berliner said. Mr. Lockhart said Ms. Herman got involved in the Market Square project in 1984 through a friend, Robert Mendelsohn, who was working with Mr. Miller.
Mr. Mendelsohn helped Ms. Herman's consulting firm, A. M. Herman & Associates, win a $205,000 contract to oversee the hiring of minority workers and contractors at Market Square, Mr. Lockhart said.
She and the two other minority partners later were each given a 3 1/3 percent interest in a limited partnership involved in the deal. Several other people also received interests in that partnership without putting up cash, Mr. Lockhart said, but there were two significant differences. Most of the others had either invested money in the project in other ways or were employees of Mr. Miller who took the interests as part of their compensation. And the minority partners were not subject to any calls to put up cash if it was needed, as the other limited partners were.
One result was that the minority partners initially were not eligible to share fully in any income from the project. When Mr. Miller decided to sell 70 percent of the project in 1987, Ms. Herman and the other minority partners each received $50,000, or one-fifth of what others holding the same interest earned.
Since then, the restrictions have been eased, Mr. Lockhart said. And although Ms. Herman has never had to invest any money in the project, the value of her remaining holding of about 1 percent has risen to possibly as much as $500,000.
Ms. Herman has listed her interest in the project on Government financial-disclosure forms since 1993 and estimated it was worth at least that much. But she was not required on the forms to give details of how she acquired the interest.
Mr. Lockhart said this was the only such project in which Ms. Herman ever received part ownership. But Ms. Herman's consulting firm also won a $500,000 contract in 1989 to create and monitor affirmative-action plans for the construction at the Government's new $1 billion Ronald Reagan Building here.
The financial-disclosure records show that in the early 1990's, Ms. Herman's company did consulting work on diversity issues for Burger King, Procter & Gamble and Levi Strauss. She sold the company after she took the White House job in 1993.
Ms. Herman's nomination ran into problems last month, when the White House disclosed that one of her assistants had invited a top banking regulator to meet with Mr. Clinton and some of the nation's most powerful bankers at a coffee sponsored by the Democratic Party. White House officials have said Ms. Herman's office was involved in setting up the coffee because of a miscommunication about the nature of the event.
Mr. Miller, the developer who put together the Market Square project and still holds an interest in it, also attended one of the White House coffees last year, and he donated $50,000 to the D.N.C. three weeks later. Mr. Lockhart said Ms. Herman did not know that Mr. Miller was at the coffee. Mr. Miller, who has long contributed to Democratic candidates, was unavailable for comment.
White House officials said that Ms. Matsui, a deputy to Ms. Herman at the White House Liaison Office, and others, including John Huang, the former Democratic fund-raiser who is under Federal investigation, used the list of Asian-Americans compiled by the office in providing Mr. Clinton's campaign with names of people who might want to help it court Asian-American voters.
The 20-page document contained the names of Asian-American civic, political and business leaders in 12 cities, and it was included in the files of Mr. Huang released by the Democratic National Committee. But Mr. Huang does not appear to have used it in his fund-raising.

HEADLINE: DISPUTE AT AMERICAN AIRLINES: THE UNION;
A Showdown Forced by the Power of a Union

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Saturday, Feb. 15

 BODY:
The pilots' dispute at American Airlines represents a rare instance in which a union in the United States holds not only extraordinary power over its employer, but also over much of the country.
So much so, in fact, that President Clinton intervened immediately after the pilots called their strike to keep the airline flying and avoid the turmoil that would have been caused by a grounding of the nation's second-largest airline. 
 In an era of weakened labor unions, the pilots are one segment of the work force that may be stronger than ever.
Pilots at American and other airlines have tried to flex their muscles before, but they have much more in their favor now. Airlines are generating record profits, meaning greater job security for pilots. That is a sharp contrast to many previous airline pilot disputes in which the threat of bankruptcy or layoffs tipped power in favor of the airlines.
Now, the balance of power is tipped against the airlines. Because pilots cannot be readily replaced, they can instantly shut down the airline, costing the company millions of dollars a day. Although American's healthy profits of late have helped fortify the carrier's war chest to survive a strike -- it has $3 billion in cash and credit available -- the company also faced the prospect of running up losses quickly.
"This dispute has been about raw leverage, and pilots are probably in a stronger position than any pilot group has been since deregulation of the industry," said Daniel M. Kasper, an aviation consultant and member of a 1993 Presidential commission to study the industry.
The pilots have also gained more leverage as a result of broad shifts in the way airlines divide up the country. Since deregulation of the industry in 1978, airlines have set up hub operations in major cities, helping the carriers gain advantages over competitors in key markets and enabling them to exercise greater control over their prices.
Increasingly, airlines like American have come to dominate major airports, controlling as much as 90 percent of the flights through key cities. American's strongholds include Dallas and Miami, where it controls about two-thirds of the flights, and to a lesser degree Chicago, where it competes against United Airlines for most of the air traffic. So when pilots threaten a strike, tourism and other industries in some cities are severely affected. That can build pressure on the airline to make concessions to the pilots.
The Transportation Department, for example, has estimated that a strike would have cost the country $200 million a day and leave 40,000 passengers stranded over the Washington's Birthday holiday weekend.
But the pilots' immense leverage has worked against them, too. With so many people affected, pressure built on governors, members of Congress and the Clinton Administration to step in to avert a strike. Such intervention did not help the pilots' cause of getting raises and other concessions, which are best extracted during a strike or just before one.
During a news conference yesterday, James G. Sovich, president of the pilots' union, said he did not want President Clinton to intervene. The reason was perhaps best detailed in a letter Mr. Sovich mailed to pilots' union members on Monday. "As I have told you before," the letter read, "plan on at least a 30-day strike. Only the absolute belief by management that such a devastating threat is not only present, but also that it will be utilized, may make AMR come to reason."
The two sides, which still have to settle their differences, represent opposing views on questions being posed by employees at many companies now benefiting from a healthy economy: How much should employees share in the profits? And should employees be viewed strictly as a cost of doing business or rather as equal partners with management?
According to the most recently publicized proposals from the two sides before the strike was announced, the pilots said they wanted an 11 percent raise over the next four years while the airline offered a 5 percent raise over the next three years. They have also been quarreling over how much in stock options the pilots should receive.
Donald J. Carty, American's president, said in a news conference shortly after Mr. Clinton averted a strike that the dispute centered on economic issues, rather than issues of job security.
With their average salary of $120,000, pilots at American, and other major airlines, are on an economic par with many managers at the company. And because pilots cannot transfer their skills to other professions -- or transfer to other airlines without losing seniority -- they have long been intensely interested in company affairs.
In the current dispute, the union has sought to sway the airline on a key strategic issue of whether the main airline or its commuter subsidiary, American Eagle, should fly smaller jets that American wants to acquire. The Allied Pilots Association, which represents pilots only at American, says its members should fly the jets. They worry that their jobs will be threatened if the jets are flown by the pilots at American Eagle, who have a different union.
The dispute between American and its pilots has been governed by strong emotions as much as debates over strategy. Although there is widespread dissension within the ranks and within leadership of the Allied Pilots Association, the union has tried to build unity by portraying Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of American and its parent company, the AMR Corporation, as a boss who is greedy.
In the pilots' union magazine, Mr. Crandall has been caricatured in a cartoon as running a staff meeting in which he urges his lieutenants to get concessions from the pilots so that he can enrich himself.
Mr. Crandall has stayed clear of direct negotiations with the pilots, clearly recognizing that his public image would be of no help. He sent the airline's president, Donald J. Carty, to Washington last fall to reach a tentative agreement with the union's leadership. Mr. Carty was successful, but members of the union voted against the agreement. Mr. Carty has also led negotiations for American this week in Washington.
Although Mr. Crandall was in Washington Thursday, and publicly asked President Clinton to intervene to avoid the strike, a spokesman for American said that Mr. Crandall remained at company headquarters in Dallas on Friday.

HEADLINE: DISPUTE AT AMERICAN AIRLINES: THE OVERVIEW;
AMERICAN AIRLINE PILOTS STRIKE BUT CLINTON ORDERS THEM BACK

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Saturday, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Invoking seldom-used emergency powers, President Clinton intervened today minutes after midnight to halt a strike by American Airlines pilots that had threatened to disrupt air travel nationwide.
The action -- the first such move by a President in an airline strike in 31 years -- will keep American's planes flying for up to 60 days, while a specially convened board develops a proposed agreement and the two parties consider it. In taking the action, Mr. Clinton said he hoped to avert "severe disruption to both domestic and international air transportation." 
 "I was also particularly concerned that a strike would be especially disruptive over a holiday weekend, when hundreds of thousands of citizens rely on our air transit system," Mr. Clinton said.
He called on the two parties to "redouble their efforts to reach an agreement; they owe that to each other and to the traveling public."
Just after midnight, James Sovich, the president of the Allied Pilots Association, addressed his members and their families via a satellite system, informing them: "We have no alternative but to exercise our right to call a strike."
Mr. Sovich said: "We have no other method of demonstrating to management that we are resolute in our commitment to receiving a fair and equitable contract agreement."
The pilots called the strike after their board rejected a last proposal from Federal mediators.
But the White House reacted almost instantly. Bruce Lindsey, the deputy counsel, rushed to the residence to obtain the President's signature on orders invoking powers Mr. Clinton has under the 1926 Railway Labor Act.
The President named a three-member panel to recommend a non-binding resolution of the dispute. The panel has 30 days to devise recommendations and the parties have another 30 days to consider them, with no work stoppage in the meantime.
By intervening, President Clinton ignored objections from the 9,000-member pilots union, which wascounting on the leverage of a strike to secure a better contract. But, had he not intervened, the tens of thousands of travelers who would have been stranded or at least inconvenienced by the strike may well have wondered why not.
Mr. Clinton took the steps after a day spent hanging back, refusing to tip his hand on Friday on whether he would intervene in hopes that the pressure of the deadline would force the parties to agree. But the airline and representatives of its pilots were unable to resolve differences over wages and whether lesser-paid pilots should be permitted to fly American's smaller, commuter jets.
Mr. Clinton named Robert O. Harris to be chairman of the three-member mediation panel. Mr. Harris, a former chairman of the National Mediation Board, previously served as chairman of a board convened by Congress to resolve the railroad labor dispute of 1981. The President also appointed Anthony V. Sinicropi, a professor emeritus of the University of Iowa and a former president of the National Academy of Arbitrators. The third member is Helen Witt, a former member of the Federal Mediation and Consultation Service.
The union emphasized that the President's action may only postpone a strike. "We may have to do this one more time," Mr. Sovich said early this morning.
Since American carries roughly 20 percent of the nation's air travelers -- and is a dominant airline in cities like Miami, Dallas, and Chicago -- a strike would have stranded travelers nationwide. While American's other unions are opposed to the pilots' efforts, the company said would not operate if its 9,000 pilots struck.
The Transpotation Department had estimated that 40,000 travelers would be stranded by a strike this weekend, and that it would ripple through the economy, costing as much as $200 million a day.
The airline was clearly delighted with the President's action. "If there's any silvery lining to the cloud," said Donald Carty, the president of American Airlines, after Mr. Clinton intervened, "the airline is operating. And we're delighted that it's operating."
But there was less enthusiasm among the pilots.
At Kennedy International Airport in Queens, Chet Smith, a 41-year-old captain, said he was "less than thrilled by the President's action."
Even before the pilots' union called their strike, the threat of such action disrupted air travel on Friday. In Miami, many grumbling passengers had given up on finding flights to Latin America and the Caribbean. With some American flights canceled and others filled, and no other airlines flying along some routes, some passengers threw up their hands and went home.
In other airports, travelers groaned about flights canceled, or they shifted to roundabout connections in places they never wanted to visit. Some wondered whether they would be able to get back from where they were going, while others scrambled for more expensive seats on other airlines.
Al Light, a 44-year-old logistics inspector, found himself stuck in Chicago Friday night without a flight home to Harrisburg, Pa. "They announced on the loudspeaker that the pilot had walked off the plane," he said. "Now I'm going to miss my plane, which means I'll miss seeing my wife on Valentine's Day."
Mr. Sovich, the union president, said on Friday that the union would comply and keep flying if Mr. Clinton chose to invoke his authority under the Railway Labor Act. But he urged that the President not do so.
"We prefer that the President not interject himself in this dispute," Mr. Sovich said.
In publicly describing -- and simultaneously trying to influence -- the state of the negotiations, both sides sounded pessimistic late Friday.
Calling the negotiations "slow and difficult," Mr. Sovich said, "We have made significant progress on insignificant issues." He did not elaborate.
Christopher Chiames, a spokesman for the airline, said: "Progress is coming, but it's coming slowly. But this is part of the give and take of negotiations. We have nothing to report as far as agreements."
The two sides have been far apart on issues of wages and staffing. AMR, the parent of American, is hoping to use small 50-seat jets in its American Eagle subsidiary to carry commuters. But the pilots' union fears that the company wants to use those jets, with lower-paid pilots, to take routes away from them. The union submitted a new, detailed eight-page proposal Thursday night for having its members also pilot those smaller planes.
With the prospect of thousands of stranded, angry passengers looking for someone to blame, the White House was at pains on Friday to try to deflect attention and pressure to the negotiators themselves. Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, peppered with questions about Mr. Clinton's intentions at his daily briefing, finally said he would not rule Presidential action out or in.
"I'm putting the focus where it properly should be, on the negotiation itself," he said. "It should not be here."
A senior White House official said Friday night that the Administration had discovered that its slightest word affected the talks. Even a simple remark from Mr. Clinton at midday on Friday -- "I'm going to have a meeting on this later this afternoon to get an update, and then I think I should make myself available for questions after I see where we are in a couple hours" -- had an impact when the Cable News Network reported it.
"That instantly got misread and mistranslated inside the room, and basically froze things" until the White House could clear up its intentions to do nothing this afternoon, the official said. He said the White House felt "a reluctance to intervene in the labor market until you absolutely have to."
That is consistent with Mr. Clinton's past practice, although he has sometimes indulged in more jawboning and arm-twisting than he has employed in this dispute. On the eve of Thanksgiving in 1993, Mr. Clinton informally intervened in a five-day-old strike by flight attendants against American, persuading the parties to submit to binding arbitration.
This dispute seemed to sneak up not only on the White House, but also on the airline industry, where profits have been high and the labor force stable, and on American itself. Until last month, the pilots' grumbling over the commuter flights' issue was seen as source of minor, background tension.
In November, the leaders of the pilots' union reached an agreement that called for a 5 percent wage increase over four years and that options to acquire 5.75 million shares of the airline be distributed to the pilots. On average, American's pilots make $120,000 a year -- a pay scale that may equip them to survive a strike but has not encouraged lesser-paid colleagues at American to rally to their cause.
That agreement fell apart after the union rank and file voted it down in January. Last week, the pilots requested an 11 percent raise over four years and options for 7.25 million shares. They also insisted that members of their union fly all of American's jets.
The airline responded that such an agreement would raise its costs so high that it could not compete.
In addition to grappling with management, leaders of the pilots' union have had to face grumbling in their own ranks, with some pilots openly wishing for a second chance to vote on the first contract proposal and threatening to sue those who had helped torpedo it.
"I don't think it's unusual, as we approach the unknown, that there's fear," Mr. Sovich said on Friday.

HEADLINE: Detroit Newspaper Unions Offer to Go Back to Work

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
The striking Detroit newspaper unions announced yesterday that they would make an unconditional offer to send 2,000 employees of The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press back to work after 20 months off the job.
The move was taken, the unions said, in hopes that a National Labor Relations Board complaint against the newspapers would eventually require the papers to pay back wages for every day from this point that they refuse to take the workers back. 
 Although the offer suggests an end to the strike -- and although the papers' management considers it so -- the president of the Detroit Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions insisted that the strike was still on. The official, Al Derey, a Detroit teamsters leader, said that picketing would continue and that the unions would expand their efforts to discourage advertisers in publications owned by the Knight-Ridder Corporation, which owns The Free Press, and the Gannett Corporation, which owns The News.
"This is a bold new strategy to take our jobs back," Mr. Derey said. "If they do not accept this offer, then we will be going to court."
One of the six unions on strike still has to vote on the offer. A return to work by the Newspaper Guild members will require a binding vote, which has been scheduled for Sunday.
Detroit Newspapers Inc., the business and management agency for the two papers, said the unions' offer constituted the end of the strike, and management officials urged the unions to drop any ideas of continuing to bring economic pressure on the papers.
"We have heard from three of the unions who have indicated to us that they are sending us unconditional offers, and at that point, our position is that the strike is over," said Tim Kelleher, senior vice president for labor relations at Detroit Newspapers.
Mr. Kelleher repeated management's long-held view that some 1,300 replacement workers who had crossed picket lines to keep the papers publishing would not be fired to make room for returning strikers. Former strikers, he said, would be taken on as jobs opened up.
"People who are interested in coming back to work should get their names on a preferential hiring list, and we'll get them their jobs back as they become available," Mr. Kelleher said. "The idea of continuing advertising boycotts and everything else is counterproductive. The way to get people back to work is to improve sales and improve the business."
Whatever new pressure yesterday's decision by the unions puts on the employers, it also represents an acknowledgment by the unions that the country's longest active newspaper strike had failed to stop publishers' efforts at newspapers across the country to trim jobs made redundant by new technology and to streamline work rules.
Mr. Derey conceded as much yesterday when, in a statement, he said a new strategy was needed "because the current strategy has not achieved our final goal."
The six unions, including the typographers local, teamsters and Newspaper Guild, called 2,500 employees of the two papers onto the streets on July 13, 1995, after Detroit Newspapers refused to yield on plans to buy out several hundred union jobs and to reorganize the papers' distribution system.
The strikers published a successful weekly paper, The Detroit Sunday Journal, that drew advertisers away from the big dailies, discouraged readers from buying the struck papers and forced losses totaling more than $100 million last year alone. Combined daily circulation at the two papers fell to 600,000 from 900,000 before the strike.
Operating with a streamlined non-union work force, the papers reduced their losses month by month, however, and management has predicted that they would begin to turn a profit in the spring.
Throughout the strike, the unions had appealed to the stirring history of militant labor in Detroit, where, years ago, auto workers fought pitched battles to win recognition. But times and technology have changed, allowing newspapers to publish even during a strike, said Ben Burns, a professor of journalism at Wayne State University in Detroit and a former executive editor of The News.
"The issues here were the same at a lot of papers, where management was trying to get rid of featherbedding and a lot of people working at jobs that weren't really jobs," Mr. Burns said. "I think the strikers got whipped up in the romance of Detroit and trade unionism, and thought that what was true decades ago was still true today."
The strikers' best hopes now appear to lie with Thomas Wilks, an administrative law judge with the labor board in Washington. Last month he concluded hearings on a charge from the Detroit office of the labor board that Detroit Newspapers had engaged in unfair labor practices during negotiations leading up to the strike.
If Judge Wilks affirms the charge, and the unions continue to win on appeal, then the strikers will be entitled to back pay for each day the companies deny them their old jobs back -- jobs that management has said no longer exist in any large numbers.
"If the employers stick to that, they in a sense act at their peril," said Stephen M. Glasser, assistant to the regional director of the Detroit office of the labor board. "The judge's decision is appealable and it can go through the courts, and if ultimately some authority holds that this was an unfair labor strike, then that cash register has been ringing all along for the employers."
Mr. Derey estimated that Detroit Newspapers would be liable for $250,000 for every day it was found to have denied the strikers their old jobs.
About half of the reporters and editors who walked off the job eventually returned to work at the struck papers, and many others have found work at publications elsewhere. Less fortunate have been the blue-collar drivers, bundlers and laborers who had depended on the jobs eliminated by the changes in the distribution process. Some of those workers attended a rally at The Detroit Sunday Journal yesterday, condemning the back-to-work decision and calling for the strike to continue.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 20, 1997, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a union offer to end the Detroit newspaper strike misstated the papers' financial condition. The management says that they have been profitable since the fourth quarter of 1996, not that they are expected to be profitable beginning in the spring.

HEADLINE: Where Wildlife Meets Wild Surf

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE; WARREN HOGE is chief of the London bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
FACED with the multitudinous life choices that confront a child growing up in New York City, my son on turning 13 settled on his. He wanted to be a surfer.
My wife and I found ourselves living in the only apartment on our mid-Manhattan block where the wave heights at Pipeline and Waikiki were tracked (800 numbers to Honolulu surf shops) and where the morning greeting was "barrel and tube," the mantra of surfers describing the dreamed-of shape of a breaker. The challenge was how to accommodate this obsession of my son's along with my hope of devoting the family summer vacation to rain-forest exploration. We found a harmonious solution on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. 
 The country has some of the largest untouched primary forests in the world and a government and population with a commitment to protecting them unequaled in Latin America. Costa Rica also figures in globe-trotting films modeled after "The Endless Summer" -- we had a large collection in our East Side apartment -- as one of the far-flung places on the planet where surf pilgrims go in pursuit of the perfect wave.
We decided on two spots, one at the tip of the remote Osa Peninsula in the south and the other on the busier coast of Guanacaste Province in the north. I had last seen the northern part of Costa Rica in 1979 where, as a correspondent, I had covered the bloody ending of the war between the forces of Anastasio Somoza and the Sandinista rebels across the border in southern Nicaragua. I pledged back then to return someday to focus on the peaceful beauty of Guanacaste's savannahs and seashore, its spreadtrees and grazing white brahma cattle.
Fought over in the 19th century by Nicaragua and Costa Rica, Guanacaste has been a conflicted part of the country in recent times. It served as a staging area for the Sandinista rebels in the 1970's, and in the 1980's it became the site of secret airstrips and supply centers for the contras who sought to oust the victorious Sandinistas from Managua.
Osa, on the other hand, had always been cut off from the world and even from the rest of Costa Rica. A dirt road linking the peninsula to the mainland was completed only in 1986.
Our group was my wife, Olivia; my son, Nicholas, the soi-disant surfer; his schoolmate Wyndham Boylan-Garnett; Wyndham's mother, Nuala Boylan, and myself. We flew to San Jose in August, where we overnighted at the Gran Hotel Costa Rica, a raffish downtown hotel with an open colonnaded restaurant looking out on the city's busiest square, where we reporters had put up in 1979.
Bordered by the Teatro Nacional, a tropical knockoff of the Paris Opera House, the square is called the Plaza de la Cultura. But not all of its denizens are opera buffs. One of them that Saturday night stole a bag with all of my family's passports, travel vouchers and credit cards.
After some hurried phone calls to start the process of getting passports replaced, credit cards canceled and copies of travel documents faxed, we set out the next day on a five-hour drive to Tamarindo, a beach community in Guanacaste famous for its waves. Our car was a rented Hyundai Galloper Exceed V6 Wagon, the kind of sturdy, four-wheel-drive vehicle recommended for the unmarked, muddy and often deeply rutted roads along the coast. The radio brought in hearty salsa, good traveling music.
If you need writing paper in Tamarindo, all you'll find is a notepad of sheets made from banana-leaf fibers. The shampoo on sale is biodegradable and carries a label, itself made of recycled paper, that assures that no animals were mistreated in the manufacture of the contents. The shorefront Hotel Las Tortugas was built with no ocean views to the south because light can distract giant leatherback turtles that use the beach there to lay their eggs.
The same hotel is headquarters to surfers who consider the beach there, Playa Grande, the finest venue in the area and many of whom also share the concern for nature. It was there that I had to abandon my East Coast notion of surfers as sun-addled, tattooed, monosyllabic layabouts. We had almost as much fun learning about their customs as we did finding out about the habits of rain-forest creatures.
Surfers are up early in the morning, and from some source somewhere the word goes out that a particular shore site is "going off" or "firing." It may be a "right" or a "left," a beach break, a point break or a reef break, the ideal time can be high tide or low tide or some point in between, the waves can be shoulder-high, head-high, overhead, double-overhead or Hawaiian-sized, the wind may be off-shore ("epic") or on-shore ("bummer") -- regardless, it's where the Jeeps with boards on their roofs and men and women in bathing suits at the wheel head as they rattle expectantly out of town, kicking up clouds of dust.
Once there, the surfers gather on the sand in motionless groups of statuary composition, silently studying the swell, the winds and the sets of large waves that come rolling in every five minutes or so. Another unuttered signal goes out, and the surfers grab their boards and plunge in.
At Playa Grande, around the bay from Tamarindo, Nick and Wyndham saw what they had been missing on Long Island. Long waves began on one side of the widely curved beach and peeled across the horizon, curling cleanly and showing nothing but a shimmering smooth surface to the morning sun until disappearing into frenzies of foam on the other side.
The boys were intimidated by the wave heights at first, but enchantment and exhilaration overcame their initial fear, and they soon were riding across the glassy wave faces. The boards they used -- known as body boards or boogie boards -- are ridden in a prone position. You are supposed to grasp the front with one hand and the side with the other, raise your chest and stare off into space uninterestedly, like a dog ornament on the hood of a pricey limousine. It's a look of arrogance and defiance, and the boys, both New Yorkers, got that part just right.
We adults, used to East Coast beaches, found the surf to be challenging but manageable. Because the waves break in expected patterns with little whitewater commotion, I found them ideal for body surfing. And there was the keen pleasure of looking back and seeing only mangrove forests, palms and banyans bursting explosively from their midst, and distant gray-green mountains with clouds lounging in the valleys.
Every time we wandered off into those forests, we got a lesson in the abundance of life that inhabits tropical shorelines. The microscopic organisms that the ocean washes over its reefs, rock and beaches feed a voluminous array of tiny creatures that in concert with plants support a vast community of crabs, snails, shrimps, iguanas, squirrels, egrets, herons and other creatures.
We were particularly intrigued by hermit crabs and the delicate orange-legged, purple-shelled crabs who make the land itself seem animate as they skitter by the thousands into their forest burrows at the approach of an intruder. Each April, these crabs make spectacular migrations to the sea to breed, with each female releasing tens of thousands of eggs, which become larvae drifting in the waves until six weeks later, when they all march inland and begin the cycle again.
WE stayed in the Tamarindo Diria, an unassuming beachfront hotel with carefully tended grounds and bungalow rooms looking out onto the Pacific. In the evening, we dined at the seaside restaurants and bars in the village, eating coriander-laced ceviche and grilled lobsters, grouper, snapper, sea bass and mahi-mahi, accompanied by rice and beans and washed down with local beer or Concha y Toro, the old reliable Chilean white. The boys drank banana con leche and rumless pina coladas. The owner of La Fiesta del Mar delighted us one night by rushing back to our table after we had ordered fish to say that a fresh supply of shrimp had just been delivered. They arrived at our table still kicking.
For high-end pleasure, we loved the food and atmosphere at the stylish Capitan Suizo. For low-end, we liked the funky Noguis Bar. Each evening we strolled back along the dirt road leading to our hotel past a pond that came alive in darkness with frogs, producing a symphony of guttural sounds with a numbing repetitiveness that would shame the most obdurate minimalist composer.
At week's end we drove back to San Jose, gave up our vehicle and caught our flight to Puerto Jimenez, the only town on the Osa Peninsula. Waiting for us by the gravel airstrip was Jonathan Seidman, a 27-year-old forestry and conservation graduate of Kent State University who has worked there as guide for five years, with whom we had made arrangements five months earlier.
He drove us into town, a laid-back frontier outpost with a soccer field, a boat dock and the only block of paved road on the entire peninsula. We bought flashlights and simple knee-high rubber boots for the rain-forest treks, then drove out along the coast of the Golfo Dulce and up muddy roads to our lodge, Bosque del Cabo.
Bosque sits in a privileged location, 500 forested feet above the Pacific. Its seven thatched-roof bungalows have porches that look out over the ocean. The beds are covered in mosquito netting, but it's a largely decorative touch. At that height, the nights are breezy and bug-free. Once a cattle pasture, the land has been gracefully landscaped with profusions of brightly colored gingers and heliconias lining the pathways from the individual lodgings to the one communal space, a dining area open to the sides.
The only contact with the outside world is by radio phone, and there is electricity only in the kitchen. Night falls early in Costa Rica in the summer, usually about 6 P.M., and from that hour on, Bosque lives by candlelight. The hiking during the day is very physical. You are apt to feel total bone fatigue and find yourself nodding off by 8 P.M. I loved the idea of reading by the light of a flickering flame in the midst of a forest, but each night I was good for only a couple of pages.
Our purpose in going to Bosque was to live in, feel and try to understand some of the complexities of the tropical rain forest, and Jon wasted no time getting us on the trail. Many times it wasn't a trail at all, but a slurry of leaves and mud and rocks, and the inclines and descents were steep. Within minutes of leaving Bosque our first afternoon, Jon announced that we were in primary forest, undeveloped, undisturbed, its reproductive cycles intact and humming.
We found ourselves at the base of immense trees, some rising 180 feet above the forest floor, closing out all but about 10 percent of the light shining down on the canopy. The sight induced a feeling of wonder and reverence. The great cathedral-like space captured the forest's mists and held them in the shards of sunlight, like fine particles of dust that hang suspended in the streaks of light shining through stained-glass windows in great naves.
The profound silence was a quietness that throbbed with activity as Jon pointed out all the life going on around us -- hummingbirds pollinating the voluptuous orange and red heliconia plants, cowtrees (so called because when cut with a knife they secrete a digestive latex), larvae of frogs and tadpoles in tightly joined leaf bases where water had collected, earnest parades of leaf-cutting ants carrying their immense burdens from trees to anthills, golden silk orb-weavers spinning perfectly symmetrical lace patterns, mimosa leaves that fold in on themselves protectively on being touched, strangler-fig vines reducing the tree they have encircled to a home for ants, moths and bats, Indian desnudio trees that continually shed their bark so that parasitic plants can't take up lodging, woodpeckers tapping away in pursuit of termites.
During our treks, giant frigate birds with their wingspans of more than six feet wheeled into view overhead. Lovely little immaculate antbirds called out to one another in sweet bell tones, laughing falcons guffawed and, in the forest counterpart to hoisting the cocktail flag, parrots, the most social of birds, gathered in flocks at day's end and raised a happy ruckus.
There are four kinds of monkeys in this part of the rain forest -- squirrel, spider, white-faced capuchin and howler -- and we saw them all. The howlers put up a sonorous groan, using their formidable sound equipment and then amplifying it with a bellows-like movement of their jowls. The spiders chatter excitedly and perform spectacular acrobatics in the trees. All of them get irritated at the presence of someone else. They shake their fist at you. They also shake tree limbs and have been known to throw things at people, ranging from fruit pits to their own feces.
We swam in waterfalls and splashed in pools in reef formations on the beach that emerge as the tide ebbs, producing a whirlpool-bath effect. We walked on beaches where the only signs of human life were our own footprints, and we hiked the forest paths in the midst of thunderstorms and marveled at how little rain fell on us.
ONE morning we were accompanied by a dazzling blue morpho butterfly that sashayed with the studied insouciance of a boulevardier showing off his chic. These were not the only popinjays out that day. Toucans and fiery-billed aracaris posed on three limbs proudly showing their golden-beaked profiles, and scarlet macaws flew by, shrieking and flashing their red plumage.
One afternoon Jon spotted a hugely feathered brown and black bird on a low tree limb. It was a giant curassow, a sight so rare that Jon demanded we take his picture with it so that his friends would believe he had really seen one.
Detached from the world, deep into the mysteries of nature in the raw, we grew to feel the kind of out-of-office sensation the best vacations deliver. But the real test of that phenomenon came when we were joined in the lodge by a Hollywood producer, Brian Grazer, whose film, "The Nutty Professor," had recently been released. He hiked and surfed and watched rosy sunsets behind thunderheads on the Pacific horizon from his porch hammock like the rest of us. Three days passed. But on the fourth day he sent someone to town to fax his studio and get the grosses.
 
Finding a perfect wave or a pristine rain forest
 
Getting There
Our four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle from Avis had seven seats and cost $780 a week, including mandatory insurance. Smaller vehicles, at $300 to $400 a week, do not have four-wheel-drive, which is worth considering if driving off main roads. In rainy months (September and October), roads to Tamarindo and Puerto Jimenez can be impassable. The drive to Tamarindo takes five hours, to Puerto Jimenez eight hours. Travelair has 45-minute flights to both towns from the Tobias Bolanos airport in the San Jose suburb of Pavas. The fare to each town is about $80 one way. The 45-minute trip from the Puerto Jimenez airport to Bosque del Cabo costs $25 in a taxi, usually a flatbed truck with benches.
 
Guides
Jon Seidman and a partner operate Escondido Trex in Puerto Jimenez, telephone and fax 735-5210. (The country code for Costa Rica is 506.) He charges $125 a day for groups up to four plus expenses.
 
Where to Stay
In Tamarindo, the Tamarindo Diria, telephone (506) 290-4340, fax (506) 290-4367, has double rooms with beach view that range from $99 to $133 , with breakfast.
At Bosque del Cabo, telephone and fax (506) 735-5206, there are four standard bungalows with two double beds, bathroom and outdoor cold shower for $100 single, $75 a person as a double, $65 a person as a triple and $60 a person as a quad. There are two deluxe cabins with a single king-size bed, tiled bath and more spacious balcony that cost $110 single, $85 a person double. Rates include all meals. There is also a house with solar power, refrigerator and stove that accommodates four, at $700 a week with no meals.
 
A warning to visitors on street crime
"The alarming growth in street crime reflects growing economic difficulties combined with an increasing influx of dollar-toting tourists who think they're visiting a nonviolent, democratic nirvana only to find that they are easy marks for thieves who are not interested in maintaining the country's pacific image."
This unattributed quote is posted in a part of the United States Embassy in San Jose that handles reports of thefts of passports and travel documents. That office is filled these days with everyone from doe-eyed backpackers to seasoned world travelers.
A consular information sheet published by the State Department on Dec. 3 warned travelers to buy locally valid theft insurance when renting vehicles in Costa Rica. Two Americans have been killed in robberies in the last three years, the sheet says, and there have been several other incidents directed at tourists, who are advised not to wear jewelry, to travel in groups during daylight and to carry only photocopies of their passports with them while leaving originals in their hotel's safe.
When I was a reporter in Central America in the late 1970's and early 1980's, San Jose was the "safe" city, capital of a country with no army, no desperate poverty and little history of civil strife, a pleasant escape from the more menacing places like Guatemala City, Managua and San Salvador.
We found out that things had changed when we pulled up to the Gran Hotel Costa Rica on our arrival in the country on a Saturday night to drop off the baggage in the crowded square the hotel fronts. Several men in white shirts and dark trousers busied themselves putting the bags onto a trolley, and I assumed they all worked for the hotel. Evidently one of them didn't. By the time we got to the front desk, the bag with all our passports, credit cards and travel vouchers was gone.
In the hours to follow, I was able to find out just how unremarkable the episode was in San Jose. Everyone knew the going price for an American passport ($30) and the name of the coffee shop two blocks away where the petty thieves plying this trade hang out. No one from the hotel or the police department expressed surprise or regret.
I put out the word that I was interested in paying to get our things back; after two meetings on nearby corners and the payment of $170 I managed to retrieve a notebook of no value to the burglar and to learn that the passports had probably been sold already.

HEADLINE: Crime

BYLINE: By Marilyn Stasio 

 BODY:
Like those ubiquitous bottle caps clustered around bus stops, Lawrence Block's crime novels are embedded in the streets of New York City. It takes more than an eye for local color or an ear for the vulgate to capture that feeling of ground-in grit that surfaces in EVEN THE WICKED (Morrow, $23), Mr. Block's 13th Matt Scudder mystery. It takes a certain sensibility to appreciate the animal comforts of a gin mill like Jimmy Armstrong's and to hear the music in two guys talking the same language:
" 'We have to talk,' he said. 
 " 'I was on my way over.'
" 'Don't come here. There's that coffee shop I met you once, Greek place, Eighth between 44th and 45th. I forget the name, they changed it when they redecorated, but it's the same place.'
" 'I know the one you mean. The east side of Eighth.'
" 'Right.' "
To put it another way, it takes a writer like Lawrence Block to find the humor, the horror and the only-in-New-York absurdity of a vigilante serial killer who calls himself "the Will of the People" and who includes a drama critic on his hit list of mobsters and child molesters. (David Letterman, of course, comes up with his own Top 10 list for this "urban folk hero.") The story has some sharp angles and the usual fancy footwork from our intrepid private eye. If anything feels a bit off, it's the class of New Yorker claiming Mr. Block's attention and wit: too many talky lawyers, reformed drunks, self-important journalists -- the sort of people who would step right over a bottle cap.
Who are you? Anyone who can't give an honest answer to that basic question might well get the wind up and disappear -- "like a spider, gone without a trace, leaving a perfect web behind." But when such a disappearance occurs in a rigid society like Japan's, as is the case in Miyuki Miyabe's deep and moody mystery ALL SHE WAS WORTH (Kodansha International, $22), the loss of face can be devastating.
Not even Shunsuke Honma, a senior police inspector idling at home after an injury, can fully grasp the significance of the crimes of desperation that he uncovers when he begins a search for his nephew's missing fiancee. After establishing that the lovely and elusive Shoko Sekine once declared "consumer bankruptcy" (incurred by imprudent credit card use), Honma does more digging and discovers that she has stolen another woman's identity and history, maybe even her life. The spare style and measured pace of Alfred Birnbaum's translation suit Honma's painstaking investigative methods and the somber tone of Ms. Miyabe's searching theme -- the value of the individual in a consumer-mad economy that punishes debt with ruin and disgrace, even death.
Stephanie Plum is having a job crisis. In THREE TO GET DEADLY (Scribner, $24), another rollicking chapter in the madcap career of Janet Evanovich's sassy bounty hunter, top pros like Ranger, Stephanie's mentor, get to bring back the "howling-dog" lunatics who skip out on $500,000 bail. Left with the chump change, our favorite Jersey girl (big hair, great bod, fresh mouth) is stuck with the unpopular assignment of tracking down Uncle Mo, a beloved candy-store owner who was nabbed for packing a gun. (The neighbors don't deny that Uncle Mo broke the law by "carrying concealed," but as Stephanie's grandmother sagely notes, "it wasn't one of those laws we care much about.") A pariah around town, Stephanie teams up with a savvy ex-hooker named Lula for a manhunt that turns nasty when a local drug dealer is shot dead in Uncle Mo's shop. As more dealers with connections to Uncle Mo are knocked off, Stephanie becomes so rattled that she dyes her hair orange. But even this fashion blunder looks good on the adorable klutz, whose manic excesses are an indelible part of her charm.
When Bill Moody writes about dead jazz musicians, you can hear the blue notes bouncing off the walls. THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET (Walker, $21.95) pays homage to the real-life trumpet player Clifford Brown, whose shooting-star career ended when he was killed in a car crash on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1956. When lost tapes of Brownie surface in Las Vegas, it's not exactly the Holy Grail for jazz buffs (that would be a cylinder recording of the fabled New Orleans cornet player Buddy Bolden), but it's enough to get one collector killed. Evan Horne, the jazz pianist who plays sleuth in this cool series, is less concerned with finding the killer than with determining the authenticity of the tapes, so he spends his quality time hunting down old sidemen with long memories, whose voices, raspy and real, conjure ghostly musicians and sounds from the grave. In this context, the murder mystery becomes an afterthought, like some improvisational theme behind the melody.
Greg Iles's suspense thriller MORTAL FEAR (Dutton, $24.95) swells the lists in the growing subgenre of cyber-crime fiction, and like many of these machine-driven novels, it's a lot more complicated than it needs to be. Besides being a computer genius, the monster surfing the Internet for victims in this gory story also has formidable knowledge of microsurgery, psychology, Eastern religions and apocalyptic literature. Harper Cole, the hacker-hero who cuts him down, is no less self-absorbed. This digital wizard, who works from a farmhouse in the Mississippi Delta, is alerted that something sinister is afoot when several female clients drop off EROS, the erotic on-line service for which he is a systems operator. When the cyber-stalker proves too slippery for the F.B.I., Cole logs on to EROS in the guise of a woman and pursues the killer himself. Despite the artifice of the characters operating it, the technology involved in their ingenious computer chase -- which gives new meaning to the term "network" -- is fascinating.

HEADLINE: 'Everything for Sale'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The central argument in Robert Kuttner's book "Everything for Sale" (review, Jan. 26), that free markets often fail, is correct only if one asks, "At what?" The purest free market in economics, that which existed prior to civilization, had no economic imperfections but myriad political imperfections. It operated with optimum efficiency according to the law of the jungle. The political market came into existence as a mechanism to improve upon the law of the jungle. The history of civilization has been a history of the intersection of political markets and economic markets. 
 Government should be at a minimum when there is minimum need for government, usually in periods of extended peace and prosperity. Government should be at a maximum when there is maximum need for government, in periods of war and depression. Because wars and economic contractions cannot be predicted with very high degrees of certainty, government cannot be downsized below certain minimum levels of national security and social security -- a safety net.
Mr. Kuttner's work is useful in reminding us of the many successes of government. It would be more useful if he would simply recognize there is a law of diminishing returns on tax policy, on spending policy and on regulatory policy. The political marketplace should produce leaders who are able to tell when we are taxing too much, when we are spending too much on national or social security and when regulation creates more problems than it solves. It is when that marketplace fails us that the economy most often gets into trouble.

HEADLINE: UNDER A BARE BULB

BYLINE: By Frank Bruni; Frank Bruni is a reporter for the Metro section of The Times. His most recent article for the Magazine was a profile of Andrew Wylie.

 BODY:
The evening's performance of Henrik Ibsen's "John Gabriel Borkman" has ended, and audience members have begun to disperse into the chill London air when a gray-haired woman in an awkward black dress materializes in the lobby of the Royal National Theater. She holds a blue bucket trimmed with silver tinsel, and the way she tilts it forward, combined with the beseeching look in her eyes, signals that she is collecting alms for something -- maybe the poor, maybe even herself. It seems a safe bet that she has wandered in from the windswept banks of the Thames on this night shortly before Christmas to seek out holiday-season good will.
But a closer inspection corrects that impression, bringing a gasp of surprise. It's Vanessa Redgrave, fresh off the stage, still in her turn-of-the-century costume, still enveloped by her character's aura of loneliness and desperation. Plastic snowflakes from the play's final scene fall from her wig as she nods to the people who draw near, encouraging their approach. What they want is an autograph or a better look, but they clearly feel obliged in the bargain to pony up a few pence for the refugee organization identified on her bucket. The actress is offering them a trade: a brush with theatrical greatness for a recognition, if only fleeting, of suffering in the world. 
 It is a deal she has been making almost her entire professional life, and it has exacted its costs. Although Redgrave has long been regarded as one of the world's most accomplished, fascinating actresses, her insistence on exploiting that renown for political purposes has often alienated peers and audiences; there were long periods during which the roles offered Redgrave did not reflect her stature or talent. This is not a subject she enjoys discussing, but it is broached during a late dinner, just a few ticks before midnight, as she savors a glass of red wine and the remains of a wearying day.
"It bothered me," she says of the years she found herself ostracized for her activism, mostly on behalf of Palestinians. Her smoky voice, coarsened by Silk Cut cigarettes, has dropped to a whisper, her hint that the conversation is getting too personal, too close. "It bothered me a lot."
Redgrave turned 60 last month. This week, previews begin at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in Manhattan for a new production of Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra," directed by Redgrave and starring her as the legendary heroine who realizes too late, clutching an asp to her breast, that she has misspent her passions. But what of Redgrave's passions, and of the price she has paid for them? Does she have any regrets?
I went to see her in London with these questions in mind. For four days I trailed after her, cadging conversations in dressing rooms and taxicabs and wherever else she was likely to halt the perpetual motion that defines her jumbled careers as thespian, humanitarian and provocateur.
And I listened to her talk: about the stamina of fascism in the world, the confusion at the close of a millennium, the social utility of theater and the transcendent importance of art. As she droned on, I despaired that she would ever tell me what I really wanted to know. Then, finally, I realized that she had, not directly but indirectly, in the digressions and diatribes of a woman so caught up in the history and struggles of others that she seems almost indifferent to her own.
 EDGRAVE ENTERS HER SEVENTH decade with a burst of theatrical and cinematic activity. In addition to "Antony and Cleopatra," she has roles in three movies scheduled for release this year. The first, due later this month, is "Smilla's Sense of Snow," based on the best-selling Danish mystery by Peter Hoeg, to be followed by "Mrs. Dalloway," an adaptation of the novel by Virginia Woolf, and "Wilde," a biography of Oscar Wilde.
This lineup seems infinitely more worthy of Redgrave than some of her projects in recent years, when she popped up in such unexpected places as a cheesy thriller titled "Mother's Boys," featuring Jamie Lee Curtis as a would-be soccer mom gone round the bend, and a pro-forma TV docudrama titled "Two Mothers for Zachary," with Valerie Bertinelli as a lesbian.
Redgrave offers high-minded rationales for this work, pronouncing the social issues instructive or the characters unique, but some peers submit a less ennobling explanation. Redgrave needs the money, they say, because she earned little during her exile, insists on doing low-paying theatrical productions like "Borkman" and "Antony and Cleopatra" whenever possible and continues to pump much of her income into causes.
"She hasn't got a penny to her name," says Katharina Wolpe, an English pianist who is a close friend. "She hasn't got a bean." Her two-bedroom walk-up in London is unremarkable, with a bare bulb on a cord serving as the fixture in the foyer, and she shivered through one of the mornings I spent with her rather than let the drizzle dirty her one good winter coat, just back from the cleaners. The best way to barter for more time with Redgrave, I learned, was to offer to pay for a taxi or meal.
Friends say that her three children -- the actresses Natasha and Joely Richardson, and Carlo Nero, an aspiring movie maker -- badger her about her finances, with slightly more success in the last few years. Proof of that, they say, is her surprising appearance last year in "Mission: Impossible," a film with dubious social value. "She really knows that she needs money at the moment," says Eileen Atkins, her co-star in "Borkman." "At 60, you begin to get worried about whether you have anything in the bank."
Redgrave has softened in other ways as well. When her own children were growing up, she was often absent, dashing off to demonstrations. Her 1994 autobiography, "Vanessa Redgrave," includes a passage in which she tells a young, tearful Natasha that Mommy must go because "many children could not live a happy life with their parents because of the injustice and cruelty of our society." But, friends say, Redgrave dotes on her four grandchildren. Atkins recalls the time Redgrave took Joely's daughter, Daisy, 4, to the Royal National Theater and let her dance giddily amid the fake snowflakes used in the production of "Borkman." "She's enchanting with her grandchildren," Atkins says. "She must be the best grandmother in the world."
But in her energy and enthusiasms, Redgrave seems to defy age. Linked in the past with Tony Richardson, Franco Nero, Warren Beatty and Timothy Dalton, she is currently rumored to to be involved with David Harewood, the 31-year-old black actor who plays Antony to her Cleopatra. (Redgrave refuses to speak of romances, while Harewood says merely, "Sometimes, I'll be watching in the wings and get so transfixed by her I miss my cue.") And if Redgrave is now making fewer waves, it is not because she has surrendered her political zeal. She just happens to be channeling it, for the moment, in less controversial directions.
She travels frequently to the former Yugoslavia as a special envoy for Unicef; she presides over the International Artists Against Racism, a group that pressures European Governments to relax laws against third-world refugees seeking asylum. While it has been many years since Redgrave ran for Parliament on a Trotskyist ticket, she does not rule out the possibility of doing so again. There is certainly reason enough in the miseries she sees everywhere she looks.
 "THEY COME FROM CHINA," REDGRAVE IS saying over her shoulder as I hustle to keep pace with her. She is guiding me through a former Baptist church in London now being used as a refugee shelter, her broad-shouldered, six-foot frame lunging forward, a severe figure with a mannish haircut colored a vaguely punk orange. "From Russia," she says. "From Africa, especially Nigeria, because of the regime."
This recitation does not come in response to any particular question. Redgrave is simply playing teacher to a captive student. "From Algeria," she continues. "From Afghanistan. From everywhere, everywhere." It is nearly 11 P.M., and most of the young men are visibly baffled by who she is and why she is there. But one of them, a 37-year-old man from Zanzibar named Islam, seems to recognize her and says, "Thank you." Redgrave clutches his hand for a few seconds, then releases it to hold her fist up in a gesture of solidarity.
The next day, she whisks me to another shelter and again unfurls a litany of deprivations: about the 850 refugees that she says are being kept in prison for no reason, about the two pounds a day with which refugees are expected to feed themselves. Redgrave has clearly decided that if she is going to let a journalist hang around, she is going to make it matter. It is my first clue to her refusal to see anything, even an interview, as exclusively personal or professional.
She has never been content to define herself only, or even primarily, as an actress, a craft she gravitated toward naturally. Her parents, the late Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson, were luminaries on the English stage, and all three of their children -- Corin, Vanessa and Lynn -- followed in their footsteps. But Michael Redgrave passed on to his children a legacy of social activism as well -- and it made a particularly strong impression on Corin and Vanessa. No sooner was Vanessa making a name for herself as a performer than she was earning a reputation as a rabble-rouser. In between racking up awards and nominations in the 1960's for such movies as "Morgan!" and "The Loves of Isadora," she grabbed headlines for protesting the war in Vietnam and sounding calls for nuclear disarmament.
There are myriad theories about what propelled Redgrave in this direction, beyond the example of her father and an innate concern of her own for people in danger or need. Maybe the revelation of her father's furtive homosexuality made her acutely sensitive to the pain of oppression. Maybe class guilt fueled her embrace of Marxism. Maybe intellectual insecurity about emphasizing the arts over academics at an early age forced her to overcompensate, turning to radical politics to assert her seriousness.
Whatever the cause, Redgrave's crusades began to get her into real trouble when she backed the quest of Palestinians to wrest territory from Israel for a homeland. She financed a documentary, "The Palestinians," in which she danced with a Kalashnikov rifle. Then, accepting an Academy Award for her performance in the 1977 movie "Julia," she denounced the "Zionist hoodlums" demonstrating outside the auditorium. Jewish leaders in particular voiced outrage, and Redgrave felt the sting of it in dwindling career opportunities. Although she possessed the versatility and beauty that would later give Meryl Streep first crack at almost all the best female leads in movies, Redgrave virtually vanished from centerpiece roles in popular cinema and saw several Broadway engagements canceled.
"It was most difficult for her at what should have been the height of her career, in her late 30's and early 40's, and that was the tragic loss," says James Ivory, who cast her in "The Bostonians," a 1984 film. Still, Redgrave hardly made it easy for him. Ivory recalls that during a meeting to discuss the role he wanted her to play, she abruptly changed the topic to the Workers Revolutionary Party, hitting him up for a donation.
"Her voice got deep and remote," Ivory says. "It was like an oracle coming out of a cave. I found myself in this grotesque position of writing out a check for $50 for a political party whose whole mission was to overthrow practically every institution in Western civilization. But there was no way around it."
 HERE IS IS STILL NO WAY AROUND it. My first night with Redgrave, the talk turns to her peculiar status in movies in the 1990's as the queen of the walk-through so subtly breathtaking it both exalts and eclipses everything around it. In "Howards End," her meandering survey of a garden becomes a wordless meditation on the warring currents of satisfaction and sorrow in a life almost over. In "Smilla's Sense of Snow," the way she clutches a Bible portrays religious conviction as an amalgam of idealism, escapism and pure madness. What Redgrave does, less through technique than an ineffable gravity of spirit, is communicate a character's entire history in an evanescent moment.
Redgrave remarks that she commands no more money for movies today than she did in the 1960's, but reasons that this is the inescapable fate of so many people her age. I assume she is speaking of actors, but she defiantly corrects me. "You name it: taxi drivers, shopkeepers, whatever," she says. "They're earning exactly the same in real value terms as they did in the 1960's."
The comparison strikes me as delusional: the money struggles of the average worker are not volitional, while Redgrave could solve her own by making two movies like "Mission: Impossible" a year and cutting back on charity. That she doesn't do this is admirable, perhaps even noble, but a choice nonetheless, and that distinction often seems lost on Redgrave as she perfects her posture, equal parts studied and sincere, as a woman of the people.
When I comment that her West London neighborhood seems charming, she launches into a soliloquy about the way rising rents and convoluted parking regulations are driving store owners away. When the subject of music comes up, she says that John Lennon's "Imagine" is her favorite song "because of what it says: 'Imagine there's no countries.' " Redgrave is like a broken record, forever spinning lyrics of injustice and insurrection.
She has been in that groove for a long time. Her autobiography depicts an ideologue for whom circumstances change but the song remains the same. Her account of the birth of Natasha Richardson, her first child, becomes a rant against unnecessary painkillers and Caesarean sections in capitalist societies intent on profit. More than two decades later, when Redgrave accompanies a pregnant Joely Richardson for a uterine scan, simple joy over the imminence of a grandchild surrenders to moral outrage that while medical technology improves, "governments pursue policies that have already led to a worldwide economic disaster."
"It's very, very unrelenting," says Robert Fox, an English theatrical producer who was married for several years to Natasha Richardson. With most actors, he says, "it's a phase, and then they marry Ted Turner." With Redgrave, it is an identity that has ossified into hard, cold granite.
In fact, it is Redgrave's art, not her activism, that she says she occasionally questioned, wondering if it were important enough. "I did always feel that theater was important, but I didn't realize that it was absolutely vital to civilization until about 1992 or 1993," Redgrave says, explaining that theater provides both moral lessons and psychic balm in times of hardship. "I think theater is as essential to civilization as safe water," she says.
Through such reasoning, she has transformed her work with the Moving Theater -- a politically minded, ethnically diverse company that she and several other actors in England founded two and a half years ago -- into a public service of the highest order. This is where her current production of "Antony and Cleopatra" had its genesis. Redgrave conceives Shakespeare's narrative as a commentary on imperialism triggered by events around him, and thus sets the play in the Elizabethan era, "which is very close to ours in many, many ways," Redgrave says. "Assassination is the order of the day in every country. There are millions being impoverished, war everywhere." Her fascination with the part of Cleopatra, which she has scaled three previous times, turns out to be as much didactic as it is dramatic.
But what of the simple thrill and beauty of a thing well done, of a role expertly realized? Do these mean nothing to Redgrave? One afternoon, over coffee, I remark that it must feel like an extraordinary privilege to be blessed with such an artistic gift. She bows her head, falling silent. When she looks up, her usually flinty gaze is dewy, and I sense, for the first time in many hours with her, that I am seeing something candid and intimate.
So I revisit the topic on my last night with her, over dinner at an Indian restaurant. I observe that during a curtain call for "Borkman," tears welled in her eyes, and that after all these years, the applause seemed as important to her as ever.
"It means even more to me," Redgrave says. But then, predictably, the oracle emerges from the cave, veering off toward some impersonal horizon with the words: "Maybe it's because I've realized all that theater can mean to people." For Redgrave, pride in her own accomplishment would be venal and mundane; she is caught up in larger forces and higher purposes, seeing herself as a vessel for the good of humankind.
I understand then that for a woman who still defends the hoisting of that Kalashnikov rife as "destiny," who defines the characters she plays by the political and scientific climates in which they lived, who believes that a person does not so much march toward barricades as be beckoned by them, second thoughts and second guesses -- let alone regrets -- are luxuries best avoided. Redgrave seems safe from them even at this late and lonely hour, on the far side of midnight, as an air of exhaustion settles over her and exaggerates the stoop in her shoulders, already sagging from the weight of the world.

It is possible to get travel information on the World Wide Web by using a search engine like Alta Vista, Yahoo or Lycos. It is also bound to be time-consuming and probably fruitless. Luckily, several companies have already done the preliminary work.

BUSINESS OR PLEASURE
Landseer Online
http://www.landseer.com
 Landseer Online describes itself as a source for the international business traveler, but you don't have to be traveling on business to use it. It contains four main divisions -- message center, information, services and products -- plus subdivisions and additional sites of potential interest. You can get exchange rates and weather information, ask questions or provide answers, plan a trip and, of course, buy stuff.
Since I was about to play host to guests from Aarhus, Denmark, I imagined that I was thinking of making a trip there. In the information category I selected world facts, and got the World Factbook produced by the Central Intelligence Agency, a Government publication widely available both in print and on Web sites. I selected Denmark and saw a small black-and-white map, followed by a presentation divided into geography, people, government, economy, trans portation, communications and defense forces. It was too long to read on screen while the meter was ticking, but it would be easy enough to download a copy and read it later or print it out. 
 There were some nice touches. That Denmark's land area is 42,370 square kilometers hardly paints a picture in one's mind, but that it is "slightly more than twice the size of Massachusetts" does.
Next I tried destinations, which turned out to be a link to the City.Net site. I selected Denmark, then Aarhus, then travel and sights. That led to a large new listing. After a couple of failed tries, the Daimi Guide to Aarhus appeared, a comprehensive guidebook with the touchingly honest admission that it, like any such guide, "will always be more or less outdated."
Three attempts couldn't raise the exchange-rates site, so I switched to Trip Planner, which promises to "lead you through a series of checklists where you tell us your destination and exactly what you want in the way of hotels, restaurants, travel info and more." The choices are used "to build a personalized guide that you can print out for easy reading or to take with you on your trip."
I did not go through the checklists, but I did look at the destinations offered. There were 65, from Acapulco to Washington; Aarhus was not among them. Copenhagen was there, and it should do. Denmark, as everyone knows, is only about twice the size of Massachusetts.
 
WORK IN PROGRESS
Biztravel.com
 http://www.biztravel.com
 When you buy a book, magazine or newspaper, you expect it to be finished. Publishers do not put out such things before they are complete, although the realities of deadlines, production schedules and human frailties may mean they are less than perfect.
Web sites, however, intentionally go on line in an incomplete state, since they can be changed so much more quickly and easily than traditional printed media.
Biztravel.com, which started late last year, is, like Landseer, intended for the business traveler. When I checked in earlier this month, the three main components -- Biztraveler, an on-line magazine; bizcityinfo, and bizmiles, which keeps tabs on frequent-traveler miles -- were more or less complete. Two other sections were not: bizreservations was in "final beta testing" and V.I.P. lounge was "coming soon."
Travel Alerts contained timely information about airports, roads and weather in the United States. Travel News consisted of short reports about airlines and airports, car rentals and the like.
Bizcity was still in progress. From two lists of cities, divided into American and foreign, I selected Copenhagen and got a short profile with two photographs. A click on the hotels section of a subsidiary menu brought a pretty good listing. Biztravel.com is worth keeping an eye on. L.R. SHANNON

Sponsor's Selling a Co-op Unit
 
Q I am currently renting an apartment from the sponsor of a building converted to a co-op in 1985. Before my occupancy in 1995, there were renters in my apartment for at least 10 years. The sponsor currently owns 59 of the 288 units in the building. I am interested in purchasing my apartment. What criteria does a sponsor use to determine if he should continue to rent or to sell an apartment? Do the rest of the shareholders have any say in the matter? Is it in their interest for the sponsor to sell? . . . Cheri Mersey, Manhattan.
 
A Donald M. Klein, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, explained that in the situation described, the sponsor is most likely considered a "holder of unsold shares," a legal designation that carries with it certain special rights.
For example, Mr. Klein said, while co-op shareholders usually have to obtain the consent of the co-op board before renting or selling an apartment, a holder of unsold shares needs no such permission. And though a holder of unsold shares must allow rent-controlled and rent-stabilized tenants to remain in their apartments at their regulated rents, Mr. Klein said, any tenants who succeed such regulated tenants can be charged free-market rates for their apartments. 
 As a result, he said, the criteria a sponsor uses to determine whether to rent or to sell an apartment are typically driven by simple economics. "If the rent is high and the maintenance is low," Mr. Klein said, "then it's probably a nice investment to keep."
In other words, he said, if the rent being collected on an apartment exceeds the maintenance charges being imposed by the co-op, then the sponsor has little incentive to sell the unit -- particularly if a sale would result in a taxable gain for the sponsor. Moreover, Mr. Klein said, although shareholders in a co-op have little control over a sponsor's right to rent or sell, the sponsor's decision can indeed have a significant impact on those shareholders.
"If the sponsor holds too many unsold shares," he said, "banks will be hesitant to lend in the building."
As a result, Mr. Klein said, it is in the best interest of shareholders to have as many owner-occupied units in the building as possible.
In fact, at least one co-op, 200 East 16th Street Housing Corporation in Manhattan, has taken its sponsor to court for failing to sell units. James G. Samson, the lawyer who handled the case for the co-op, said it was settled out of court when the sponsor agreed to sell a certain number of units each year.
 
Moving-Out Fees In Co-op Buildings
 
Q When my friend was moving from a rental apartment in a co-op building, she was told that there was a new house rule that required a $300 deposit to cover any damage to the elevators or hallways that might occur while moving out. However, even if there was no damage done, only $200 would be returned. The remaining $100 was going to be used for upkeep of the newly renovated areas of the building. I can understand a deposit against damage, but can the board's keeping of the $100 be legal? . . . Jean H. Dorsett, Manhattan.
 "As a general rule, co-op boards are given wide discretion in the imposition of fees relating to their co-op tenancies," said Dean M. Roberts, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in co-op and condominium law. "As long as the rule imposing the fee is enacted pursuant to the bylaws and is uniformly applied to all shareholders, then the fee would most likely be found to be legal."
However, Mr. Roberts said, there may be some question as to who is responsible for paying the fee because such fees can only be assessed to shareholders by the co-op.
Generally, Mr. Roberts said, a rental tenant in a co-op would be required to pay a fee assessed by the co-op only if the terms of the agreement governing the tenancy required it. Tenants renting from sponsors, Mr. Roberts said, are even less likely to be responsible for such fees because the sponsors themselves are usually not required to pay them. And finally, Mr. Roberts said, such fees cannot be imposed on rent-controlled or rent-stabilized tenants -- regardless of whom they are renting from -- because the fees would be considered rent overcharges.

HEADLINE: The Animal Smugglers;
THE LOOTING and SMUGGLING and FENCING and HOARDING of IMPOSSIBLY PRECIOUS, FEATHERED and SCALY WILD THINGS

BYLINE: By Donovan Webster; Donovan Webster wrote about the theft of computer chips for the Magazine in September 1994. His book "Aftermath: The Remnants of War" was recently published.

 BODY:
As the world's largest exotic reptile show -- the National Reptile
Breeders Expo -- was about to get under way last August in Orlando, Fla., special agents from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's division of law enforcement were ready to move in. For more than three years, they had been tracking a fast-moving smuggling ring out of Germany and Canada, and two members of the ring had just arrived to sell more than $100,000 worth of rare and protected snakes and tortoises from Madagascar. 
 They spotted Simon David Harris at the Orlando airport. Harris, 25, was a British citizen living in South Africa. He was carrying in his suitcases 61 Madagascan tree boas and 4 spider tortoises, both of which are protected species. Customs officials arrested him. He would be the bait.
Two days later in a restaurant outside Orlando, Harris's partner, a 33-year-old German named Wolfgang Michael Kloe, was eating breakfast with his wife and two children, waiting for the remainder of his shipment to arrive. Harris showed up, but unbeknown to Kloe, he had agreed to cooperate with Federal officials. The two men left the restaurant to add Harris's cache to Kloe's, which was in a parked van nearby. Kloe had a haul of Madagascan boas; over the years, his ring had smuggled in more than 100 boas and 51 radiated tortoises, which since 1975 have been protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), signed by 130 nations. The radiated tortoise, indigenous only to southwestern Madagascar, has a yellow head and a domed shell with brilliant yellow-and-black star bursts, making it one of the most coveted tortoise species on earth.
As Kloe climbed into his van, two Fish and Wildlife officers confronted him. He went quietly -- until he got in the car.
"I handcuffed him with his hands in front instead of behind his back," one of the officers recalls. "I thought it would be more comfortable during our ride." The officer drove Kloe toward Orlando for his arraignment. He slowed the car as they approached a tollbooth on the East-West Expressway, and then: "Boom -- Kloe was out of the car and running."
Kloe shot out across the 10-lane highway, dodging speeding cars and trucks. He jumped the railing of a bridge and scampered down an embankment before disappearing inside a plumbing-supply warehouse. With the sirens of backup police units blaring in the distance, Kloe slipped out a rear door, where a pair of warehouse workers grabbed him. They mistook him for a petty thief.
Kloe eventually pleaded guilty and was fined $10,000 and sentenced to 46 months in prison for conspiracy, smuggling, money laundering, attempted escape and violating the Lacey Act, which bans interstate and international transport of endangered or protected species that have been illegally captured. For Fish
and Wildlife, breaking up Kloe's ring was a result of thousands of agent-hours, including international detective work and audio- and videotaped stings. Why all this time, money and effort to stop the smuggling of ... a few dozen snakes and turtles from Madagascar?
Wildlife for sale. The trade in exotic animals -- especially protected, threatened and endangered species -- is not usually thought to occupy a huge share in the global market of illegal goods smuggled across borders. But in recent years, only illegal drugs have outstripped the cash value of the living and dead wildlife that sluices through a black market toward trophy hunters, pet enthusiasts and devotees of traditional medicines. "The business is roughly equal to that of smuggled weapons," says Anne-Berry Wade, a Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman. "And very few nations do anything about it."
Between $10 billion and $20 billion in plants and animals were traded illegally around the world last year, with the United States leading the list of buyers -- spending about $3 billion (compared with $30 billion for contraband drugs). The cargo comes in many forms. Like the snakes and tortoises shipped to Orlando, they may be live "pets," pulled from the wild to be sold for thousands of dollars to collectors. They might be dead animals or animal parts whose use and value spans every interest: rare butterflies and beetles caught and killed for collectors; potions made from the horns of endangered black rhinos or the bones of tigers, both of which are said in some cultures to increase male sexual potency, or exotic skins used in designer clothing (Most Wanted, page 30).
In the end, however, animal smuggling is essentially an environmental problem. According to Fish and Wildlife authorities and a chorus of independent biologists and ecologists, life on earth may be nearing a doorway it does not want to enter. They suggest that if the decimation of animal populations and their habitats continues, the tapestry of life across whole blotches of the map may start to unravel. Though few scientists agree on the timing or severity of this scenario, they have given it a name: ecosystem collapse.
Perhaps nowhere on earth have exotic animal species come under more pressure than on Madagascar, a 1,000-mile-long island off the southeast coast of Africa with the planet's most distinctive skein of life. Given that the high-profile arrests in Orlando last summer concerned some of Madagascar's most coveted tortoises and snakes, I decided to see firsthand what the animal trade looks like from the supply end, and what it does to an environment under attack. I boarded a jet for the 30-hour flight.
Antananarivo -- or Tana, as the locals call it -- is the island's capital, a city of 1.5 million souls clinging to the sides of 12 red-dirt hills. Studded with apartment houses that are either porch-fronted French colonials or third- world brick cubes, Tana is a city of poverty and dusty beauty. The roads are edged with carts drawn by zebu, a curving-horned mix of cow and ox; farther on lie pastel-green rice paddies. Pedestrians carry live chickens slung across their backs for the evening's meal.
Closer to Antananarivo's downtown, an almost medieval flavor overtakes the city. Many of the houses have interior courtyards and darkly lighted passageways leading to backyards. There are broad stairways rising over the city's hills and roadway tunnels beneath them. Merchants sell litchi nuts, while open-air barbers proffer empty chairs. And all across Antananarivo, on days when the wind blows hard, the sky is thick with smoke from the burning forests and grasslands.
A geologic orphan, neither part of Africa nor Asia -- the island occupies its own tectonic plate, which has slid southeast over the ages -- Madagascar was unpopulated until roughly 2,000 years ago, when Malay-Polynesian mariners called the Malagasy arrived. On Madagascar, the wide, slow arc of biological evolution had been allowed to continue its curve for at least 80 million years, unkinked by human intervention.
Consequently, many of the island's animals and plants are unique. All 32 species of lemur (prehensile-tailed mammals that seem equal parts fox, cat, raccoon and monkey) live only in Madagascar. As does the Parson's chameleon, a three-foot-long arboreal lizard whose limbs move ponderously and whose bulging eyes rotate independently. As did, until a few hundred years ago, the comically gigantic Aepyornis, a 10-foot-tall bird, now extinct, whose shattered eggs -- each larger than a rugby ball -- are still glued together and sold as $500 souvenirs by Malagasy locals. Then there are the various tortoises and snakes, many of which rank among the planet's most threatened species.
In 1960, when Madagascar gained full independence from France, its population was six million. Today, 12 million people live there (they speak both French and Malagasy), and the population is expected to at least double again by 2015. To feed all these people, jungles are being replaced by rice paddies and grazing land; every year, nearly a third of the island's former scrub forest and desert is set afire to keep it arable. With widespread unemployment and a government still adapting to free-market democracy after shifting in 1993 from a Communist dictatorship, Madagascar is being squeezed by economic and environmental forces on all fronts.
As the world's appetite for exotic pets grows, Madagascar has found that its hoard of snakes and tortoises and lemurs, displaced by deforestation, are a very convenient export product. And for smugglers, with a large pool of collectors willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of owning a fast-evaporating piece of life on earth, Madagascar is a pirate's paradise -- especially given that local enforcement isn't very tight.
Of course, Madagascar isn't the only place where smugglers thrive: huge profits are being made from Brazilian monkeys, Indonesian reptiles, Australian birds. "Animal smugglers do it because enforcement and prosecution aren't priorities compared to other crimes," says Tom Striegler, Fish and Wildlife's chief of law enforcement. According to Striegler, a padded vest studded with 40 eggs from Australia's endangered black palm cockatoo, each worth at least $10,000, is far easier to smuggle than an equal-valued cache of cocaine, simply because customs officials aren't looking for cockatoo eggs. "And there's not a stigma attached to being an animal smuggler," Striegler says. "If you get caught illegally transporting animals on a first offense, it's possible you won't even do jail time. You can't say the same for running drugs." (All told, Kloe's gang smuggled in animals worth more than $250,000, which earned him 46 months' jail time and a $10,000 fine; a similarly priced haul of cocaine sold by the kilogram would net a smuggler 121 to 151 months in jail, with potential fines of $175,000 or more.)
Snakes are among the most common live contraband because of their availability and because they, like tortoises, can survive a long trip without food or water. Larger and more fragile live animals, especially monkeys and birds, are more difficult to smuggle (the survival rate for smuggled birds is only 10 percent) and are, therefore, often more expensive.
Madagascar is hardly the only country where habitat destruction and illegal animal collection are endangering the environment. A 1996 study by the World Conservation Union called the loss of biodiversity one of the world's most pressing environmental problems, noting a sharp increase in the pace of extinction of birds and mammals. And with exploding human populations, especially in the third world, the trend is expected only to grow.
"You go into these jungles where there once were abundant birds and parrots, and now they're empty," says the eminent biologist George Schaller, director of science at the Wildlife Conservation Society, about South America's equatorial rain forests. "Collectors removed immature birds before they had time to breed. Demand from the pet trade stripped those jungles like a disease. Who knows how many ways the loss of the birds will upset the balance of life in those jungles? But it will."
In Antananarivo, the place where smug-gling-minded individuals can gain reliable information is a hotel and bar called Le Glacier -- "the Ice Cream Maker." Ice cream may have been concocted here at one time, but the milk and flavorings have long been discarded to history, leaving only the ice. Which is used to cool Scotch whisky.
Le Glacier is Antananarivo's cultural crossroads. From inside, you look out onto Zoma, which the locals say is the world's second-largest outdoor market after Bangkok's: bananas and knockoff Nikes, live ducks and musical instruments, butchered zebu and automobile radiators. Around you, Le Glacier's barroom is a dingy, tall-ceilinged place dotted with tables and trolled by bored hookers.
It takes a few minutes to navigate Le Glacier's social shoals, but soon I am talking with a well-dressed, gravel-voiced gentleman who seems to be a regular. When I ask about smuggled snakes and tortoises, he takes a puff of his Gauloise and grins. "That man, over there, he knows the smuggling," he says, pointing toward the bar. "Monsieur!" he shouts. "Come over to our table and join us."
The man does. His name is Patrice Grondin, and though only in his 50's, he is thin and battered. With a receding hairline and mahogany parchment skin, he is a caricature of the pirate outlaw. His eyes are rheumy, his teeth capped with silver. It's 5 in the afternoon, and he has been in the bar since before lunch.
After lighting a cigarette and ordering a white rum, Grondin settles in. "Since we all know the man who introduced us, I know we can speak freely," he says. "The smuggling is going on. Right now! Especially the radiated tortoise. It is in great demand by pet owners. Each tortoise's shell is unique. I've heard a story that once the Queen of England offered a lot of money -- hundreds of thousands of dollars -- to find two that are exactly alike. And still, with all that money at stake, it never happened."
Some of the tortoises, he says, are even shipped out of the country with the Government's help. "It's amazing how it is all intertwined," he says, smoothing his hands over each other. Grondin then mentions the platter-size plowshare tortoise, one of the world's most endangered reptiles. It is estimated that only 400 to 1,000 plowshares still exist in Madagascar's wilds. On the night of May 6, 1996, 76 plowshares were stolen from a captive-breeding reserve along the country's northwest coast, destroying 10 years of work with the slow-to-breed animals. The theft and export of the plowshares was so solidly planned that they were advertised for sale in Europe days before they were stolen.
These days, Grondin tells us, animals are increasingly smuggled off Madagascar by fast trimarans or speedboats, bound for South Africa or the island of Reunion. "The airports are too controlled," he says, "so unless prior arrangements have been made, you can be caught. But there is no coast guard in Madagascar."
Once the Madagascan tortoises and snakes arrive in Reunion or South Africa, Grondin says, they are mixed with captive-bred exotics. Because these rare species don't exist naturally outside Madagascar, the newly smuggled animals are also assumed to have been bred in captivity. Eventually, false documents are generated for the illegal animals, since it's not against the law to transport a protected animal if its paperwork confirms that it never lived in the wild.
The conversation ebbs and flows. There are stories about would-be smugglers getting caught. One radiated-tortoise courier tried to board an outbound jet in Antananarivo wearing heavy winter clothes whose insulation was stuffed with tortoises. Another carried them aboard as cabin luggage -- in a burlap sack marked "Coconuts." Grondin laughs. "The bag looked good," he says. "It was about the right weight, and the round shape of the shells looked like coconuts under the fabric. Then the coconuts started to crawl and scratch inside the bag!"
Finally Grondin offers some specific directions: to trace the path of the radiated tortoise, he says, we must go to Tulear, a seaport city in southwestern Madagascar. But first he issues an invitation: "Come with me, and we will leave one morning and come back with a few boas in the afternoon. It will take only four hours."
I will definitely be heading to Tulear. But, sure, I'd also like to see how boas, which are also protected by the Cites agreement, begin their trip from the Madagascan jungle to Orlando.
A Few days later, I find myself bear- ing a letter from Grondin -- he couldn't accompany me the day I wanted to go -- and heading across the scarred and mountainous jungles of east-central Madagascar toward the town of Andasibe.
During the past few years, snakes have come to dominate the fast-growing animal smuggling trade. They are sought as pets (Michael Jackson and the rock guitarist Slash, both famous for their snakes, may have spurred the craze) and for their skins and body fluids. In Vietnam, I was once offered the blood and gall of a live grass snake. Before my eyes, the delicate green animal -- narrow as a string -- would be slit from tail to head, with the gall and blood squeezed into a glass of rice brandy. The elixir, I was told, would give me the strength of 10 men.
Snakes move through the black market in ways limited only by human imagination. One of the most creative ruses was undertaken by a Taiwanese man named Chine-Kuo Liu, who in July 1993 was arrested leaving Los Angeles International Airport with 52 North American snakes on his body. To carry the snakes, he would drop one into the toe of a nylon stocking, let the snake ball itself tight, then twist the stocking shut above the snake and drop in another, repeating the process until the stocking resembled a large string of pearls. Then he wrapped the stocking around his body and wore loose clothes for the airplane trip.
At Andasibe, home to the 2,000-acre Perinet nature reserve, I enter the railway hotel and give Grondin's letter to the maitre d'hotel. He reads it and smiles. "Yes," he says, "I will send for someone who can help."
I sit for lunch, and within five minutes two young farmers -- Buddy, 24, and Julien, 29 -- approach the table. They're filthy, and they look hungry and a little nervous. "We have no boas today," Buddy says. "It is Friday, coming into the weekend. There are many tourists inside the reserve. So we don't hunt. We don't keep any in our possession on weekends, in case someone were to see. But we can get some. It will take only a few hours."
Julien, who is smaller and darker than Buddy, raises a hand to quiet him. "Will you be exporting these?" he asks. "If so, we can get smaller specimens. They're easier to hide. Or, we can get a large one. We can get anything you'd like."
I say it doesn't matter. I'm only interested in seeing one.
The next morning at 9 Buddy arrives at the hotel. "We have a ground boa," he says. "A beautiful one. But only one. The tourists were too many last night. We could not hunt. We have to walk the forest paths and roads using flashlights. It would have given us away."
We drive about two miles from the rail station, through a village of wood huts with dirt floors and backyard gardens and a circular rice paddy at its center. We turn up a side road that leads to the town's former schoolhouse, a three-room building whose windows, doors and roof have been destroyed. "A cyclone did that," Buddy says.
Julien materializes from the jungle. He lifts a dirty white bag into the air and walks toward us. We step inside the wrecked schoolhouse, and Julien opens the bag. "It's a very nice specimen," he says. "We got another one like it recently. For a German. He bought it for $300. He paid in real U.S. currency."
Slowly, the snake begins a long, easy-bodied slide out of the bag. Its head is triangular, its body a puttylike brown blotched with dark diamond shapes along its back. The shapes grow larger as the snake's body increases in diameter. "This is a young one," Julien says. "It is only three or four feet long. They can be six feet long."
He lifts the snake by its midsection. "It's also a female," he says. "And it is pregnant. I can feel the eggs. Soon there will be little snakes."
So if I were to take this one snake from the jungle, I would effectively be taking many more. "Is $300 a lot for a boa?" I ask Julien.
He bobs his head. "Yes," he says, "though they can be more expensive."
"In the United States," I tell him, "people would pay $2,000."
He looks shocked, as if I'd just slugged him. "Well," he says, "you have to pay for transportation -- and sometimes for bribes. I am not an exporter. I am a cultivator. I farm rice. These days, I don't make enough money from that."
The Madagascan ground boa, Julien goes on, is indigenous only to the Andasibe area, but there are a lot of them. "So, to me," he says, "I can do one of three things with these boas. I can leave them alone, and not have enough to eat. I can eat them. Or I can sell them to people. I make enough from selling one snake to eat for a month -- or more. What would you choose? Of course, I would rather make $2,000 than $300 from this snake. But the danger comes in the exporting."
Does he know how the snakes are exported?
"Not really," he says. "By boat, I think. Many of them."
Fortunately, the United States Attorney's indictment from the Orlando case fills in some gaps, at least in the case of Wolfgang Kloe's operation. Kloe and another defendant, Frank H. Lehmeyer, would travel from Germany to Madagascar, where they collected the snakes and tortoises and had them flown back to Germany, often by bribing airport officials. In Germany, the animals would be sold to a Canadian, Enrico Joseph Truant, who hired couriers to transport the animals back to Canada in what Kloe called a "special suitcase." From Canada, the snakes and tortoises would be driven into the United States and shipped by commercial airlines from Detroit. By this time, Lehmeyer would have sent a forged Cites permit for the animals to Truant, with instructions to show the permit only if necessary. If the permit went unused, Truant was to return it to Lehmeyer.
Back in the destroyed schoolhouse, Buddy and Julien still think I want to buy their snake for export. "She is very healthy," Buddy says. "So, are we ready for a sale?"
"No," I tell them, "I only wanted to see it. I don't want to buy it."
The two snake catchers are confused. They look at each other, their faces screwing tight. They each smoke a cigarette, watching me for a few minutes, asking for a second and third time if I don't want to buy the snake. After a moment of negotiation between themselves, they turn the snake loose on the schoolhouse floor. No use keeping evidence around.
Buddy tells me that because of their size and ability to adapt to different-shaped containers, snakes are far easier to export than radiated tortoises, which are generally heavy, bulky and more difficult to find. Also, when in distress, the tortoises urinate -- sometimes a noxious, crimson liquid that can tip off a wildlife inspector. The urine's smell, Buddy says, can linger for hours or days after a tortoise has been taken. That is why most smugglers drop newly collected tortoises into mesh bags and swing them in circles above their heads, inciting the animals to spend their scent before export begins.
We talk for a few more minutes. I give Buddy and Julien about $15 each for their work. The snake, which isn't accustomed to sunlight, slithers tentatively across the wooden floor. A moment later, what must have seemed a windfall $300 to Buddy and Julien slides through a hole in the fractured floorboards, dropping onto the red soil of Madagascar.
The harvesting of wild animals wouldn't be nearly so profitable if there weren't such ardent collectors around the world, especially in America, Germany and Japan (where an estimated 1 in 10 males is a serious but-terfly collector). And their demands have turned animal smuggling into something of a science.
When Fish and Wildlife officers raided a house in Redwood City, Calif., five years ago, they found an extensive collection of butterflies, in-cluding dozens of living specimens shrouded in glassine envelopes and chilled inside a dark refrigerator.
"It's done that way so the butterflies metabolize stored fat before they're killed," says Chris Nagano, an entomologist with Fish and Wildlife's Carlsbad, Calif., office who participated in the Redwood City case. "It creates the best specimens for sale to collectors, because then the fat can't melt out and spoil their wings once they die."
The keeper of these butterflies, as it turns out, was a pest exterminator and butterfly authority named Richard J. Skalski, known locally as "Bugman." In the end, investigators found that Skalski and his colleagues were in possession of 2,375 rare and protected butterflies from Mexico, Germany and the United States, a cache that Fish and Wildlife estimated to have a black-market value of more than $300,000. On the ceiling beams above his bed, Skalski had meticulously taped sections of paper toweling on which were mounted maturing chrysalides, so that he could monitor their development.
"He knew precisely what he was doing," Nagano says. "It was a system that left him pristine specimens."
By Nagano's reckoning, such behavior isn't that uncommon. The most obsessive collectors, he says, often become experts on their preferred species. "Pretty soon, they think, Hey, it's my animal," Nagano says. "Which results in the smuggling and, I think, a real lack of respect for the species."
Nagano remembers interviewing one rare-animal dealer who had seen so many zoologic obsessions that he coined a name for it: the Sickness. "He told me he could see it in their eyes," Nagano says. "The animal takes them over. He told stories of guys whose wives left them because of the Sickness. Guys who were ruined financially. It's ironic -- they gain all this knowledge of a rare species, and rather than use it to help the animal, they internalize it. They have to possess it."
Of course, not all collectors are pathological. Richard D. Bartlett, 58, white-haired and thick- bearded, has written 13 books and more than 400 articles about reptile behavior and collecting. He and his wife (and sometime collaborator), Patti, live near Gainesville, Fla., on a few acres draped with Spanish moss. They maintain a menagerie of about 100 animals -- including 40 species of exotic snakes, birds, turtles, mudskippers and tortoises, among them a pair of radiated tortoises from Madagascar -- collected over the years and kept in conditions that would put most public zoos to shame.
Bartlett has a particular soft spot for reptiles and amphibians. "I've been interested in them since I was old enough to understand there was life beyond me in this world," he says. "And I can't tell you why, exactly. I just find the roles that they play in life fascinating. They occupy an ecosystem niche that's not being used. They're so versatile.
"I can say, I think, that we don't have too many wild-collected animals in our collection. Oops, I'm lying -- I have some temple vipers, from Sulawesi and Sumatra. I believe they are wild-collected. And I have the radiated tortoises, of course, which I got 45 years ago from a French dealer who couldn't give them away. But I got those before any protections existed. I wouldn't do it today."
These days, Bartlett says with conviction, he has joined with the scientists who believe that biodiversity is indeed being threatened and that animal smuggling is a significant part of the problem. "I'm here, in my backyard in Florida, with my snakes from around the world and my pet tortoises from Madagascar, and one of the messages I get is that the world has gotten really small," Bartlett says. "You can get anything you want -- anything you can imagine having -- provided you're willing to pay for it. No matter how rare an animal is, you can get it. Think about the implications -- there's something deeply frighten-ing about it. That's why we have to change the way things are being done now. The time has come for that."
The harbor town of Tulear in south-west Madagascar has a Caribbean-blue sea, deep coral lagoons and constant cool breezes, which make it feel like a tropical seaport. Yet a few hundred yards inland dust devils swirl inside walled courtyards, wild dogs crowd the patchy concrete streets and everywhere people are asking for money -- begging and selling in equal proportion. Away from the beach the ground is a spiny desert, though one whose mosaic of plants, birds and animals appears healthy.
Everywhere beneath the placid surface of Tulear's dusty streets a sort of Wild West desperation dwells, and it occasionally bursts into view. One afternoon, for example, I buy a few seashells from a woman who is subsequently beaten by a man nearby, though it's not clear for what. He shatters a large conch shell across her face, leaving her bleeding, crying and, it seems, perplexed. In another minute, the man is surrounded by a mob and beaten senseless. All this happens beneath an enormous, swaying palm tree, less than 200 yards away from my luxury beach hotel.
This is where I have come to look for illegally transported radiated tortoises, which can sell in the States for as much as $10,000 each. The most valuable specimen is an adult female that can reproduce; also, the more distinctive and brilliant the sun-burst shell, the more valuable the tortoise. After a few hours of asking around, I drive away from town with a local gentleman who says he can guide me to where the tortoises are kept and sold.
"Some Malagasy think the tortoises are good luck to have around your house," he says. "Other people think they are a delicacy. They eat them -- especially around Christmas. Still others export them. They put them in pirogues -- you know, dugout canoes -- at night, and take them to boats offshore, for export. Everyone knows that in other countries the tortoises are extremely valuable as pets. The adults live to be more than 100 years old. They can be very beautiful. This is why collectors like them so much."
Within 10 minutes we are snaking through a ghetto at the edge of town. Tall fences, made of woven sticks, line the dirt road and obscure our view. Ragged children run alongside our car. Finally, where the street ends, we get out and walk the village's maze. At one house, my guide tells me to wait, then steps inside a fence. He returns a minute later with a tall, 30-ish-looking woman in a print dress. "She has some tortoises she will show you," he says. "Come."
I step into her small house, built with scrap wood and a tin roof. In one corner, hemmed by plywood boards leaning against two beds, is a pen filled with radiated tortoises stacked two and three deep. The woman -- "I don't want my name used," she says -- pulls back a shade-giving sheet hanging on a string above the pen, and the afternoon's blistering daylight falls across the contraband. The tortoises jump and tumble. Each one is the size of a halved basketball. Their black-and-yellow star-burst designs are intricately beautiful, if somewhat dusty. The animals grunt and make hissing sounds, their little yellow heads craning from beneath the high domes of their shells, their tiny clawed feet scratching and scrabbling against the other tortoises' shells and the wooden walls of the pen. I count 24 of them. The room smells dirty. The tortoises do not appear to be in peak health.
Outside, our arrival has attracted a small crowd, and a few men poke their heads inside, menace in their demeanors. Everyone, apparently, knows this is where radiated tortoises are sold, and the men seem to be making sure that no trouble comes to our hostess.
I ask her if she knows that these tortoises are endangered.
"Yes," she says. "I sell them to local people for food, starting at 5,000 Malagasy francs" -- about $1.35. "For people who aren't local, I sell them beginning at about 15,000 francs. Sometimes I sell them for much more than that. That depends on how many tortoises I have at the time, also who is buying them." Does she know what the nonlocal people who buy tortoises do with them? The woman looks at me, then glances at the shanty's dirt floor. "I don't want to talk about that," she says. "I don't know who those people are. All I know is that about once a week, usually late at night, a pirogue lands on the darkest part of the beach and someone comes and gets me, and we go and unload tortoises. The pirogue always lands on the beach. Never in the port."
She won't talk about where the tortoises go from there, or who does the exporting. There are intimations, however, that this is how smuggling systems are usually set up: no one knows too much about anyone else's part in the network. This way, even if someone gets caught, the pipeline can't be pieced together.
In the pen, the tortoises are still grunting and hissing, trying to escape. The woman grabs a few, re-arranging them; the thumping of their shells initiates even more bedlam.
As the woman lifts one of the larger tortoises from the pen, another woman steps inside the shanty. She is carrying an infant. The baby, it happens, belongs to the tortoise merchant. It is perhaps 3 months old. The woman sets the baby on a bed next to the tortoise pen, and the tortoise merchant lays the tortoise on its back near the infant. The baby lies helplessly on its back, too. Both are thrusting and kicking their hands and feet into the air.
The tortoise merchant lifts her baby, cradling it in one arm. With her free hand, she grabs the tortoise's carapace and flips it, with an unceremonious thunk, back into the pen, sending the animals into yet another round of grunting and hissing. The interview, she says, is over. It is time to nurse the baby.
Just one more question, I say: "Where do these tortoises come from?"
"From the south, a place many miles down the beach," she says. "From a place somewhere near the town of Betioky."
Betioky is a village of sand-floored wood- en huts at the edge of the Mozambique Channel. The air is hot and dry, and a nonstop gale howls across the sand and sea. At the far edge of the lagoon, a half-mile off the shore, the deep azure ocean hammers the reef, waves frothing white against the palette of blues on a sea-and-sky horizon.
It took an entire day to drive from Tulear, less than 100 miles, passing through rock-escarpment valleys, cactus-and-baobab savanna, spiny chaparral and, finally, the low pine and scrub of this sandy dune beach.
Along the route, a traveler can readily see what an ecosystem devoured to nothing looks like. For stretches that seem endless, the earth has been burned and seared to broken and charred stone. The area was originally logged and set aflame to create grazing areas, but a few years of low rainfall -- a climatic change perhaps partly hastened by the biological one -- have left it barren. No people. No lizards skittering up the roadbed ahead of the car as they do across the rest of Madagascar. It is a land consumed down to lifelessness.
Then, at the far end of this blotchy desert, the deep blue of the sea rises above the low dunes, and a narrow rind of life clings tight. In Betioky, the children are often naked, the adults barely dressed in rags. Electricity is still many miles away. The village's fishermen, who have seen their fortunes dwindle after overfishing much of the reef, use patchy sails made from burlap sacks to propel their dugouts. The sand is a pale white, so clean it nearly fluoresces. Beneath a Crayola-yellow sun and deep blue sky, small octopuses hang drying from racks in the afternoon heat, shifting in the wind.
I drop my baggage in Betioky and, after asking some questions in town, head off-road along the coast. After winding through the scrub and pine for five or six miles, I arrive at the place where, I was told, radiated tortoises are caught by an outlaw band. Their patron -- father to most, clan leader to others -- is a skinny, ebony-skinned man named Benjamin. He's 53 and lives in a prehistoric structure: a tiny, three-foot-tall mound of loose-woven pine boughs with an open cooking fire on its sand floor. The hut is set in a ravine, one dune off the beach. The afternoon's idiot wind continues to howl over our heads, occasionally whipping at the boughs of Benjamin's house, making it hard for us to speak at a polite distance.
Benjamin is wearing only a thin wrap of sarong, a rag with brightly printed colors. He is understandably suspicious -- he knows that collecting tortoises is illegal. But soon, after I promise "No police, no police," he calms down.
"Yes, we get them most every day," he says. He reaches into his shelter and extracts a sack with five radiated tortoises, from a near-adult 20-pounder to a youthful specimen of perhaps 2. I'm surprised by the vibrancy of their colors -- their shells are like inlaid wood, their amber yellows and dark browns and midnight blacks practically giving off their own light. The difference between these healthy, newly collected specimens and the ones I saw in Tulear, further up the pipeline, is astounding. In fact, until seeing these, I hadn't understood why these tortoises are so prized.
Benjamin tells me that I am a day late. Today is Wednesday, and just yesterday he sent an outrigger full of tortoises to Tulear -- it probably arrived late last night. "It was beautiful," he says. "A boatful of them. Eighty tortoises in bags. They were not the largest ones, but we got 1,000 Malagasy francs" -- about 30 cents -- "for each of them."
There are not as many of these tortoises as there used to be, Benjamin says. "It's like the fishing. For 51 of my 53 years I have been a fisherman here. Now the fishing has gotten too hard, and I am growing too old. It is far harder work than collecting tortoises. But collecting tortoises is far more risky. Still, I have to. I have to eat. I have to feed myself and my family, and the fishing has been nearly used up."
I ask if he understands the restrictions, if protections on the tortoise make sense.
"The tortoises are here, and I have to eat," he says again. "That is all I need to know. My people have always done this. They have collected what is nearby for food and money. Why should that change?"
He smiles, confounded, as I mention -- somewhat absurdly, I'm aware -- the opinions of biologists and global eco-congresses. "We do this to eat," he keeps saying. "We are human. We need to eat." He smiles again and puts the tortoises back inside their sack.
I ask Benjamin if he is going tortoise hunting tomorrow, and if I can go along.
"Yes," he says. "Tomorrow we will go to the best collecting place. It is a distance away. There are many tortoises there. We can collect many in an hour. Ones much bigger than we get here, along the beach. Along the beach now, the tortoises are becoming hard to find. They are being depleted, like the fishing."
We make arrangements to meet at 5 A.M.
That night, although I'm offered a shack in Tulear, I opt to sleep on the beach. The wind is fresh, almost overpowering the din of waves breaking across the reef. The air is so clear that every star of the Southern Hemisphere seems visible. All night long, as I wrestle with the twisty economics of the radiated tortoise and the ground boa and the danger of collapsing ecosystems in the face of people trying to feed themselves, the constellations march steadily overhead.
If fishing has become too difficult, why shouldn't Benjamin turn to collecting tortoises for profit? People worldwide have always eaten and sold what's available -- why should Benjamin starve because far-off biologists and statesmen decide the radiated tortoise is now off-limits?
"When the gendarmes catch me with tortoises," Benjamin told me earlier, "I can give them money and they forget about it. The police understand. But when the World Wildlife Fund comes out twice a year, I make sure not to have any tortoises in my possession. If they catch you, you are going to court and to prison. To me, they have the problem backward -- let the tortoise live, so I can starve."
It strikes me that telling Benjamin not to hunt tortoises is a bit like telling an Iowa farmer: "Sorry, you can't grow corn anymore, even if that's your livelihood. The inhabitants of Mars think it's a bad idea."
And then I think of something I heard months earlier from Robert S. Anderson, senior trial counsel for the wildlife and marine resources section at the Department of Justice and the enforcement officer for Cites in Geneva. "The people who smuggle these animals into the U. S. usually aren't hobbyists gone astray," he said. "They're not doing this to eat. They're not trying to save the species. They're out to make a buck."
And I know that he's right, too.
So where does the shift happen? At what point does a radiated tortoise go from a piece of nature's bounty to contraband? Is it when they're dumped into the outrigger on Benjamin's beach, or into the darkened pens of Tulear? Or as they exit the pipeline in Orlando -- now worth hundreds or thousands of times more than they were in Madagascar?
On my way back along this beach, looking at the stars, I think of all the animals. Snakes in Asia and the United States. Birds from Guyana and Central America. Tigers in India and Siberia. Black rhinos. Red-kneed tarantulas. Black bears. According to the planet's most eminent biologists, the pace of biodiversity's decay is speeding up. And there is too much demand to discourage Benjamin and his colleagues around the world from supplying.
It's 4:28 A.M. In the east, the first slice of sunrise climbs into the sky. Off the beach, fishermen are already steering their square-rigged boats across the lagoon toward the reef. Soon the light of the sun blots out the stars, and in the village behind me roosters start crowing.
Forty-five minutes later, I arrive at Benjamin's camp, ready for a morning of tortoise hunting. We begin hiking to the collecting area, and in the cool of the morning the six men in Benjamin's hunting group say little. To me, they're a slightly threatening bunch. Wearing ragged clothes and broken shoes, each man carries a sharpened machete, and I can't help but think that I may have asked Benjamin too many questions the night before. Maybe he and his men think I'm a policeman. Might they set their machetes on me out in the bush?
An hour later, after hopscotching through burned-over savanna and intact chaparral, Benjamin points into the forest. "This is it," he says. We head away from the road, and within minutes we are walking through groves of low eucalyptus trees. The men spread out, and all across the area I can hear them hollering their good fortune.
"Got a large one," somebody yells.
"Another here," someone else shouts.
Benjamin has yet to find a tortoise. He searches beneath the eucalyptus shrubs, pressing back their branches to look around the roots. "The tortoises like it deep beneath the bushes," he says. "They eat the leaves and use the brush for shade."
Ahead, he points. "Ah," he says. "There."
Just beneath the edge of a shrub, a mature radiated tortoise -- large as a boulder -- rests in the shadows. As Benjamin approaches, the tortoise hisses and tries to escape deeper beneath the eucalyptus, but it is too late. Benjamin flips the tortoise onto its back, grasping its carapace at a natural handle where its left rear leg protrudes. The tortoise stares at Benjamin with its black, almond-shaped eyes. As Benjamin stands, holding the tortoise against his thigh, the tortoise urinates -- a thin, red liquid that reeks of ammonia. "There it is," Benjamin says, laughing. "He thinks it will save him now."
Within an hour, Benjamin has caught nine tortoises. At one point, he finds two adults with a baby, the size of a small stone, wedged beneath them. He collects them all and, stripping a swath of bark from a tree with his machete, pulls the bark apart into several long strips. He then loops and ties the strips at the natural seam where the tortoises' bottom and top shells connect. It's a quick, neat trick. Soon, all the tortoises have a small handle, and Benjamin finds a long windfallen branch, smooths it with his machete and lashes each tortoise to the pole. He is working quickly, humming a little song to himself. "A very good day," he says.
By the time we return to the road, the other men are there as well. An hour and a half has passed since we went into the forest. They have taken 54 mature radiated tortoises from the wild, plus a number of young ones -- which I can't accurately count -- which they either tied beneath the larger tortoises or stuffed into their pockets. It has been a banner day. If not sold as a Christmas meal to someone in Tulear, each tortoise will be worth at least $2,000 once smuggled out of Madagascar, with the most exquisite of them commanding prices as high as $10,000. When this haul is transferred into pirogues on the beach near Betioky, Benjamin and his clan will take in roughly $16.
It is hard to imagine that two hours ago I was afraid of these guys. Now they are slapping my back and dancing, ecstatic at their harvest.
As we begin home, Benjamin tells me that the radiated tortoises now live in a very limited area, which is shrinking all the time. He tells me, too, that he knows each of the adult tortoises he collected today is older than he is. He knows, he says, that the tortoises will soon be gone.
"What will you do for food," I ask him, "when the tortoises disappear?"
Benjamin looks at me, my question flapping nervous as a bird behind his dark eyes. He stares down for a long moment, scanning the red soil. He shakes his head. He smiles. "I don't know," he says.

HEADLINE: How Towns Are Making Investments In Farmland

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
RIDGEFIELD officials, faced with the loss of one of the last remaining family farms in town, last year bought the development rights to the 101-acre property on Lounsbury Road for $2.1 million. By a vote of 1,800 to 1,300, townspeople decided to keep the fruit trees and vegetable fields from being turned into building lots.
And because the town did not purchase the property outright, the Brewster family or other families can continue to farm it -- and the town will not have to maintain the livestock barns and stone walls. 
 "We didn't really want to get involved in owning the property," said Bernard P. Dzielinski, chairman of the Board of Finance in Ridgefield. "But we have appraisals that put the commercial value of the property at $3.2 million, so we got it for about two-thirds of market value. I guess people decided it was a good investment."
"It's a good way to augment what the state of Connecticut has been doing," he said. "But you have to have a fairly unique situation. The owner has to be willing to take part in the transaction, or it isn't going to work. This can't be done by someone who wants to get the maximum profit out of a property."
North Branford has taken the process even further. It set up a special account this fiscal year, with an initial appropriation of $125,000, to acquire open space or farms. "There was a recognition by the town that farmland is starting to disappear in town, acre by acre, inch by inch," said Frank B. Connolly, North Branford's town manager. The town has also established a Rural Preservation Committee, with members from the Planning and Zoning Commission, Town Council and farming community.
"North Branford is going through a transition, the change from a rural to a suburban community," Mr. Connolly said. "There's an ongoing sewer construction program we've had to get into, there's a lot of subdivision activity going on, and there's a lot of other things happening. This was a general recognition that we had to do something in response, or we would wake up some day and say, 'Where did all the farmland go?' "
Joseph J. Dippel, director of the Farmland Preservation program for the State Department of Agriculture, said more towns across the state are considering how to retain their rural roots in the face of a dwindling state program aimed at preserving farmland. During this fiscal year, the state budget for farmland preservation was cut 25 percent, to $3 million. Since the program was established in the 1970's it has acquired 167 farms totaling 25,450 acres. The goal is to preserve 130,000 acres of farmland.
"We're encouraging municipal efforts more than ever, because if we can show municipal support for the program, we can probably build a stronger case for more state support," Mr. Dippel said.
The degree of commitment to farmland and open space preservation varies from town to town.
"Most towns have some mechanism for accepting farmland into trust, but very few have a funded program for the purchase of development rights," Mr. Dippel said. "Most towns don't develop an appreciation for this type of program until there is little farmland left. At that point, it's too late. The land is going to be very expensive and difficult to farm because it's surrounded by subdivisions and other developed uses that are not going to appreciate the noise and odors associated with farming."
But many towns are moving forward more rapidly. Mr. Dippel said Shelton has accepted gifts of land for preservation, and Sharon has begun a program that will allow it to purchase development rights to farms. And several towns have expressed an interest in a Federal program that would allow sharing the cost of farmland preservation among the state, town and Federal governments. Connecticut got $1 million under the program this fiscal year; only California, Pennsylvania and Maryland got more.
Richard D. Schultz, the Planning and Zoning Administrator in Shelton, said there were at least three dairy farms in town when he was growing up there, but the last one closed just last year. There are fewer than 2,000 acres of active farmland left in town, which is the reason Shelton is developing a preservation policy as part of its open space plan, and the aldermen recently adopted an Agricultural Land Preservation Fund.
"I've seen the suburban sprawl eat up a lot of our open space area," Mr. Schultz said. "Shelton is now primarily single-family homes on one-acre lots. And a lot of the farmers who are left are at an age where they are getting ready to retire. That's why it's imperative that each town have a plan, and a funding mechanism, so those property owners know they can go to public officials first."
Avon is also considering a farmland preservation policy, said its Town Planner, Steven M. Kushner. There are four remaining farms in town, all large operations. The owner of one is in his 80's and none of his children want to run it, Mr. Kushner said, and with building lots fetching $150,000 to $225,000, "There would be a lot of pressure on his heirs to develop that property."
The town wrote to the State Department of Agriculture to try to encourage that agency to purchase the development rights to the town's remaining farms, he said, but there has been no response.
"There have been some very preliminary discussions about the town stepping in," Mr. Kushner said. The town has discussed purchasing the farms and leasing them to farmers who would operate them, or offering some sort of tax break, or making a joint application with the farmer for state or federal aid.
"The purchase of open space outright is a difficult thing to explain to taxpayers," Mr. Kushner said. Last year the town had to try three times to pass a referendum on $22 million for renovations at the high school.
"My feeling is, if you have trouble getting approval when you have a case like that, where the roof is leaking and the computers are inadequate, I don't know what kind of response you're going to get seeking money to buy open space," Mr. Kushner said.
Not all the efforts are geared strictly toward farmland preservation. Cheshire, for instance, has spent $10 million purchasing 800 acres of open space in the last 10 years, but the only farm acquired so far has been a tree farm.
"We're always aggressively seeking other farms, but none of them are up for sale right now," said the Cheshire Town Planner, Richard A. Pfurr. There are about 10 active farms in town, primarily raising bedding plants.
"The program has enjoyed tremendous support," Mr. Pfurr said. The voters typically give us $1 million a year, and one year they gave us $3 million." He said anti- development sentiment was what got the program started, but the results are what have kept it going -- townspeople buy their Christmas trees at one farm protected by the program, and hike through rugged terrain on Prospect Ridge, in another 160 acres the town has preserved.
Mr. Pfurr said the town has set a goal of putting 1,800 acres into open space status, "But that doesn't mean we're going to stop there."
Old Saybrook and Essex are also discussing what could become one of the first joint purchases of a large tract of open space. They are considering some type of cooperation between the towns and local land trusts to acquire a 900-acre property that straddles the border, said Old Saybrook's First Selectman, Laurence F. Reney. The family is asking $2.5 million for the property, which he said is about half its value on the open market.
Mr. Reney said a pond on the property serves as a local water supply, and there has been discussion of developing something that would not threaten water quality.
"From the state's point of view, they're probably looking for property that has more prime farmland," Mr. Reney said. "But we have other reasons for wanting to see it preserved, including economic reasons. If someone bought it and put 300 homes up there, it would impact the community heavily," Mr. Reney said. "There would be more children in the schools, and more demand for police and fire services, and so forth."

HEADLINE: L.I. Schools Wary of Plan To Increase State Aid

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
SHAKEN by years of reductions in state aid, education officials on Long Island are reacting skeptically to Gov. George E. Pataki's plan to increase state aid and cut school taxes.
The plan, which the Legislature would vote on, has support from Republican legislators and Long Island groups concerned about high taxes. But after initial uncertainty, local school officials say the initiative is filled with hidden dangers and is based on optimistic economic expectations. 
 Mr. Pataki's five-year $3.4 billion plan, the highlight of his budget proposal, calls for a dollar-for-dollar increase in state aid to make up for school-tax cuts of 27 percent for an average homeowner by the fifth year of the plan. The cuts would be achieved by giving homeowners a $30,000 tax exemption -- $50,000 for people 65 or older -- on the assessed values of their houses based on a statewide median house value of $110,000. On Long Island exemptions would be adjusted up, to reflect higher house values. The state would pay the school districts the amounts that the homeowners would be exempted from.
Assemblyman Thomas F. Barraga, Republican of West Islip, a former member of the Education Committee, said the plan was a major initiative that embraced the best of past Republican proposals. "He is the first governor to put together a five-year plan that combines the two elements of property-tax reduction and an increase in state aid," Mr. Barraga said. "If this plan is destroyed it will be destroyed by the educational community. The best message to them is to embrace this program because it won't be back again."
The critics said the plan did not redress the disproportionately large loss of state aid that Long Island has had in the last seven years, compared to other regions, most of which have had increased aid.
The president of the Nassau and Suffolk School Boards Association, Lorraine M. Deller, said Long Island school officials firmly supported cutting the property taxes that paid for schools. But local boards, she said, had been compelled to raise taxes for five years in response to cuts in aid and "the state's withdrawal from its responsibilities."
"On the face of it, this proposal looks wonderful," Mrs. Deller said. "But when you get into it, it's not good for Long Island."
A study last year by the Long Island Association and the Long Island Educational Coalition found that aid to local districts declined, 22.38 percent in Nassau and 12.43 percent in Suffolk, from 1990 to 1995. Aid to other districts increased 3.5 percent.
In the five years the operating budgets for schools increased, 12.4 percent in Nassau, 9.7 percent in Suffolk and 12.4 percent statewide, the study said.
In what Mrs. Deller and school officials said showed the effects of lower aid and an increasing reliance on property taxes, property taxes increased 33 percent in Nassau and 23 percent in Suffolk.
The officials agreed with backers of Mr. Pataki's plan that shifting costs from property owners to the state appeared to be favorable for Long Island, where school taxes make up more than 60 percent of total property taxes in some districts and where homeowning predominates.
But the officials said the plan was vague on crucial details and depended heavily on an unreliable Legislature to allocate money annually to reimburse schools for lost tax revenues.
"Is it going to be at the whim of each and every legislator each year?" Mrs. Deller asked. "If that money has to come through the state budget process each year, we have no confidence the money will be made up."
Under the plan, the officials said, part of the lottery revenues used for school aid would be diverted to reimburse the districts for lost property taxes. The reduction in aid would then be made up by using other state money. The officials said it was unclear where the state would find that money.
"There is no guarantee we will get those dollars back," said Robert E. Lupinskie, chairman of the legislation committee for the Nassau and Suffolk School Boards Association. He said the uncertainty would be even greater in an economic downturn.
Mr. Barraga said such concerns echoed those heard when Mr. Pataki proposed to cut income taxes. "When we first started the tax cuts, the same questions were there," he said. "And we ended 1996 with a $1.3 billion surplus."
Mr. Barraga said Mr. Pataki had also revived a "rainy day" fund with $360 million that would be a cushion in a downturn. But Mr. Barraga said the state was "fiscally much stronger" than in the early 90's.
Last week Moody's Investment Services, which rates bonds, said Mr. Pataki's budget plan depended heavily on continued economic growth and cuts in Medicaid. The analysis also noted concern about the high debt load.
Other aspects of Mr. Pataki's proposal are also meeting opposition from Long Island school officials They said they were troubled by a requirement that districts limit tax increases to 4 percent a year or the rise in the Consumer Price Index, whichever was lower. The officials said that would harm districts with problems like shortfalls in aid, increases in enrollment, unexpected expenses, higher costs for contracts for supplies and labor or shifts in assessed values. A provision that the cap could be broken with the approval of two-thirds of a district's voters would not be a remedy, the critics said.
"Where in New York State did any school district budget receive more than two-thirds of the votes?" the co-chairman of the Long Island Education Coalition, Dr. Bruce G. Brodsky, asked. "That's just not going to happen."
Dr. Brodsky said the requirement would give control to a minority of voters. "I really have a problem with that," he said. "This is a democracy. We try to do things by simple majorities."
He said a limit of two budget votes a year compounded the problem.
Supporters of the plan said the cap assured that districts did not raise taxes as they were receiving greater amounts of total revenues from the state.
"I don't see this as a problem," Mr. Barraga said. "The idea is to control your spending and your costs, so you don't have to increase your budget above the 4 percent or the rate of inflation."
"The 4 percent cap is manageable, provided that allowances are made for increased enrollment and bond issues for capital improvements," said Rayelle Weber Tyler, chairwoman of the Nassau Citizens Budget Committee.
Mrs. Tyler said a two-thirds vote to override the cap would be possible. "People are responsible and intelligent enough that if something that will seriously impact their district is communicated properly, they will pass the budget," she said.
Of more immediate concern, she said, are inequities in assessments in Nassau, where studies show that assessments based on 1938 construction costs are too high in some lower-income areas and too low in some higher-income areas.
"The assessed valuations on which the tax rate is based must be fair and equitable, and that is not the case in Nassau County," Mrs. Tyler said.
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall also criticized the plan for failing to address assessment inequities. In an analysis released on Feb. 4, Mr. McCall said that limiting the tax increase to 4 percent was unwise.
"Although the proposal responds to popular frustration with rising taxes, it is fundamentally flawed," he said. "First, there are many reasons why a local levy might need to increase by an amount in excess of inflation, including the need to improve standards or compensate for the loss in state aid or non-property-tax revenues. Property levies often have to be modified for reasons having little to do with program spending."
School officials said Mr. Pataki's plan appeared to have a good chance of being enacted. "It's a nonelection year, and they tend to do things a little more abrasively in nonelection years," said Dr. Brodsky.
Mr. Barraga predicted that the Legislature would approve the plan.
The school boards association has scheduled a workshop on Feb. 25 to explain details of the plan to members of school boards.
"It's always good for people to know as much as possible, because the headlines in the paper are so favorable and yet the details are not as good as the headlines sound," the executive director of the group, Alice F. Willett, said.
The school officials said that almost unnoticed in the budget was a shift of $100 million for special education from the state to local districts. They said the plan to limit school taxes was proposed as the Board of Regents was raising academic standards for public schools.
"If you look at the Regents proposal," Mr. Lupinskie said, "each year the standards get a little higher. Meeting those standards will require additional resources, and yet there are no dollars attached. So what we have in essence is an unfunded mandate."

HEADLINE: Law Schools Optimistic on Jobs

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
DESPITE intense competition, the two law schools on Long Island are optimistic over prospects for their graduates.
Hofstra estimated that 92 percent of its 264 graduates in the Class of '95 had found jobs within six months of graduation, said Michael Schiumo, a senior assistant dean. The rate for the 225 graduates of the Touro Law School in 1995 was 75 to 80 percent, said Dean Howard Glickstein. 
 U.S. News & World Report indicated in its issue of March 18 that 82 percent at Hofstra and 66 percent at Touro had found law jobs in six months.
Both deans said those statistics were invalid because they included graduates whom the survey did not reach. Mr. Schiumo said the study counted 75 percent of the unknowns as unemployed.
"It's not always the people you think will be quickly employed who are," he said. "A lot depends on interviews and other factors, which makes it unfair to include the unknown population in the statistics."
Robert Morse, research director of the America's Best Colleges for U.S. News, said if the magazine had used a percentage higher than 25 percent, law schools that had large numbers of unknown responses could have had higher success rates that would not be valid. "It's a credible way of putting all schools on a level playing field," he said.
Last year 274 students graduated from Hofstra, and Touro had 225, one-third part-timers.
Competition for jobs, Mr. Glickstein said, has intensified since 1986, when at least 85 percent of Touro graduates found law-related jobs in six months. The market has become tighter, he added, and it can often take up to a year for qualified candidates to find employment.
"Years ago law firms believed that students went to law school to learn to think like a lawyer," Mr. Glickstein said. "Then it was their responsibility to teach them how to practice law. Today, because of the competition and intensity to try to accumulate billable hours, many law firms are looking for people with practical experience."
The profession has become financially driven, Mr. Schiumo said, adding:
"Law firms are seeking people who can make contributions quickly, which has put more pressure on students to have a specific area of focus. As law is getting more specialized, students are expected at an earlier point to pick an area of law in which they are interested."
Among the 1995 Hofstra graduates who found jobs, according to Mr. Schiumo, 65 percent went to private practice, 14 percent found employment in business and industry, 11 percent went into governmental work, including agencies and prosecutors' offices, 7 percent took judicial clerkships, 2 percent found jobs with public-interest organizations, and 1 percent went into teaching.
That breakdown has been fairly consistent over a few years, he added, with the most significant changes being a decline in governmental jobs and an increase in jobs related to business and industry.
"In some cases," Mr. Schiumo said, "graduates become the legal counsel for a corporation, while others are doing different things within companies tangentially related to law, using their law experience. One example was a recent graduate who started a company that helps businesses get set up on the Internet, and many of his clients are law firms."
Touro graduates, Mr. Glickstein said, are substantially represented in the Suffolk County District Attorney's office. Graduates, he added, have been most successful finding jobs with public agencies, small- and medium-size law firms.
A majority of graduates from both schools, the deans said, are choosing to remain on the Island.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Rental Construction Revives to Meet Rising Demand

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
STRONG demand for market-rate rental apartments along with available financing is nudging developers to start or plan new projects.
Evidence of that are the buildings containing hundreds of rental apartments under way or about to begin along the Hudson River waterfront. The activity is also creeping into other areas of northern and central New Jersey, where new construction has been spotty for the last two decades. 
 Estimates are that the rental vacancy rate for well-located quality apartments in those areas is under 5 percent, said Jan L. Decker, a partner at Kruser, Welsh & Cirz, a real estate services firm based in Morristown. "With vacancies low and expenses stable, apartments have remained among the top five investments nationally for the last five years," added Ms. Decker. Aware of that, developers are responding to the supply-demand imbalance, she said.
Adding to the motivation of builders to put up rental properties is a bill working its way through the Legislature that would make permanent a 1987 state law that exempts new apartments from rent control, which developers maintain has been among the barriers to construction. The current law, which expires this year, did not result in a huge amount of rentals because of the housing recession. But industry analysts and developers said the new law would add certainty to the process and encourage building.
"Knowing this law is in place should help set the tone for planning projects in the future," said Nathan Slovin, executive vice president of the New Jersey Apartment Association, a trade group in East Brunswick.
Still, he said, the challenges that have kept construction limited persist. Among them are the scarcity of properly zoned sites and high land and construction costs. And municipalities continue to resist multifamily residences, particularly rentals, because they are perceived as taxing local resources, especially schools.
Moreover, many of the new projects will rise on once commercially zoned parcels. Others are being developed as a result of towns wanting -- or being forced through builder lawsuits -- to meet their obligation under the state's Mount Laurel doctrines. Those doctrines require municipalities to provide opportunities for developing housing for people making 50 to 80 percent of the median income in the area.
"Every one of the opportunities we had to build rentals we created," said Jeffrey B. Albert, vice president of Avalon Properties in Wilton, Conn., with offices in Princeton. Avalon has developed five rental complexes with a total of 1,500 units in suburban New Jersey and is building a 745-unit project on the Jersey City waterfront.
Mr. Albert, who said said demand far outstripped supply, said that "towns have the outdated image of rentals as two-story ugly buildings with mattresses hanging from the windows."
"The new rentals," he added, "are not that."
Like other developers, Mr. Albert is staying the course because of the ready market in the state, where he said there is an unmet need from a large number of people who cannot or choose not to buy. He said Avalon had at least three other suburban projects with 1,166 more apartments planned in Fort Lee, Freehold and central Morris County.
Those reasons are drawing others, like Pinnacle Communities Ltd. of Short Hills, into the rental arena. It expects to start construction by fall on two projects. One -- with 352 apartments, 52 of which will be affordable to lower- or moderate-income tenants -- will rise on a long dormant site off Route 208 in Fair Lawn. The other, for which the final details and legal issues are being hammered out, is in Upper Saddle River and will have either 88 units plus a movie theater or 186 apartments. In either case 39 units will be set aside for lower-income tenants, said Brian M. Stolar, a principal.
AT both, most of the market-rate units will have two bedrooms. Rents are to start in excess of $1,000.
"We cannot be that short-sighted to think everyone wants to buy," said Mr. Stolar. "Meeting the needs of those people has been sorely lacking in the past in New Jersey."
The demand is coming from young single professionals and married couples as well as divorced people and empty-nester couples. Because of the economics of new construction most of the new projects, aside from their Mount Laurel units, are geared to the upper-middle to high end of the market.
Among them is Excelsior Two, now under way on Prospect Avenue in Hackensack. The 18-story, 267-unit building, which has no Mount Laurel units, is the twin to one completed in 1988. The housing recession and savings-and-loan debacle of the 80's delayed construction until now, said Anthony Palmeri, a principal of the local Sebring Associates, the developer.
With the demand for rentals today and the solid occupancy at Excelsior One, now is a good time to build, he said. The second tower, like the first, will have studio to three-bedroom apartments plus penthouses 640 to 2,700 square feet in size. The buildings will be linked by a 9,000-square-foot structure with a health club. Monthly rents start at $950 for studios and go to $4,500 for penthouses, he said.
In Morristown, the Applied Companies of Hoboken will break ground in May on Chancery Square, with 131 market-rate apartments. It will rise on part of a downtown parking lot on Cattano Avenue, which the company will lease for 98 years from the Morristown Parking Authority.
"It is a good core location," said Michael I. Barry, an Applied vice president, noting the "large office population in the county and the city, as well as the local nightlife." It also is near I-287 and the N.J. Transit train station with direct service to midtown Manhattan.
"Here, as in other quasi-urban areas, there is a pent-up demand for rentals," he said. "A large percentage of people want to live close to where they work or where they can walk to activities." The one- and two-bedroom units, with 700 to 1,050 square feet, will rent for $1,000 to $1,400 a month.
Applied is also building, alone or with partners, a 117-unit luxury rental in New Brunswick and a 299-unit apartment tower on the waterfront in Jersey City, the near-twin of another that was built as a condominium but never occupied, converted to a rental in 1995 and is now fully leased.
Elsewhere in Morristown the Sterling Properties Group of Livingston is building a 20-unit rental with garage parking on a parking lot off Route 27. Monthly rents for the two-bedroom apartments will be slightly higher than the $995 to $1,150 it costs to lease others at area complexes that have long waiting lists, said Joseph Forgione, a Sterling principal.
IN South Plainfield, Westminister Communities, an affiliate of the Kushner Companies of Florham Park, is planning a 160-unit project "because there is always a demand for rentals," said Jeffrey Freireich, a company principal. He also said that the location on a former industrial site on Pomponio Avenue -- not far from I-287 and the people who work in the offices along the highway -- would support the project. Thirty-four units will be for low- and moderate-income families.
Woodland Manor will have one- and two-bedroom units with 800 to 950 square feet of space. Monthly rents will be on par with those in the area, which are $750 to $900, said Mr. Freireich. Construction is expected to start by the summer.
At the same time in Wall Township, Roseland Property Company of Roseland will start Ashton Woods, an up to 160-unit rental on a former retail site off Route 35. The 700- to 1,050-square-foot one- and two-bedroom units will rent for $800 to $1,000 a month. Twenty percent of them will be affordable to low- and moderate-income tenants.
"The demand is here and the pressure to build is high," said Marshall B. Tycher, a principal. He said his company was advancing plans for six other suburban developments with 1,000 more apartments. It also plans rentals along the Hudson River in West New York, including a 276-unit project it will start building next month, added Mr. Tycher.

HEADLINE: A Federal Grant for Greenwich Avenue?

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
FASHIONABLE stores and restaurants as well as a boulevard-like air have caused Greenwich Avenue to be thought of as Fairfield County's version of Fifth Avenue. Indeed, with a Saks Fifth Avenue store and a goodly number of specialty shops catering to the tastes of the affluent, Greenwich Avenue and its side streets may be the toniest shopping district in Connecticut.
So, to many of Greenwich's residents, the news that town officials might be getting a $500,000 Federal grant to help finance the face lift of one block of the mile-long shopping thoroughfare came as something of a surprise and left many townspeople bemused. A Federal grant to beautify a piece of Greenwich Avenue? Surely, someone is jesting or there's some mistake. 
 It is no joke and no mistake. Officials of the state's most affluent community are serious about seeking a Federal grant for half a million dollars for the portion of the avenue between Lewis and Elm streets, and perhaps millions more to upgrade the rest of the avenue with new sidewalks, street lights, benches and potted plants, along with more trees. But in the opinion of some members of the 240-member Greenwich Representative Town Meeting, which must vote on such a proposal, the beautification of Greenwich Avenue is far from being a high-priority item.
"Can you imagine the reaction if people in Greenwich picked up The New York Times and read that Beverly Hills was getting a half-million dollar Federal grant for palm trees to be planted along Rodeo Drive?" said James Boutelle, a member of the R.T.M. "Well, I think some people might think that giving Greenwich that much Federal money to beautify Greenwich Avenue would be similar."
"The avenue does need some improvements -- mostly sidewalk repairs -- but I don't think we need ornate street lamps and expensive benches," said Mr. Boutelle, who is the vice chairman of the town's Community Development Block Grant program. "Certainly such money can be spent on far more important things, like schools and low- and moderate-income housing, which we need in Greenwich contrary to popular thought."
But town officials, including First Selectman Thomas Ragland, maintain that Greenwich Avenue, for all its cachet, needs a face lift, and that improvements on the block between Lewis and Elm -- where the Saks store opened last fall -- would be a start.
"Giving a face lift to Greenwich Avenue is distant in the sense of town priorities -- school projects and new sewers, for example, are much more important -- but while it may not be our biggest concern, it will be the most controversial," said Mr. Ragland, who is an architect and planner. "And while Greenwich Avenue may be at its zenith now -- I don't think you'll find a vacancy on the avenue -- it's best to do your work in such a situation when a place is at its peak."
Mr. Ragland continued: "Also, we send tons of money to the Federal Government and to the state every year, so why shouldn't we get some of it back?" The First Selectman noted, however, that if Greenwich did request and receive a Federal grant, the money would not be available until the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1.
Town officials point out that Federal funds are available for such purposes.
"Some may argue that we should not tap into such funds, but the money is specifically earmarked for streetscape improvement," said the town's Public Works Commissioner, Marcos Madrid, in referring to the Federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Enhancement Act (I.S.T.E.A. and usually referred to as "Iced Tea"), which allocates funds to municipalities for improvements.
John Pugliese, a chairman of the Greenwich Architectural Review Committee and a member of the Greenwich Avenue Enhancement Committee, agrees with Mr. Madrid. "In the past, we've done repairs on the avenue in bits and pieces, and that's been unsatisfactory," said Mr. Pugliese, who is an architect and a real estate broker. "What we need is a master plan for the whole avenue, and this would be a start. But the townspeople are going to have to buy into the project."
That could add up to a sizable amount of money. Leslie Peoples of Vollmer Associates -- the Manhattan-based firm of engineers, architects and planners that has drawn up a master plan for sprucing up the entire avenue -- said the overall cost would be $3.7 million.
The first block's rehabilitation alone is estimated at $750,000; town officials hope that $500,000 would come from the the Federal Government. The plan drawn up by Vollmer Associates calls for installation of street lamps similar to those that graced the avenue more than 50 years ago, along with cast-iron and wood benches.
To many residents of Greenwich, the avenue -- and its police officers directing pedestrian and vehicular traffic -- looks just fine already. "I love it as it is," said Lisa Vitiello, whose restaurant, Mare e Monte, is on the block targeted for the initial improvements.
On the other hand, she said, "I would be willing to contribute as long as the cost is not prohibitive."
Mrs. Vitiello, like several other business owners interviewed, regards inadequate parking space as a "far bigger concern."
"There's been a big drop-off in the customer count on the avenue because there aren't enough places to park," said Irving Grannick, who has owned Grannick's Pharmacy on Greenwich Avenue since it opened 55 years ago. "I don't think a face lift is going to bring people back. It's the lack of parking that keeps people away. We're making more and more deliveries because people call and say they can't find parking places."
Jerry Baxendale, the owner of the D. W. Rogers department store (which has been on Greenwich Avenue since 1890) said, "Greenwich Avenue is a very unique street and I'd be willing to contribute toward improvements, but we have to be conservative about it."
Some Greenwich residents feel that spending millions of dollars to enhance an already-attractive thoroughfare does not make sense in light of other needs. "The cost could be staggering, even with Federal help," said John Anner, a lawyer and the chairman of the Finance Committee of the Representative Town Meeting.
"We're now in the process of spending $45 million for capital improvements at the high school," he said, "and we have to spend millions to provide more space at other schools as the school population grows. So how can we justify spending a lot of money to beautify Greenwich Avenue? It seems frivolous."
But John Margenot, who stepped down in 1995 after serving five two-year terms as First Selectman, said a face lift for Greenwich Avenue was a necessity. "The avenue is the spine of the town, and we have to keep it esthetically pleasing to attract people," he said.
Mr. Margenot first proposed such a plan four years ago, only to have it rejected by the R.T.M. on the ground that it would cost taxpayers too much money.
"I know some people are leery of asking for Federal assistance," said Mr. Margenot, alluding to past reluctance by Greenwich officials in seeking Federal funds for projects at town beaches or other recreational areas for fear that such financing would force the town to allow non-residents to use the areas.
"But I don't think we should expect the merchants to pay for the face lift," he said.
"There's no reason why we shouldn't take advantage of Federal money if it's available.
"After all, Greenwich people pay taxes, too. And contrary to what some people think, we're not all Rockefellers in Greenwich."

HEADLINE: The Venerable History of Incivility

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
INCIVILITY in bipartisan politics and government in America is as old as the Republic.
Benjamin R. Barber, the author of "Jihad vs. McWorld," about the impact of tribalism and the global economy on civility and democracy (Times Books, 1995) said political discourse in America has always been, to a degree, fairly raucous but with certain limits. 
 When Alexis de Tocqueville toured America in the mid-1830's, Professor Barber said, he was impressed with "the local spirit of liberty" and the "powerful participation" of citizens in local government, whether at a New England town meeting or a gathering of settlers at a frontier fort.
There always has existed "a rhetorical incivility within the boundaries of bipartisan politics which is a healthy manifestation of political conflict and disagreement," Dr. Barber said. "That's what democracy is about."
But, said Dr. Barber, the Walt Whitman Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University, those boundaries have eroded and a second kind of incivility has emerged.
"Divisive rhetoric has become not only disagreement between parties but a rejection of the legitimacy of the other side, validating a position that your opponents are immoral, un-American and possibly worthy of being subjected to violence," he said. Opponents become "enemies of the Republic and the political process itself."
Professor Barber added, "We've seen the results at abortion clinics, in the far right militia movement and in Oklahoma City."
Ernest Reock, former director of the Center for Government Services at Rutgers University, said that the Open Public Meetings Act that took effect in New Jersey in 1976 may have inadvertently provided more of an opportunity for confrontation.
The law was designed to open to the public governmental meetings that had been closed, but, Professor Reock said, "while there were lots of negative aspects to closed meetings, you didn't have people coming out and shouting at their officials because their officials just weren't there to shout at."
Historically, Professor Barber said, alienation and willingness to indulge in uncivil oratory have increased the higher up the political ladder one goes. In recent years, there has been "a trickle-down effect" to the local level.
Even on respectable national forums like the McLaughlin Group and Crossfire, incivility substitutes for discourse, he said.
"People yell at each other," Dr. Barber said. "They talk at the same time. There's almost no listening and no visible modification of opinion and there is a vilification of opponents, all of which is taken as ordinary discourse. It's hardly a surprise then at the local P.T.A or block meeting people mimic that form of discourse. It's that trickle-down effect."

HEADLINE: Point of Disorder

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
COUNCILMAN Thomas A. DeGise sat in his shirt sleeves for three hours in City Council chambers, under the blank gaze of mayors dating to 1838, in portraits, and in front of the often hostile glare of 100 taxpayers, on wooden benches.
In the course of the hearing -- on the budget -- he and his Council colleagues heard themselves characterized as "puppets of the mayor" and "politically expedient," ramming through a financial package that was "a sham," "a boondoggle" and "a gimmick to get re-elected." 
 "It could have been worse," Mr. DeGise, who is council president, said afterward. "This was very tame compared to some hearings we've had."
He had had only two hours' sleep and, after working all day as a job placement officer at the city's Snyder High School, he felt tired. He took off his eyeglasses now and then to rub his eyes.
"This is the fourth budget I've voted on," Mr. DeGise said, after 21 speakers had walked to the microphone and the budget was adopted. "One raised taxes a lot. One cut them a lot. And one kept them the same. The reaction was always the same. They yelled and told us how stupid we are."
Things aren't always as cordial in other New Jersey municipalities. At a meeting in Carteret a few years ago, the mayor punched a resident who he claimed had insulted his wife. In East Brunswick, a man whose shop had been taken over by the town for nonpayment of taxes threatened to shoot officials with a ray gun. And in East Orange, a resident who was arrested while speaking often refers to the council president as Big Bird.
Frustrated and hostile residents; churlish officials; rancorous public meetings. Welcome to democracy, local-government style.
It is an image that runs counter to the notion of participatory government as a sacred tradition whose hallmark is the painting by Norman Rockwell of a dignified American Everyman exercising his constitutional right of free speech at a town meeting while his neighbors listen respectfully.
Today, the artist might have decided to paint a wild-eyed curmudgeon thumping his fist on the lectern to the cheers and jeers of irate taxpayers as he excoriates his elected officials as thieves, scoundrels and knaves.
"We haven't had a war in some time where people have been able to express pent-up aggression on an enemy on the battlefield," said John K. Rafferty, longtime mayor of Hamilton Township. "And so, we zero in on politicians and government."
But Sam Perelli, state chairman of the United Taxpayers of New Jersey, says sometimes extreme action by citizens is warranted to jolt officials out of arrogance and complacency.
"What they're doing is responding to those elected officials who we call 'The We Know What's Best For You Gang,' " Mr. Perelli says. "I believe in civility, but I've also seen where in many cases being civil and respectful got you a laugh behind closed doors and no action."
He added, "It's also been my experience in most cases that councils getting these kinds of abuse have it coming because they do a lot of things behind closed doors and they don't answer questions."
Is this a sign of increasingly hostile times? Or is it just the latest incarnation of a political system that has always suffered from -- or gained zest from -- an in-your-face quality?
It is popular sport for cultural commentators to bemoan the end of civility, or decorum, or courtesy or tact. No longer do we simply register our disapproval in a letter or a petition or with a ballot. We chant, we march, we perform street theater, we even riot. The more outlandish the better, if it lands the participants and their cause on the 6 o'clock news.
MANY officials sit back and let the people have their say, including the gadflies who relentlessly attack them. Many towns put limits on the amount of time a resident can speak. Five minutes has been upheld in court, said Michael Pane, who is the former deputy general counsel of the New Jersey League of Municipalities.
But, in truth, Mr. Pane and other experts on local government say, there is nothing in the law requiring governing bodies to set aside a time for the public to speak at public meetings, except at second reading of an ordinance or at a public hearing on a specific matter under consideration by the governmental body.
At its reorganization meeting last month, the East Orange Council, by a 7-to-3 vote, passed a measure that requires anyone who wants to speak at a regular Council meeting to notify the clerk before 3 P.M. the day of the meeting. Three minutes is the limit. Allowing a person to speak who does not register is at the discretion of the chair.
Only Newark is believed by experts to have a more stringent requirement: potential speakers must sign up 48 hours in advance, but at the meeting the chairman will take a roll-call on whether the person can speak.
The Newark City Clerk, Robert Marasco, said the rule dates to the mid-1950's and is necessary because the state's largest city has a much larger agenda for each meeting, sometimes 200 items.
In East Orange, where strong anti-tax and civic groups have grown and shown opposition to the Mayor and Council in recent years, proponents defend the measure as a way to maintain order and keep meetings from running too long. Critics say it is aimed at quelling dissent.
"No personal attacks will be allowed," the measure says. But what is the difference between personal attack and a legitimate criticism?
"It's a line that's very difficult to define in the abstract," Mr. Pane said.
The lack of civility appears to be growing across the country, according to a poll conducted for U.S. News and World Report last April. Of 1,005 adults polled, 88 percent saw it as a serious problem and 80 percent said it has worsened in the last decade. Those polled blamed political campaigns, as well as television, talk radio and rock music.
In a survey by the National League of Cities released last month, in which public officials were asked to rate conditions in their communities, 18 percent said civility in public life had declined in the last year, while 23 percent said it had improved.
Some New Jersey officials also report an increase in discourtesy, with people becoming more frustrated as towns faced with decreased state and Federal support look for ways to cut expenses. They also appear more cynical about the ethics of officials from the President on down.
"I believe they have become more abusive, but there's also a frustration on the part of the public that they feel they can't reach their elected officials," said Betty Kiss, the East Brunswick Township Clerk and president of the New Jersey Municipal Clerks Association.
"People don't want to spend a lot on taxes and are more cautious about spending," she said. "I think they've become more leery of government because it seems everyday you pick up the newspaper and read where a local or county official has done something illegal."
It is logical that local government is the lightning rod for voter unhappiness. It is the level closest to the people.
"The Mayor and members of the governing body are the most accessible," said William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities. "They live in town, they go to the same churches, and their children go to the same schools.
"In these changing times when state and Federal governments are forcing decisions down to the local level, I see the frustration level getting higher," he said. "So the citizens take it out on the mayor and elected officials. They're the ones who send out the tax bill."
This is true even when the issues are those over which the local governing body exercises no control.
"We've been talked to about nuclear disarmament, the NAFTA treaty -- we have nothing to do with that," said Mr. DeGise, the Council President in Jersey City. "If they're mad at the mayor, they come to yell at us. If they're mad at President Clinton, they come yell at us."
Mayor Rafferty, who has been Mayor of Hamilton for 22 years, said that increased media coverage of politics and government has made constituents better informed about the issues and also more aggressive.
That does not necessarily translate into better knowledge of how government works. In the League of Cities survey, two thirds of elected municipal officials said that citizen involvement in their communities is good or very good. But, they added, residents lack good understanding of the functions of government or their responsibilities.
Marilyn Roman, a former Hudson County freeholder and former Jersey City councilwoman who served briefly as acting mayor, said there are deep-seated problems in Jersey City like an 11 percent unemployment rate and changes in funding formulas that make governing complicated.
"People don't really understand how government works and where the money comes from and what the money is needed for in order for the city to work," Ms. Roman said.
Usually, the discourse at meetings centers on proposals that might affect a neighborhood or a resident's pocketbook: a change in a zoning law that increases traffic, a tax increase. Sometimes comment from citizens causes the governing body to reconsider a course of action and influences the outcome. This is the way local government is supposed to work.
But often the public meeting becomes a stage for a personal drama whose central conflict is us against them.
"I've been accused of everything," Mayor Rafferty said. "From being a thief, being in collusion with every developer in the township, of owning land everywhere from the beaches of North Carolina to the Jersey coast to interest in almost every business in town. It always seems to deteriorate to that point."
Last spring, during debate over rezoning some land for a Walmart store, Mr. Rafferty recalls being called a "raging old bull."
"I didn't mind the raging bull part," he said. "It was the old bull part that got to me."
At a Council meeting in Carteret in June 1992, Mayor Peter J. Sica, who is 56, bolted from his seat and punched a much larger and younger man who had insulted his wife.
As the Mayor tells it, it was during a heated meeting and he was going through the fairly innocuous business of appointing citizens to unpaid positions on a board that would make municipal buildings accessible to the disabled. His wife, who had been serving as the unsalaried chairman of a municipal commission for the disabled for years, was the last. As he said her name, he heard a man in the audience call Mrs. Sica "a whore."
"So I said," Mayor Sica recalled, 'I'm going to come down from here and knock your head right off your shoulders.' And he said, 'Come on.'
"So I did."
During his 15 years as Mayor, Mr. Sica said, he has been called every name in the book and even spit on, but that insult crossed the line.
"I can take any kind of abuse anyone wants to throw at me personally," he said. "I will debate with anybody on the issues, I have no problem with that, and I think that's every American's God-given right."
BUT, the Mayor said, "Unfortunately, a lot of people abuse politicians' rights not realizing we have as many rights as they do." And he added, "There is a point where you overstep reasonable bounds, like when you say something against my wife."
Found guilty in Municipal Court of disorderly conduct, Mr. Sica paid a $300 fine.
"I'd pay $600 to hit him another," Mayor Sica said, chuckling. "But you know, subsequently in all honesty, the guy I hit apologized. He said he was misled by my detractors and has become a good friend of mine. He even worked to get the vote out for me in the next election."
When Betty Kiss took over as clerk of East Brunswick in 1980, a man who had lost his junkyard for nonpayment of taxes stormed into a public meeting. "He said he had a ray gun in his briefcase," she recalled. "I was getting ready to duck down because you just don't know." In December 1995, an East Orange resident, Paul Barnes, was arrested on a charge of disrupting the public meeting by refusing to yield the floor. Seeing the arrest as an attempt to silence him, Mr. Barnes says, "They claim I spoke three minutes overtime."
His conviction in Municipal Court was overturned, but his treatment has made him furious. At a recent meeting, he handed out a flier that pokes fun at the baldness of the chairman who had him ejected and has the head of the present chairwoman imposed on the body of the Sesame Street character Big Bird.
Carol Y. Clark, one of three councilwomen who voted against the measure requiring an early sign-up to speak, said many residents feel as Mr. Barnes does: "disenfranchised."
"I believe," Ms. Clark said, "that was put in to deter citizen participation and to try to shut citizens up and curb negative responses to certain legislators and politicians."
But Councilman Phillip Thigpen, one of seven who voted for the measure, denies the Council has any ulterior motive.
"There are 70,000 people in East Orange and that's not a representative sampling of how the people feel," Mr. Thigpen said. "I think everyone wants to see orderliness. There is no restraint on freedom of expression as some people have characterized."
Municipal officials say they listen to residents who appear to have legitimate concerns and no hidden agendas. They say they also listen to gadflies, regulars who can go through a laundry list of grievances.
"Usually, they have a completely negative stance, no matter who the government is," Ms. Roman said. "They're not there so much because they're good citizens but because they're nitpickers."
Yvonne Balcer, who says she has attended just about every Jersey City Council meeting for the last 10 years, would disagree that she is nitpicker. She calls herself an activist.
At the recent budget meeting, she accused the Council of complicity with Mayor Bret Schundler, attacking a measure she said it was a financial gimmick to cut the municipal portion of the tax rate and assure the Mayor's re-election.
"They see me as a thorn in their side," she said outside the Council chamber. "But if they're going to follow the dictates of the Mayor and not use common sense then I'm going to go up there and say this is wrong."
State Senator Byron Baer, who sponsored the open public meetings act, known as the sunshine law, which requires that governing bodies meet publicly, said that citizens in a democracy should not be spectators but participants. He added that government officials can benefit from their input, even if at times the input is unpleasant and "crosses the line of decency."
ANY chair at a public meeting has the right to see that decorum is maintained," Senator Baer said. "But it doesn't mean that criticism is out of bounds. Just because something is criticism doesn't necessarily make it misconduct, and misconduct doesn't become permissible because it's done to express criticism."
Frank Askin, a general counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union and founder of the Constitutional Litigation Clinic at Rutgers University, said political life dating to the American Revolution has often been "unruly" and "provocative."
"This country was born in provocative and robust debate and discussion, and it wasn't always polite." Mr. Askin said. "The First Amendment doesn't just protect polite speech."
But the strain of hostility in public life can take its toll.
"It winds up you go home, your emotions are upset from the meeting where it became so hostile, and you can't fall asleep," Mrs. Kiss said. "It takes a long time to unwind."
Mr. Dressel said that many people enter government because they want to contribute to their communities but can become disillusioned by the public response to them.
"I hear people in government saying they want to get out," he said. 'It's not fun anymore. Why should I stay involved for a citizenry that is not understanding?' "
Henry Coleman, director of the Center for Government Services at Rutgers University, which is one of the sponsors of an annual contest aimed at fostering better communication between municipal governments and residents, said "lots of good things" are taking place in town government but the residents are not always aware of it.
"Frankly, the contest isn't going to do much for a government that is determined not to communicate with its citizens," Dr. Coleman said. "The closer the government is to the people and the more opportunity people have to interact, the better they understand and appreciate it."
About 25 percent of the municipalities in New Jersey now televise their governmental meetings on cable, Mrs. Kiss said, a development that should mean increased understanding and perhaps more meaningful citizen participation.
But frustration and incivility may increase, too, as the role of the Federal Government diminishes and the burden of programs like welfare is absorbed by the states with the problems hitting closer to home.
Mark Schwartz, president of the National League of Cities, thinks that although incivility has been on the rise in recent years, it has ebbed. He was so concerned with what he saw as increased fractiousness in public life, that as as president-elect he commissioned a study of the issue.
The report, "Connecting Citizens and their Government: Civility, Responsibility and Local Democracy," came out in December and provides examples of how communities around the country are instituting programs to make the relationship between government and citizen more harmonious and constructive.
What prompted Mr. Schwartz's concern was the bombing in Oklahoma City, where he is a councilman.
"After the bombing," he said, "a lot of us would sit around and talk and wonder what would make somebody do something so horrendous as to kill so many people and attack the government when the government is really our neighbors."
He added: "We're all the government."

HEADLINE: A Pillar of City Housing: Tax Relief

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
IN the prosaic parlance of officialdom, they are deadeningly designated: the J-51 Tax Exemption and Abatement Program and Section 421a of the New York State Real Property Tax Law. But for Henrietta Cohen, an 84-year-old widow, and Azizur Rahman, an emigre from Bangladesh, they are lifelines to a decent, affordable home.
And for New York City, they are girders in a jerry-built framework for preserving and creating habitable housing through a system of tax incentives. 
 The J-51 program is intended to encourage the rehabilitation of older housing; the 421a program is designed to stimulate the construction of new buildings. In their present forms, they have evolved because of two judgments about the role of government in housing.
One, which underlies the J-51 program, is that the income of thousands of New York City tenants is insufficient to afford the rents or rent increases that would allow a landlord to finance major rehabilitation work.
The other, underlying the 421a program, is that in much of Manhattan the rents or prices for newly built apartments are high enough to justify a quid pro quo: tax benefits to the market-rate development in return for some new or gut-rehabilitated apartments for lower-income households.
Now the Giuliani administration is preparing to propose a change in the 421a program that would, if previous patterns hold, rekindle the controversy that the abatement programs have historically generated. Critics of the programs have long contended that tax abatements are not needed to generate new construction in the most affluent areas -- particularly midtown Manhattan -- and should not be used there.
At present, the 421a program is available to most of Manhattan south of 96th Street (the so-called exclusion zone) only if developers also create low-income apartments within the building or somewhere else in the city, or if they completely gut and then rehabilitate existing low-income apartments.
Under the proposed change, which requires approval by the State Legislature, developers could also be granted a Section 421a benefit for new construction in the exclusion zone if they contributed money to refurbishing already occupied low-income buildings elsewhere in the city. The Giuliani administration hopes to use those contributions to save distressed buildings that are at risk of abandonment.
"The Federal Government has walked away from budgeting for low-income housing, but the need is still there," said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, Commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. "We are trying to marry the idea of getting new market-rate housing and creating a funding stream for low-income housing at the same time." Martin Oestreicher, the deputy commissioner for the property division in the city's Department of Finance, said that 45,013 apartments in the city were receiving 421a benefits last year, and approximately 650,000 units were receiving benefits under J-51.
And since 1990, Mr. Oestreicher said, the two programs have resulted in approximately $2.2 billion in forgone tax revenue -- $1.3 billion under J-51, and $963 million under 421a.
The building in Jamaica, Queens, where Mrs. Cohen lives vividly illustrates how J-51 directly affects people's lives.
"Hey, Kenneth!" Mrs. Cohen piped up to her landlord, Kenneth Subraj, one recent Friday afteroon. "The elevator needs a cleaning."
In her housecoat and slippers and leaning on her aluminum walker, Mrs. Cohen had just come down to the lobby from her seventh-floor apartment to pick up the mail. As the original tenant in the nine-story, red-brick building on Merrick Boulevard, she has donned the mantle of unofficial ombudswoman for her building. She moved in 39 years ago and has since seen several landlords come and go.
But none quite like Kenneth, George and Jay Subraj, three Guyanese brothers of Indian descent who came to the United States in the 1970's and 80's, founded Zara Realty and began buying buildings in Jamaica and neighboring Hollis. They now own nine.
"They put a lot into this building," Mrs. Cohen said of the Subraj brothers. "Before, sometimes heat, sometimes no heat, comme ci, comme ca, you know what I mean?
"The other landlord, the roof leaked," Mrs. Cohen said. "It's a good thing I had a lot of newspapers, The New York Times, to soak it up. No more problems since."
Not only have the Subraj brothers rebuilt the roof, they have replaced that capricious old boiler with a new dual-fuel heating system, hung dual-pane thermal windows throughout the building, refurbished the elevators, remodeled the lobby and installed a garbage compactor and chutes -- all with the help of J-51.
THE program has allowed the Subrajes, along with hundreds of other landlords, to renovate their buildings and, thereby, sustain their livability. "These are not rich Manhattan rents," Mr. Subraj said of his nine rent-regulated buildings where a studio goes for about $450 and a two-bedroom for, maybe, $900. "These are working-class neighborhoods, low-income. So we are limited. Given that kind of rent, we are able to do the improvements with J-51."
There has been "quite a bit of rejuvenation in Jamaica" in the last two decades, Mr. Subraj said, spurred, in part, by the tax-incentive programs. "Without the improvements, these buildings would definitely be rundown and will not attract a decent tenancy. And we will end up being the type of landlord you don't want to be."
Both J-51 and 421a "were created to deal with a problem that has plagued New York for decades -- the shortage of housing for households of all income levels," said Michael Schill, director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law. And what they try to do is "harness the private sector to provide that housing, recognizing that government can't and shouldn't do it all by itself."
Given the high costs of land and construction in New York City, as well as the "extraordinary maze of regulations that developers must navigate" in order to build, Professor Schill said, the tax incentives offered by the programs are vital to preserving and increasing the city's housing stock.
"Increasing our stock is particularly important today," Professor Schill said, "because, unlike most other large, older American cities, the population of New York is increasing, partly due to the influx of immigrants." After sharp declines between 1960 and 1980, according to the Census Bureau, the city's population grew by 3.5 percent during the 80's, from 7,071,639 to 7,322,564. The influx continued during the first half of the 90's.
Under J-51, owners pay no increase in property taxes attributable to major building improvements for 10 years; then taxes are phased in over the following four years. In addition, owners are entitled to an annual 8.33 percent reduction of the taxes they had been paying based on the pre-rehabilitation assessment -- up to 90 percent of the "certified reasonable costs" of the work. The caveat is that apartment assessments after completion cannot be greater than $38,000 a unit, which effectively makes the J-51 program unusable in high-value locations, including most of Manhattan.
Under 421a, a building is exempt from property taxes while it is being constructed. After that, taxes are phased in under a schedule that differs in various parts of the city.
In the Manhattan exclusion zone, taxes are phased in over 10 years, until the building pays full taxes. When financing is obtained from tax-exempt bonds, as has been the case with much recent Manhattan construction, the property-tax abatement period lasts 20 years, with a full exemption for 12 years, followed by a phaseout. Such tax-exempt financing is obtainable only when 20 percent of the apartments in the building are made available to low-income families -- the so-called 80/20 program.
In other parts of the city, the 100 percent exemption period lasts for 10 years, followed by a five-year phaseout (in Manhattan outside the exclusion zone and in the four other boroughs) or 100 percent for 20 years, also followed by a five-year phaseout (in a neighborhood preservation area or for a project that has tax-exempt financing).
The housing generated or preserved under the two programs is particularly important in the current market, housing analysts say. According to "Housing N.Y.C., '96" a report by the city's Rent Guidelines Board, the city's rate of new construction has hit a longtime low.
Over the last 35 years, the report said, "the number of certificates of occupancy issued for newly constructed buildings in the city has plummeted from an average of 37,000 per year in the 1960's to a mere 7,900 in the 1990's." And fewer units were issued certificates of occupancy in 1993 (5,510) than in any year since 1945. In 1993, the last year for which data were available, the city's vacancy rate stood at 3.44 percent, with 5 percent or below the statutory standard for declaration of a housing emergency.
Without 421a, market players say, the crunch would be worse.
"We've been involved since the inception of the program in the early 70's," said Gary Jacob, executive vice president of Glenwood Management, which has built about 2,000 apartments in nine buildings, mostly on the East Side of Manhattan, under 421a. "It was the only program at the time that permitted rental housing to be built," Mr. Jacob said. "I'm not aware of any rental housing built since 1971, absent 421a."
Only last month, on West End Avenue between 61st and 64th Streets, construction was completed on West End Towers, a 1,000-apartment complex that was built with 421a incentives. "Included in those 1,000 apartments are 200 low-income units, which I think is some of the best low-income housing in the city," said the developer, Daniel Brodsky, president of the Brodsky Organization.
"They've been very good programs for the city," Mr. Brodsky said of J-51 and 421a, with the latter, particularly, giving the city "the ability to have low-income housing built and managed without the city having the responsibility of operating it. It integrates people racially, economically and socially in a set of buildings, and it works very, very well."
Among the beneficiaries of the 421a program are Mr. Rahman, the Bangladeshi native, his wife, Husna, and their sons, Minhaj, 16, and Fayaz, 8.
Mr. Rahman earns $12,000 a year as a waiter -- with tips. He pays $438 a month for a two-bedroom apartment in West End Towers. "Before, I used to live in Astoria, a very small, one-bedroom apartment, and I used to pay $700," he said. "My sons used to sleep on the floor. The living room was so small, I could not put beds in there.
Mr. Rahman won his new apartment in 1994 after spotting a newspaper advertisement, placed by the Brodsky Organization, announcing a lottery for the 200 units that was being run by the city's Housing Development Corporation.
"Thanks God, I get this one," Mr. Rahman said. "This building is very fancy. We have a dishwashing machine, a microwave that came with the building. It is a dream for me because I am a very low-paid person and cannot afford to buy this stuff. Here I am able to give my children a little better food."
THE 421a program has, at times, been a lightning rod for controversy. The law creating the program in 1971 stipulated that the tax incentives were supposed to promote construction of housing on "vacant, predominantly vacant or underutilized" sites. When, in the 1980's, Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue qualified for 421a benefits, the battle that eventually led to creation of the exclusion zone was joined.
Distant echoes of that conflict were heard only two months ago when the City Council voted, 29 to 17, to extend 421a incentives to sites zoned for the city's biggest buildings -- including the 3.4-acre site at Columbus Circle where some of the city's most high-profile developers have proposed building residential and office towers of up to 750 feet in height.
As she had more than a decade ago, Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger weighed in against what she considers misuse of the 421a program. "A desert doesn't need sand," she said, "a jungle doesn't need trees, and this site -- probably the single most valuable piece of real estate north, south, east or west of the Hudson River -- doesn't need your tax dollars, my tax dollars or anybody else's tax dollars to be developed."
In a recent interview, Ms. Messinger said that, as she had in the mid-80's, "I am always going to ask the same questions" about the two programs: "Where do you need tax breaks to encourage construction or renovation of housing and where can it proceed on its own?
"In exchange for providing some special tax breaks, we want to end up with some more affordable housing," she said. "These programs do that, but we get only a limited number of units at a fairly high cost in forgiven taxes."
The forgone revenue, in the estimation of Councilman Archie Spigner, chairman of the Council's Housing Committee, has been worth it. "I believe, when in doubt, we've got to come down on the side of giving the incentive, because there's a spinoff," Mr. Spigner said. "A new project provides employment opportunities to the construction industry; that's a plus. The taxes derived from the sales of goods and services in putting the project together, that's a plus. And the physical improvement to a community is also a plus. Then when the incentive expires and the property is fully taxable, that's the goal."
Posing the questions asked by critics of the programs -- "Have they been used prudently? Would the developers build without the incentives?" -- Mr. Spigner, a Democrat from Queens, said:
"Given the competition for capital and the opportunities available to developers across the river in New Jersey, in Westchester, in Stamford, Conn., in Nassau and beyond, my answer is that the stakes are too high for a casual roll of the dice on whether or not a project would go forward with or without the subsidies."
And of Columbus Circle, in particular, he said: "You can argue until you're green that they would go forward without it, but there are some of us who are not ready to take that chance."
Several of the developers who have submitted proposals for the Coliseum site said the need for 421a benefits depends on the proportion of housing to commercial space envisioned for the project.
Christopher Jeffries is a principal of Millennium Partners, which is putting the finishing touches on the 33-story Grand Millennium, one of three buildings in the company's Lincoln Square complex, all of which were built with 421a benefits after 150 low-income units were first constructed in other boroughs.
"Our project is heavily weighted toward housing, so we believe 421a is needed for the Coliseum," Mr. Jeffries said. "Remember, development of the Coliseum project with 421a will guarantee a significant number of low-income units being created somewhere else in the city by the private sector. It would be at least 100 units under our program."
But Richard LeFrak, president of the LeFrak Organization, said his company's proposal for the Coliseum "does not, at this time, contemplate requesting a 421a tax abatement. Our program has a very high commercial component, more than all the other proposals, so 421a is not as critical."
Critics of 421a argue that, despite the exclusion zone -- which runs from 96th Street to 14th Street on the east and Houston Street on the west -- Manhattan continues to be the prime beneficiary of the program. And data from the Department of Finance lend some credence to that contention. Last year, 54.7 percent of the 45,013 units receiving 421a benefits were in Manhattan, 20 percent were in Queens, 11 percent in Brooklyn, 8.9 percent on Staten Island and 5.4 percent in the Bronx.
Despite that distribution, the city's overall need has not slackened. Because of the real estate market collapse of the early 90's, applications for 421a have decreased in recent years. "Housing N.Y.C., '96," the Rent Guidelines Board report, states that an average of 5,865 apartments qualified for 421a benefits each year during the 1980's. But in the first half of the 1990's, the average declined to 1,796 each year, a reduction of 69 percent.
At the same time, the city's already constricted housing supply is facing a further crunch as the Federal Government struggles to cope with a crisis in its major subsidy program for the poor. The Federal program -- Section 8 -- covers the gap between 30 percent of a tenant's income and the rent for the apartment.
With Congress focused on deficit reduction, the Section 8 program is facing deep cuts, imperiling the renewal of contracts for buildings with up to 50,000 units that are due to expire over the next 10 years. Section 8 expirations in the city will peak at about 5,000 a year by 2002 before phasing down to zero in 2007, said Victor Bach, director of housing research for the Community Service Society, a nonprofit organization, who has written a report on the issue.
If the contracts are not renewed, owners of some subsidized buildings are likely to convert to market rents, while others may be forced to abandon buildings because, without the subsidies, they will not be able to meet operating expenses, Mr. Bach said.
Is the city's already taut housing stock facing a pincer action from above, because of the dropoff in 421a applications, and from below, because of the Section 8 crisis?
RONALD SHIFFMAN, director of the Pratt Center for Community and Environmental Development and a former member of the City Planning Commission, believes so. Mr. Shiffman pointed out that rent regulation may be weakened by the Legislature in the coming months and housing allowances are going to be cut under the new Federal welfare law.
"So, both of these," he said, referring to the contractions of 421a and Section 8, "will contribute to the crunch over the next five years. Many people will have to either double up or use the streets."
With all those factors coming into play, N.Y.U.'s Professor Schill sees 1997 as "a year of decision for housing in New York City." And, while not discounting the value he and many others see in both 421a and J-51, the professor wonders whether measures "other than tax incentives are necessary to build and maintain private-market housing."
Proposals to relax residential zoning requirements and give more favorable property-tax treatment to multifamily dwellings could be important steps toward increasing the housing supply, Professor Schill said. "Directly attacking the high cost of housing construction and renovation might be better than piecemeal attempts to subsidize development through tax concessions," he said.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY & CO.;
Job Security Dwindles as Rent-a-Job Companies Surge

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
Like more than 43 million others over the past two decades, Douglas E. Owens was downsized, unemployed, rented out, and basically left to survive by his wits. His resume went out to hundreds of companies and his feet walked miles of carpet in and out of interviews after he was cast out of the cradle-to-grave corporate world that he had e inhabited for 23 years.
Unlike many others still grappling with the uncertainty of today's labor market, Mr. Owens, 50 has a real job again. More importantly, he knows he probably won't keep it. 
 And he knows the same thing is true for a lot of the people he hires in his new job as vice president of human resources at Origin Technology in Business.
"It used to be that if you saw a resume full of two-year stints at different companies, you were shocked. Now it's normal," he said at his Murray Hill office, where he now sits perusing hundreds of resumes. "I would like to say I will keep this job forever, but I know the percentages aren't there anymore and that I will probably end up working interim on into retirement. That's the way the world works now; we are all disposable."
Mr. Owens has seen both sides of one of the fastest-growing sectors of the American economy. The growth is spurred by the need for new workers at downsized companies that are unwilling to take on additional full-time employees. Instead, they outsource the work, hiring outside contractors. Besides making the labor market more fluid and allowing business to operate more efficiently, the practice has spurred a new line of work: companies that channel workers into a series of jobs that are rarely permanent.
According to Federal labor figures, the number of temporary workers in New York and New Jersey rose by 35,000 in the first half of the decade, with 151,007 workers registered in 1995, the last full year that such statistics are available. During that period, the number of temporary hiring offices (many owned by the same company) increased from 1,522 to 1,874.
Nationally, the trend is much the same, with temporary work moving from a $16 billion to a $31 billion industry from 1990 to 1995. And now Manpower Inc. is the largest employer in the nation, offering up 750,000 temporary workers a year.
"It is part of the great economic transformation that we are going through," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Blousteinready School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, adding that New Jersey, with its concentration of manufacturing, communications and pharmaceutical companies, has been at the center of the trend. "It is the result of a drive for efficiency, an attempt to insure that a company is only paying for work that is done and not for workers who are idle."
Outsourcing has many facets, but the chief aim is to cut employment at a company to a core of individuals focused on its main business. All other activities, from handling mail and copying to accounting, information services and building maintenance, may be farmed out to other companies or individuals on contract. Even in the core business, if projects require additional hands, the company often opts to hire an engineer or executive as a consultant, rather than put him on the payroll.
According to Mr. Owens, who saw his own salary nearly halved during his two years of temporary jobs, one in six of the employees his company now asks him to hire are project workers who will never be put on the company payroll.
The crush of workers looking for jobs combined with the need of companies to find quick sources of labor, has caused a staggering growth in job clearinghouses, including those that specialize in executive and management positions. The Ascher Group, a Roseland company that began in 1981 as an executive head-hunting firm, began channeling its energy into temporary placements six years ago. Since then, revenues have approached $5 million, nearly five times what they were in 1992.
The company is itself a model of outsourcing, hiring other contractors to do its payroll, accounting, advertising, printing, legal and travel services. Susan P. Ascher, the company's president, added that one of the companies that uses her executives is itself an outsource firm that runs warehouses for other companies.
Many economists and business specialists believe that the trend may have reached its peak, that companies have cut to the bone, and in some cases trimmed too many workers from their staff.
"They are finding out that they can't move the raw data up the chain of command after they have carved out much of the chain," said Stanley Deetz, a professor of communication at Rutgers who has studied the corporate culture of downsizers such as AT&T. "And there is some thought at major corporations that things went too far, too fast."
But the business world is unlikely to revert to its old ways. Downsizing and outsourcing have been one of the chief bolsters of the American economy and American stock prices in recent years. economists say. It has also helped to further weaken unions and reduce wage inflation, with median wages now 3 percent below what they were in 1979. And while companies may slow their outsourcing of existing jobs, economists say they are likely never to internalize many of the jobs that will be tomorrow's boon, particularly those in information technology.
"Most of the obvious outsourcing targets have been consummated already, but technology is moving so quickly that few companies will be able to develop these as internal functions," said Mr. Hughes, noting that up to 43 percent of the jobs lost in corporate America over the past decade were later outsourced. "Everything from the Internet, to data processing and information handling will probably be purchased outside from ground zero. This is the future."

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
In 2002, Mr. Speaker?

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
AH, youth. A. Gifford Miller has plenty. When he was elected Council member from the Upper East Side last year, Mr. Miller, then a 26-year-old Democrat, earned an asterisk next to his name by becoming the youngest person ever elected to the city's decidedly middle-aged legislature. Politically astute beyond his years, Mr. Gifford outmaneuvered three other Democrats during a special election last winter to fill the seat vacated by Charles Millard, who resigned to become president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
In 10 bitterly cold days, Mr. Miller and his supporters gathered nearly 7,000 signatures, more than triple the required number, and he went on to trounce a Republican twice his age by 14 points. "Gifford came out of the gates quicker than anyone else," said Jerry Skurnik, a Democratic political consultant. "In some respects, he was at the right place at the right time." 
 He is also extremely lucky. Because he has yet to serve a full four-year term, Mr. Miller will be the Council's sole surviving Democrat when term limits sweep away the 44 other Democrats four years from now. Vito Fossella, a Republican from Staten Island, will be the only other Council member left standing.
Assuming he wins re-election this fall, something that is almost certain in a body where turnover is rare, Mr. Miller will be the Council's senior Democrat on the first Monday of January 2002. With that advantage, and assuming he plays his cards right, supporters say he stands a good chance of becoming the Council's Speaker, second only to the Mayor in power and prestige.
"Gifford is bright, energetic and asks the right questions," said Peter F. Vallone, the Democrat from Queens who has led the Council since 1986. "I guess you could say he has the qualifications for a good Speaker."
With his boyish side part, prominent ears and gee-whiz smile, Mr. Miller, who lives in an East 81st Street co-op, doesn't quite exude blind ambition. "Everyone is always ribbing me, calling me Mr. Speaker," he said the other day as he picked over the remains of his fried chicken lunch at Ellen's Cafe near City Hall. "Believe it or not, I have a strong sense of my own irrelevance."
During his first 12 months, Mr. Miller's impact on the Council has been minimal, and he has yet to see any of his bills made into law. Before he was elected, his only other job after graduating from Princeton University in 1992 was as an aide to Representative Carolyn B. Maloney.
While his Council colleagues seem to like him well enough, many say it is too early to handicap his chances for Speaker. "Gifford works extremely hard but he still has a lot to learn," Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed of lower Manhattan said. "I can't quite imagine him as Speaker. I think the situation shows up the problems of term limits."
Chris Meyer, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, agrees that Mr. Gifford's ascendancy to the post is not a sure thing. "People assume that longevity equals primogeniture and they're wrong," he said. "Gifford may know how to work the system and he hasn't made enemies yet, but he has a lot of work to do if he wants the Speaker's job."
That means building a broader base of support, especially in the boroughs outside Manhattan and among Democratic party bosses whose influence on the Council will be greater after term limits take effect. "Gifford needs an issue on which he can make a name for himself," Mr. Meyer said.
So far one of his more prominent maneuvers has been something of a blunder. When Mayor Giuliani announced plans for ferry service between the East Side and Yankee Stadium, the Councilman ridiculed it as a windfall for only one person: the Mayor's son, Andrew. "Maybe it's a way for Andrew to get home from the games safely, but I don't think the community wants it," he said then. That remark earned him the Mayor's enmity and former Deputy Mayor Peter Powers made a point of telling him so.
Mr. Miller says he now regrets the comment. "I guess I was being flip," he said. "I didn't mean to offend the Mayor."
Nevertheless, the incident has made little impression beyond City Hall, and Mr. Miller enjoys wide support among his constituents, many of whom are visibly charmed by his youth, his energy and his earnestness. Mention his name to allies, and comments like "handsome," "promising" and "Kennedy esque" flow freely.
"Sometimes he's annoying as hell because he asks so many questions but he's basically a nice kid," said Norman Adler, a political consultant and an informal adviser. "He comes from money but he's not snotty about it."
Raised on 98th Street and Fifth Avenue, Mr. Miller was surrounded by politics. His father, Leigh, was a State Department official in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations. His mother, Lynden, is a prominent garden designer. Both his parents, whom he describes as "yellow dog Democrats," have served on Community Board 8 in East Harlem. "Dinner table conversation was often political in nature and fairly heated," his father said. "But we never imagined that he would become a politician."
During a recent visit to the Lenox Hill Senior Center on East 70th Street, Mr. Miller was greeted like visiting royalty by the lunchtime crowd as he handed out a flier on crime prevention. Sydelle Seelenfreund-Gorlick, 81, trailed him like a proud grandmother. "He's so thoughtful and every time he sees me on the street, he kisses me," she said, adjusting the ladybug pendant on her sweater. Asked if Mr. Miller wasn't just being a politician, she snapped: "I've been around a long time and know the difference between a phony and the real thing."
A few days later, in a Park Avenue apartment thick with judges, elected officials and the Silk Stocking district's Democratic elite, Mr. Miller was the guest of honor. As four candidates for Manhattan borough president furiously worked the party, sponsored by the Lexington Democratic Club, Mr. Miller appeared relaxed. Stepping to the front of the room, looking out over a sea of beaming faces, he brought the crowd to a polite roar when he spoke of the Democratic Party's responsibility to the poor and disfranchised. "The last chapter, I'm sure, has not been written for Gifford," the evening's host, Joe Rosenblatt, announced.
Even his rivals have trouble criticizing him. "It's not his fault that he went to the best private schools and never had to work a day in his life," said Samuel D. Morell, who lost his Council bid to Mr. Miller last year. "He has no fire in his belly. But on the other hand, if I had kids, he's the kind of guy I would want to marry my daughter."

HEADLINE: Like Oil and Water: A Tale of Two Economists

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
THEY have met only once since Paul Krugman returned last summer to the prestigious economics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was a brief, accidental encounter among the file cabinets and secretaries' desks near Lester Thurow's office. "We exchanged pleasantries," Mr. Thurow said. "He was telling someone about a trip he had made to the far south of Argentina, and I listened politely."
The small talk left so much unsaid. For the two men -- from offices one floor apart that look out on the Charles River -- are not so much colleagues as high-profile combatants in a struggle to explain the very nature of the national economy. With all the authority of their profession, they have gone public with strikingly different explanations of an economic phenomenon bedeviling not only the experts, but everyone else, too. Why have so many Americans fallen behind in the last two decades, while an affluent minority has so visibly prospered? Why has the resulting income gap become so glaring and persistent, even with six years of steady economic growth under our belts? 
 What Mr. Thurow and Mr. Krugman have done is translate into vivid metaphors, riffs of sarcasm and doomsday prose the dry, technical debate of their colleagues at a time when many Americans have taken sides, telling pollsters that they think competition from the rest of the world is the big cause of their income troubles. For Mr. Krugman, representing the majority of economists, that view is wrong. The big culprit, he argues, is new technology right here at home, requiring so many well-paid, college-trained workers, and so few of the less skilled. But for Mr. Thurow and other challengers of this view, the rapidly evolving global economy is indeed mostly to blame, with its hundreds of millions of low-wage workers sending what they produce to the United States and pulling down the pay of average Americans.
Mr. Krugman, 43, and Mr. Thurow, 58, are not alone in this debate, of course. Politicians, pundits, historians, sociologists and Wall Street analysts have jumped in. The debate pops up all the time, in articles and books and on talk shows. Policy prescriptions fill the air: regulate trade, restrict immigration, levy higher taxes on the rich to subsidize the poor and improve educational standards in an attempt -- perhaps vain -- to make everyone highly skilled and well paid.
Pat Buchanan, who sought the Republican Presidential nomination last year, exploited the issue. Bob Dole tried to make wage troubles a campaign theme, and even President Clinton, while just issuing a report suggesting that the rising income gap may be reversing, has nonetheless singled out this inequality as the current economic problem. But Mr. Krugman, so often described as a shoo-in for a future Nobel Prize, and Mr. Thurow, who became an M.I.T. economics professor while Mr. Krugman was still a teen-ager in well-to-do Merrick, L.I., have emerged as the loudest and most articulate public voices of the profession that, above others, should have answers.
As they go at it, never face-to-face -- always in writing and public speaking, sometimes from the well of the same M.I.T. lecture amphitheater, although on separate days -- they offer very different versions of the economy, as if they were cardiologists differing over heart disease, with one citing stress as the primary cause and the other a fat-rich diet.
"The fact this debate exists means no one knows who is right," said Robert Heilbroner, an economics historian who has written books with Mr. Thurow. "The economics profession seems to have a split personality, with the Lester Thurows trying to see a larger picture, and the Paul Krugmans in the business of trying to measure hard-and-fast cause and effect."
The jockeying for the upper hand in this debate sometimes becomes personal. While serving as the defender of the mainstream viewpoint among economists, Mr. Krugman cultivates a firebrand image. He refers to "startlingly crude and uninformed" views of those he criticizes, often by name -- Robert B. Reich, the former Labor Secretary, is a favorite target -- or to experts who "offer a logic no more confused than usual." He included Mr. Thurow in that last epithet. And so when Mr. Thurow was told last summer that Mr. Krugman was returning to M.I.T., after two years at Stanford University, he requested that Mr. Krugman refrain from disparaging his M.I.T. colleagues -- a request that Mr. Krugman has honored so far. "He is too personal," Mr. Thurow said. "He makes it hard to have a debate."
Mr. Thurow, on the other hand, offers broad declarations that go far beyond the equations, diagrams and mathematical models that are, in Mr. Krugman's view, the essence of respectable economics. Mr. Thurow, for example, offers sweeping statements about the impact of the global economy on Americans. "Those with third-world skills will earn third-world wages," he declares, and "anything can be made anywhere on the face of the earth and sold everywhere else on the face of the earth."
For Mr. Krugman, who declined to be photographed with Mr. Thurow, such statements are more seat-of-the-pants judgments than testable economic logic. They are, he wrote recently, expressions in a war "between the essentially literary sensibility that we expect of a card-carrying intellectual and the scientific-mathematical outlook that is arguably the true glory of our civilization."
Such differences enliven the buzz among their colleagues at M.I.T. "Paul's style is still that of the enfant terrible, while Lester speaks more like someone on the mountaintop telling you how it is," said Richard L. Schmalensee, the deputy dean of M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management.
Still, there is common ground. Both men see themselves as liberals, fighting not over ideology but over what constitutes good economics. They favor similar policies -- strengthening unions to give labor more bargaining power, pushing education to improve Americans' workplace skills and income redistribution via Government policy to reduce inequality. They once even taught a basic economics course together at M.I.T., although they lectured on alternate days. (Mr. Thurow was more fun for the students, but Mr. Krugman covered the curriculum, Mr. Krugman said.)
Both acknowledge that they shifted their attention from academia to the public arena after being shut out of top slots as advisers in Democratic administrations -- Mr. Thurow after Jimmy Carter was elected President and Mr. Krugman in the early Clinton days.
"My epiphany, came at that famous economic summit in Little Rock in 1992," Mr. Krugman said. "A lot of stuff said there was clearly silly. I had been aware that pop economics writers had a much bigger audience than good economists. But I did not take that seriously because I thought that anyone who really mattered would know the difference. That turned out not to be the case."
Mr. Thurow and Mr. Krugman also share an uncertainty, even a pessimism, about the future. Mr. Krugman is doubtful that any policy can improve much on the market's self-correcting, if sometimes fallible, ways. And Mr. Thurow worries that without a new central challenge -- something to replace the cold war -- Americans will let the economy deteriorate by failing to support Government money for research and necessary public investment that business shuns because the payoff is not direct and immediate. In his latest book, "The Future of Capitalism," he even foresees, in the absence of this central challenge, a decline into a modern-day Middle Ages.
"My brother in Chicago, whom I respect very much, called me and said I had written the most depressing book he had ever read," Mr. Thurow said. "I was surprised. I thought I had laid out solutions. But maybe they stick in my mind and not in the reader's."

Wooing the Crowd
The names appear alphabetically, in modest black letters, outside the suite where Mr. Krugman has his office, and he jokingly points out that his name is first, ahead of the Nobel Prize winners Paul Samuelson and Robert M. Solow, two giants of American economics who happen to be Mr. Krugman's suite mates. "I ought to take a picture of that while it lasts," he said. He need not rush. His imprint on mainstream economics is already well embedded.
Mr. Krugman, the only child of an insurance company manager, achieved luminary status in less than a decade as an economist. Finishing at Yale in 1974 and receiving his Ph.D. from M.I.T. in 1977, he soon plunged into teaching and research, producing path-breaking findings on the interplay of Government and industry in trade. Although he worries about Government interference in markets, he nevertheless has demonstrated with mathematical precision how an assist from Government can give an industry a competitive advantage in, say, manufacturing and exporting commercial jets or computer chips.
With his reputation as an expert economist firmly in place by the early 90's (he won the John Bates Clark Medal in 1991 as the nation's most outstanding academic economist under 40), Mr. Krugman cut back on original research and turned his attention to a wider public, displaying a rare knack for explaining the discipline and logic of economics if not to every subway straphanger, at least to the educated layman.
"There is no question that the polemics cut into the research," Mr. Krugman said. "I like to think that like Keynes" -- John Maynard Keynes, the legendary British economist who juggled scholarship, essay writing and public service -- "I can step back and do deep thinking again, but who knows. It is one of the things I wake up and worry about."
Mr. Thurow, 15 years older than Mr. Krugman, actually blazed this trail from academia to a wider audience. The eldest of three sons of a Methodist preacher in Montana, he went east to Williams College and won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford. He earned a Ph.D. at Harvard in 1964 and four years later, at 30, found himself at M.I.T., holding professorships in both the economics department and the Sloan School of Management, where he later became dean. Pioneering work on income distribution helped get him to the top. But he, too, shifted to capturing public attention after being shut out of government. He had helped in the Carter election campaign but, like Mr. Krugman 16 years later, lost out for a top advisory position in the new Democratic Administration.
"I decided that if I could not have the king's ear, I would talk to the public," Mr. Thurow said. "That's the other way to have an impact on the economic system." And he certainly has talked to the public, in best-selling books, magazine articles, television appearances and on the lecture circuit -- at $30,000 a speech, he says, nearly double Mr. Krugman's speaking fees.
But for all their similarities, and their common home base, the chasm separating their economic theories seems unbridgeable.
Mr. Thurow applauded -- and still likes -- Mr. Krugman's early research suggesting that the Government can help create an export advantage for industry. That fits Mr. Thurow's preference for a market system leavened by Government. But Mr. Krugman objects that his research is all-too-often loosely invoked as justification for an intrusive industrial policy by people "who don't understand its limits."
Mr. Thurow says that when the Mexicans or Chinese export shirts or tires to the United States, for example, less-skilled American workers are edged out or forced into lower-paying service jobs. Mr. Krugman responds that imports from low-wage countries represent only 2 percent of the national income, not enough to have much of an impact on American labor. In fact, he says, trade in its entirety is too small a percentage of the gross domestic product to greatly influence wages.
Trade is a cause of income inequality, Mr. Krugman acknowledges, but he says other factors are more important -- primarily the onslaught of new technology. Because of that, the demand for highly skilled people -- from computer programmers to top executives -- has soared, and their wages have gone up relative to the less skilled.
The Thurows of the world misunderstand another dynamic, he adds. As the Mexicans and Chinese shift into shirts and tires, American industry produces jet aircraft, cellular phones and other high-technology products to pay for the imports. "We raise the wage of skilled people who produce planes," Mr. Krugman said, "and lower the wage of those who are unskilled."
But, he said, the unskilled will probably not suffer over the long run. Incomes will rise in Mexico and China, Mr. Krugman said, as workers there become more productive. That was Japan's experience after World War II, and South Korea's more recently. The global pie, in effect, becomes bigger.
"If you can shift machinery from the United States to Mexico, why should you think that would level American wages down rather than Mexican wages up?" Mr. Krugman asked. "If a Mexican worker's output goes from one widget to 10 widgets a day, his wage rises to that level. If you strip the story down, this is the only explanation that makes sense."
Mr. Thurow offers an entirely different tale. With capital so mobile and transportation and communications improving constantly, companies can place their operations almost anywhere, he says. Even their high-technology operations are vulnerable as educated Russians and Eastern Europeans, for example, bid for work. Adding salt to this sore, low-wage countries focus their exports more than ever on the United States. In addition, the influx of immigrants is very similar to shifting production abroad, bringing the low-wage labor here instead of sending the work there. As a result, wages are driven down in areas like Southern California or Texas or Florida where there are many immigrants. And everywhere in the country, there is downward wage pressure simply from the threat of American companies' relocating or producing abroad.
"Russia has 800,000 scientists and engineers," Mr. Thurow declared in an M.I.T. lecture last month. "Why pay an American physicist $75,000 a year when you can get a Russian for $100 a month?" Moments later he invoked the image of a dress manufacturer with 18 factories around the world, linked by "high-definition television to control quality." This manufacturer, Mr. Thurow said, "tells customers: 'Don't worry whether the dress is made in Bangladesh or New York. It's the same item, same quality, same delivery time.' "
 
Growth, the Great Divide
Still, Mr. Thurow would not intervene in the global economy by restricting trade or impeding the flows of people and investment across borders. Nor would Mr. Krugman. They are both free traders. The best solution, they also agree, is more economic growth both here and abroad. But they are worlds apart on how to achieve that growth, or whether it is even possible.
The divide is over productivity, or output per worker, which has not been rising all that much lately in the United States and the rest of the industrial world. Ultimately, the only way to generate more growth, or national income, is to put more people to work or to find some way for each worker to produce more each hour.
Mr. Thurow would try to lift productivity in stages. He would start by stimulating the economy, perhaps through Government spending or lower interest rates, a Keynesian approach that is now considered by mainstream economists as more likely to produce inflation than real growth. For Mr. Thurow, however, the stimulus would open up opportunity, and the opportunity would pull up productivity.
A machine shop, for example, might open to serve a growing demand for auto parts. A waiter in a nearby diner, seizing an opportunity, takes a job as a grinder. Grinding auto parts produces more income than the same time spent waiting on tables. So the worker's output, measured in cash, rises. The diner raises its output per worker, too, by putting in a buffet. The customers, in effect, serve themselves, a form of automation.
"Productivity comes out of an economy that is pushed," Mr. Thurow said. "It is the result of what people do in response to the opportunities that growth makes possible, not the cause of growth."
Mr. Krugman calls this "wishful thinking." He, and most mainstream economists, say they do not know why the annual rise in productivity, or potential output, has slowed so much since the early 1970's. Nor do they claim to know how to reverse this poor performance. The math and the evidence, Mr. Krugman says, are inexorable. Whenever America's economic growth rate goes much above 2 percent -- its long-term ceiling -- the unemployment rate invariably falls. Workers are added to increase output, until the unemployment rate gets too low and the labor supply is exhausted -- simply bidding up wages without substantially increasing the nation's potential growth rate.
"All this seems pretty ironclad," Mr. Krugman writes in an article recently submitted to the Harvard Business Review.

Metaphors and Hypotheticals
Lester Thurow is a loner at M.I.T. He rarely attends the Wednesday lunches of the economics department or other faculty gatherings. His most prominent allies are not other academic economists but high-profile outsiders like Mr. Reich, the former Labor Secretary, and Robert Kuttner, a writer and editor of The American Prospect, a liberal magazine. For that matter, Mr. Thurow is seldom on campus. His new assistant, on the job since Dec. 3, saw her boss on fewer than five days through late January. He had visited London, Abu Dhabi, Istanbul, Mexico City, Aruba and Davos, Switzerland, among other stops, attending conferences, promoting foreign-language translations of "The Future of Capitalism" (William Morrow & Company, 1996) and speaking, always speaking. "As a traveler, he puts Jules Verne to shame," said Mr. Heilbroner, the economics historian and Mr. Thurow's sometimes co-author.
Yet, when the criticism comes, it is almost always preceded by praise. As dean of M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management from 1987 until 1994, Mr. Thurow was by all accounts a big success, as a fund-raiser, promoter and prominent economist whose frequent television appearances made the school much more widely known. "Lester is a great citizen," said Rudiger Dornbusch, an M.I.T. economist. "You want anything done for the school, and he is there to do it."
That said, the criticism from mainstream American economists is rather blunt: Mr. Thurow's sweeping conclusions and forecasts are often wrong. He predicted, for example, that the international organization that supervises free trade, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, would fail. Under its new incarnation, the World Trade Organization, it thrives. Observing the rise of the Internet and television home-shopping channels, he predicted during a recent lecture that "a lot of conventional store shopping will disappear," a pronouncement that brings frowns of doubt to his mainstream critics.
In "Head to Head," a best seller published in 1992, he described a global struggle involving three antagonistic trading blocs, centered in the United States, Europe and Japan. Bill Clinton, then running for President, was photographed with the book in his hands. But the regional trading blocs have not emerged. "Are they even plausible today?" asked Robert Z. Lawrence, a trade economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. (Mr. Thurow says they might yet materialize.)
The back-and-forth between Mr. Thurow and Mr. Krugman extends to their writing styles. In writing about economics for the public, both resort to metaphors or tales to make their point. But Mr. Thurow gets no peace here from Mr. Krugman, who says he misused the two key metaphors in "The Future of Capitalism." One was plate tectonics, comparing global economic forces to the earth's steadily moving plates. The other was punctuated equilibrium, drawn from evolutionary biology and used by Mr. Thurow to illustrate rapid and fundamental economic change punctuating the normally slow evolutionary process.
"I happen to know a fair amount about plate tectonics and a lot about punctuated equilibrium," Mr. Krugman said. "The latter is not taken seriously by good biologists. And if he is going to use plate tectonics, he must take into account that small events can unleash huge consequences. I am amazed he did not use plate tectonics in that sense."
Mr. Krugman, whose most recent popular books were "Peddling Prosperity" (W. W. Norton, 1994) and "Pop Internationalism" (M.I.T. Press, 1996), employs simple stories to illustrate economic theory -- a favorite being a baby-sitting cooperative with payments made in Popsicle sticks. But sarcasm is also a hallmark of the Krugman style, sometimes leveled gratuitously, even friends say.
He pleads guilty, at least in part. "If I am trying to get across an idea that people find hard to wrap their minds around," Mr. Krugman said, "one way to do it is to find an influential person who is saying something quite silly because he does not grasp the idea."
"That jolts people into trying to grasp the idea," he said, "and avoid sounding silly themselves."
 
The Tenacious Two
M.I.T. welcomed Mr. Krugman back last summer like a lost son. In 1994, he had gone off to a Stanford professorship with the woman he would soon marry, Robin Wells, an M.I.T. economist who had also landed a job there. By last spring, both wanted to return.
"I convened the faculty and notified the administration," said Paul Joskow, chairman of the M.I.T. economics department. "Within a few weeks, we put an offer together. Paul is very important to us."
Soon he was back on campus, a tenured professor again, reoccupying his old office in the suite with Mr. Solow and Mr. Samuelson, both fans of Mr. Krugman as a rising star in mainstream economics. But some of the mainstream economists in Mr. Krugman's camp are nevertheless critical of his view that the global economy has only limited impact on American wages.
Technology might have a greater impact on wages than the global economy does, said Michael J. Piore, a Harvard economist, but many factors play a role -- weaker unions, deregulation, job insecurity -- and assigning weights is futile. "The right position is agnostic," he said.
And Edward Leamer of the University of California at Berkeley has found that Chinese apparel makers do indeed exert downward pressure on wages here. When apparel workers lose jobs in this country because of the Chinese competition, they end up competing for jobs as gardeners, waiters, maintenance workers and the like. "So the Krugman view that trade is not a large share of the gross domestic product is completely irrelevant, in my view," Mr. Leamer said. "I've told him that, but when he gets committed to a viewpoint, he doesn't let go."
The same might be said of Mr. Thurow.
"Lester provokes, he challenges, he takes chances with ideas that are often wrong, blindly wrong," said Mr. Lawrence of Harvard, an ally of Mr. Krugman in the economics debate. "But he is a very original guy, and you need those people. You ask, 'Would I like to see the world run by Lester Thurow?' No. Nor Paul Krugman, for that matter. But do I value his creativity? Yes."

Snared M.I.T. professorship when Paul Krugman was still a teen-ager and also served as a dean of M.I.T.'s business school. Since then, he's been a loner on the faculty, often closer to outside personalities than M.I.T. colleagues. In an effort to capture the big picture, he has gained a reputation for sweeping, hard-to-prove statements. Makes $30,000 a speech, and his total income exceeds $500,000. Paul Krugman, 43. Grew up in Merrick, L.I., and attended Yale. Earned Ph.D. from M.I.T., establishing himself quickly as a brilliant researcher. Named country's most outstanding economist under 40 in 1991 and is considered by fellow economists as a shoo-in for the Nobel prize. More partial to what can be measured and proved and fond of taking swipes at those who dispute him. Makes only $15,000 a speech, but his fees are rising, and his total annual income is around $250,000. (Photographs by Michael Quan for The New York Times) (pg. 1); Lester Thurow and Paul Krugman are handled by the same speakers' bureau, but are positioned differently. Mr. Thurow is presented as the doyen who can make economics "compelling for lay audiences." Mr. Krugman, his fellow M.I.T. economist, meanwhile, is being sold in the bureau's marketing book as the "outspoken and iconclastic" bad boy of the beat. (pg. 10)

WHAT THUROW THINKS
The global economy, offering a huge supply of low-wage, foreign workers, is the principal cause of income inequality in this country, pulling down the wages of low-skilled American workers.
Greater economic growth is the solution. This requires more output from each worker, or higher productivity. By pushing the economy through measures that stimulate growth, opportunities will arise to increase productivity, and workers and companies will seize them.
 
WHAT KRUGMAN THINKS
Technology, not global competition, is the principal cause of American income inequality. The problem is here at home. The onslaught of technology, however, puts a premium on highly-skilled people, driving up their wages, but not those of the less skilled.
Trade represents is too small a portion of the American economy to greatly affect wages.
Greater economic growth through higher productivity is the solution, but no one knows how to raise productivity.
 
WHERE THEY AGREE
Both see income inequality and wage stagnation as big economic problems.
They see themselves as liberals, favoring stronger unions and more education and training to raise workers' skills. They also favor the redistribution of income through taxes to close the gap between rich and poor.
They are free-traders.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
Overshadowed by 125th, 116th Street to Polish Image

BYLINE: By JANET ALLON

 BODY:
While planning for economic development in northern Manhattan continues, East 116th Street, the main commercial thoroughfare in East Harlem, is being overlooked, local leaders say. In fact, they say, it has been overlooked for quite some time.
"The street looks about the same way it did in the 30's," said Eddie Baca, executive director of the Local Development Corporation Del Barrio and chairman of Community Board 11. "People always talk about 125th Street, and 116th Street gets lost. It just has not been a priority." 
 The development corporation is promoting plans to revitalize East 116th Street. They include forming a unified merchants association, helping local businesses and stores get financing to fix up their facades and interiors, adding trees, making signs and lighting uniform, and studying whether to form a business improvement district.
"Right now, the street is a hodgepodge of signs and worn-out canopy frames from the 70's," said Raymond Plumey, an architect and planner who worked with the development corporation to create a plan for a more unified look on East 116th Street. "Some merchants use the sidewalk for display area, which adds to the congestion. There's absolutely no cohesiveness."
The development corporation has applied for an $800,000 block grant from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation, which would provide about half the money for renovating stores and helping merchants. The Empowerment Zone is expected to decide on the application on March 7.
A few development projects are under way that could improve the street's fortunes. The street's eastern anchor, the old Washburn Wire factory, was recently purchased by the Blumenfeld Development Group, a Long Island-based commercial developer, which plans a retail and housing complex on the site.
Several housing developments are also planned or are already under construction. On the western end, construction is to begin this fall on Millennium on Fifth, a condominium. Project Return, a nonprofit social service group, is completing 90 units of housing for the elderly between First and Pleasant Avenues. The East Harlem Building for the Community, a nonprofit housing group, is putting together financing for 200 units of housing above commercial space on an empty lot between Park and Madison Avenues.
The development corporation is also suggesting a new use for La Marqueta, the small shopping bazaar underneath the Park Avenue viaducts at 116th Street. "We're suggesting that that be a Latin jazz and entertainment district," said Mr. Baca, who is calling for the city's Economic Development Corporation to commit $3.5 million that it had once promised, then revoked from La Marqueta.

HEADLINE: Goodbye, Divorce Court

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER

 BODY:
EVERYBODY likes to talk about divorce. If not their own, then their sister's, brother's, cousin's, friend's. Or you-know-who's or what's his-name's. At social gatherings I attended over the last several years, strangers would invariably turn to me with eager eyes once they found out I was a divorce lawyer. Clucking sympathetically at "how hard it must be," they were nevertheless hungry for dirt. And full of questions.
"Have you ever represented anyone famous?" they would ask. (I have, but I'll never tell you whom.) "Do you represent more men or more women?" (About a 50-50 split.) "What's the worst, nastiest case you ever handled?" (Hard to choose among so many miserable candidates for the honor.) Followed, of course, by, "Let me pick your brain about this situation. . . ." 
 Well, no more. I've been out of the divorce business since September, burnt out after 17 years in practice and 16 in the field of family law. I'm a full-time student at Columbia now, hoping to add an M.S. in journalism to my J.D. Now when people ask me what I do, the answer doesn't intrigue them nearly as much as it used to. I'm no longer the focus of everyone's prurient interest, and I confess that I miss the attention a bit.
Otherwise, to say that I have no regrets is to put it mildly.
Of course, I didn't leave the law on a whim. Going back to school in your mid-40's and starting from scratch is not necessarily the most appealing of prospects. The loss of income, the thought of the long years needed to build a new career and the possibility of failure kept me awake through many long nights. My wife, bless her, encouraged me as best she could, but it was ultimately my decision to make.
At last, I made the decision because I was tired. Tired of all the lawyer-bashing by headline-hungry politicians and appellate judges who in fact bear much blame for many of the problems for which they hold lawyers responsible. Tired of the indifference and ineptitude of many of the trial court judges, and the costly chaos many of my clients endured as a result. And, yes, tired of some of those clients, too, the ones whose anger and bitterness blind them to the folly of their conduct and who blame everyone but themselves for their problems, most especially their lawyers.
Don't matrimonial lawyers deserve some of the blame for the lamentable state of the divorce courts today? Of course. There are plenty of unethical and incompetent divorce lawyers, and lots of fee-gougers, too, all of whom contribute to a less-than-flattering public image. But to condemn the entire matrimonial bar for all the problems with New York family law is just flat-out wrong. For the real problem is not the lawyers; it is the Alice-in-Wonderland system in which they work.
The trip through the looking glass starts with the very basis of the divorce itself. New York is not a "no fault" state; unless you've been legally separated for at least a year, you have to have grounds to get a divorce. The grounds are adultery, abandonment for more than a year and "cruel and inhuman" treatment. Once you've proven one of these, you are entitled to a divorce and to a financial settlement. Yet, by law, the judge must decide how to divide your property and award support without any reference to your spouse's bad acts, which you've just taken such pains to prove.
Confused? You've got lots of company. This contradiction confuses most people. How can it be that fault is required for divorce, but that it has no bearing on other decisions in the divorce case? I can't begin to estimate how many times I was asked that question by unhappy clients whose spouses had truly done them wrong. I never had a decent answer.
 
Lie? In a Court of Law?
The Judge Demands It
 In any event, the practical consequences of this legal bifurcation are enormous. People are not allowed to get divorces on consent, as they are in other states, so they often make up a ground and swear to untrue allegations of misfeasance just to get unhitched. Everyone -- that includes the judges -- knows just what they're doing, too, and the practice is universally allowed. More than that: it is encouraged. Innumerable are the times a judge has warned me in conference that my client will be "punished" if he or she dares to "waste the court's time" by introducing evidence of the real fault in the case.
Others use the issue of grounds as a sword to gain financial leverage. I had a client whose husband of many years had left her for a much younger woman. He had no ground for divorce, but desperately wanted one so that he could remarry. My client -- who had the grounds -- refused to use them until he anted up.
There are even times when a spouse just won't go along with a divorce no matter what. That's exactly what happened in one of my cases. The marriage was as lousy as it was long, but the husband had never done anything overtly bad. Instead, for years, he had criticized his wife and driven her crazy with his complaining. Still, he was loyal, hard-working and a good provider. The wife sued for divorce and lost, with the judge finding that there was not enough evidence of cruelty. For all I know, these two are still married, living in separate homes and not speaking to each other.
As bad as that sounds, at least their case was heard. In this city and its suburbs, where there are simply not enough judges handling matrimonial cases, that's no easy task. Ask any divorce litigant about the problem. Everything takes forever, or so it seems to parties who can wait months for the resolution of requests for temporary support or custody, and years for a trial. Arguing a motion can be a daylong exercise, as the lawyers wait for endless lists of cases to be called. Conferences also take far longer than they should, as the lawyers wait for judges to finish other conferences or, in some cases, for the judge to show up in the first place.
As for the conferences -- well, many are colossal wastes of time. As the clients sit fretting outside, wondering what can be taking so long in the chambers to which the judge and lawyers have retreated, the latter are more than likely telling each other jokes or talking about how much the judge hates matrimonial cases. "They're all liars," he or she will say about the litigants, without benefit of knowing a thing about the case. "They'd better settle, or else!"
Like all New York judges, those who hear divorce cases, whether elected or appointed, are products of local party politics. Since the public at large pays almost no attention to judicial elections or to judicial selection, politicians pretty much choose the judges at their whim.
Are there any qualifications for divorce judges that set them apart? None. There are no prerequisites for becoming a matrimonial judge, and many who preside over divorce cases have never practiced matrimonial law in their lives. Indeed, since family law cases are considered to be messy, "bottom of the barrel" sorts of things, they are often given to the most inexperienced judges, those who don't have the seniority to protest. Or they are farmed out to judicial hearing officers, who are retired judges, or to special referees, who are lawyers who work for judges, and not judges at all.
What a nightmare! More than once I have had to remind an elderly hearing officer of the names of the parties sitting before him, or the testimony he has just heard but already forgotten. And I have often been told by a newly assigned judge that he or she knows nothing about divorce law, even as he or she sits in judgment over my client. Imagine hearing something like that from your doctor just as you begin surgery!
Furthermore, regardless of whether they have experience, many judges have deep-seated prejudices against either men or women. Depending on whether you are a man or a woman, you wouldn't want certain judges presiding over your divorce because you wouldn't stand a chance, no matter what the circumstances of the case.
In one case of mine, for example, a Manhattan judge who was legendary for her anti-male bias ordered a husband to pay so much more in child support than his wife said she needed that he panicked and left town, absconding with his retirement funds to Mexico. Another Manhattan judge ordered a client to pay his wife tens of thousands of dollars in support more than he earned. He had decided that the man could earn at least $100,000 a year and ordered him to get a job paying that much, as if such positions could be had for the asking.
It was, in fact, this kind of injustice that finally provoked the authorities to begin rotating judges in and out of the matrimonial courtrooms. As a result, the roster of divorce judges in Manhattan has changed three times in the last two years, and cases have been assigned and then reassigned. This creates even more problems and delays, as new judges have to learn old facts and lawyers have to go over the same ground again and again.
For which repetition they must charge their clients.
 
A Lawyer's Lot:
Hurry Up and Wait
 Matrimonial lawyers bill on the basis of time expended, usually $250 to $500 an hour in Manhattan. They charge whether the time was wisely spent or stupidly imposed on them. When a lawyer has to wait three hours to spend five minutes with a judge or has to repeat things that were said long before, the client foots the bill. Often, the bill becomes enormous. Yet while various customer groups and judicial commissions have pointed fingers at lawyers' billing practices as the cause of the astronomical legal fees now all too common in divorce cases, they rarely acknowledge the sheer magnitude of the time lawyers spend attending to judges who are accountable to no one for the lawyers' time, and clients' money, that they waste.
Nor do they acknowledge the responsibility the clients themselves bear for the fees about which they so bitterly complain.
To be sure, clients face an intimidating task when they enter the matrimonial arena. They are generally angry and upset, understandably so, and they are also suggestible. And as many people have pointed out, wives are often more vulnerable than husbands, both emotionally and economically, since they may be financially dependent on their husbands and occupied with the care of the children. These women don't know the law, or quite understand it, and yes, there are some lawyers who take advantage of that fact by urging their clients to take costly and unnecessary action.
But most clients, men or women, need little urging to act foolishly. As a result, much of a good lawyer's work involves preventing the client from giving in to his or her most self-destructive impulses.
I suppose it is human nature to want validation or even revenge when one feels wronged by a loved one. Yet many people are so angry that they lose all perspective, and demand that their lawyer help them in "destroying" a spouse through financial or custodial battling. And if the lawyer suggests a more rational or humane approach, or one more likely to succeed, this kind of angry client is likely to accuse him or her of weakness, incompetence or even complicity with the other spouse.
When it comes to anger, I've seen it all. There was the couple who hurled cigarette-filled ashtrays across a conference room as the lawyers ducked for cover. There was the wife who threw herself down the stairs and pretended she was pushed, and the wife who sold their house out from under her husband by having an impostor appear at the closing.
Then there was the Manhattan husband who insisted that he could retire and take care of their child, with his soon-to-be ex-wife supporting him. (I'll never forget the moment he said to the judge -- a woman -- that working women were by definition incapable of raising children properly.) There was the father who enlisted his sons in an "army" so that they could physically attack their mother and get medals and promotions for doing so. And there was the Brooklyn mother who refused to let her husband, a clergyman, see their small son because, she said, she alone in the world knew how to care for him. At the custody hearing, she fell to irrational pieces, much like Captain Queeg in "The Caine Mutiny."
Yet, as crazy as it sounds, every one of these people will probably swear to you, even today, that what he or she did was morally right.
As a lawyer, you are supposed to represent your client and obey the client's wishes. Too often, their anger forces you to sally forth like Don Quixote, your lance dipped in vitriol. Whether you have a reasonable chance of winning is beside the point to the client, who may well cite the all-too-predictable failure of your efforts as a justification for not paying you later on.
Which brings up another sore point: lots of clients don't pay their bills. As a small-business man, I grew tired of carrying accounts receivable on the scale of a multinational corporation. And I grew tired of clients' telling me to litigate issues on credit that should never should have been litigated at all, or telling me why financing their Caribbean vacation was more important than paying me.
Finally, the problem of over-litigation by many clients is compounded by the near-total anarchy that has lately come to define the law on custody and finances. After decades of rarely deigning to smudge its fingertips on the nasty problems of divorce litigants, the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, now seems hellbent on changing many precedents the lower appellate courts established in the field. As a result, everything is changing, and not necessarily for the better. It's become a free-for-all, and many clients seem to believe that anything is worth a shot nowadays.
 
When in Doubt,
Fight It Out
 Examples of the chaos abound. A parent may now be allowed to move with a child to a distant place even though that would violate the other parent's visitation rights, something that was not allowed very often in the past. Now, because the Court of Appeals says it might be all right after all, parents have another reason to fight over custody and the possible departure of their children for inaccessible places.
At one time, child support was fixed by law at a certain percentage of gross parental income up to $80,000 a year, and apportioned between parents based upon their respective earnings. But the Court of Appeals has now approved applying the percentages to a couple's total income. Unfortunately, the court established no clear-cut criteria for making this determination.
As a result, fathers with financial means, fearful of losing their prosperity, are now thinking about custody fights far more than they ever did. Where mothers once might have settled cases, they are now refusing, hoping to hit the jackpot. The practical consequence again: more litigation, more delay, more expense.
More fighting. In our adversary system, after all, that's what you're supposed to do in court: fight. Except that fighting costs more than it ever did before. Clients are confused and angry, and because anything seems possible, their expectations are often unrealistic and are rarely met. The clients are therefore almost never happy with the results of their lawyers' labors. A "thank you" in the divorce business has become as rare as snow in July.
So I gave it up. To a person, every colleague who learned of my decision last year congratulated me. They envied my escape from what has become a depressing and an aggravating business. They are still in the practice of law today, and they all confirm that I did the right thing.
In fact, by giving up my law practice, I have attained the kind of celebrity with my peers that I lost with the public at large. When we meet, it is they who gather round, eager to see if it's true that there's life after matrimonial law.
Believe me, there is.

How a Bad Law May Have Become Worse
DIVORCE law has always been something of a stepchild in the family of New York jurisprudence.
The influence of the Roman Catholic Church restricted the availability of divorces for many years. Until 1967, the only ground for divorce in New York was adultery. And to avoid collusive divorces, the courts required corroboration, meaning that an admission of adultery was not enough. You needed a third party -- a private eye, usually -- to confirm that a tryst had occurred.
So New Yorkers who wanted divorces were often obliged to go elsewhere. Depending on the era, that might have meant Mexico, the Dominican Republic or Reno, Nev. George Cukor's 1939 film "The Women" is all about rich New Yorkers moving to Nevada for six weeks to be divorced.
Eventually, the Divorce Reform Law was enacted 30 years ago, expanding the grounds to those of today, which do not include any kind of no-fault ground. Couples were no longer required to attend state "conciliation bureaus," which were intended to encourage divorce-bound couples to reconsider their decision.
Still, until 1980, the law concerning marital property remained archaic. In New York, property belonged by law to the person who held title, regardless of what was fair. So, for example, if a couple's home or a husband's business was in his name alone, it became his in the divorce, period. To even the score, a wife could receive alimony for life, unless she was found at fault.
The 1980 Equitable Distribution Law changed all that. Marital property was to be evaluated and distributed "equitably," regardless of title. Either a husband or a wife could get maintenance (the word alimony was abandoned), but not necessarily permanently. The law was trumpeted as a solution to the economic injustice that wives often suffered in a divorce.
But the law never defined "property." Did it include licenses and educational degrees? How about professional practices that could not be sold, like law practices? Since these and many other kinds of small or family businesses are not usually bought and sold, how do you determine market value?
While divorces were never cheap, the confusion following the 1980 law caused costs to explode. Because of all the uncertainty, most of the early cases involving substantial assets were litigated extensively and appealed. While a consensus eventually emerged, the Court of Appeals now seems to be changing some of the rules.
In almost every case now, there have to be accountants, appraisers and actuaries as well as lawyers. If there are custody disputes, there have to be psychologists and psychiatrists. Economists have been called in some cases to establish the value of homemaking services or the likelihood of a person's ability to enter the workplace. In many cases, where dishonesty is suspected, there is endless detective work, and there can be long, drawn-out depositions.
The resolution of such complex issues takes time, perseverance and money, all of which may be in short supply for the economically dependent spouse, usually the wife. As a result, some advocates say the Equitable Distribution Law has actually resulted in more injustice for women, not less. BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
City to Consider Allowing Merchants to Run Market as a Co-op

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII

 BODY:
In its latest effort to quell mounting discontent among merchants at Mart 125, the city-owned indoor market, the city has agreed to consider the merchants' request that they be allowed to buy the building and run the market as a co-op.
Councilwoman C. Virginia Fields said the agreement came during a meeting between her and the Commissioner of the Department of Business Services, Earl Andrews. 
 But both Ms. Fields and Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington say it is premature to assume that the city will agree to a co-op plan. Mr. Washington said the merchants first had to improve their balance sheets and show that they could manage a joint operation. "Until people can demonstrate they can run something successfully," he said, "we are not going to do anything."
Since opening in 1986, the market has had many problems including a leaky roof, uncollected garbage and a broken air-conditioner. A city audit in 1994 showed that the former sponsor, the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, owed the city more than $2 million.
Richard Hollins, president of the Mart 125 Merchants Association and the owner of the R & B Jewelry stall, attributes the problems to the city's refusal to give the merchants a stake in the market. "Instead of helping us to achieve our goal, the state and the city have forced one management company after another on us," Mr. Hollins said.
Last April, the city, which owns the mart building on 125th Street between Frederick Douglass and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevards, brought in the the Masjid Malcolm Shabazz mosque as sponsor to repair the roof and air-conditioner and to buy radio advertisements to publicize the mart, Mr. Washington said. The city also recently adjusted rents to better reflect the size of the stalls. A few rents were raised but most were lowered, some by as much as $200 a month. Most rents are now $400 to $800 a month. Still, some merchants are continuing a rent strike under way almost since the mart opened.
Merchants were also angry when they found out that the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, which manages the building, applied last August to transfer the property to the Department of Economic Development. The city said the transfer was a necessary step for offering tenants long-term leases. But many vendors say they think the city wants to sell the building to private investors.
Some merchants, even those who support the co-op say they are worried about whether the concept could work.
The owner of a bath oil stall in the mart, Alvin Reid Jr., said he did not want to borrow money to buy into the co-op. "To me, the most important thing is to get business back to normal," Mr. Reid said. "Unless business picks up, I don't want to incur more debt." JANE H. LII

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
The Not-So-Invisible Hand In the Great Dow Climb

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
THE mutual fund industry has been going to great lengths to deny responsibility for the stock market's boisterous rally, which last week took the Dow Jones industrial average above 7,000 and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over 800, each for the first time.
At a recent meeting with reporters, Don Powell, the chairman of he Investment Company Institute, the industry's leading trade group, and of Van Kampen/American Capital, a family of mutual funds owned by Morgan Stanley & Company, tried to dismiss the notion by saying that mutual funds owned only 14 percent of corporate equities in this country, far less than the amount owned by individuals and pension funds. 
 John Rea, the chief economist of the trade group, concurred, telling the meeting that the institute's studies showed "no correlation between the performance of the equity market and mutual fund flows."
But plenty of people believe otherwise. For evidence, look at what happened on Wednesday, when the institute reported that $24 billion flowed into stock mutual funds in January. Within a half-hour, the Dow industrials doubled their gain for the day. On Thursday, the Dow industrials continued their rally, moving above the latest thousand-point mark before falling to 6,988.96 at Friday's close.
That Wall Street traders and brokers are watching mutual fund cash flows is clear to Melissa Brown, a quantitative analyst at Prudential Securities, who each week sends Prudential's brokers and traders a summary of the cash flow reports provided by AMG Data Services, an independent fund-tracking company in Arcata, Calif.
"We crunch the numbers every week, and if our report is five minutes late, people get upset," Ms. Brown said.
At Smith Barney, professionals ranging from equity traders, who must make minute-to-minute investment decisions, to brokers, who presumably work with a longer-term perspective, are "all pretty interested" in how much cash is coming into the firm's mutual funds, said Jessica Bibliowicz, who oversees the mutual funds unit.
"Does mutual fund cash flow affect the market?" she asked. "I think it definitely does."
To be sure, the $24 billion that flowed into equity mutual funds, as estimated by the Investment Company Institute, was not a record for inflows in a single month. That accolade belongs to January 1996, when $28.9 billion moved in. And when measured as a percentage of assets already invested in stock funds, last month's inflow of 1.37 percent fell below the level recorded in each of the first five months last year.
OTHER factors have also have helped keep the market moving ahead. Corporate earnings are robust. The economy is humming. The dollar is strong. Consumers are confident and intent on saving for the future.
Since late 1990, those factors have combined to fuel a nearly unbroken rise in stock prices. During that time, the Dow industrials have not fallen more than 10 percent below their peak level.
Only one thing has changed: the portion of corporate equities held by mutual funds.
According to the Federal Reserve, that percentage has more than doubled since the end of 1990, to 14.3 percent from 6.6 percent. (Like most Government statistics, the Fed's numbers are somewhat dated. The most recent figures measure holdings through the third quarter of 1996.)
Over the same period, the portion of equities owned by individuals directly rather than through mutual funds fell only slightly, to 47.7 percent from 49.9 percent. The portion owned by pension plans, both government and corporate, and insurance companies edged down from 30.2 percent to 28.6 percent. Foreign ownership fell, too, to 6.1 percent from 6.9 percent.
Some of the transfer of stock ownership from individuals to mutual funds might simply be money going out of one pocket and into another. Assume, for example, that John Q. Public's employer replaces the employee pension plan with a 401(k) retirement plan, and Mr. Public decides to sell those utility stocks left to him by his aunt and use the extra money to increase his contributions to his 401(k) plan.
In the Federal Reserve's data that would register as a decline in personal holdings of securities and a rise in mutual fund holdings, although the net result would, in fact, be a wash.
But if Mr. Public's employer matches a portion of his contribution, as many employers do, that would increase the mutual fund holdings of equities. And over time, as those mutual funds performed better than those stodgy utility stocks favored by Auntie Public, the fund's portion would grow further.
THE growth of the mutual fund industry has affected the stock market in other ways, too. Individuals who own stocks are far less likely to be active traders than are mutual fund managers. According to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund trackers, nearly one-quarter of the mutual funds that invest in a broad array of American stocks turn over their entire portfolios each year.
And increasingly, the fund managers are focusing on the stocks of the biggest American corporations. To keep up with the soaring returns of the Dow industrials and the S.& P. 500, many managers have been bidding up the prices of the largest stocks while ignoring their smaller cousins.
The difference is stark. While the S.& P. 500 index of big-company stocks gained 9.6 percent from the beginning of the year through Thursday, the S.& P. index of 600 small-cap stocks had grown just 1.4 percent.
Few fund managers can find a reason, it seems, not to own popular stocks like those of the technology leaders Intel and Cisco Systems, or of long-term blue-chip corporations like I.B.M. and Merck. To illustrate, those four companies are among the top 10 holdings of both the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund, which focuses on stocks of well-known and established companies, and the Fidelity Emerging Growth fund, which aims to buy developing companies.
Looking at such trends makes people like Ms. Brown, the Prudential analyst, scoff at the fund industry's notion that flows to mutual funds are not driving the market's gains. "People are paying a lot of attention to those numbers," she said.
Which raises the question: What happens if the cash flow to mutual funds slows down?
"One week's or one month's data truly don't tell you anything," Ms. Brown said. "But a lot of people are nervous about the valuation levels of the market. They may be betting that the underlying support of the mutual fund flows will continue." So, she said, "If those flows dry up, it's Katy bar the door."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "A Different Perspective"
This chart, plotted on a logarithmic scale, gives the same visual weight to comparable percentage changes. A 100-point rise when the Dow Jones industrial average is at 1,000 looks the same here as a 700-point rise when the Dow is at 7,000. Through this lens, the Dow's recent run-up looks less extraordinary.

HEADLINE: Our Best Defense

BYLINE: By James A. Baker 3d; James A. Baker 3d, Secretary of State under President George Bush, is honorary chairman of the James A. Baker 3d Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
The Chemical Weapons Convention an international treaty that commits member nations to destroy their chemical weapons and to forswear future production, acquisition or use of them -- is before the Senate for approval. Despite the fact that the treaty was negotiated under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, a number of Republicans have expressed reservations about it. I respect their motives, but their concerns are misplaced.
For instance, some have argued that we shouldn't commit to the treaty because rogue states like Libya, Iraq and North Korea, which have not signed it, will still be able to continue their efforts to acquire chemical weapons. This is obviously true. But the convention, which has been endorsed by 68 countries and will go into effect in April whether or not we have ratified it, will make it more difficult for these states to do so by prohibiting the sale of materials to nonmembers that can be used to make chemical weapons. 
 In an ideal world, rogue states and terrorist groups would simply give up the use of chemical weapons. But ours is not an ideal world. The Chemical Weapons Convention recognizes that, and so should its opponents. It makes no sense to argue that because a few pariah states refuse to join the convention the United States should line up with them rather than with the rest of the world.
Others have argued that if we ratify the treaty, we will not be able to verify that all members will abide by it. No international agreement, of course, is perfectly verifiable -- just as no domestic law is perfectly enforceable. But the treaty sets up a verification system, including international inspections on short notice, that will be far more effective than what we possess today. Moreover, the treaty would strengthen information-sharing among member states. It would increase, not diminish, our understanding of chemical weapons threats.
Some opponents of the treaty claim that it would create yet another costly international bureaucracy and place an onerous regulatory burden on American business. Both assertions are overstated. Our share for administering the treaty would be about $25 million a year, a truly modest amount in a Federal budget of about $1.7 trillion. Only about 140 companies would have significant reporting requirements, while some 2,000 others would be asked to fill out a short form.
Moreover, failure to ratify the treaty would actually cost the American chemical industry hundreds of millions of dollars in sales by making United States exporters subject to trade restrictions by convention members. Our joining the convention could help American business -- which is why the chemical industry supports ratification.
Other critics assert that the treaty would somehow infringe on our national sovereignty -- in particular, the Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable search and seizure. In fact, it explicitly permits members to abide by their constitutional requirements when providing access to international inspectors. Under the treaty, involuntary inspection of American manufacturing and storage sites would still require legally acquired search warrants. The idea that ratifying the treaty would repeal part of our Bill of Rights is simply wrong.
But by far the most important argument against the treaty is that ratification would somehow undermine our national security.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Let me be blunt: The idea that Ronald Reagan and George Bush would negotiate a treaty detrimental to this nation's security is grotesque.
The United States does not need chemical weapons as a deterrent. Any nation or group contemplating a chemical attack against us must reckon with our overwhelming conventional force and vast nuclear arsenal. Each is more than sufficient to deter a chemical attack.
Chemical weapons are relatively easy to develop and cheap to manufacture, so it is no coincidence that the rogue nations now seeking to build chemical arsenals are economically impoverished and technologically backward. Unlike Iraq or Libya, we don't need such weapons to project our influence. In fact, we are already committed -- under a law signed in 1985 by President Reagan -- to destroy our existing chemical weapons stockpile by 2004. We will do this whether or not we ratify the treaty.
What we need is a way to limit the risk that American troops or civilians may someday face a chemical weapons attack. The convention can help do precisely this by controlling the flow of illicit trade materials and by making it easier to marshal international support for the political, diplomatic and economic isolation of countries that refuse to ratify it.
If we fail to ratify the convention, we will not only forgo any influence in the continuing effort against chemical weapons, we will also risk postponing indefinitely any progress on an international ban on the equally dire threat of biological weapons. More generally, we will imperil our leadership in the entire area of nonproliferation, perhaps the most vital security issue of the post-cold-war era.
Today we face a monumental choice requiring a bipartisan consensus, just as we did in ratifying the North American Free Trade Act in 1993. Failure to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention would send a message of American retreat from engagement in the world. For this reason -- and because our national interest is better served by joining the convention than by lining up with pariah states outside it -- I support the treaty and urge my fellow Republicans to do the same.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
South Africa Slips in Role Of a 'Tiger'

BYLINE: By GREGORY JORDAN 

 BODY:
THREE years ago, South Africa seemed on the verge of stealing the "economic tiger" title from its Asian counterparts. Its peaceful transition to majority rule and a booming, liquid stock market looked promising. Three closed-end funds began for eager American investors, and a couple of open-end funds followed suit.
But last year, the market tumbled on inflation and political uncertainty, and the South African rand wobbled. Talk died down of South Africa eclipsing the high-growth Asian economies, which represent three-fourths of emerging-market stock holdings. 
 Managers of funds with an African focus have responded in part by spreading their assets among other nations, including Ghana, Mauritius and Zimbabwe.
Jaideep Khanna, who manages the Morgan Stanley Africa Investment fund, says South African equities dropped to about 40 percent of his portfolio in the last quarter of 1996, from nearly 70 percent in 1994.
"Right now, South Africa is bouncing back, but we're also moving into Botswana, Egypt, Ghana, Mauritius, Zimbabwe and others," Mr. Khanna said. "They're going in cycles -- you can't really say the Asian tiger growth has taken hold."
Partly because of its shift away from South Africa, the Morgan Stanley fund, the biggest of the group at $304 million in assets, had a total return of 9.9 percent for the 12 months ended in January, while the South African stock market, as tracked by the Financial Times Actuaries, was down 24 percent in dollar terms.
Among the three closed-end funds that began in early 1994, the best performer has been the Southern Africa Fund. From its inception through January, it had a total return of 75 percent, versus 58 percent for the Morgan Stanley fund and 19 percent for the New South Africa fund, reported Lipper Analytical Services, the fund trackers.
 These three funds have been trading at about a 20 percent discount to the value of their underlying assets. Closed-end funds issue a set number of shares, which trade on a stock exchange, usually at a discount or a premium, depending on investor interest.
AMONG the region's open-end funds, which continuously issue new shares, the Merrill Lynch Middle East/ Africa fund kept its loss small last year. The fund, with $7.8 million in assets, has made big bets on Egypt and South Africa, with the latter slipping to 23 percent of holdings last November from 28 percent a year earlier.
 "These African countries are still very early in their reforms," said Grace Pineda, the fund's manager. "But fundamental changes in Africa now justify investment in the whole region, not only South Africa."
 Other open-end funds that focus on the area are Calvert New Africa and Lexington Strategic Investments, which buys South African mining stocks. ASA Limited, a closed-end fund that dates to 1958, similarly invests in mining concerns and has a big stake in South Africa.
Funds that invest in emerging markets around the world often provide a little exposure to sub-Saharan Africa, too. According to Ian Wilson, editor of Micropal Emerging Market Fund Monitor, these funds had $4.4 billion in Africa in the third quarter, and two-thirds of them have African holdings.
Still, managers note the speculative nature of investing in Africa and the painful transition from an economy based on agriculture and natural resources to one based on manufacturing. They cite political instability in Nigeria and Zaire and tie growth in countries like Zimbabwe to good weather and agricultural output. "You can't really compare African economies with other emerging markets yet," Mr. Khanna said. "It's the last place capital goes."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: James D. Oelschlager;
White Oak Growth Stock Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
TIRED of trailing the Standard & Poor's 500?
Plenty of investors are. In frustration, many are flocking to funds that mimic the index. 
 But among those still trying to beat the benchmark, a few have planted their money in the tiny White Oak Growth Stock fund, which invests in large growth stocks and has outperformed the index handily over the last three years.
Last month alone, the fund's assets rose more than 50 percent, to $62 million, said James D. Oelschlager, who manages White Oak, which is not yet five years old, and the Pin Oak fund, its small-capitalization stock counterpart, from Akron, Ohio.
No wonder White Oak is getting attention. Fund investors generally consider a large-capitalization growth fund a core holding in their portfolios. Such funds tend to own the biggest blue chips -- like I.B.M. and Coca-Cola -- whose earnings are growing quickly.
Among these funds, White Oak has been an exception. Only 11 of 108 large-cap growth funds beat the S.& P. over the three years, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund researchers. White Oak gained 30.4 percent a year, on average, in the three years ended in January, versus 20.7 percent for the S.& P. and 16.8 percent for the average large growth-stock fund. White Oak, a no-load fund, rose 39.4 percent in 1996, versus 26.3 percent for the S.& P.
Mr. Oelschlager, 54, does battle daily not only with fund rivals, but also with a personal demon, multiple sclerosis. He swims each morning in his indoor pool before leaving for work at Oak Associates, his $5 billion money management firm. It is one of the few forms of exercise available to him since he was confined to a wheelchair in 1985. But he brushes off his misfortune. "Everyone gets dealt some good and bad cards in life," he said, "and I've gotten lots of good ones."
Investments piqued his curiosity in the seventh grade, when he reaped the princely sum of $25 a week on his Cleveland Plain Dealer paper route. His father introduced him to a stockbroker, who helped him invest his earnings. Except for several years attending law school and then a short stint practicing law, he has remained enamored of the investment business.
As a manager, Mr. Oelschlager runs a tight ship. White Oak owns just 22 stocks, with technology accounting for 65 percent of the portfolio, financial services 25 percent and health care 10 percent. Broad diversification is not his fund's goal. "We're concentrated in areas and number of issues," he said, adding that he would run a $300 million individual portfolio the same way.
Over all, he is optimistic about stocks. "I don't think that valuations are excessive like they were in the early 1970's," he said. "People will be surprised how strong earnings reports will come in in 1997."
In particular, he is looking for technology stocks to gather momentum after their slump last summer. The most attractive area, he said, is wide-area networking, the business of linking computers around the world for a company or an enterprise.
When he picks stocks, Mr. Oelschlager looks for a price-earnings multiple lower than the company's projected rate of earnings growth. The stocks in his portfolio now trade at 25 to 30 times anticipated earnings for 1997. He also likes to buy when the multiple is near its five-year low.
Once he buys, he tends to hold. White Oak's annual turnover is roughly 25 percent, versus 90 percent for stock funds over all.
Because the market tends to be irrational in the short term, he said, "we don't get too concerned if a stock misses its quarterly earnings estimate by one or two cents."
"If a stock falls," he said, "we view that as a buy opportunity."

A Software Specialist
Whenever the stock price dips, he is adding to his stake in Parametric Technology, a software company in Waltham, Mass., with a market capitalization of $7.7 billion. It specializes in computer-aided design and supplies programs for mechanical engineers. Its markets are growing rapidly, especially abroad.
Mr. Oelschlager calls the company "a bit underfollowed" by Wall Street stock analysts and says it has a "record like clockwork" for earnings and revenue growth. Wall Street expects its earnings to grow about 35 percent a year, but he is even more optimistic about the company's managers. "They consistently do better than promised," he said.
Parametric, coming off a fantastic 1996, is trading at about 34 times his projected earnings for the year that will end in September. That multiple should drop to the mid-20's based on 1998 estimates, Mr. Oelschlager predicted, as earnings grow.

Riding a Chip Rebound
Another favorite is Applied Materials of Santa Clara, Calif., which makes equipment for the semiconductor industry and has a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion.
The ups and downs of semiconductor stocks may be too extreme, in his view. "We're seeing a pickup in the semiconductor markets after last year's slowdown," he said. "I think the semiconductor market is stronger than most, because people tend to overdo things on the downside."
Shares of Applied have recovered from their plunge last summer and absolutely soared last week. "There's more interest in this stock," he acknowledged, "but it still has a lot more room."
On Wednesday, stock analysts revised earnings estimates upward about 20 percent for the stock based on an improving outlook and first-quarter results. Mr. Oelschlager expects, however, that even these expectations will prove conservative. The stock price, now at $52.875, remains relatively inexpensive, he contends, at 25 times earnings estimates for the fiscal year ending in October and 16 times earnings for the next year.

A Big Bank, and Getting Bigger
In the financial services sector, Mr. Oelschlager is adding to his stake in Nationsbank, the Charlotte, N.C., banking giant with a market capitalization of $47 billion.
The company is well positioned to make more acquisitions, he said, and to expand its territory beyond its base in the Southeast. Last month, it acquired Boatmen's Bancshares of St. Louis for $9.76 billion. Nationsbank has "smart management with a good record of acquisitions in the South and Southwest, and enjoys the benefits of economies of scale as it consolidates," he said.
He expects annual earnings growth of 15 percent over the next three to five years. The stock is trading at about 13 times his expected earnings. Stock analysts expect Nationsbank to earn $8.57 a share this year, a modest increase from $8.01 in 1996. The stock has risen sharply since the Boatmen's acquisition was announced in August and since the recent announcement of a 2-for-1 stock split, to take effect on Feb. 27.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
On the Books, More Fact and Less Fiction

BYLINE: By JON E. HILSENRATH 

 BODY:
EARNINGS season is upon us, and some accounting experts say the numbers you are seeing tell a more truthful story about corporate America than they once did.
Not long ago, companies were routinely writing off huge expenses in the midst of sweeping restructurings. In fact, from 1991 through 1993, nearly $1 of every $3 of earnings posted by American companies was more myth than reality and had to be written off. These mea culpas not only kept investors off-balance, but, when used too liberally, they distorted earnings for years to come. 
 "Negative surprises," as scandals are politely called on Wall Street, are by no means a thing of the past. Write-offs still claim about $1 of every $10 of reported earnings, and companies still have assorted brushes for adding color to their results. But a recent report from Goldman, Sachs shows that with the sharp decline in corporate write-offs, the income reports you see today are telling a more accurate story about companies' operations.
In addition, balance sheets "are the cleanest that they have been in most investors' professional lives," said Abby Joseph Cohen, an investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs and co-author of the study. "Investors, in general, are increasingly comfortable that what is being reported by a company is close to the truth."
You don't have to wear green eyeshades to appreciate the larger point. Soaring stock prices have everyone -- including the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan -- fretting. How can one explain, they ask, that an investor now has to pay 20.5 times earnings to buy the Standard & Poor's 500, the highest level since 1993.
But at least some of that expansion in multiples may be deserved, the Goldman study suggests, as investors have grown confident that a dollar of earnings is a dollar of earnings. Price-to-earnings ratios may well be rising because investors have greater confidence in the quality of the numbers being reported. "Investors appear to be willing to pay a higher premium for the higher quality inherent in reported earnings," said Ms. Cohen's co-author, Gabrielle Napolitano, a Goldman, Sachs analyst who specializes in accounting issues.
Book values, which reflect how much a company is worth after subtracting debts and other liabilities, are also gaining new respect. Investors are paying 4.6 times book value for the S.& P. 500, compared with 2.6 times in 1991, when write-offs were rampant.
(Oddly enough, as earnings reports have become cleaner, confidence in earnings estimates has been badly shaken. The quarterly profits reported last month by I.B.M., Intel and Merrill Lynch all surpassed Wall Street's expectations, and yet all three stocks were immediately hammered by investors.)
Why is accounting getting cleaner? The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or F.A.S.B., the panel that makes the rules for the private sector, has a lot to do with it. It has made great strides in tightening the rules that corporations must obey to earn a clean opinion from their auditors. On their financial statements, companies can no longer dance around the eventual cost of delivering health care to future retirees. New standards also lay down more detailed rules for the way companies report their use of complex financial instruments, and they require companies to write off bad assets sooner than they might have in the past.
The healthy economy and low inflation have done their part, too. If corporate executives can make their numbers honestly, they have less incentive to resort to accounting tricks or bogus restructuring charges to keep things humming.
While these improvements are important, investors should keep their pencils sharpened. A handful of accounting gimmicks persist, and they can seriously distort a company's value. As a result, companies' assertions in annual reports still need to be carefully scrutinized.
INVESTORS have rediscovered this in just the last two weeks, as they have struggled to understand how two separate Big Board companies so badly missed the mark when describing their respective financial health. In the first case, the Mercury Finance Company, which makes auto loans to high-risk borrowers, managed to overstate its earnings by $90 million in the last four years. Mercury says the overstatement was due to "accounting irregularities," which it attributed to a rogue financial officer.
In the second, Centennial Technologies, a maker of personal-computer equipment, announced last week that it had opened an inquiry into the accuracy of its reported earnings because of discoveries made in its year-end audit. By week's end, the company had dismissed its chief executive and suspended its chief financial officer. The stock, already toppled from the $58-a-share level where it traded in December, closed on Monday at $16.50 and has not reopened for trading.
Executives don't have to risk committing fraud to play with earnings. The Goldman study notes somewhat archly that accounting rules still give financial officers plenty of "opportunities" -- all quite legal -- to massage income statements. Using different approaches, financial officers can shift earnings from the present to the future, paving the way for steady earnings growth. They can also take tomorrow's earnings and place them on today's income statements, pleasing impatient investors. And if the auditors do not object, these executives can get away with reporting revenues well before their time.
Though it has come a long way in demanding that financial officers be more conservative, the accounting standards board is still wrestling with how to write rules dealing with complicated issues like how companies should account for items that do not have tangible value -- research and development, for instance, or investments in advertising. And there are still gray areas in the rules that are on the books.
"Accounting has never been and will never be an exact science and a precise measurement exercise," said Timothy S. Lucas, director of research at the rule-making body. "There is an element of judgment that will always be necessary."
Consider, for example, I.B.M.'s accounting for its recent acquisitions of the Lotus Development Corporation, Tivoli Systems Inc. and Object Technology International Inc. Because of the accounting method that it chose, I.B.M. was able to show a significant jump in earnings for 1996. It was also able to set up its financial statements to show earnings growth in the future.
To understand what happened, start with the notion of good will. When a company pays more than the tangible value of another company's physical assets -- as I.B.M. did in these cases -- the premium it pays is called good will. This is the added value that the acquired company brings to the party because of its good name, its trade secrets, its franchise or its years of experience.
Typically, in the United States, the good will acquired in mergers and takeovers is treated like any physical asset, like a piece of machinery or a corporate jet. It is depreciated -- or systematically reduced in value -- over the same number of years that the asset is expected to help produce revenue for its owner.
But I.B.M. classified $2.275 billion from those 1995 and 1996 acquisitions as an immediate expense called "purchased in-process research and development," not good will. This was ostensibly I.B.M.'s estimate of the value of the research and development that the acquired companies were undertaking at the time of the purchases. So, instead of writing off the good will over several years -- which would put a drag on earnings for years to come -- it took a quick hit to earnings in 1995 and again in 1996 at the time of the acquisitions.
WHY was I.B.M. so eager to reduce its earnings? The maneuver gave the company ample room to show earnings growth in the future, secure in the belief that investors were likely to treat the charges being booked on the front end as one-time adjustments irrelevant to recurring earnings.
"This is called the 'big bath' in accounting," said Baruch Lev, an accounting professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
And what was the impact of this big bath on Big Blue? Its 1996 earnings report showed that with the special expense treatment included, I.B.M. reported income for 1996 of $5.4 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion from 1995. If the company had written off this good will over a more traditional period, like five years, rather than taking a one-time expense, profits for 1996 would have been $5.5 billion, down from $5.8 billion in 1995.
Professor Lev estimates that more than 300 companies have used similar techniques to account for acquisitions of high-technology companies in the last two years.
"Everybody does it," said one trader who finds the practice appalling.
While I.B.M. chose to hurry expenses, setting the stage for future earnings growth, other companies tarry in recognizing expenses to make their earnings look nicer today. This tactic is particularly true of younger companies under pressure to impress investors in a hurry.
America Online offered but one recent example. Typically, a company treats its charges for running a marketing program as an expense that reduces earnings on the income statement. But until late last year, America Online was able to mask its costs of shipping millions of trial diskettes to prospective customers. It classified those costs as an asset that only gradually had to be amortized, or whittled off its balance sheet.
Most companies would have immediately listed those costs as an expense, said Howard Schilit, an adjunct accounting professor at American University who writes a newsletter on accounting mischief.
BY Sept. 30 of last year, $385 million in so-called "deferred subscriber acquisition costs" -- really marketing expenses -- had built up on America Online's balance sheet. That included $237 million accumulated in its fiscal year that ended last June, nearly eight times more than its reported net income of $30 million. America Online changed its accounting procedures in September in the face of widespread complaints by analysts and it took a charge of $385 million, essentially acknowledging all of the deferred costs at once. Between that episode and other problems caused by the company's new pricing plan, the company's net worth has shrunk to a runty $39 million.
In this case, the odd-sounding asset should have been the tip-off. Balance-sheet entries are usually fairly simple, like inventories, accounts receivable or property. If something looks unusual, it is almost always worth checking.
The other lesson is to monitor year-to-year changes of all key items on the financial statements. If sales are rising briskly, other expenses should be rising in proportion. "One of the things that I always do when I look at a company is a trend analysis," said James Murray, a forensic accountant with Kroll Associates, a private investigation firm in New York. "If you see that over a period of three or four years there is a very clear-cut trend in activity, and then, for whatever reason, the numbers are way up or way down, there has got to be an explanation for that."
For instance, looking at trends on America Online's balance sheet would have shown the deferred subscriber cost ballooning last year.
A simple change in accounting procedures can also give a company a quick earnings lift. On Nov. 12, Foundation Health, a managed-care company based in Rancho Cordova, Calif., announced quarterly pretax income of $53.3 million, down $7 million from the comparable period of 1995. But the situation was actually worse than that. One hint: while the rest of its expenses were rising in line with sales growth, depreciation expenses dropped by $2 million. Why? Foundation Health had changed its depreciation schedule, by deciding to write off assets over a longer period, spreading the costs.
Seven days later, however, the company announced that it was restating its earnings, "after further analysis and consultation with the company's independent auditors" at Coopers & Lybrand. Lo and behold, when it did, pretax earnings were $47.9 million, not $53.3 million, and the depreciation expense was re-entered as an increase from the previous year, not a decrease.
Finally, investors need to beware of some companies' tendency to record revenue before they are sure they will receive payment for their shipments. This has become a problem with small software companies looking for fast results. Under current accounting rules, they have enormous leeway over when they give themselves credit for items like promised upgrades.
And it can be a problem with companies that are simply impatient to show results. Kurzweil Applied Intelligence Inc., a developer of voice-recognition systems for computers, became mired in scandal after it began taking liberties with revenues in 1991. Top brass at the time began allowing sales representatives to count toward their quotas sales that were not quite final. To cover their tracks, goods were stored in temporary warehouses until the paperwork calling for them to be shipped was complete. By 1992, the company was including in its quarterly results sales that were consummated up to two weeks after the quarter had ended, and by the next year all inhibition had vanished, with the company booking any twinkle in the eye as a done deal.
The company's former treasurer pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges, and two other executives, including its onetime president, were convicted of related charges. Kurzweil is now operating under new management.
Investors, however, have one piece of ammunition at their fingertips. When companies are monkeying around with sales, there is a good chance the firm's accounts-receivable line on the balance sheet will start growing out of proportion with the rest of the financial statement. Accounts receivable are sales that have been booked but are not paid for. By looking at accounts receivable as a percentage of sales over a period of years, you may detect the sorts of unusual swings that could be a tip-off to larger problems.
WHEN all is said and done, earnings may be getting more reliable. But as long as managers have big incentives to produce quarterly earnings, they will be tempted to find ways to fiddle with the numbers.
"Nowadays, you have a lot of bonuses that are tied to the performance of a company," Mr. Murray of Kroll Associates said. "You also have a lot of pressure on senior management to perform well to look good in the marketplace. This is a problem that we see quite often."
Investors, in other words, should still think twice before taking companies at their word.

In the early 1990's, $1 of every $3 of reported income had to written off. Because the write-offs often inappropriately included future years' expenses, they distorted earnings for future years, too. Now, though, cleaner balance sheets are being rewarded by higher price-earnings multiples. (Source: Goldman Sachs; Standard & Poor's)(pg. 1)
 
"A Little Tinkering Goes a Long Way"
Until it succumbed to pressure from its auditors, the Foundation Health Corporation was able to report a higher pretax profit in 1996 than it should have, juust by stretching out its depreciation costs over more years. Here is the health-care company's income statement for the quarters that ended on Sept. 30, 1995 and 1996, in millions. (Source: Company Reports)(pg. 5)

Wall Street Is Looking More Like Tokyo

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Just for a moment, think back to a year ago, the last time markets closed to honor Washington's Birthday. Since then oil prices have risen by several dollars a barrel. Long-term interest rates are also up. And the Dow Jones industrial average has leapt by about 1,500 points.
There was a time when increases in crude oil and interest rates would have disturbed the equity markets, but now any such impact is transitory. The Dow took just four months after hitting 6,000 to get all the way to 7,000. There is, of course, talk of 8,000. 
 There should be no mystery about what is propelling this market. It is cash, and the expectation of more cash, from individuals across America. It is no coincidence that the final run to 7,000 came as it was reported that mutual fund investors had poured $24 billion into stock funds last month.
There is a circularity of reasoning here. The money comes in because the market goes up, and the market goes up because the money comes in. Such circles don't last forever, but it is a bold forecaster who will prophesy when this one will end.
Those who find current prices reasonable -- and Wall Street has no shortage of these people -- point to earnings. Analysts this year expect 14 percent growth in corporate profits, and while that is probably optimistic, few think profits will decline. If they rise, it will be the first time since World War II that corporate profits rose for six consecutive years. But now people generally expect good economic news to go on forever. There were few complaints from Wall Street over the fact that President Clinton's budget foresees no recession until at least 2003.
Still, current prices are a bit disconcerting for some analysts. Even assuming that Wall Street is right about how much profits will rise this year, the market is still awfully high. Rick Pucci, the veteran chief of research at IBES International, which used to be known as the Institutional Brokers Estimate System, reports that a month ago the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was trading at the highest ratio of price to expected earnings since IBES started collecting figures on analysts' expectations a quarter century ago.
The unprecedented multiple was 16.5 times expected 1997 profits, but it was hardly a warning of doom. Prices have leapt, and now the figure is 17.2. "If history is any guide," Mr. Pucci said, "where the P/E ratio is now is somewhat above the fair band."
But that is precisely the point. The history of things like price-earnings ratios and economic downturns does not matter to investors. They know that over the last 15 years, those who bought stocks got rich. Those who were cautious did not.
As Charles P. Kindleberger notes in his classic financial history, "Manias, Panics and Crashes," a new edition of which has just been published by Wiley, "There is nothing so disturbing to one's well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich."
For connoisseurs of manias, here's a fact, courtesy of Ed Hyman, the economist with ICI Group: At its peak, the Japanese stock market was valued at 140 percent of that country's gross domestic product. The United States market is now over 133 percent.
There is no magic in past market peaks, just as there is no proof that earnings will ever decline. The baby boom generation wants to save for retirement and thinks stocks are the only way to do it.
Someday, something will change that attitude. But in the meantime the party goes on. And what a party it has been.

How About One in Every Color?

 BODY:
Median household income in the United States is about $35,000. That's less than two-thirds the average bonus that the securities industry's 150,000 workers in New York CIty are expected to draw. The record bonuses for 1996 have already touched off a spending spree that not only improves the region's economy but affects its cultural climate, too.
Wall Street rewards its workers on the basis of the previous year's results, and 1996 was a very good year. In all, the industry is expected to hand out more than $8.1 billion -- averaging $54,000 a person, but ranging from $10 million down to a few thousand dollars. That, in turn, is generating a windfall for local tax departments and for people who sell everything from luxury cars and real estate to $1,350 shoes. Still, the consumption may be a little less conspicuous than when Wall Street last boomed. 
 "You still don't have the ugly behavior of the 80's," said an equity trader at a major brokerage house. "People have all been sobered by the layoffs and entrenchment in the business. Everybody knows we made a lot of money, but it's 'When is it going to end?' rather than 'This could go on forever.' "

World War II's Unfinished Business

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WORLD WAR II, with its global carnage and the Holocaust, is the epic of our age. Each generation has its own increasingly complicated interpretation of the war's meaning and mysteries, its heroes and villains, and more than 50 years later it retains the power to shock and surprise.
Not only has the war suddenly reached out to transform the biography of the new Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, but it is also the source of issues that are engrossing her department and the foreign policy of the United States. 
 "It is extraordinary how much time we as a Government are spending on questions coming directly out of World War II," said Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman. "The war was the compelling, shaping event of the century, and it is back with us."
 
Issues Large and Small
 There are specific issues like Nazi gold and the role of Switzerland and its banks during the war; there are bilateral issues like German annoyance with American criticism of Bonn's treatment of the Scientology movement, which it judges to be a Nazi-like cult; there are judicial issues like the allegedly lax pursuit of accused Nazi war criminals living in Canada and the United States; and there are personal issues like Ms. Albright's newly revealed Jewish ancestry and the impact this revelation may have on her policies. Above all, perhaps, there are issues of regional identity, like the continuing effort to restructure European security so the continent is no longer a potential source of genocidal war.
American foreign policy is dominated by issues of European security that stem from the unfinished business of the war. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the various organizations designed by "the wise men" of the West to provide stability -- NATO, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Organization of Economic Development, even the European Union -- all need to be modernized and broadened.
But the Soviet collapse has also altered moral perspectives. The end of World War II was followed so quickly by the cold war and the effort to contain Moscow that any effort to investigate the behavior of Western allies was pushed aside. "The allies sacrificed the past to the war against Communism," said Amos Perlmutter, a professor at American University.
Self-examination was repressed on the personal and national level, whether the issue was the behavior of Vichy France or neutral Switzerland on the Western side of the continent or of East Germany or the Nazi-occupied Baltics on the Eastern side. National mythologies -- the extent of the French resistance, for example, or the deterrent power of the plucky little Swiss army -- went without challenge. Even Francois Mitterrand, the former President of France, admitted only near the end of his life that he had worked for the Vichy Government.
But with the cold war over, argues Richard N. Haass, director of foreign-policy studies at the Brookings Institution, "the moral dimension of foreign policy has become more pronounced," accelerated by powerful reminders of the persistence of genocide in the televised horrors of Rwanda and Bosnia.
Jurgen Chrobog, Germany's Ambassador to Washington, said the resurgence of war issues struck him too. "After the end of the cold war, we find that Europe is still Europe," he said. "Europe got back to its historical roots -- look at the ethnic problems in former Yugoslavia and elsewhere. In the old East, because of the dictatorships, there was no chance to learn to live together, so all these ethnic conflicts are breaking out again."
World War II, with all its horror and fascination, lit very long fuses of guilt and shame, said Mr. Haass, "and people and countries have only dealt with it slowly, reluctantly and not always honestly." So the truth comes out in dribs and drabs, he added. The same is true in Asia; Japan's own myths about its brutalities in World War II are only slowly unraveling.
There is also a generational factor, Mr. Perlmutter pointed out. The wartime generation was grateful to survive and true heroes were scarce, he said, so there was a lot to hide. Their children have been preoccupied with rebuilding and stability, and with achieving financial security. It is only the grandchildren who now have the time, the self-assurance and the distance required to ask hard questions and resurrect buried shame.
"Government and private archives are opening," said Sweden's Ambassador to Washington, Henrik Liljegren. "Psychologically, every nation has a need to go through its own actions and find its soul. But it takes some time before it is ready to do that."
 
National Soul-Searching
 The new self-searching will continue to bring forth difficult issues, even as the wartime generation dies off, said David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee. The newly opened East, for example, has produced troubling new paradoxes. In former Soviet republics like the Baltic nations or Ukraine, some people who worked with the Waffen SS during the war are getting German pensions while their neighbors -- Jews who survived ghettoes and concentration camps -- are not yet able to receive compensation from Germany, Mr. Harris said. The issue is already attracting Congressional interest.
"We feel we're so modern with all our insistent talk of the millennium and the 21st century and the bridges to this and that," said Mr. Burns. "But it's fascinating how World War II has come back to remind us of its power."

The Real Caribbean: Paradise Stops At the Beach's Edge

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: ST. JOHN'S, Antigua

 BODY:
IT is a deliciously sunny Saturday morning at the peak of the tourist season, and at Heritage Quay here, hundreds of passengers are being disgorged from a pair of towering cruise ships into shops and restaurants with names like Smoke & Booze or Rasta Pasta. As a band serenades the visitors with a reggae version of "Mr. Bojangles," a middle-aged American suddenly begins to dance with a T-shirt vendor. "Did we mention that this is paradise?" asks one of the brochures handed to arriving tourists.
Or so it seems to outsiders. Yet this is also the place that the novelist Jamaica Kincaid, who grew up here, describes as a "monument to rottenness," an island nation barely the size of Queens that has been dominated for half a century by a single family whose doddering patriarch "perhaps by now thinks that the government is his own business." And what about that mysterious electronic listening post, bristling with antennas, radar and satellite dishes, that the American military operates just across from the airport where the charter flights from Chicago and Manchester land? 
 Beneath its frequently bland and cheerful surface, the Caribbean is a place long haunted by intrigue, malfeasance and poverty -- and by the unyielding hopes of generations of people who have fought back against the buccaneers who surround them. More often than not, though, that reality remains invisible to the 15 million visitors who come from North America and Western Europe each season.
 
What Tourists Don't See
 Seeking sun and relaxation, they usually leave without having made contact with the small, tightly knit societies they are visiting or with the problems those islands must confront on a daily basis. For casual visitors, the only inconvenience likely to arise is that their hotel or travel arrangements may be disrupted, as occurred last week when the threat of a strike by American Airlines pilots led to the cancellation of scores of flights before President Clinton stepped in to order a 60-day reprieve.
"From what I've seen, it's just a lot of shops," said Ed Vrabel, a passenger from Hickory, N.C., whose cruise ship was on its way from St. Lucia to St. Martin. "All these islands seem pretty much the same, and none of them look as nicely kept as we're used to in the States."
For the 63,000 people of Antigua, the central fact of their lives is the Bird family dynasty, which has controlled the politics and economy of this island 250 miles east-southeast of Puerto Rico ever since Vere C. Bird founded the Antigua Labor Party in the mid-1940's, when Antigua began a slow transition from British rule to independence, which came in 1981. Over time, and increasingly, his critics charge, Mr. Bird and his sons, including Lester, the current Prime Minister, have made Antigua a haven for fast-buck artists and con men of every stripe; meanwhile, the critics say, the Birds use their own share of the loot to maintain themselves in power.
In 1990, for instance, Vere Bird Jr., the Minister of Public Works and Communication, was implicated in a scheme to smuggle arms from Israel to the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia. The result was an international scandal, his resignation and street protests in which demonstrators carried placards demanding that "The Birds Must Go!" -- but no prison sentence. It later emerged that in the 1970's Antigua had also diverted shipments of Canadian 155-millimeter howitzers to South Africa for use by its troops against Cuban forces in Angola.
Then, in 1995, another Bird brother, Ivor, was fined $75,000 after being caught with a 25-pound shipment of cocaine as he boarded a plane at the airport, which is named for his father. Last year, American officials expressed concern that organized crime groups from Russia had opened offshore banks here to launder billions of dollars in profits from arm sales, drug trafficking, extortion and prostitution. Even more recently, companies promoting gambling over the Internet have begun springing up here.
"Any unregulated activity quickly finds itself with Antigua as its prime headquarters," said Tim Hector, who is an editor of The Outlet, one of the few news publications here that the Birds do not control, and an opposition member of the Senate. Antiguan politics, he added, are "the politics of greed," offering "infinite opportunities for corruption" and engendering a cynicism among the population that spills over into tourism, which accounts for more than half of the country's income and employment.
"Local people are asking where is their stake in the economy," Mr. Hector said. "They read that the average per capita income here is more than $6,000 [U.S.] a year, and they know they aren't making that kind of money themselves. What they see is the corrosion of beliefs and standards that has come with the money economy."
As visitors are often surprised to discover, the Caribbean is full of morally conservative societies often appalled by what they see as the licentiousness of their visitors and the complicity of their own rulers. Barbados, the most prosperous and content of the eastern tourist islands, is probably the best example of that sort of rectitude. But other islands, among them Antigua, forbid topless or nude bathing as well, and their residents seethe when moneyed tourists blithely ignore those regulations and the local police look the other way (or sometimes stare). Those islands, like Antigua, that have casinos grudgingly allow their citizens to work there, but most prohibit them from entering after work hours to gamble their money.
At the moment, one of the most contentious issues on the handful of islands that remain under British rule, such as the Cayman, Turks and Caicos and British Virgin islands, is London's effort to extend legislation that legalizes homosexual acts between consenting adults. "You can't dictate sexual preference, but this goes against the grain in this type of society," argued the Rev. Errol Brooks, the senior Anglican clergyman on Anguilla, an island of 9,000 people that is a favorite of upscale European travelers. "One must take into consideration the mores and norms of a society rather than enforce foreign values."
In contrast to 25 years ago, however, the Caribbean is no longer debating whether it wants tourism or not: even Cuba has finally jumped in. Compared with harvesting sugar cane, working in a hotel not only pays better, it is less physically taxing. And besides, what alternatives to tourism are there now that the United States is attempting to kill off the banana and apparel industries through trade restrictions? The only other choices may be growing marijuana or selling passports to foreign businessmen, a scheme Grenada is about to try, based on its success here and in Dominica. Instead, the big arguments you hear nowadays are about whether the small islands are getting a fair deal from large hotel chains, condominium developers, cruise lines and the foreigners who run them.
Riot police on the island of St. Martin, ruled jointly by France and The Netherlands, fired tear gas last month at rock-throwing hotel workers who were fired after Hurricane Luis passed through in September 1995. But now that the hotels are reopening, 133 former employees want either severance pay or their old jobs back; taxi and bus drivers have also gone on strike to protest an increase in the price of gasoline.
A few miles away, Anguilla is debating whether to allow cruise ships to dock more than twice a month. Hoteliers say no, suggesting that guests paying up to $1,200 a night do not want to -- and should not have to -- mingle with hoi polloi. But most taxi drivers and store owners on the island favor the proposal, hoping not only that the tourism pie will be bigger, but that they will get a larger slice of it.
 
Profits Sent Away
 "The money is not trickling down to us because the tourists stay in their resorts and the hotel owners send their profits back to their home country," said Bob Rogers, who with his wife Lilian owns a livery service in Anguilla. "If tourism doesn't produce benefits for the people who live on this island, then there really is no point in having it around, is there?"
Away from the beaches and the hotels, in areas of the islands that visitors rarely see, pockets of poverty remain, encouraging the migration of local people to the very same places that the tourists come from. In Antigua, there are still one-room wooden shacks mounted on cinder blocks -- houses with no running water, flush toilets or electricity.
Even some of those who cater to tourists barely make ends meet. "I live by faith," said Enid Browne, a vendor here of T-shirts that bear the message "Smile Mon" and the image of Mickey Mouse in dreadlocks. "Some days you don't sell nothing at all. But the hotels only want to hire the young ones, the advanced ones. It's a small place here, but there's not enough work to go around, so they can take their pick."
At a downtown shop just up the street from Heritage Quay, the proprietor was asked how tourism had changed Antigua in his lifetime. As tourists streamed by his open door, he reflected for a moment, then reached back to his days as a schoolboy under British rule and recited a stanza from "The Deserted Village," a poem by Oliver Goldsmith:
 
Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a
prey
Where wealth accumulates and men decay
Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade
A breath can make them, as a breath has made
But a bold peasantry, their country's pride
When once destroyed, can never be supplied.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
If a Republican Seizes the Center, Watch Out

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
FOR anyone trying to assess the state of the Democratic Party, the best place to look may not be Washington -- where President Clinton just had the rare pleasure, for a Democrat, of celebrating re-election to the White House -- but in New York City.
A mayoral election is taking shape in this most Democratic of cities, and the contest so far suggests that the health of the Democratic Party is much worse than it seemed when measured by Mr. Clinton's victory last November. The Democratic Party in New York City -- historically a source of party icons and national ideas -- is stumbling at the Mayoral starting line. It is wrestling with the likelihood that for the first time in 60 years, a Republican mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, will be re-elected by running as a Republican. 
 And while some of that has to do with the specific circumstances of New York (particularly, Mr. Giuliani's incumbency and political resourcefulness, a declining crime rate and a strong economy), it is also a measure of the sickness of the city's Democratic Party -- and, by extension, the ill health of the Democratic Party across the nation.
 
'Type A'
 Nothing dramatized this better than the announcement last week by the former Mayor, David N. Dinkins, who lost to Mr. Giuliani in 1993, that he would not challenge Mr. Giuliani again. Few people really expected Mr. Dinkins, who is 69, to run, and polls suggested that had he tried, he would not have succeeded. But it was a reminder to Democrats of what is wrong for them in New York. Here was a voice from the past who, with a few sentences, instantly obscured four people who have spent much of the past few years preparing to run for Mayor.
And Mr. Dinkins did that with a political message that -- if forceful in its denunciation of Mr. Giuliani (he described the Mayor as a "Type A personality") -- contributed little to the ideological evolution of the party itself. By the end, the reaction which greeted Mr. Dinkins' near-entry into the race suggested that in groping for a challenger to Mr. Giuliani, the party was profoundly unhappy with the existing field.
The election is still nine months away, and this is New York. But the episode served as a reminder that the party of Roosevelt, Koch and two Cuomos has this year produced what appears to be a cast of candidates with relatively little new to say. It is, arguably, not any Democrat but Mr. Giuliani who is making the New Democratic case -- preaching one day in favor of immigration and the next against Newt Gingrich. He has left very little breathing room for the Democratic field in New York. If Mr. Clinton's rightward shift showed that centrist Democrats can make inroads against the conservative Republican tide, Mr. Giuliani's success in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost five to one suggests even greater potential power in centrist Republicanism.
"New York is the perfect example of what should be frightening the Democratic Party," said Deborah (Arnie) Arnesen, a Democrat and former New Hampshire state Representative and unsuccessful candidate for Congress in 1996. "If they can't figure out what to say even there, then something is really wrong. We have to evaluate what is happening."
There are some Democrats who argue that their weakness so far in the mayoral race is a local phenomenon, the latest spasm from a party still trying to emerge from the long shadows of Edward I. Koch and Mario M. Cuomo. And a few Democrats argue against drawing national lessons from New York, insisting that the more instructive lesson was Mr. Clinton's victory last November.
But Mr. Clinton's re-election was not based on championing either old or new Democratic ideas. And while Mr. Clinton was winning the White House, Democrats were losing seats in the Senate, and their gains in the House owed much to the unpopularity of Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker. The more meaningful election might well turn out to have been that of 1994, when Republicans took control of the House.
Even optimistic Democrats view these times as transitional. "We're still getting up off the floor after 1994," said Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic party's unsuccessful candidate for President in 1988. "But I think there's a great opportunity here."
All of which explains why what's going on in New York is so potentially important. It is a city that has always been "a bellwether in Democratic politics," said David C. King, an associate professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
The field for the September Democratic primary is made up of four people. The two leaders are Borough Presidents Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan and Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx. Two others -- the Rev. Al Sharpton and City Councilman Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn -- are considered long shots.
The early maneuverings of the front-runners are instructive of the party's plight: Both have devoted considerable energy to shedding the liberal Democratic label.
Ms. Messinger was once identified with many New York liberal causes of the 1970's and 1980's. Now she resists any attempt at ideological identification. As she backs away from such long-held positions as her support for regulating commercial rents, she argues that the causes she took up in the past reflected the times and the Upper West Side district she represented in the City Council.
Mr. Ferrer did Ms. Messinger one better. He began his campaign by renouncing his lifelong opposition to the death penalty (an issue that has nothing to do with being Mayor, but often a lot to do with winning the job). He has also made of point of his opposition to certain forms of late-term abortions.
The candidates and Mr. Dinkins, who endorsed Ms. Messinger last week, have described last week's events as a transformation. "It represents a new day in politics," Mr. Sharpton said. "There is nobody in this primary that is connected to the old 60's type of liberal Democratic coalition. It's almost a passing of the torch to another generation."
But it is unclear exactly what is being passed, and to whom. Mr. Ferrer and Ms. Messinger have done little beyond attempting to step on their own roots. If there are any new ideas about what Democrats should be doing about governing, or even winning elections, they have yet to be heard.
It is in this environment that Mr. Giuliani has shaped a distinctive political personality, blending fiscal conservatism, crime-fighting and emphasis on improving the quality of life in New York.
 
Sending a Message
 In that regard, he has been much more active than Mr. Clinton. But like Mr. Clinton, he has blurred party labels, taking the endorsement of the Liberal Party and stressing his support for issues like abortion rights.
So the Democratics might end 1997 finding little of value coming out of the political laboratory of New York. By contrast, Mr. Giuliani's political experiments appear to be doing well -- should Republicans political leaders, who have never liked him very much, chose to take a look next November.
"Giuliani is a message to his party," said Ms. Arnesen , the New Hampshire Democrat. "It is: 'Look what's happening in a traditional Democratic enclave. I'm winning and they can't even figure out how to run against me.' "

HEADLINE: Are Canadians Yankees, Too?;
Cuba's Bridge to the United States

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
GUESTS at Havana's old Hotel Nacional who watch television can now choose between grainy black-and-white films extolling the glory of the 1959 Communist Revolution or feature films on HBO like the cold war thriller "The Hunt for Red October."
The hotel's new telephone service enables quick computer links with New York via AT&T, and hotel guests can get a warm can of Coca-Cola from their mini-bars. 
 Nearly 35 years since the United States placed an economic embargo on Cuba to stifle its economy and squeeze Fidel Castro from power, Mr. Castro still struts around Havana in designer leather boots. American goods, along with the Yankee dollar, can be easily found all over, even though there are few Americans to be seen.
What's going on? Cuba has managed to build bridges to the United States without dealing with the Federal Government directly. It buys regularly from the subsidiaries of American companies operating in countries like Mexico, where Cuba's Coca-Cola comes from. But one of Cuba's most valuable connections to the mainland and an increasingly eager business partner has been Canada, America's closest ally and biggest trade partner.
To the Cubans, Canadians are just like Americans -- they're big, they act rich and they speak English. But while the United States has tried to isolate Cuba since the Communists took over in 1959, Canada has tried to engage the country both economically and diplomatically, much to Washington's annoyance.
With last year's passage of the Helms-Burton law, which imposes sanctions on companies from Canada and other countries doing business in Cuba, United States foreign policy has clashed openly with the trade policies of some of its strongest allies. Several European countries have challenged the Helms-Burton law in a complaint before the World Trade Organization. But for the moment the challenge has been postponed, leaving Canada alone in its defiant response to the law. Ottawa already has passed a law prohibiting Canadian companies from complying with the reporting provisions of Helms-Burton or paying any fines.
Washington itself shifted ground a bit on Cuba last week. The Clinton Administration said that 10 American news organizations would be permitted to circumvent the economic embargo and open bureaus in Cuba, spending dollars on rent, electricity and other goods.
Still, while Washington has spent 40 years scheming against Cuba, Canada has spent that time making deals. Ottawa, a far less rigid cold warrior than Washington, never broke off diplomatic relations. Its companies have poured over half a billion dollars into nickel mines, luxury hotels and other businesses, often involving property once owned by Americans. Two-way trade between the two countries has doubled in the last four years and now exceeds $400 million a year. Although Spain, Italy and other European nations also trade with Cuba, its most important links are to North America through Canada and Mexico.
So great is the Canadians' business interest in the island that callers to Cuba's consulate in Toronto get to pick from eight phone options including "press four if you want to open a bank account or start a business in Cuba" and "press five if you want to get married in Cuba." The Cuba Tourist Board has erected more than 125 billboards in Toronto, and many more in Ottawa, Vancouver and other cities, promising cold-weary Canadians "a warmth you'll remember." A round-trip ticket from Ottawa to Varadero can cost as little as $161.
Raymond Chretien, Canada's Ambassador to the United States, acknowledges that Ottawa's independent position bothers Washington. "We know who our friends are," Mr. Chretien said just before last November's elections in the United States, "but we also want to be able to go to the beaches of Cuba." Last year, more than 150,000 Canadians vacationed in Cuba.
Still, Canada seems loath to push its Cuba policy too far, for fear of alienating Washington. Trade with Cuba is a nice plum, but it totals in a year what Canada exchanges with the United States in a day.
Cuba's abysmal record on human rights and the persistent poverty of most Cubans despite the island's recent embrace of capitalism also make it difficult for Ottawa to crow too much about its cozy relationship with Mr. Castro.
Take for example what happened during Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy's visit to Cuba last month. As Cuban officials were plying him and his entourage with cigars and showing off Varadero beach, they whisked him away on a surprise visit.
Mr. Axworthy was more than a little uncomfortable when he realized that the Cubans had taken him to a nearby oil drilling site that had been taken over by a Canadian company, Sherritt International. The company's president and several key officials have been banned from the United States for violating the Helms-Burton act. The tour abruptly ended when Mr. Axworthy hopped back on the overheated bus.
The Canadian bridge from Cuba to North America grates on Cuban-Americans. For three years the Alliance of Young Cubans, a political advocacy group in Miami, has put up billboards in Canada reminding Canadians that their tourist dollars help keep Mr. Castro in power. "Your paradise. Their hell." say the billboards, which show a tourist family enjoying Cuban beaches while a Cuban family watches from the shadows.
Of course, even though many Canadians enjoy the beaches while most Americans have to comply with the embargo, some Americans visit Cuba anyway. Canadian flags flew on many yachts docked at the Varadero marina during Mr. Axworthy's visit, but the stern of one flagless sloop said Golden, Colo., another Dover, Del.
That only points out the ultimate paradox in this complex triangle. A few years ago the Cuban Government made it legal for Cubans to hold American dollars. Since then, the Cuban peso is rarely seen in Old Havana. Nearly everything spent on hotels in Varadero and Havana, or Cokes at the Hotel Nacional, is in American dollars, although most of it has not been spent by Americans.

Europe's Wild Ride

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
If you thought 1989 was an exciting year in Europe, with the Berlin wall crashing down and Communism being swept aside, then you won't want to miss 1997. Because the two major balancing institutions in Europe, NATO and the European Union, are both going to be "adjusted" in 1997, and it's going to make for a wild and crazy Eurocoaster. The Clinton Administration isn't worried. It's assuming that these two major balances in Europe can be simultaneously "adjusted" and create a new, even more stable equilibrium.
Don't bet on it. 
 Here's why: By the end of this year E.U. members are supposed to commit to a common currency, the Euro, that will make their integration much deeper. But this deal isn't cooked. The problem is the Germans are not keen about letting southern Europe -- Italy, Spain, Portugal -- into the common currency right away because the Germans, who are obsessed with having a hard, stable currency, don't trust southern Europeans to hold the fiscal and monetary controls needed to maintain a strong Euro.
For Germany, southern Europe is still a region inhabited by Bedouins. You trade with Bedouins. But you don't share a currency with them. Italians were stunned when Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper wrote last month that Italians don't understand the importance financial markets attach to rules: "Those who respect rules are often considered stupid in Italy. Why should they go by the rules when the sly push ahead in line, throw rubbish on the street and pass cars on the highway on the right?"
Sounds like a great partnership!
This struggle over a common Euro-currency coincides with the effort to expand NATO to Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. U.S. diplomats are confident they can move NATO's frontier closer to Russia, while assuring Russia that it isn't being threatened or frozen out of the new Europe. The U.S. will do this by forging a NATO-Russia charter that perfectly balances everyone's interests. Unfortunately, this delicate new balance will have to be negotiated while there is a near total power vacuum at the top in Russia. Good luck. This project also assumes that the countries left out of the new NATO -- Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Ukraine and the Baltic states -- will sit quietly, and not become a gray area of intense competition between Russia and NATO. Sure.
Here's the truth: Yugoslavia aside, Europe has actually been quite stable since 1989. We don't need all this heroic geo-engineering of organizations now.
The only way there will be an even more stable, long-term, security structure in Europe is if democratic reform in Russia moves forward, not if NATO's front line moves forward. And the only way the E.U. will thrive in the global economy is not if its members have a common currency, but if they deregulate their economies and become more competitive and entrepreneurial. It is much more important that French storekeepers open on Sunday than that they have a common Euro currency. It is much more important that a young Helmut Gates in a garage in Germany be able to raise $50 million overnight for his invention rather than that the pittance he can now raise is denominated in a common Euro currency. Europe's priority now should be internal reform, not organizational reform.
If the leaders don't know this, the people do. Luigi Vittorio Ferraris, a professor at the Free University in Rome and former Italian Ambassador to Germany, remarked to me: "You can't build a new Europe without Europeans, and my students are very much less European than they were 10 years ago. The enthusiasm for Europe is not there. Before 1989, E.U. and NATO meant security. They meant modernization. They meant welfare. Now, the fear is gone; the threats are all internal. But we are being asked to put on a new European straitjacket, just when we feel less European."
I hope it all works out: a new NATO, a new E.U., a new currency, all in 1997. But I fear this will involve too many moving parts. I suspect we'll wish we had let well enough alone. There is a real danger that we could not only lose the balance that came together in Europe in 1989-91 -- a balance that has been relatively easy to maintain and has provided a stable environment for internal reform -- but we could also lose the energy and focus to deal with the real problems, which are mostly inside these states, not between them.

HEADLINE: Young Unwelcome in Retirees' Haven

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: YOUNGTOWN, Ariz., Feb. 13

 BODY:
Fresh-faced and direct, 16-year-old Chaz Cope would seem to be the ideal poster boy for this Phoenix suburb of sunshine and orange trees.
Instead, this retirement community sees him as human contraband. While Youngtown allows dogs, the City Council has voted unanimously to fine Chaz's grandparents $100 a day for illegally housing a child. 
 "All we wanted was permission for him to stay until he finished high school, only 16 months," Lynne Rae Naab, the boy's grandmother, said, dabbing her eyes after recalling the Dec. 19 expulsion order. Chaz moved here about a year ago to escape physical abuse by his stepfather in another part of the state.
On the other side of Phoenix, a similar expulsion order hangs over the head of another 16-year-old, Deserae Carrie. She lives quietly with her grandmother in another retirement community, Superstition Heights. The lawyer for the community, which has 36 homes, calls her presence "a nuisance." Deserae counters that she has nowhere to go because her mother is dying of cancer in a nursing home.
Both expulsion orders have been temporarily suspended because of intervention by Arizona's Attorney General, Grant Woods.
But in a state where retirement communities have become a powerful political and economic force, the Attorney General must move gingerly to protect the powerless in this intergenerational warfare.
"Politically, it's not a vote-getter if the word filters down that you are anti-senior," Mr. Woods said in his downtown office today. Referring to defending the teen-agers, he added, "But it's still the right thing to do."
Like many other Sun Belt retirement communities, Youngtown and Superstition Heights bar permanent residents under 18 years old through age covenants written into deeds. The Federal Fair Housing Act bars discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, sex or family status, but it does allow discrimination against children. If 80 percent of the housing units in a community have at least one occupant 55 or older, the community can be certified as "adult," and can bar children.
Nationwide, only about 10 percent of Americans over 50 live in restricted retirement communities, according to surveys conducted by the American Association of Retired Persons. But in Arizona, almost half of the state's 530,000 residents 55 and older live in such communities.
In the association's surveys, conducted over the last decade, 77 percent of respondents, on average, said they wanted to live in mixed-age communities, while only 13 percent said they wanted to live among people of their same age group.
"Most elderly do not want to live in that type of segregated community," George Gaberlavage, the association's senior housing expert, said from Washington. "But a significant minority do, and we support their right to choose."
Leaders of retirement communities say they bar children to insure peace and quiet, and to avoid having to provide schools, which would mean higher taxes.
"Young people kind of like to hassle the old people," said Lucille Retheford, the 75-year-old president of Youngtown's Historical Society. "If we had young families in here, we would have to put in an elementary school, swings, sidewalks."
She estimated that with children around, new school taxes would double the average tax bill for houses here, now about $300 a year. To maintain a virtual exemption from paying school taxes, this town of 2,500 residents has historically taken a hard hard line about expelling clandestine children and their parents.
There are other economic forces at work as well. Arizona has an estimated 10,000 retirees migrating to the state every year, second only to Florida. And the newcomers tend to be more affluent than younger Arizonans: the average household income of a retired couple moving to Arizona in the late 1980's was $32,400 -- 24 percent higher than that for younger residents.
According to the Office of Senior Living, a section of the state Commerce Department, retirees spent $13.6 billion in Arizona in 1995.
"This is a huge sector of our economy," said Jason Morris, a Phoenix zoning lawyer. "There are a lot of people with a vested interest in making sure that these age covenants are maintained."
Elected officials in Youngtown and Superstition Springs declined to be interviewed today, saying the disputes were being mediated by the Attorney General. But two years ago, well before today's controversy erupted, Youngtown officials boasted to The Arizona Republic of expelling 300 young families in the first half of the 1990's.
Today, at the town offices, a form is available for any resident who wants to denounce a nonconforming family. Police enforce a 7 P.M. curfew for visiting children who are 16 years old or younger.
Last summer, when the Naabs first applied for a variance to the age ban, they had to pay $300 to file the application. Then town officials posted a sign on the lawn of their modest bungalow to inform neighbors that the Naabs intended to house a child.
"We are all here because we want to live among our peers," said Mrs. Retheford, who moved here 25 years ago from Kansas, where she had worked as an industrial engineer. Noting that all four candidates in next month's City Council election support the ban on children, she predicted, "It won't make one whit of difference who is elected."
In neighboring Sun City, Arizona's largest retirement community, which, combined with Sun City West, has a population of about 70,000, residents keep a vigilant eye on the State Legislature as representatives draft bills to comply with a recent State Supreme Court order to make all communities pay for public schools regardless of whether they have children.
"Education now absorbs almost 49 percent of that state budget," complained Floyd Tharp, acting president of the Sun City Taxpayers Association. "What we are concerned about is protecting the life style of the old folks, the widows, the widowers."
Arizona's generational polarization is expected to grow more acute. In the next 25 years, the number of residents over 55 is expected to double, to about 1.1 million people.
"Clearly, the retirement communities are conservative, their votes are overwhelmingly anti-government, anti-schools," said Tom Rex, who conducts demographic studies for Arizona State University.
Founded in 1954, Youngtown says it is America's oldest retirement community. Marketing to the elderly, developers chose the name on the theory that it would keep residents young at heart.
In 1963, Youngtown residents founded the first field chapter of the American Association of Retired Persons. With the 50th anniversary of this community of tract houses and bungalows fast approaching, Youngtown residents are seeking to have their town listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Unfazed by this weight of history, the Naabs say the community's ban on children is unnatural.
"It used to be families taking care of their own," Mrs. Naab said over coffee around her kitchen table.
Jerry Lee Naab, a blunt-spoken former painting contractor, agreed, saying: "We are family oriented. This new generation, it's me oriented."

HEADLINE: Micro-Loans for the Very Poor

 BODY:
Anyone who scoffs at the value of 62 cents should talk to Muhammad Yunus. In 1976, the Bangladeshi economics professor tried an experiment. From his pocket, he lent the equivalent of $26 to a group of 42 workers. With that 62 cents per person, they bought the materials for a day's work weaving chairs or making pots. At the end of their first day as independent business owners, they sold their work and soon paid back the loan.
Thus began the microcredit movement, which has become the world's hot idea for reducing poverty. This month, microcredit's backers met in Washington to begin to broaden the program's reach and raise money from developed nations and institutions such as the World Bank. Eight million people are now getting microcredit, half of them in Bangladesh. Microcredit proponents want to expand that to 100 million people by 2005. It is a worthy goal that the United States should support. 
 The first microcredit program was the Grameen Bank, founded by Mr. Yunus. Now almost all its borrowers are women, who tend to be poorer than men, have fewer opportunities and are much more likely to spend new earnings on their children. Grameen requires its borrowers to organize themselves into groups of five. All are cut off if one borrower defaults.
They meet every week to make loan payments at commercial interest rates and critique one another's business plans. They also pledge to boil their water, keep their families small and carry out other good health practices. People who repay small loans on time can take bigger ones. Grameen, which now makes a profit, claims a higher repayment rate than traditional banks. One-third of its two million borrowers have crossed the poverty line and another third are close.
Microcredit is now at work in 43 countries. A version has even reached 150,000 Americans in inner-cities like Chicago and Washington. Borrowers here can begin with a $500 or $1,000 loan, enough for gardening or hair-styling tools. President Clinton said he will ask Congress for $1 billion more over the next five years to develop microenterprise in the United States.
A no-handout, inexpensive program that builds business sounds so politically appealing in today's climate that it is worth recalling microcredit's limits. It cannot take the place of clean water, family planning efforts and child immunization programs. It can do little for the most desperate, those too sick or unskilled to work. It is also not free, as some of its political backers suggest. The most successful microcredit programs can fund their loans through interest and the savings they encourage borrowers to build. But most projects still rely on donations, and all are most helpful when they are backed by technical and marketing assistance programs, which cost money.
Still, microcredit has brought a much-needed revolution in anti-poverty programs. It deserves more than its current 2 percent share of the world's $60 billion development budget. Microcredit goes directly to poor people. It creates jobs in villages. It helps women develop confidence and independence. Microcredit can win new political backing for anti-poverty programs abroad that the poor still desperately need.

HEADLINE: Reform in the Balance

 BODY:
Most officeholders in Washington still don't get it, but the American electoral system is in ethical and financial crisis. When it comes to President Clinton's fund-raising, the chips of news have now arranged themselves into a mosaic of scandal. Few reasonable Democrats any longer question the wrongness of their party's behavior in the last election. The remaining suspense is over how prosecutable it is.
On Capitol Hill, the plans for Congressional investigations and hearings on campaign abuses are mired in petty infighting, much of it among Republicans who seem bent on piddling away their party's historic opportunity to own the reform issue. 
 With a few notable exceptions, Republicans and Democrats alike share the blame for pawing at campaign reform legislation rather than pushing it. They believe the lack of protest over attempts to preserve the old system means the public does not care. We believe it means the public is rapidly giving up on the ability of this Congress and this President to create a new system of political finance.
The White House. The revelations about possible Chinese involvement in the President's re-election campaign are so serious that Mr. Clinton himself admitted on Thursday that "we have to let the investigations proceed." It would be even more helpful if he would wake and shake his lethargic Attorney General, Janet Reno, to the overdue need for a special prosecutor.
Already, several dozen Federal Bureau of Investigation agents are poring over a dizzying list of suspicious transactions. First there were the inordinate contributions and White House visits from present and former officials with the Lippo Group of Indonesia. Most recently, The Washington Post disclosed an F.B.I. investigation into whether Chinese Government officials or their agents may have used go-between contributors to put money into Mr. Clinton's campaign. There have also been reports that both the President and Harold Ickes, the former White House deputy chief of staff, may have been involved in directing tax-exempt contributions toward nonprofit groups they knew would be helpful to their campaign.
Despite these distractions, Mr. Clinton has shown some energy on the legislative front. He brought a bipartisan group of legislators to the White House to push the McCain-Feingold bill and its companion legislation in the House. Aides to Mr. Clinton say he will urge Democratic and G.O.P. leaders to put this legislation on a fast track. We hope he does, but any such action would gain credibility if Mr. Clinton would also order full cooperation with all investigations by the Congress and urge Ms. Reno to appoint a special prosecutor.
Senator Trent Lott. In the history of campaign-reform legislation, few leaders have been dealt a hand like the one held by Mr. Lott. The Senate majority leader owes no real debt to the old system of money-for-influence, and with the decline of Speaker Newt Gingrich, he has a chance to take his party in a new direction. Yet last week it seemed mystifyingly clear that Mr. Lott sees himself as a guardian of special-interest politics. Is it because he somehow views it as "conservative," since business has long used it to fund friendly Republicans? Or is it because Mr. Lott, for all his famed discipline, has come to his great job as free of vision as he is of obligations?
Mr. Lott needs only to look at recent history to see the mistakes made by others who thought their interests lay in protecting Congress's system of financing undistinguished incumbents. In 1993, both the House Speaker, Thomas Foley, and the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, prevailed on Mr. Clinton to defer campaign finance reform, ostensibly because of the need to pass budget and health care legislation. Perhaps Mr. Lott should ask Mr. Foley how he is enjoying retirement and Mr. Mitchell whether he liked leaving the Senate in Republican hands.
The urgent need is to pass legislation to ban soft-money contributions to the parties. There is a need also to provide free or low-cost television to curb campaign costs. Any new law must close loopholes that have let labor unions and businesses help candidates by disguising campaign ads as "issue advocacy."
Campaign reform is supported by two strong, but lonely voices for change, Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and Fred Thompson of Tennessee. But instead of rallying to these two, Mr. Lott seems to be listening instead to the irredeemably misguided Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Mr. McConnell speaks to the cynical impulses of party leaders who worry that they need the hundreds of millions of dollars in soft money to keep their campaigns going. Mr. Lott is supposed to be the ultimate pragmatist. Surely he can see that slowing down Mr. McCain's legislation and dampening support for Mr. Thompson's hearings on campaign finance will dim his future as Senate leader.
The Hearings. Senator Thompson has one of the toughest jobs in Congress this year, and he has sent mixed signals about whether he is up to it. Most of his fellow Republicans clearly want the hearings of his Governmental Affairs Committee to target President Clinton and the Democrats. The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, is rightly concerned that Mr. Thompson not conduct the hearings in a partisan manner. The fact that almost all the early subpoenas for information have gone to Democratic fund-raising people has not inspired confidence that Mr. Thompson will be fair.
There were some reports last week that Mr. Daschle and the Democrats were trying to limit the hearings to the Presidential campaigns as a way of keeping the heat off their own Congressional fund-raising activities. That would be a mistake. Mr. Daschle should work with Mr. Thompson to make sure that the hearings are given the broadest scope to look at both parties. The Democratic abuses have gotten most of the bad publicity, but the committee must also look into the meeting-for-dollars arrangements organized by the Republicans and the apparent quid pro quos that have resulted in efforts to ease regulations on developers, miners, the tobacco industry and other groups that bankrolled the Republicans.
Mr. Thompson has asked for $6.5 million to conduct the hearings, many times more than was budgeted for Whitewater, but the Democrats are wrong to balk. This is a matter of greater scale. Provided Mr. Thompson is equally curious about both parties, he should get the time and money to do the job.
The hearings are essential. The public needs full information on the abuses, or the Congressional stallers will prevail. The fund-raising scandals of the last few years pose the gravest threat to the country's political system since the Watergate scandals of a generation ago. It is clearly possible that Mr. Clinton, people close to him and many members of Congress on both sides of the aisle stand in political or legal jeopardy if real reform comes to the capital. But the American people want a cleanup. It is time to get on with it.

HEADLINE: South Korea Is Upset and Its Leader Imperiled by Tycoon's Way With Forbidden Fruit

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Chung Tae Soo, a tycoon who built one of South Korea's largest conglomerates, used to send his chauffeur in a Mercedes-Benz to deliver cartons of apples as gifts to selected politicians and bankers. Hidden under the apples, South Korean prosecutors have said, were piles of cash.
Just who partook of that forbidden fruit is the question that is now roiling South Korea. Mr. Chung's gifts have ripened into a huge scandal that is swirling dangerously close to President Kim Young Sam, who took office four years ago vowing to wipe out the collusive relationship between Government and business that has existed for decades. 
 But instead of conquering corruption, Mr. Kim is now in danger of being engulfed by it. Analysts say the scandal shows that bribery is a deeply ingrained, and to some extent accepted, part of the business and political culture here that will be difficult to uproot as long as the Government retains such strong control over the economy.
Four people in Mr. Kim's inner circle -- a Cabinet minister and three members of the National Assembly -- have been arrested and accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece from Mr. Chung. Prosecutors say that in return they did favors, particularly helping to arrange bank loans to Mr. Chung's Hanbo Steel company, which collapsed last month under nearly $6 billion in debt.
Also arrested have been a close aide to the opposition leader Kim Dae Jung, two bank presidents, Mr. Chung and another Hanbo executive. The President has called for a full investigation.
With one year remaining in his five-year term, Mr. Kim is in danger of becoming a lame duck. In addition to the scandal, his administration is still reeling from widespread strikes that erupted in late December after Mr. Kim's New Korea Party steamrolled a new labor law through the National Assembly. His approval rating in public opinion polls has plummeted from more than 80 percent after he took office early in 1993 to far less than 20 percent now.
"They've lost control of the country," said Yang Sung Chul, an opposition party member of the National Assembly and a former professor of political science.
Prosecutors say their investigation is complete. This is making some people suspect a cover-up, since the prosecutors are under the control of the President. With the Whitewater investigation in the United States taking years, they say, it is preposterous to say that the Hanbo inquiry could be wrapped up in only three weeks.
"The Korean people are frustrated with the conclusion of the case by the prosecutors," Hankook Ilbo, a daily newspaper, said in an editorial Friday. The National Assembly is to convene a special session on Monday mainly to hold hearings on the scandal. President Kim is expected to eventually express his regret to the nation and conduct a shake-up of his staff, Cabinet and party.
"Hanbogate," as some are calling the affair, is not the only bribery scandal to hit the Kim administration. A Defense Minister and a Labor Minister were convicted of taking bribes earlier in Mr. Kim's tenure, and a Health and Welfare Minister resigned after his wife was arrested for accepting money from an industry association. A top aide to Mr. Kim was arrested and convicted last year and charged with accepting money from businessmen. In other corruption scandals, 16 bank presidents have also been arrested.
Analysts say a cause of the corruption is that the Government exercises strong control over business and the economy, so paying politicians or bureaucrats can open up big profit opportunities for companies.
Also, in South Korea, as in many other countries, relationships are an important part of business, and relationships are often facilitated by money. It is not unusual for people to give business associates a small amount of money, "the price of a rice cake," on holidays and other occasions. The aide to President Kim who was arrested last year said some of the huge sums he received from businessmen were rice cake money, not bribes.
Party leaders need money to give to party candidates, and lawmakers are expected to give gifts to constituents on various occasions.
"Lawmakers are supposed to pay more than average people at weddings and funerals," said Kim Chull, spokesman for the governing New Korea Party. He said that while President Kim "never received even one penny," from businessmen, his aides who were arrested might have used money "to manage their organizations," and to "take care of their colleagues."
During South Korea's three decades of dictatorship that started in the 1960's, the Government chose some family-owned companies, known as chaebol, to be the engines of industrial development. The chaebol, which have grown into gigantic conglomerates that dominate the economy, were given loans at favorable interest rates by commercial banks, which functioned essentially as arms of the Government.
That is at the root of the Hanbo affair. Banks lent sums to Hanbo far in excess of what would have been prudent, in part because of pressure from the Government. Mr. Chung, who had been convicted of bribery twice, apparently regarded his payments to politicians and bankers as so important that his chauffeur, who has been questioned by prosecutors but not arrested, held the rank of managing director of Hanbo.
Opposition parties say that in South Korea, the President has such strong control of the Government that Mr. Kim must have known what was going on. The President's son is planning to sue two opposition politicians for libel, which will mean he will be subject to questioning by prosecutors.
Other critics say it is bad enough that Mr. Kim's aides took money. "It doesn't actually matter if he knew or not," said Yoo Jae Hyun, general secretary of the Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice, a nonprofit organization. "The money went to his party and his political system."
President Kim has taken steps to reform the political system. He eliminated a rule that allowed financial accounts to be maintained under fictitious names, which had helped make bribery and money laundering easy. There have also been a new law limiting campaign spending and one that was supposed to control corporate donations. Mr. Kim's supporters also say that the large numbers of arrests for bribery during his tenure is evidence that such crimes are no longer being ignored.
In his most daring move, President Kim prosecuted his two predecessors, Roh Tae Woo and Chun Doo Hwan, in part for accepting hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes.
Even if the Hanbo scandal does blow over now, there is a possibility the investigation could be reopened by Mr. Kim's successor, just as Mr. Kim prosecuted his predecessors.
"This is not the final act for the Hanbo scandal," Mr. Yang said. "It is the first act."

Mets' McIlvaine Feels No Pressure as He Looks for Improvements

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Feb. 15

 BODY:
Mets General Manager Joe McIlvaine will not entertain for a minute the thought that he might be the general manager on the griddle in New York.
Such an idea indicates pressure, self-induced and otherwise, and the 49-year-old executive refused to bite, his smile and his confidence as bright as the players' steps were lively during the Mets' first workout for pitchers and catchers today. 
 "I'm not the type that is going to put pressure on myself," McIlvaine said. "All I can do is, every day when I come here, every day when I go home, is think of some way to make the team better."
This refusal to acknowledge fledgling demons, or help them hatch, comes even though McIlvaine and the world know that he is in charge of the New York ball club that did not win it all last year, even though the view from the bleachers is that the Mets are undeniably "his team" now and that Manager Bobby Valentine is "his guy" -- phrases McIlvaine all but despises.
Yes, McIlvaine knows that from the moment he brought in Valentine to take over the Mets' Class AAA affiliate in Norfolk last year, most thought it only a matter of time before Valentine moved up. And Valentine did, in August, replacing Dallas Green, the manager McIlvaine inherited from Al Harizan in 1993 when he was named general manager.
" 'Your guy' -- I don't like that," said McIlvaine, even as the man he promoted led pitchers and catchers through their first spring training workout. "He's not Joe McIlvaine's manager; he is the manager of the New York Mets. And I expect from Bobby what I expect from any manager: to run the ball club, to see improvement, to see hard work and a good work ethic, and to see him utilizing his staff in the best way possible."
As for the idea that the last vestiges of Harizan's regime are gone and that this is McIlvaine's creation, good or bad, that is wrong, too, the general manager insisted.
"I've never looked at things that way because I think that you can profit from what was before you and you can add to it," McIlvaine said, even as such new acquisitions as relievers Greg McMichael, Toby Borland and Ricardo Jordan limbered up. "The main thing is, these are all New York Met players, no matter what source they came from, so I never look at it -- and never have -- as this being my team or anybody else's team."
Still, there is no denying that whatever improvements the Mets make, or do not make, they will be more likely linked to McIlvaine and his program, from the kind of acquisitions he made to what he does with the money allotted in the new economic realities of baseball.
It is a program McIlvaine stubbornly defends, from his disdain for checkbook baseball and the blind pursuit of free agents to his nursing of the minor league franchises.
Green may have grumbled at the end of his stay about McIlvaine's yearly visits to the minor league teams, which require 35 days each season. But, McIlvaine says: "The general manager is in charge of the organization. Bobby's been in the minors; he understands. Dallas did, too. He was a development guy, a scouting guy, too."
Even though McIlvaine played down the pressures that most likely will come his way this season, he did not mind continuing to turn up the dial on expectations. Earlier this month he said he expected the club to reverse last year's record. When the natural assumption was made that McIlvaine was therefore calling for a 91-71 finish, he avoided the numbers. Today he again backpedaled off the 91 victories, but only slightly. "I would never make predictions -- I never do," McIlvaine said. "I said that was our best goal -- that's all."
He then added: "But when I wrote to our players when we sent the contracts out, I said in order for us to be a contender, we need to reverse our record. We need a 20-game swing; it's as simple as that."
When asked whether needing, wanting and expecting were three different things, McIlvaine was blunt. "It's time to turn it up here and get going in the right direction."
McIlvaine knows that to improve, second baseman Carlos Baerga and the newly acquired first baseman John Olerud have to duplicate their best seasons in the American League. And young players, such as shortstop Rey Ordonez, right fielder Alex Ochoa and third baseman Butch Huskey, have to show measurable progress.
"If we do those things, we'll be fine," McIlvaine said. If not, then McIlvaine's resolve will surely be tested in the cauldron that is New York, a place where pressure has been known to singe even the most impervious of souls.
 
INSIDE PITCH
Manager BOBBY VALENTINE continued to prepare the Mets for life without JASON ISRINGHAUSEN, BILL PULSIPHER and PAUL WILSON, even though the first two of the injured pitchers hope to be ready by opening day. "They have to do an awful lot, and unless everything falls perfectly, I don't think there's time to put the injuries behind them," Valentine said.

HEADLINE: 68 NATIONS AGREE TO WIDEN MARKETS IN COMMUNICATIONS

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Feb. 15

 BODY:
More than 60 countries endorsed a landmark agreement today to open up their telecommunication markets to all rivals. The move legally commits governments to unlock the state telephone monopolies that still control well over half of the world's communications business.
The agreement here came after weeks of bruising negotiations, in which the United States pushed relentlessly for greater liberalization and slowly coaxed concessions from countries around the world. 
 The pact should lead to steep price reductions in many segments of the $602 billion worldwide annual market for communications. It marks a big vindication for the United States, which essentially vetoed a much more modest agreement in April.
The United States did not get everything it wanted. It failed to persuade Canada and Japan to end restrictions that block foreign companies from buying a controlling stake in their dominant telephone carriers.
But the United States announced modest restrictions on Japanese and Canadian companies -- including the blocking of Canada's ability to send direct-broadcast television signals into the United States -- to prompt further concessions before the accord goes into effect on Jan. 1.
In Washington, Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States trade representative, said at a news conference, "U.S. companies are the most competitive telecommunications providers in the world, and they are in the best position to compete and win under this agreement."
Officials of AT&T, MCI, Sprint and other major telecommunications companies agreed. They noted, for instance, that under the agreements their subscribers on a business trip would eventually be able to call from Tokyo to Paris across an American company's telephone network, without using the state-dominated telephone systems of either country.
Ms. Barshefsky said today that the accord would "save billions of dollars for American consumers."
The Federal Communications Commission has estimated that the average cost of international telephone calls will drop over the next several years by 80 percent, from an average of $1 a minute to about 20 cents. Some cuts are already in effect.
The pact may also speed the introduction of new services that span the globe. Robert W. Kinzie, the chairman of Iridium, a company that is launching 66 satellites that will enable users of small "pocket phones," similar to cell phones, to call one another from anywhere in the world, called the agreement "absolutely critical."
"It means that no country can prevent us from allowing subscribers to call or be called, no matter where they are in the world," he said.
American officials in Washington also called today's agreement the largest accomplishment yet of the two-year-old World Trade Organization, which is both a negotiating forum to lower trade barriers and the arbiter of international trade disputes.
But it remains unclear how muscular the organization will prove to be, and whether it will have the authority to order countries that are slow to carry out the agreement to change their behavior under threat of suffer economic sanctions.
Nor does the agreement affect international restrictions on ownership of broadcasting and other media. That remains an untouchable issue for many countries, as for many members of the United States Congress, and was excluded from this agreement.
To a great extent, the agreement exports the regulatory principles that revolutionized the American long-distance market in the 1980's and are now being extended to unlock local telephone monopolies in the United States.
The biggest impact on consumers is likely to be in Asia, Latin America and Africa, where most governments have done little or nothing to reform the creaky state-controlled monopolies that provide shabby service at home and charge wildly inflated prices for international telephone calls.
The Institute for International Economics, a policy research organization in Washington, has estimated that the savings from new competition could total a staggering $1 trillion by 2010.
The deal will also force the United States and Europe to follow through on their plans to open every part of their own markets to wide-open rivalry: local and long-distance telephones, international service and wireless communications. Through the World Trade Organization, the agreement also creates a binding legal weapon for countries to enforce deregulation.
The most fiercely contested part of the agreement would do away with restrictions that prohibit a company based in one country from acquiring a controlling stake in the telephone carrier of another country. That is almost certain to intensify the frantic scramble among industry titans like AT&T, BT of Britain and NTT of Japan to buy or build their way into markets around the world.
The agreement is not expected to have much impact on the proposed merger between BT and MCI Communications, America's second largest long-distance company, because the United States and Britain were well on the way to an agreement on lowering restrictions between themselves.
But the pact could increase the competitive pressure to form "me too" alliances and mergers, perhaps linking major Asian, North American and European operators.
"We see this as a really defining event," said Gerald Taylor, chief executive of MCI. "It's not something that is measurable tomorrow, like a gun going off at a race. But what it is is a shift in attitude toward embracing deregulation, open markets and competition."
Jeffrey Lang, the deputy United States trade representative, who led the negotiations, said the agreement marked a milestone in both international trade and the communications industry.
"The most remarkable aspect of it, and what is truly an American idea, are the pro-competitive regulatory principles," he said today. "We knew from the very start that unless you could challenge the franchises of monopolies, you could never get real access."
The agreement provides a powerful new weapon to challenge countries that continue to shield their telephone companies, he said.
"The regulatory principles are enforceable just like a tariff agreement," he said. "You get the benefit of a W.T.O. dispute-settlement and enforcement mechanism on the process that countries use when they decide who gets a license."
Ian Taylor, Britain's Minister of Science and Technology, said the agreement would usher in a sea change in the choices and prices available in global communications.
"The order of magnitude is massive," he said. "There are estimates that the U.K. market alone will increase by $20 billion a year by the year 2010."
Though there have been some rumblings of mistrust from Congress in recent weeks, the new agreement is not expected to be blocked in Washington. The Clinton Administration contends, and most lawmakers agree, that it already has the necessary authority to negotiate a deal and does not need additional approval from Congress.
Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, has been hostile to the agreement, and indeed to almost any agreement involving the World Trade Organization. But the House and Senate are controlled by Republicans, and key Congressional Republicans were quick to voice their firm support.
Thomas J. Bliley, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the House Commerce Committee, said the deal would be a boon to American communication workers who would "enjoy an expansion of high-paying, high-technology jobs" as America exports more advanced technology.
The agreement was a clear vindication for the United States. After months of grueling negotiations in early 1995, most members of the World Trade Organization were ready to support an agreement that fell considerably short of the one reached today.
But to the shock of many, the United States abruptly announced just a few days before the negotiating deadline last year that it would not go along. American negotiators, led by Ms. Barshefsky, complained that too few nations had made meaningful offers to deregulate and reform.
The decision infuriated many European governments, which warned that the United States was holding out for too much and would wreck the prospects for a good, if imperfect, move toward freer trade.
Despite the criticism, the gamble paid off. When negotiators went back to the bargaining table last month, American negotiators led by Mr. Lang successfully pressed for one concession after another in a long series of one-to-one negotiations with countries like Mexico, Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia.
A result was that 68 countries made firm commitments today to liberalize their markets at least to some degree, double the number that had done so when the talks collapsed in April.
In recent days, moreover, one country after another has improved its earlier offers. Mexico and South Korea, for instance, agreed to let foreign companies own up to 49 percent of telephone carriers within their borders. Indonesia and Malaysia agreed to adopt the broad regulatory program of allowing competition within their borders, as did a host of smaller countries.
Several European countries agreed to deeper liberalization as well. Spain, Portugal and Italy, for instance, had refused to unravel their state monopolies until the year 2000, two years after most other members of the European Union had committed to take that step. But those countries decided to move up their schedules as well, and will now open up their telephone monopolies on Jan. 1, 1998.
"I am glad we waited," said Renato Ruggiero, Director General of the World Trade Organization. "We have now made much more progress than we had last April, which means that this was a good time to do a deal."
Executives of AT&T echoed that view. "The willingness of the United States and Barshefsky to step back from a deal last April put the United States in a position to get a much better agreement," said Gerry Salemme, AT&T's head of regulatory affairs in Washington.
What the United States failed to get was movement from Canada and Japan on the issue of foreign ownership. Japan insisted on prohibiting foreign companies from acquiring more than 20 percent of either the NTT Corporation or Kokusai Denshin Denwa, the companies that dominate the domestic and international telephone business, respectively, in Japan.
Canada refused to let foreign companies own more than 46.7 percent of any land-based telecommunication carrier in the country. It also insisted on preserving the current monopolies in satellite telephone services for three years and international telephone calls until October 1998.
In the end, irritated American negotiators gave up and resorted to the face-saving measure of retaining selected restrictions against companies from those countries.
Canadian negotiators, who had been under relentless pressure from the United States for weeks, were modest today about their success.
"It's a balanced agreement," said Michael Binder, Canada's Assistant Deputy Minister for Telecommunications. "Just ask the Americans. Even they will tell you it's a good agreement."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Highlights of Pact"
A total of 68 countries made commitments to open their telecommunications markets to competition, including from foreign companies.
 
AGREEMENT
Countries agree to end protections for telephone and satellite monopolies, in most cases before the year 2000.
 
ENFORCEMENT
More than half of the countries, including Japan and all members of the European Union, agree to adopt legally binding regulatory priniciples that force traditional telephone monopolies to let new rivals connect with their networks at "cost-based" prices.
 
COMPLAINTS
Countries may take complaints to an independent panel of the World Trade Organization, whose decisions are legally binding.

HEADLINE: DISPUTE AT AMERICAN AIRLINES: NEWS ANALLYSIS;
Weighing Clout of Pilots Against Economic Costs

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Because the economic reach of the pilots' union vastly exceeded its political grasp, President Clinton was free to intervene almost instantly to keep the jets flying when the pilots struck American Airlines just after midnight on Friday.
In making his decision, Mr. Clinton had to weigh the potential fury of tens of thousands of holiday travelers, the pleas of Republican and Democratic lawmakers from states like California and Florida, and the prospect of a blow to the economy costing up to $200 million a day, against the wishes of 9,000 pilots who are mostly Republicans and are not even concentrated in one state, but spread out around the country. 
 Still, President Clinton resisted making a final decision so long that his staff prepared remarks in the event he decided not to intervene. In part, he was worried about setting a precedent that would warp future airline bargaining, senior White House officials said today.
But by late Friday night, aides said, he was convinced that a strike's economic damage would be too severe. "Fine, I'll do that," President Clinton finally said as midnight approached, when Bruce R. Lindsey, the deputy White House counsel, called to recommend the intervention as the labor talks broke down, Mr. Lindsey said.
After the strike was announced, Mr. Clinton was in his second-floor study, playing solitaire at his desk and watching basketball on television, when Mr. Lindsey brought him the necessary orders.
By signing them, Mr. Clinton invoked his extraordinary powers under the 1926 Railway Labor Act, suspending the strike for up to 60 days while a newly convened emergency board develops a proposed agreement and the two sides consider it. The last President to intervene this way in an airline strike was Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1966.
Mr. Clinton was given room to maneuver by his allies in organized labor. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. had recommended that he not intervene, but the labor federation made no public fuss about it on Friday as the strike deadline loomed. And today, the organization seemed to shrug off Mr. Clinton's decision, which undermined the pilots' bargaining position by snatching away, at least temporarily, their most powerful lever.
"We support the collective bargaining process," said Denise Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "It seemed as if the process was moving forward, but it had not yielded a contract at that point. There are a lot of workers involved, and a lot of consumers who would be affected, and we respect the decisions that were made."
Asked whether union members would view Mr. Clinton's decision as violating a union principle by heading off a strike, Ms. Mitchell said: "I don't think you can express it that clearly. I think that people probably had points of view that were all over the map."
The Allied Pilots Association is not a member of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. In fact, it is isolated even within the airline industry, representing only the pilots at American. In 1963, the American pilots split away from the Air Line Pilots Association, which is a member of the labor federation and still represents pilots at most major carriers. If the American pilots succeed in achieving their desired contract, they would put enormous pressure on the leadership of the pilots association, which has not won such substantial gains.
Even the other unions at American were not lining up to support a strike by the pilots, who earn on average $120,000 a year. In a strike, American had planned to put most of its 81,000 other employees on leave. The union may have isolated itself even further, because of a comment made by its president, James G. Sovich, in a presentation to Wall Street analysts last week.
To help explain a point that the pilots respected American Airline's managers but did not trust them, Mr. Sovich said many Americans had similar feelings about President Clinton: "They think he's doing a great job, but they don't think he's ethical." The comment apparently reached Mr. Clinton's ears.
While the American pilots may have had few political allies, they have enormous economic power -- too much, Mr. Clinton decided, to permit a strike. Much like a strike at a single, critical parts plant can shut down most of General Motors' assembly lines, the pilots had the power to ground American.
The President himself spelled out the potential costs of a strike in a lengthy statement this morning, explaining his decision to intervene a statement that, like the executive order permitting the intervention, the White House had ready to go when the pilots struck.
Mr. Clinton noted that American is the country's second largest airline, carrying 220,000 passengers daily. The Department of Transportation, he said, had estimated that during a strike, about 43,000 passengers a day would not be accommodated by other airlines. Mr. Clinton also pointed out that most of American's workers would have been put on leave.
"The majority of these employees are based in Texas, Illinois, New York, California, Florida and Oklahoma," he said. Many of the elected officials from these states, he said, "have made it clear to my Administration that a strike would severely affect their economies."
Today, Senators from those states -- even some of Mr. Clinton's leading antagonists in Congress -- sounded gratified by the President's decision. "We are certainly pleased that there is no strike on today," said Larry Neal, a spokesman for Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas.
Still, White House officials said, Mr. Clinton would have much preferred not to have intervened. All week, officials reviewed the history of such interventions in airline disputes, wondering why there had been 33 up until 1966 -- and 3 in that year alone -- but none since.
They concluded that deregulation, combined with the rise of the airlines' use of hub cities, had changed the industry, making it harder for other airlines to step in and provide service in the event of a strike.
The internal debate then turned to the future, and whether intervention would change the nature of bargaining throughout the industry. But, Mr. Lindsey said today, "we thought some of the circumstances were unique, for example the timing of it coming over one of the busiest weekends" for airline travel.
The case for intervening was stiffened by a Transportation Department study given to the White House on Thursday. It showed the strike's effects rippling through the economy, punishing the tourism industry in South Florida and the Caribbean.
Some staff members argued that the strike should be permitted to run for two or three days, but Mr. Clinton rejected that idea, saying that if he would intervene he would rather do so immediately.
By intervening, Mr. Clinton may have merely delayed a strike. It would take an act of Congress to postpone it beyond the 60-day period. But he has done what he sought to avoid -- inject himself into the negotiations, and perhaps subject himself to blame if they ultimately fail. Today, the White House was still trying to distance itself from the talks.
"We're not in the negotiations," Mr. Lindsey said. "We don't feel it's appropriate to be in the negotiations."

HEADLINE: DISPUTE AT AMERICAN AIRLINES: THE PILOTS;
Despite Anger Over the Strike Ban, a Pledge to Do Their Best

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 15

 BODY:
These were grim, tight-lipped men, in their crisp blue uniforms with the four stripes of a captain or the three of a co-pilot on their sleeves, pulling their bags on wheels back into Miami International Airport just hours after President Clinton stopped the strike that many were prepared to wage for a month or more.
With Mr. Clinton's decision today to set up a Presidential Emergency Board to keep American Airlines and the Allied Pilots Association bargaining, pilots say he has robbed them of their one effective lever in stopping American's chairman, Robert L. Crandall, from turning over many jobs to a new corps of much lower-paid, less-experienced pilots. 
 "President Clinton has denied labor the only legal recourse we have today," said Bob Ames, 50, an Airbus pilot and the strike coordinator for the 1,400 Allied Pilots Association members who fly out of Miami. They represent about 15 percent of American's 9,300 pilots and the most militant of the lot.
"But we're going to do what we do," Mr. Ames said. "We're going to go fly airplanes."
These men, and the tiny minority of women among them, are not automobile workers or supermarket checkout clerks, whose rote jobs take little expertise, who work under the gaze of a supervisor and who can be replaced by just about any applicant from an unemployment line.
These elite of the unionized labor force, earning an average of $120,000 a year, thought they were special. Independent spirits who believe they assume responsibilities as intense as any surgeon's, they operate in the solitude of the sky, in a cockpit where no President Clinton, no Chairman Crandall can intrude.
"We've always owned the flying," said Nick Galyon, 40, who flies Boeing 767's on international routes. "We don't talk to managers. We operate unsupervised. We are totally unsupervised around the world, around the clock."
Michael Oliver, 34, a co-pilot who flies Boeing 767's, said the decision to appoint an emergency board means more of the uncertainty that has persisted for over two years, since the pilots and the company began discussions on a four-year contract.
"I think it's going to perpetuate the roller-coaster we've been on, and putting our families through all of this," Mr. Oliver said. "We're still a considerable distance apart at the table."
The emergency board is to study the dispute and recommend a solution within 30 days. The pilots and unions will then have 30 days to study the proposal, after which the pilots can decide to strike. But Congress could take action to prevent a strike.
Talk to any one of these pilots or co-pilots, and the same dream is heard, that of every red-blooded American child who hops off a fence with an umbrella open and who, with training and perseverance, finds that flying is actually possible.
"It was like a destiny," said Alex Garmendia, 51, a captain on Airbus 300's. He wears an "AA" lapel button with two diamonds, one for each decade of flying for American.
"When I was a little boy," Mr. Garmendia said, "a friend of the family was an Air Force pilot. I tried on all his equipment. I went to the Air Force base with him and his son." From then on, he said, there was only one thing he wanted to do: fly. Mr. Garmendia went to junior college in Miami and received a two-year degree in aerospace technology.
"I realized I was underqualified to be a pilot," he said, "so I went to San Jose State in California and got a bachelor's in finance with a minor in aviation. I went into the Air Force and stayed for six years. I was hired by American Airlines in 1976. They hired only 100 guys that year; I was the 51st."
Don Siciliano, 38, is a 747 captain who has been with American for 13 years and who started learning to fly when he was 18.
"Where I grew up, near Pittsburgh, we lived under the flight path to Allegheny County Airport," Mr. Siciliano said. "My five brothers and two sisters and I would be outside playing, and a plane would go by. I would stare up there. I was mesmerized. Basically all I wanted to do was fly airplanes."
Kim Kenny, 37, a first officer, or co-pilot, on a 727, said that as a child, "I loved planes." Her father could fly, Ms. Kenny said, "but there were no women role models, so being a pilot didn't enter my mind." Then, after graduating from George Washington University in Washington, she took a flying lesson.
"The minute I took off, it was pretty much what I wanted to do," she said. "I just loved it. It gave me a sense of freedom, a sense of challenge that would make it fun."
But the current conflict has brought American's pilots down to the tarmac of the changing relationships among management and labor. In the interest of holding down costs to meet competition, American wants to add sophisticated jets, smaller versions of those these pilots typically fly, to its regional routes.
The company would extend the routes to bigger cities and give the jobs to subsidiary companies that are not bound by the contracts with the mainstream pilots. Like American's pilots, its flight attendants, mechanics, baggage handlers and ticket agents could also be affected.
This is another version of "outsourcing," the practice among many unionized companies of hiring subcontractors to do jobs previously done by the companies' organized workers. American's pilots say the company's plan devalues their skills and the trust that has bound them to American.
As yet, Mr. Crandall has not won the opprobrium of Frank Lorenzo, the man unions blame for bankrupting Eastern Airlines in the late 1980's. Some take pride in Mr. Crandall's fierce assaults on competitors.
"He has been an innovator, a real marketing innovator," Mr. Garmendia said. "But that has changed. Beating up labor has become his main objective."
Rich Rubin, 47, a captain who flies 767's on international routes, said: "This is about trust. I don't want to slam him just to slam him. Bob Crandall is a very astute businessman. He thinks in terms of warfare. I just wish he'd realize that we are not the competition."

HEADLINE: DISPUTE AT AMERICAN AIRLINES: OVERVIEW;
Clinton, Stalling Strike, Averts Travel Chaos for Holiday Weekend

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Travelers won a reprieve today from a potentially crippling strike by American Airlines pilots after President Clinton intervened, shifting attention to a board that will try to resolve the dispute between airline executives and union leaders within 60 days.
American Airlines said its operations had for the most part returned to normal. At some airports there was more confusion at other airlines' ticket counters as passengers had switched carriers in anticipation of a strike. [Page 25.] 
 Many travelers said they were pleasantly surprised that their travel plans had not been disrupted.
"It was incredible relief," Elena Musso said while waiting for an American flight at Kennedy International Airport. "I didn't want to miss my sun and ski in Tahoe."
But American Airlines pilots were generally unhappy about Mr. Clinton's decision, contending that it had undermined their negotiating power.
"I understand why the President did what he did, but basically he castrated the union," John Manganaro, an American Airlines pilot, said today at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.
The pilots' dispute now goes to the emergency board established by President Clinton. The board, made up of three mediation and arbitration experts, faces a difficult task in sorting through the complex aspects of the dispute before making a nonbinding recommendation within 30 days.
The two sides will then have another 30 days to study the proposal, after which the pilots can invoke their power to strike.
Despite President Clinton's action, James G. Sovich, the president of the Allied Pilots Association, said, "We may have to go another 60 days and then go out on strike a second time." But Congress could take further action to prevent a strike, either by extending the cooling-off period or mandating a settlement.
The decision by Mr. Clinton, the first time in 31 years that a President has invoked the power of the Railway Labor Act of 1926 to halt an airline dispute, averted wide disruptions for about 40,000 travelers this weekend.
American Airlines, based in Dallas, said the threat of a strike had already cost it about $100 million in profits because so many travelers had booked with other airlines.
Hoping to win back its business quickly, American said today that it would offer discounts of up to 50 percent off its low leisure fares but require no advance booking.
The airline also said it would double frequent-flier mileage awards on domestic flights.
"We thank President Clinton for his wisdom in preventing a strike that would have been very harmful to American's many constituencies and to the nation as a whole," said Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of American Airlines and its parent company, the AMR Corporation.
In a statement issued this morning, President Clinton explained his decision, saying: "A strike would cause a severe disruption to both domestic and international air transportation. I was also particularly concerned that a strike would be especially disruptive over a holiday weekend, when hundreds of citizens rely on our air transit system."
Although he was concerned about creating an expectation of Presidential action in future airline disputes, Mr. Clinton had been widely expected to intervene, in large part because the airline industry has consolidated in ways that make big carriers like American essential to commerce and tourism.
The Transportation Department had estimated that the strike would cost the nation's economy about $200 million a day, but some economists called that figure far too high.
To head off such damaging effects of a strike again, the emergency mediation board must try to find common ground between the pilots and airline executives.
That may be easier to do on the issue of raises than on the issue of regional jets.
American Airlines wants its commuter subsidiary, American Eagle, to fly the same planes that some commuter operations at other airlines like Delta are already using. But American Airlines pilots say they fear that the airline will use the planes to replace bigger jets on routes that they now fly.
People close to the negotiations said today that the pilots realized the company would not budge from its position but that the pilots wanted more compensation for giving ground on the issue. People close to the negotiations on both sides gave differing views today of the proposal under consideration in the negotiations last night.
According to a person with knowledge of discussions on the pilots' side, the union received a proposal for a 6.5 percent raise over four and a half years. It also called for pilots to receive five million stock options, each valued at $10 below market value, on signing a new contract and one million more shares at market value in August 2000.
The company demanded that American Eagle pilots fly the regional jets, but that -- to give some comfort to the union that their jobs would not be threatened -- only 20 percent of the commuter flights would be more than 1,000 miles.
The pilots have apparently come to understand that although a strike would financially cripple American Airlines, the airline will not budge from its demand that the jets be flown only by the lower-paid pilots at American Eagle. That demand explains why Donald J. Carty, the airline's president, repeated early today in a news conference that the dispute, in the final hour before the strike, was about money, not the regional jets. But it appears to have been about both.
According to a person familiar with the company's position, its proposal included four million stock options, each valued at $10 below market value, and a 6 percent wage increase over the life of the contract. Chris Chiames, a spokesman for the airline, did not confirm those figures but said, "I can say that the pilots rejected far and away the best compensation package in the industry."
The two sides can offer new, or earlier, proposals to the emergency board, but its job is to suggest a plan within 30 days for them to consider. The board has no power to force a deal on them, and the pilots will be free to strike again after another 30-day period.
The board's chairman is Robert O. Harris, a former chairman of the National Mediation Board; and the board's members are Anthony V. Sinicropi, a University of Iowa professor and former head of the American Arbitration Association, and Helen M. Witt, also a former chairman of the mediation board.
Depending on the board's efforts, and the willingness of the two sides to compromise, travelers may not need to worry about another strike 60 days from now. If a strike eventually occurs, several economists estimated that the cost to the nation's economy would be less than $50 million a day, only a small fraction of the more than $200 billion in income that the nation generates daily.
Rather than lost air travel, the economic damage from a strike by American would center on the lost wages as a result of layoffs and canceled business, particularly at the airline, economists said. American Airlines and American Eagle had announced that in the event of a strike, 90,000 employees would be placed on unpaid emergency leave, at a cost of $590 million in wages to the workers during a 60-day strike, nearly half of it in the Dallas area.
"I would not expect a strike to show up in any major way in the gross domestic product numbers," said Joel Prakken of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. "Those who don't spend their money on travel would stay home and spend it in other ways."
But that does not take into account the emotional cost of disappointed travelers during a strike, a cost that was largely averted today.
At Miami's airport, Alex Benincasa, a hospital administrator, and his wife, Ana, were headed to San Diego on an American flight. They were among those who had not been able to make other travel plans, so they were relieved at the last-minute turn of events.
"We started to pack," Mr. Benincasa said, "and then we had stopped packing and seven seconds later, we started packing again."

HEADLINE: Albright Flies Toward Vexing Issues

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
In advertising terms, Madeleine K. Albright has had her national rollout as the new Secretary of State. She has laid down her themes of bipartisanship, global responsibility and public diplomacy, and through appointments and symbolism has tried to yank the center of foreign policy-making back into the State Department.
Today she took her show on the road, to nine countries in Europe and Asia, mixing traditional allies with foreign policy challenges. Though her first trip abroad as Secretary of State will have ample symbolism, these 10 days also mark a first serious effort to grapple with the issues. 
 "If the first couple of weeks were filled with press and ceremony and symbolism," a senior official said, "now she really wants to get into substance in a big way."
That will be unavoidable, and grueling. Relations with Russia and China are defining the first year of President Clinton's second term, and Ms. Albright is going to both countries.
In Moscow, she will be the first American official to see the ailing President Boris N. Yeltsin since Vice President Al Gore last July.
Ms. Albright will also go to Beijing, one of Washington's most vexing relationships, arriving at the very end of a trip that is bound to tire even someone known for her stamina.
This trip will break down roughly into halves, and Russia and China will define them. While there are some important bilateral issues with various European countries, the prevailing topic of her visits to Rome, Bonn, Paris, Brussels and London will be European security -- the expansion of NATO and the effort to create a parallel understanding with Russia, ideally before NATO leaders meet in July to name prospective new members.
The recent meetings of Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia and Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore at least gave the Russians a better understanding of what an expanded NATO might mean, officials say.
It was a telling indication of Russia's current confusion, the officials said, that Mr. Chernomyrdin had not really grasped that the NATO meeting will only invite new members, who would not actually join until April 1999 at the earliest.
In her dealings with the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny Primakov, and Mr. Yeltsin, it will be Ms. Albright who will be speaking for the alliance, after she meets with NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. She is expected to be able to present a united NATO position on a new round of talks to modify the outdated treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe.
A modified treaty is an important part of a package intended to help assure Russia that an expanded NATO, with smaller forces, will have less armor arrayed; that new members will not have NATO forces, conventional or nuclear, stationed on their soil except in emergencies; that Russia will have full rights of consultation, though not of veto, on questions of European security and on any joint actions, as in Bosnia.
Perhaps most important, NATO is preparing what would effectively be a promise to Russia that it will not use force outside the NATO area without international authorization, like United Nations approval -- and Moscow has a veto there.
Persuading the Russians to slide down this funnel will not happen overnight, but Ms. Albright will start making the case in earnest, preparing for a summit meeting between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin on March 20 in Helsinki, Finland. Her meeting with Mr. Yeltsin is particularly important because, American officials say, his decision remains the crucial one on security issues.
While Russia is trying to strike its best bargain through Mr. Primakov's adept diplomacy and even to divide the alliance, it is Mr. Yeltsin who will finally make the decision as to whether the bargain available is good enough for Moscow to seek a new relationship with a NATO that will expand in any case. The American challenge, officials understand, is to give Mr. Yeltsin a good enough package of promises, consultation and high-level acknowledgments of Russia's importance that the Russian President can sell the result at home as a victory, not a defeat.
[After arriving in Rome early Sunday, Reuters reported, Ms. Albright said of Mr. Yeltsin and his health problems: "Obviously he himself and the role he has played in democratizing Russia and reform is important. But there are other elements within the Government who are also increasingly dedicated to democracy and economic reform."]
 But Ms. Albright has also started making the case for NATO expansion at home and among allies, contributing a long article to this week's Economist magazine and giving interviews to European newspapers, like Le Monde, that will appear in the capitals she will visit.
While she is away, the State Department is expected to release estimates that put the cost of NATO expansion to American taxpayers at about $200 million a year, officials say. While that number will be questioned and criticized by critics, it represents less than 0.1 percent of the Pentagon's $265 billion budget.
In France, she will smooth relations that got patchy at the end of Warren Christopher's term and discuss possible solutions to the French wish for a more visible European command within NATO. In Germany, she will reassure the Government of Helmut Kohl that bilateral relations are in order, and that State Department criticism of German restrictions on the Church of Scientology will not be allowed to define relations with Europe's most important country.
There will be hand-holding and reassurance in Seoul and Tokyo, as well. South Korea, under economic strain, is always nervous about the American commitment to its security, no matter how often restated.
Debate continues about how much Ms. Albright will emphasize economic and trade disputes with Tokyo. There will be emphasis on security ties, particularly given instability on the Korean Peninsula and a more assertive China.
But Beijing will be the climax of the Asian part of the trip, with Ms. Albright expected to meet President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng as well as Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. In part, she will prepare for Mr. Gore's visit in March.
American officials are looking for some gestures from the Chinese -- a willingness to ratify international human rights conventions, the release of prominent prisoners if even on medical grounds, and the resumption of talks about Red Cross visits to Chinese prisons -- that will let Washington claim some success on human rights as it discusses all the other key issues of their relationship.

HEADLINE: Blame Judges, Not Voters, for California's Declining Schools

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Brent Staples decries the fiscal condition of public education in California (Editorial Notebook, Feb. 10). I would not dispute this, but he is wrong to blame Proposition 13, which capped property tax rates at 1 percent of value and rolled back assessments. This 1978 voter initiative did not restrict California's ability to substitute state taxes for local taxes in paying for education. 
 The real sources of the problem were the "share the wealth" decisions by California's Supreme Court. Serrano v. Priest (1971 and 1976) said that school spending could not vary among districts on the basis of taxable property wealth. For most high-spending districts, this meant that a vote to increase spending from local sources was unconstitutional. The voters obliged the court two years later by rolling back local property taxes and effectively sending the obligation for schools to the Legislature.
What is sad about California's plight is not just the poor education offered one-eighth of the nation's public school students. It's that Serrano v. Priest continues to be emulated by state courts. The resulting reforms have invariably led to a loss of local fiscal control over education. Let's stop impugning Californians as short-sighted hedonists and look at the more likely cause of their problems: judges who think they know better than voters.

HEADLINE: Blame Judges, Not Voters, for California's Declining Schools

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Feb. 12 letters responding to Brent Staples's Editorial Notebook (Feb. 10) seek to blame the collapse of California's schools not on the "tax revolt" and lack of money, but on teachers and teaching methods. How do they account for the similar decline of what was the finest system of public higher education in the world? 
 The system was designed to provide a place in college for every California high school graduate. Did the professors suddenly become corrupt and lazy under this regime? I saw no evidence of that.
Friends in the system in the 1970's and early 1980's paid a few hundred dollars a year. In 1992 my son qualified for the University of California at Berkeley, but it was more economical to attend the most expensive private college in the nation (with financial aid) than Berkeley, where tuition was thousands per semester and he didn't qualify for aid. Now tell me again that funding cuts were not a big part of the problem.

HEADLINE: DIARY

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING 

 BODY:

STOCK MARKET
A Dow Record: This Is News?
What, exactly, constitutes news? By the old rule, man must bite dog -- the opposite occurrence being so commonplace that it's not worth noting. So how about when the Dow industrials put another 1,000-point notch in their belt? The first few times it was sort of exciting -- but the milestones are being toppled so regularly now that it's rapidly sinking to the dog-bites-man category. The Dow topped 7,000 last week, you say? Hmmm. That and 20 redials might, if you're lucky, get you onto America Online. Why do stocks keep rising? Oh, round up the usual suspects: mutual fund money, low inflation, corporate profits, blah blah blah. And the pundits, with remarkably precise hindsight, are scrambling to say that, well, the rules have changed about what defines an overpriced market. Famous last words?
 
WAGES
A Raise? What a Thought
Inflation's all but dead. The grim downsizing reaper still loiters on the street corner. A cost-of-living raise? Ha! Just be thankful you have a job -- and, while you're at it, grovel a bit. Yes, this is the way it was, but guess what: it's not really true any more. Employers nationwide are finding that they simply can't afford to keep being stingy, and wages are now rising at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, half a point above the inflation rate. No, that can't match the solid raises of the good old days -- the 60's and 70's -- but it's quite a change from the past few years, when raises all but vanished for many workers. So go ahead. Ask for a raise. For a change, the statistics are on your side.
 
WALL STREET
Lamborghinis? I'll Take Two
Lest we forget, though: there are wages and there are wages. Light-years apart from the real world of pinched pennies and juggled bills lies the funny-money world of Wall Street, and it's never been funnier. It's the height of bonus season, and we're not talking about a few $100's in an envelope -- not by a long shot. After a giddy year in the markets, the securities industry's 150,000 workers in New York are getting about $8.1 billion in bonuses, far above the previous high of $6.2 billion, with perhaps 1,500 people making $1 million or more. So if you see some smooth-faced hotshots with million-dollar suits and fire in their eyes, better step aside: they've just received their bonus checks and are sprinting for the Lamborghini dealer.
 
PHONE COMPANIES
Good Service? Try Asking
When Nynex merges with Bell Atlantic this spring, Bell Atlantic, it seems, will be setting the pace -- and that's probably just fine with Nynex customers. In a recent F.C.C. customer-satisfaction ranking, Nynex was a distant last. And last week, in fact, the New York Public Service Commission ordered Nynex to pay $109.6 million to its customers in the state for what it called a decade's worth of bad service. Here's a thought, though: in those droning long-distance wars, bargaining is creeping into the formula. If you don't like, say, 15 cents a minute, call and offer 10 -- and they just might take it. So just take this you've-gotta-ask-for-it approach a step further: Call Nynex (or whomever), and after you've lined up package rates and call-waiting, simply say, "I'll go for the good service, too, please."
 
FOREIGN POLICY
A Compromise on Cuba?
When historians sum up America's late-20th-century foreign policy, the comic relief will surely be supplied by our mounting frustration with Cuba. Our delicate sensibilities are so offended that this little island, practically on our patio, won't dance to our deafening tune that we come up with all manner of bizarre and convoluted laws to wreak our symbolic vengeance. One of the more bizarre: the Helms-Burton Act, which, basically, decrees that the rest of the world join us in ostracizing Fidel's ruffians -- or else. European nations, not at all happy being bullied this way, planned to take their outrage to the World Trade Organization. And Washington has countered by warning that it would argue -- this gets really strange -- that little Cuba actually poses a security threat. Last week, though, still hoping for a compromise, Europe postponed its challenge.
 
CELLULAR DISTRACTION
If You Talk, Don't Drive
Status-conscious go-getters wouldn't dream of cruising along in their Grand Cherokees without talking with great earnestness into their cell phones. It's vital, after all, to stay in constant contact with your broker or lawyer or wine consultant -- or at least appear to be. But is this a high-risk status symbol? Common sense has long indicated that it is, but there's been no scientific backing -- until now. A study published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine, in which Canadian researchers studied 699 phone-equipped drivers who'd had accidents, found that the risk of an accident rises fourfold when you're talking -- about the same as being legally drunk. There is some talk about restricting drivers' use of phones, but such a drastic step does not seem to be likely. Still, you can almost hear the new terminology: Stop D.W.C. -- driving while chatting. Or C.I. drivers -- conversation-impaired. And, now, it's no joke.
 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING
Funds for Family Planning
Is family planning just another term for abortion? Abortion foes in the House have long thought so -- or voted so, at any rate, putting tight reins on money for family-planning programs around the world. But last week, prodded by President Clinton, the House voted to speed the release of family-planning money. "American dollars shouldn't be used to kill innocent little children," one Republican argued. But another Republican countered that during every hour that he and his colleagues yammered about the issue, 250 women around the world would die during pregnancy -- deaths that could have been prevented by contraception. This stance won the day, as the House voted 220 to 209 to release $215 million in family planning funds on March 1. If the measure had failed, it would have been just $92 million -- on July 1.
 
SHIFTING ECONOMICS
And the Sand Goes Round
There's really not much ambiguity left. A beach is washed away, you spend millions to dump more sand on it in a futile attempt to outsmart Parent Nature, and the new sand in turn is washed away. And on and on. But have we learned that beaches simply don't stay put? Of course not. Even now, $450,000 is being spent to dump 50,000 cubic yards of sand on Brant Beach on the New Jersey shore.

HEADLINE: Research Firm Joins Rush to Sell Its Stock

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Last year, when executives at Forrester Research, an information technology research firm, went looking for a senior analyst to bolster a critical new-media and technology service, they thought they had found the perfect candidate in Bill Doyle. Mr. Doyle was a longtime designer and builder of on-line services and had an impressive resume working for the likes of AT&T and Citibank.
In a Boston-area market clamoring for such talent, however, Mr. Doyle was a hot property. And at the age of 39, with four children, Mr. Doyle was seeking more than just a good salary. 
"I'd gotten to the point where I figured I was worth something," he said. "The Forrester opportunity was the best of both worlds for me: growing operations, a profitable company, a good salary, and they were able to give me some skin in the game."
The skin referred to stock options in Forrester, which filed an initial public offering just before Thanksgiving. Had there been no options, Mr. Doyle said, "I wouldn't have considered the job."
For George F. Colony, the 43-year-old founder and chief executive of Forrester, going public had never been a priority. He had happily run the profitable firm since 1983 without the attendant pressure and headaches of public ownership.
But in recent years, the rules of the game have changed. Forrester Research competes head on in the lucrative computer research and analysis market with firms like the giant Gartner Group and META Group, both based in Stamford, Conn., and both now publicly traded companies. The successful initial public offerings of Gartner in October 1993 and META in December 1995 forced Forrester's hand.
In a reputation-based, brand-name business dependent on brainpower, stock options have become a priority for talented prospects like Mr. Doyle. "When Gartner went out as successfully as it did, people starting looking for stock options," Mr. Colony said in a recent interview. "We live in a high-tech world that is driven by stock options and in order to attract and keep great people, we had to be public, too."
To fuel the firm's growth, most likely through acquisitions, Forrester needed to deepen its war chest as well: the initial public offering brought in $37 million. Mr. Colony, who owned 100 percent of the stock at the time of the offering, was not complaining about the $120 million in net worth of his own shares. He immediately divested himself of 25 percent of his stock for his management team and to create a pool for bonuses and options for employees.
The $394 million Gartner Group initiated this trend when it went public in 1993. Gartner's public performance has thus far been a stunning success, with its stock splitting three times and its value increasing elevenfold since the offering. The company has profit margins above 20 percent; more than 300 of Gartner's 2,100 employees are now millionaires.
Gartner continues to grow at 30 percent annually. META, at No. 2 with $42 million in revenues, has shown steady growth and profits. Forrester, with $25 million in revenues, got off to a fast start as well. The firm continues to grow at 50 percent, but, after surging to $28.875 in early January, the stock has drifted back close to its value at the end of its first day of trading; it closed Friday at $21.875.
Firms like Gartner and Forrester had long been viewed as consulting firms and thus not likely candidates for going public. Such technology prognosticators have a very different business model than consulting firms. Manny Fernandez, the chief executive of Gartner, said that when Gartner went public, he was forced to spend extensive time educating financial analysts "about the nature of the business" and its value.
"This is an extremely profitable, subscription-based, annuity business," said Richard Shaffer, head of Technologic Partners, a New York-based research firm. "You build it with customer money; you are paid in advance for subscription services you fulfill over time and the renewal percentages are highly predictable. You have all the cash flow advantages and predictability of a subscription-based business and also the cachet of being related to one of the fastest-growing industries in the world, the computer industry."
And once Gartner, founded by Gideon Gartner in 1979, went public, staying private was no longer an option for its competitors. Some highly visible players like Dataquest and the Yankee Group chose to sell themselves to public companies rather than go through the pressure-packed process of going public on their own. Dataquest was acquired by Gartner itself in late 1995 and the Yankee Group was gobbled up by Primark in 1996.
A New Hampshire native and Harvard graduate, Mr. Colony has spent the last 13 years tracking the volatile information technology industry at Forrester and earned a reputation for his willingness to make bold, sometimes brash, predictions about technology trends. (He coined the term client/server computing in 1987 and helped fuel the widespread acceptance of this networked computing model; but he also predicted enormous success for I.B.M.'s OS/2 operating system, which flopped.)
Mr. Colony said that Forrester was right in about 7 out of 10 instances, which is a good enough batting average to please its clients. He boasted of the firm's "good brand name" but also said that he cautions his staff of 125 analysts and sales representatives that "if we have six months of lousy research, we're out of business."
Forrester customers can purchase subscriptions for $5,000 each to any of 10 strategic services like Computing Strategy or Network Strategy and receive regular monthly written or electronic reports. They can also pay up to $65,000 for face-to-face two-hour meetings with Forrester analysts to apply the research to specific business strategies.
Catherine J. Baker, an analyst with Robertson, Stephens in San Francisco, estimates that Forrester takes in an average of $30,000 a client in revenues with an average client buying four to five of its services.
In contrast to the consulting business in which must continually book new engagements, Forrester's subscription-based business is open-ended and continuous, and insures a highly predictable revenue stream. Forrester has 860 client companies and a renewal rate of more than 70 percent.
Gartner has 7,500 clients and an 85 percent renewal rate while META has 1,100 clients and a 75 percent renewal rate. By Jan. 1 of each year, Forrester, META and Gartner have booked and billed up to 80 percent of their revenues for the entire year.
At Nationsbank in Charlotte, N.C., for example, Janey Place, the chief information officer, spends up to $500,000 a year on services from Gartner, META and Forrester. Ms. Place said the research firms provided crucial input into her technology decision-making, though she insisted she did not make final choices based on reports or recommendations.
"Forrester is one of the influences on how I think about the direction of technology and what we ought to be doing," she said. "They've indicated industry directions a number of times that I didn't agree with and they were right."
The advent of the Internet and the ever-increasing complexity of technology's role in business have created a surge in demand for the information supplied by these firms. "The number of decisions users must make today is an order of magnitude higher than 10 years ago," Mr. Kutnick of META said.
And with increasing demand comes opportunity for new players in the market. Mr. Gartner, for example, had severed ties with his original company in 1973, but now has returned to the industry he helped create. However, his new firm, Giga Information Systems, had to pull back its initial public offering last fall.
Meanwhile, Mr. Colony has been urging his staff to catch the next big technology wave. "Unlike most companies, change is our friend; change fuels our growth," he said.
Customers say the public offering has had little impact on their relationship with Forrester. "I don't care much if they are wrong" occasionally, Ms. Place said. "I am looking for high-quality thinking and input. It's as much as you can expect in a crazy time."

HEADLINE: Taking In the Sites;
Cities and States Go Cyber In Hunt for New Business

BYLINE: By SREENATH SREENIVASAN 

 BODY:
Cities and states are using the Internet to escalate their competition for new businesses and investment.
More and more economic development agencies are now boasting on line about their incentive packages to attract companies to relocate to their areas. The World Wide Web's interactive nature allows companies and individuals looking for facts about different regions to get information that only used to be available, if at all, through the mail and in-person visits. 
 "For an economic development agency to not have a Web site nowadays is the equivalent of not having a fax machine," said Leonard Fuld, a co-author of "Regional Web Wars," a study of economic development Web sites.
His consulting firm, Fuld & Company, of Cambridge, Mass., awards Web Warrior awards to economic development agencies with sites that provide information efficiently and effectively. Current winners include the sites of South Carolina, Delaware, Ohio and Arizona. Each of these sites offers facts about its state's economic development strategy in a clear and easy-to-understand manner.
States are not alone in their hunt for new business. Cities of various sizes have gone on line, announcing their wares. New York City, for example, has an in-depth business resource guide on its site, complete with details on tax abatements, international assistance programs, and a sales tax suspension effort.
The Interactive Economic Development Network is a logical place to hunt for useful information. Its comprehensive site is filled with resources about economic development links, wired communities, financing sources and technology transfers.
Some foreign economic regions are also keen players in the game of attracting business and investment. Fuld gave the top award in its overseas category to the Cote d'Azur. This French region of the Riviera has focused considerable energy on business development and its site reflects that, making good use of maps and lists. But most overseas economic development sites are less sophisticated than the top American sites.
Not surprisingly, even a building in Silicon Alley in Manhattan has gotten into the act of attracting tenants through the Internet. The New York Information Technology Center at 55 Broad Street (www.55broad.com) advertises itself as a "wired" building that pushes the technology envelope. Its site has a virtual reality tour of the building and a list of financial incentives offered to tenants.
Some of the leading publications in the corporate relocation business have made their way onto the Web and offer executives another source of information. Area Development, a magazine that deals with planning company relocations, has a site with reprints of its articles as well as state-by-state economic profiles and a listing of state tax incentives. Site Net, a venture of Site Selections magazine, has a comprehensive site that allows corporate relocation planners to learn more about regions. The site also features a useful "tool kit" that provides a checklist for picking an optimum site, along with in-depth lease information.
Companies interested in learning more about the demographics of American counties and cities may find the University of Virginia Social Sciences Data Center's site useful. It offers extensive marketplace information that can be searched by more than 200 variables, including age groups, household incomes, and even the votes cast for Ross Perot in the 1992 Presidential election.
Acknowledging that businesses base their relocation decisions on standard of living factors as well as fiscal concerns, some of the sites highlight favorable human factors. The site of the Roanoke Valley of Virginia, for instance, has a page dedicated to its "low crime." There are selective lists of crime statistics that, naturally, favorably compare Roanoke to 20 other cities in Virginia and across the country. It does not ignore financial concerns: a similar selective list of comparative electricity rates is available.
Since moving a business or a factory to a new location involves changes for employees, two sites provide features that can show employees and management what it is like to live in different cities.
Money magazine's site offers plenty of information about its annual list of "best cities" to live in the United States. Most useful perhaps is its interactive "Find your best places" feature, that allows users to provide preferences about different factors and get back a list of suggestions for places that match their criteria.
The Homebuyer's Fair international salary calculator provides an interactive peek at the salary levels needed to provide a given living standard in different cities. Want to move from, say, a $50,000 salary in Manhattan to Geneva? The site will tell you that you need to earn $68,875 just to keep pace. On the other hand, you'll need only $17,851 to live in Kiev, Ukraine.
Commercial Real Estate Network, a GE Capital Services company, has a free search function for anyone looking to rent or buy office space, and links to various commercial real estate sites.
Unfortunately, many states and cities have not made good use of the interactive nature of the Web and have basically published their brochures on the Internet. As more and more businesses use this medium for their initial scouting, sites that are not current or well designed will lose traffic and business.

HEADLINE: A Dangerous Skirmish Over Cuba

 BODY:
The American economic strangulation of Cuba is a cold war anachronism that is now threatening to upend a carefully constructed international system for resolving trade disputes. Fidel Castro will be the only winner if Europe and the United States undermine the new World Trade Organization in a needless fight over Cuba.
That fight revolves around the Helms-Burton Act, a 1996 law that compels the United States to impose sanctions against foreign companies that do business in Cuba. The law is a misguided attempt by Congress to impose its foreign policy on others, and European leaders are right to resent it. But they are wrong to turn to the World Trade Organization to resolve what is essentially a political dispute. Last week European officials wisely decided to postpone their legal challenge in the trade organization. They would do themselves and their trading partners a favor if they dropped the case altogether. 
 The Helms-Burton Act, passed last year after Cuba shot down two civilian planes over international waters, invites lawsuits against foreign companies that use Cuban property that previously belonged to American citizens, including those who fled after Fidel Castro took control. President Clinton, as the law allows, has temporarily suspended that provision and no company has been taken to court. But the Administration is required by the law to deny American visas to executives of foreign companies that do extensive business in Cuba.
The Europeans, Canadians and Mexicans believe that economic engagement with Cuba is the best way to undermine Mr. Castro's grip, much as the White House believes that trade with China will eventually make that country more democratic. In its case before the World Trade Organization, the European Union accuses the United States of violating its free-trade obligations under the international trade accord. That is a shaky assertion. The core purpose of the world trade accord is to prevent countries from adopting protectionist or discriminatory trade practices for commercial advantage. No one argues that Congress passed Helms-Burton for protectionist purposes.
The United States, for its part, may claim exemption from the trading rules on grounds that the Helms-Burton law protects vital American national security interests. Washington, in effect, would argue that the law is an expression of American foreign policy and as a result does not fall within the trade organization's commercial purview.
A victory for Europe, giving it the right to impose trade sanctions against the United States, would undermine support for the World Trade Organization in Congress and might encourage Senator Jesse Helms and others to campaign for American withdrawal. An American victory would lead other countries to misuse the same national security defense in future cases. Japan already defends its restrictions on rice imports as a matter of food security.
Europe and the United States should try to settle this conflict on their own rather than going to the World Trade Organization. If that fails, the Europeans would be wise to hold their fire. Skirmishing over Cuba is not worth the potential risk to the World Trade Organization.

HEADLINE: Vermont Survey Finds Support For the Legalization of Hemp

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt.

 BODY:
Despite strong opposition from Gov. Howard Dean, most Vermonters favor legalizing hemp as an industrial crop, according to a University of Vermont study.
The study, conducted last year in response to a mandate from the Vermont Legislature, also found that a large number of Vermonters would buy products made with hemp. Hemp is a low potency, fibrous variety of Cannabis sativa, the species from which the flowers and leaves are harvested as marijuana. But it can also be used in fabrics, paints, edible and inedible oils, and for a variety of other uses. 
 Several states are testing the feasibility of marketing hemp, said Roger Clapp, Vermont's Deputy Commissioner for Agricultural Development. Such a test has also been mandated in Vermont.
Public opinion aside, Governor Dean, a Democrat, is strongly opposed to legalizing hemp, asserting in a recent interview: "The real question is this: Does the public support the legalization of marijuana?
"I don't think it's in anybody's best interest to do that. It sends the wrong message to our kids. I think the principal interest of the advocates is to legalize marijuana."
State Representative Robert Starr, the Democratic chairman of the Vermont House Agriculture Committee and a longtime advocate of hemp as an industrial product, disagreed with the Governor.
"The big problem is that our government, state and Federal, expects people in the 1990's to think the way they did in the 1930's," Mr. Starr said. "They've forgotten that it's up to us lawmakers to make the laws and to see that they're enforced. They think they know more than the people do."
Another hemp advocate who welcomed the findings of the study was Dennis Lane, founder and chairman of the Vermont Grassroots Party, a political party dedicated to ending the ban on growing cannabis. In 1996, three of Mr. Lane's fellow party members each won at least 5 percent of the vote in elections for statewide office, which means the Grassroots Party is considered an important one in Vermont.
"The psychoactive component is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the economic potential of cannabis," said Mr. Lane, referring to the chemical known as THC, which causes a high among marijuana smokers. "I'm pleased to see such support. The drug warriors keep using the same old tired lines, but our efforts to educate the public are getting through."
The production of industrial hemp was made illegal in the United States in the 1930's by the Uniform Narcotic Act and the Marijuana Tax Act. To this day, the only legal growing of cannabis in this country is done under special permit from the Drug Enforcement Administration.
As a practical matter, the important difference between marijuana and hemp is that marijuana has a THC level of 8 percent to 13 percent, whereas hemp has a THC level of less than 1 percent. Marijuana has a bushy growth while hemp is a tall, single-stemmed plant.
A concern expressed by opponents of legalization, including Governor Dean, is that law-enforcement officers would be unable to distinguish the two growing in a field.
Another worry, Mr. Clapp said, is that "local drug dealers will commit fraud by mixing the low-potency hemp tops in with the marijuana that's already being sold on the black market here."
The hemp issue surfaced in Vermont in the spring of 1996 after four legislative committees, including Mr. Starr's, began to consider legislation that would have instructed the University of Vermont to grow test plots of hemp, an idea that died under a veto threat by the Governor.
The compromise legislation, which took effect without the Governor's signature, instructed the university to survey public opinion and report back by Jan. 15, 1997. That was to be followed a year later by a study on marketability and suitability of soil types, the latter based on the results of hemp tests under way in the Canadian Province of Ontario.
The University of Vermont report was based on responses to a survey in May 1996 of 402 residents, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus six percentage points.

HEADLINE: A.F.L.-C.I.O. Puts Recruiting at Top of Its Agenda

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Having roused the torpid A.F.L.-C.I.O. in his first year as president, John J. Sweeney will announce on Monday the federation's ambitious all-out gamble to save the labor movement from further decline by shifting its focus to recruiting new members.
In moving the federation's emphasis toward organizing and away from politics, its thrust of last year, Mr. Sweeney hopes to reverse a 20-year slide in union membership, a trend that labor leaders see as a cancer that has sapped their strength both in politics and at the bargaining table. 
 With the goal of attracting new members, Mr. Sweeney will propose at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s winter meeting here this week a $60 million advertising effort to burnish labor's image and a campaign to reach out to working women. He will also pledge to spend more than $2 million on labor's two biggest recruiting drives: organizing 20,000 strawberry workers in California and tens of thousands of construction, hotel and health care workers in Las Vegas, Nev.
Outlining goals that some labor experts call overly optimistic, Mr. Sweeney said in an interview: "We're not going to double our membership in the short term. But if we turn around the decline in members and create a focus on organizing and set modest goals of some growth every year, whether it's 3 or 4 percent, over the long term we will build a stronger labor movement."
In the four-day meeting, the labor leaders, meeting in an urban center instead of their traditional locale, a beach resort, will hear Vice President Al Gore, discuss the labor standoff at American Airlines and refine their legislative agenda.
Mr. Sweeney undertakes his new organizing effort after his relatively successful first year as president. Under him, the federation raised its slouching public profile, pushed Congress into raising the minimum wage and excited college students about labor by enlisting more than 1,000 of them as summer interns. In addition, the federation spent $35 million to make itself a force to reckon with in politics, although its campaign efforts failed to achieve labor's big goal of returning the House to Democratic control.
Some labor experts caution that Mr. Sweeney's success at reawakening the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, an umbrella group that has 13 million members, was child's play compared with the task of recruiting millions more workers to unions.
"It will be 100 times harder," said Gregory Tarpinian, president of the Labor Research Association, a consulting group in New York. "It will be the basis by which Sweeney is judged."
The number of union members nationwide dropped by 92,000 last year and by 388,000 the year before; the percentage of American workers in unions has sunk to 14.5 percent, compared with 35 percent in the 1950's. With the work force growing by about two million people a year, unions will have to add almost 400,000 new members a year to keep from falling further behind -- a tall order considering labor's recent slump and the crusade by many companies to keep out unions.
Talking about the federation's big gamble to increase its numbers, Richard Freeman, a Harvard University labor economist, said: "If they don't organize beyond the rates in which they've been organizing people, they're captains of a sinking ship. One of Sweeney's great strengths is he's addressing the idea that organizing is the lifeblood of the union movement."
As part of Mr. Sweeney's effort to remake labor's flaccid image and show that union leaders care more about organizing workers than sunning themselves, the federation has moved its winter meeting out of the plush resort of Bal Harbour, Fla., for the first time in seven decades. Instead, A.F.L.-C.I.O. leaders will convene in downtown Los Angeles, where they will meet with low-paid hotel, garment and strawberry workers, all in the thick of organizing drives.
The 54-member executive council will debate how to help American Airlines pilots, who went back to work after President Clinton ordered a cooling-off period of up to 60 days in their brief strike. It will also analyze the failure of a 20-month strike by 2,000 Detroit newspaper workers, who made an unconditional offer on Friday to return to work.
Labor's chieftains will be courted by two likely rivals for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000, Mr. Gore and the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt. They will hone their policy recommendations for President Clinton and debate whether to keep supporting Alexis M. Herman, the embattled nominee for Secretary of Labor.
The central theme, though, will be the leaders' recognition that expanding labor's ranks is essential to their goal of stemming the two-decade-old decline in wages (after inflation is taken into account) and narrowing the widening gap between America's rich and its middle class.
Indeed, Mr. Sweeney, with David Kusnet, wrote a book last year, "America Needs a Raise" (Houghton Mifflin), which says, to nobody's surprise, that forming unions is often the best way for American workers to win better pay and benefits.
Articulating labor's populist message, Andrew L. Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, said: "The fundamental challenge facing the labor movement is, Can we raise wages for American working families in a long-term sustained fashion, and can we distribute the growth that the economy has experienced in a way that serves the interest of working families and not just corporate executives?
"We can't raise wages unless we represent significant portions of the members in our industries," Mr. Stern continued. "The American experience is that collective bargaining built the greatest middle class in the history of the world, and the erosion of the middle class's position is directly related to the erosion of the labor movement's strength."
With plans to spend 45 percent of this year's budget on organizing, the Service Employees union is serving as a model for others. As the labor movement's fastest-growing union, the Service Employees group has jumped to 1.1 million members, from 625,000 in 1980. Mr. Sweeney headed that union for 15 years.
In contrast, other unions spend 3 percent of their budgets for recruiting, on average, less than a tenth of the percentage unions spent in the organizing heyday of the 1930's. Because recruiting is done by the individual unions and not the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Mr. Sweeney has adopted the role of inspirational leader and spark plug for organizing.
To encourage the federation's 78 affiliate unions to spend more on recruiting, Mr. Sweeney has pushed through the executive board a plan in which the A.F.L.-C.I.O. will provide $20 million in matching grants for organizing drives.
"We have to keep the momentum going," Mr. Sweeney said, "and make the transition to a stronger emphasis on organizing."
Many unions are embracing new approaches to attract members. While unions rarely cooperate with each other on recruiting, 15 building trades unions have banded together to organize Las Vegas construction workers. In Maryland, three unions have organized 35,000 state workers in a cooperative effort.
In another novel approach, labor has designated certain cities, most notably Las Vegas, as hothouses for organizing in which numerous unions undertake drives that aim to create an enthusiasm and pro-labor message that feed on each other.
The labor movement has also gone international. To pressure the Japanese owner of the New Otani Hotel in Los Angeles to accept a union, the hotel workers union has sent members to Tokyo to demonstrate and enlist the support of Japanese labor.
"There are still an awful lot of labor leaders sitting back and waiting to see whether these new approaches work," said Richard W. Hurd, a labor relations professor at Cornell. "It's important for Sweeney to have some big successes to win the enthusiasm of those leaders who are less committed to the new approach. That will make it possible for this to snowball in the long run."
Daniel Yager, general counsel for the Labor Policy Association, a lobbying group for employers, said corporate America was unhappy about the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s recruiting plans.
"Their agenda is probably American business's worst nightmare," he said. "Having gambled a huge sum of money on remaking Congress and losing, the A.F.L. will now feel it has to deliver something. So they're going to devote the lion's share of their resources to organizing. We sincerely doubt that they're going to gain membership, but they will create a great deal of havoc and distrust."
No one expects companies to roll over as labor revs up its organizing machine. Many leaders fear a replay of last month's events, when the Communications Workers of America lost by just a few hundred votes in a long and expensive campaign to organize 10,000 reservation takers and other service workers at USAir.
"Employers are very strong and very much opposed," said Professor Freeman, of Harvard. "It's as if the unions are in a boxing ring against someone who's stronger and faster. If they can just keep themselves going in the later rounds, the other guy might tire and they might have more stamina, and they have to be ready to take advantage of that."

Policy for Sale

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The story is told of the corrupt Albany judge who called opposing counsel into his chambers and said: "Plaintiff slipped me five thousand to throw the case his way, and defendant gave me ten to deliver for him. How's about another five from the plaintiff and I decide the case on its merits?"
That's apparently the route taken by Bill Clinton and his policy-for-sale agents in Asia. At the same time anti-Taiwan John Huang and Charlie Trie were pouring in pro-Beijing money to (a) the Clinton campaign, (b) the Clinton Whitewater defense fund and (c) the care and feeding of the jail-bound Web Hubbell -- the Clinton "ambassador" in Taiwan and phony Buddhist cultists were steering pro-Taiwan donations to the Democrats. Neither side could be sure Clinton would "stay bought". 
 Last October, a suspicious pattern was discerned in this space of Asian-based contributions and Clinton policy switches, provoking questions about possible economic espionage involving a high Commerce official with top-secret clearance and his former Indonesian employers, the Lippo banking empire, active in China. Examination of our N.S.A. "big ear" surveillance was suggested.
In December, House Rules Chairman Gerry Solomon sent a detailed query to the F.B.I. about potential economic espionage. Director Louis Freeh replied that he had assigned 25 agents to the case.
Last week, Bob Woodward of The Washington Post wrote that intelligence intercepts indicated the involvement of the Chinese Government in directing the flow of some political contributions into the Clinton White House. If true, that would mean China successfully penetrated Mr. Clinton's decision-making process.
Mr. Clinton was forced to admit "this is a serious set of questions" and claimed, "The first I knew of any of it was last evening," now becoming his most frequent protestation.
My suspicions are heightened by the release of White House memos intended to show senators that the former national security adviser, Anthony Lake, would make a suitable Director of Central Intelligence. On the contrary, the internal E-mail is damning:
When Clinton fund-raisers ran a group of Chinese officials, petrochemical manufacturers and their Asian-American $366,000 giver into the President's office during and after a radio speech, Mr. Clinton evidently felt a twinge of guilt -- not of raising the money, but of being seen. "POTUS [President of the United States] wasn't sure we'd want photos of him with these people circulating around," noted one of Mr. Lake's staffers, seeking guidance from the N.S.C.'s man in charge of Asia.
The stunning response: although the contributor was a "hustler" who should be "treated with a pinch of suspicion," the bottom line was "to the degree it motivates him to continue contributing to the D.N.C., who am I to complain?"
The acquiescent bureaucrat was supposedly on duty to protect the national security interests of the United States, that's who he was. His responsibility -- and that of his bosses, Tony Lake and Samuel Berger, now promoted to national security adviser -- was not merely to squelch photographs that troubled the President's conscience, but to stop China's end run forthwith. The N.S.C. response should have been an unequivocal "Absolutely not, and no more policy penetrations like this in the future."
Where is the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board in all this -- or does Warren Rudman see no need for oversight? Has the C.I.A. been tasked to query Taiwanese and South Korean counterparts, who have a better network in China than we do, to find out what Beijing's princelings have been doing in American politics?
Would Tony Lake, if confirmed as Director of Central Intelligence, direct counterintelligence chief Paul Redmond to actively pursue leads to misfeasance in the N.S.C. -- succumbing to White House fund-raising pressure that loosened previous safeguards?
Or -- faced with a stunning coup by agents of influence recruited by Beijing intelligence -- would our chief counterspy shrug his shoulders and repeat the battle cry of the Lake-Berger N.S.C., "Who am I to complain?"

HEADLINE: Playing the Trade Card

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
For more than half a century, the United Nations has been the main forum for the United States to try to create a world in its image, maneuvering with its allies to forge global accords about human rights, nuclear tests or the environment that Washington insisted would mirror its own values.
But in recent months, starting with small issues and progressing this weekend to an enormous one, the Clinton Administration has begun to use a new institution most Americans have scarcely heard about -- the World Trade Organization -- to accomplish comparable ends. When the acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, announced on Saturday that the United States had approved a huge accord to open the world's highly protected telecommunications markets to frenzied American-style competition, she made clear that this agreement was about something far larger than commerce. 
 "The United States has effectively exported the American values of free competition, fair rules and effective enforcement" she declared. In fact, exporting American values, and turning America's passion for deregulation into a tool of foreign policy, is what the new agreement is all about.
The agreement, for the first time, empowers the W.T.O. to go inside the borders of the 70 countries that signed it to review how quickly and effectively they are deregulating a key part of their economies. That includes whether they are following through on their commitments to allow foreigners to invest in a business that countries from France to Japan to Singapore have long reserved for government-run monopolies. And if the W.T.O. finds evidence of foot-dragging it can, in theory at least, authorize penalties.
But that is only the beginning of a growing effort by Washington and its trading partners to use the newly created organization -- a reborn version of a weak world body that once did little but administer tariffs -- as a new tool of foreign policy.
This week the European Community will decide whether to go ahead with what could emerge as the landmark legal case in the World Trade Organization's brief history, a challenge aimed at forcing the United States to abandon one of its most contested foreign policy initiatives. Its target is the Helms-Burton Act, enacted by Congress last year to tighten the economic isolation of Cuba and increase the pressure on the Castro Government.
Europe, Canada and Mexico have denounced the act, because it places sanctions on many non-American companies and their executives for investing in Cuba. The Administration, caught between a law it must defend and the very real possibility it will lose its case, is desperately looking for a way out. It has threatened to declare the isolation of Cuba a matter of "national security" instead of economics to keep the law from going in front of the organization's trade court.
At the same time, however, Washington is using the W.T.O. as a tool to force political change in China. So far it has blocked Beijing's moves to join the organization, declaring that China's efforts to protect many of its key industries, and its huge subsidies to state-owned enterprises that employ half the working population, must come to an end. In public, Washington casts those demands in purely economic terms, declaring that China must join the W.T.O. on "commercially acceptable terms" like every other nation.
It is lost on no one -- particularly the Chinese -- that this is part of a far broader effort to speed internal economic changes in China, changes that seem certain to weaken the Communist Party's hold over the country's rapidly growing economy. That, in turn, could threaten the party's hold on power.
"This is what we've meant for four years when we've declared that trade and economics are no longer a separate sphere from the rest of American foreign policy," Mickey Kantor, one of President Clinton's closest political confidants, said a few weeks ago as he was preparing to leave the Administration after successive stints as trade representative and then Commerce Secretary. "In fact, we are using all of these tools to try to open up societies. It is a connection that we often haven't communicated as well as we should, and that doesn't always work as well as we want it to. But anyone who doesn't see that these are inextricably connected hasn't stopped to look at what's happening."
The Geneva-based World Trade Organization has become the focal point for much of this effort because it was endowed, in the global trade treaty known as GATT (the gracelessly named General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), with the power to act as the rule-setter and the judge of economic globalization.
Its predecessor organization, also called GATT, never had the power to do anything but urge the world's trading nations to lower their tariffs. And it did so during eye-glazing, multiyear negotiations -- called the "Tokyo Round" or the "Uruguay Round" -- in which countries performed enormous horse trades, lowering the tariffs on some products in return for similar concessions from other nations.
The process was slow, and involved so many trade-offs that it often entrenched protected industries rather than opened the world to market forces. But because the cold war was on, the United States did not complain: keeping its markets open to its allies -- even if they did not reciprocate -- was viewed as a way of battling Communism.
The telecommunications agreement was the sure signal that the era of such one-sided concessions is over. The deal was supposed to be struck last April. But many of the countries that were involved in the negotiations offered only scant openings of their markets, fearing that American telecommunications giants -- already toughened by a decade of deregulation in the United States and armed with superior technology -- could overwhelm the flabby government-sanctioned monopolies that have long dominated telecommunications in Europe and Asia.
"They were shocked to hear us say "No way,' " said Ms. Barshefsky, who is acting trade representative and awaiting confirmation by the Senate. "But our message was, 'Grow up; you get what you give.' "
In the end, other countries gave far more, though some, including Japan and Canada, balked at allowing foreigners to gain a controlling interest in their leading companies. But beneath all the praise over the weekend for free trade in telecommunications services, there were a lot of simmering resentments against the United States. Ms. Barshefsky, many countries complain, used the enormous weapon of access to the United States -- where 50 percent of the world's telecommunications market is situated -- to squeeze concessions out of lesser economies.
Some of the complaining came from countries that have long used protected, state-run monopolies to fill patronage jobs or reward friends of the powerful. But some of it is no doubt heartfelt. "You hear a lot of smaller countries calling this economic imperialism," one senior American diplomat said. "And sometimes you have to wonder whether our very aggressive approach creates more ill will than it is worth."
Oddly enough, the complaints one hears abroad about the W.T.O. -- that it is dominated by Washington -- is the exact opposite of the complaint heard in the United States. During his campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination last year, Patrick J. Buchanan denounced the organization, saying that its "faceless foreign judges" would nullify American laws and threaten American sovereignty.
Bob Dole, the Republican nominee, periodically echoed that theme, though without Mr. Buchanan's enthusiasm. President Clinton never discussed it. But in the Helms-Burton case, American officials have warned Europe that a ruling against the United States -- in effect, ordering Congress to change the law -- would undercut political support for the organization in the United States, just as the W.T.O. is establishing its authority.
So far, in fact, the United States has lost only two minor cases, one involving standards for foreign-produced gasoline, the other involving imported underwear -- hardly the stuff of great international conflict.
But coming skirmishes to enforce the telecommunications law, to change the way China organizes the world's largest work force and to challenge Washington's attempts to isolate Cuba all have a common element: they end the era in which the laws of international trade took place along a country's borders, at its customs stations and its ports.
Instead, those laws now go to the heart of every nation's domestic politics, from the running of the telephone system, to the subsidizing of steel mills and coal mines, to the use of economic weapons against national foes. And bigger stakes make for bigger arguments.

HEADLINE: Celebrity and Satire Mean Sales;
Political Books Become Less Sober, More Pop-Oriented

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
It has been four years since Richard Ben Cramer produced what may be the best and is surely the longest political book of the decade, a 1,047-page opus on the psychology of Presidential candidates entitled "What It Takes." Mr. Cramer's study of six contenders in the 1988 Presidential campaign enraptured critics and even sold modestly well.
Since then the White House and Congress have changed hands, Washington is still more Machiavellian, and Mr. Cramer is hard at work on a new book. 
 It's about Joe DiMaggio.
"Basically," he said, "politics is out of vogue."
At least, Mr. Cramer's swatch of it may be. Politics is following the rest of American culture, and going pop. So is political literature. The implications for the classic Washington book -- the kind pioneered by Theodore H. White's "Making of the President" series and sustained by writers like Bob Woodward -- are starting to worry some people.
The evidence is hard to ignore. Twenty years ago, Washington politics generated a wave of sobersided, brisk-selling reportage, including "Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream," by Doris Kearns, and Carl Bernstein's and Bob Woodward's coda to Watergate, "The Final Days," among many others.
A handful of their progeny made The Times's best-seller lists in the last year. But what did readers devour? Comedians (Al Franken, "Rush Limbaugh Is a Big, Fat Idiot," 23 weeks); scandalmongers (Gary Aldrich, "Unlimited Access," 19 weeks); celebrities (Colin Powell's "My American Journey," 20 weeks); sound-bite pamphleteers (James Carville's paperback "We're Right, They're Wrong," 25 weeks). And slickly promoted satire ("Primary Colors," Anonymous, 25 weeks). In other words, politics lite.
They are not without precedent. Perhaps the all-time best seller among Washington political books is fictional: "Advise and Consent," the Allen Drury novel of capital intrigue. "Washington Confidential," a 1950 expose of the city's supposedly seamier political side, is high camp today, but it also sold in droves. The capital has produced its celebrity books, too, mostly forgettable political and social memoirs.
But never have those categories dominated the list of political best sellers as they do today. And not in recent decades, some industry figures say, has a Presidential election so clearly failed to rouse readers.
"Nineteen ninety-six was just not a good year for political books. No doubt about it," said Rafe Sagalyn, a Bethesda, Md., literary agent who represents a sheaf of top Washington journalists. "It's very hard to do topical political nonfiction the way publishers once could."
Not everyone agrees. Some top-drawer authors like Elizabeth Drew and William Greider say the market for their work looks robust. Robert Barnett, a lawyer, Democratic adviser and Washington's leading literary agent, says he sees no shortage of either serious authors or willing publishers. And most of the politerati agree that more Washington books are being published than ever.
Indeed, "Blood Sport," the definitive Whitewater book by James B. Stewart, rode the hard-cover list for a healthy 16 weeks. Mr. Woodward was back with "The Choice," a prequel to the Dole and Clinton campaigns that lasted 11 weeks on the hard-cover list.
But in the book business, being published is not the same as making money. Political books have always been a sort of crapshoot, a game in which publishers printed many worthy, but marginal titles with the knowledge that one or two would probably catch fire with readers and offset the others' losses.
But last year, it seemed, only the publishers got burned.
Accurate figures on book sales are rarer than liberal Republicans. Publishers tout big numbers, but these represent books that have been printed, not bought -- and bookstores can return all their unsold books for a refund. Often, a quarter to a third of any given title is returned.
But officials in some houses, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, say returns of political nonfiction were especially dismal last year, nearing 50 percent even on some well-publicized titles. At that rate, even nominal best sellers may not make money.
Mr. Woodward's "The Choice" was the most prominent underperformer, industry officials said. Despite sales that most other authors would envy, the book appears to have fallen well short of his previous blockbusters, peaking at the fourth spot on The Times's hard-cover nonfiction list. All of Mr. Woodward's past works claimed the No. 1 spot.
Nor were there any surprises among other nonfiction works that had best-seller potential. "Showdown," Ms. Drew's account of the ideological war between Congress and the White House, and "Sowing the Wind," a widely praised analysis of the Republican resurgence by two journalists from The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, never caught on.
There were other warning flags, too. The phenomenon that created the modern political book, the inside account of Presidential politics pioneered by Mr. White, seems to have run its 35-year course. Jules Witcover, the syndicated political columnist, had chronicled six of the last seven Presidential races, but he said publishers yawned this winter when he pitched a behind-the-scenes look at the Clinton-Dole contest.
"The genre isn't dead," he said. "But it's gasping."
Some of this, of course, stems from the fact that 1996 was the Regis Philbin of recent campaigns: politics was omnipresent but so bland as to pass unnoticed. Rough-and-tumble Presidential primaries never materialized; the general election seemed narcoleptic to many.
Many authors say politics is covered so pervasively in an era of round-the-clock news that potential readers already know more than they want to about campaigns and power struggles. "People feel overloaded; that politics has become kind of a public utility; hot- and cold-running politics any time of the day or night," Mr. Cramer said.
There is the argument that Americans are so disgusted by modern politics that reading about it has become a chore. But given the runaway success of books by Messrs. Franken, Carville and Aldrich, sometimes on the same topics as more serious authors, anomie seems as much an excuse as an explanation.
Instead, they see shifts in readers' tastes and publishing economics toward splashier mass-market political books, where both the costs and payoffs are vast. Their worry is that those trends will render the meat-and-potatoes political nonfiction of reporters and political scholars uneconomical from the very start.
Peter Osnos, an excutive vice president at Random House until last year, is fearful enough that he recently announced plans for a new publishing house, supported by the Twentieth Century Fund. The publishing house would be devoted almost exclusively to financing and promoting such books.
"There are a number of people -- reporters from The Times, The Washington Post, Newsweek, lots of places -- who sold books that have had an impact," he said. "The problem is that the market price for some of them, no matter how good they are, is higher than their sales. That's a fundamental conundrum."
With exceptions -- works from authors like Mr. White and Mr. Woodward, or a memoir from a famed figure like Henry Kissinger -- traditional political books seldom have been lucrative. An average author might struggle to land a six-figure advance for a work that could consume a year or more of research and writing, and with luck sell 30,000 copies. Sales of 60,000 or more -- a very rough threshhold for many best-seller lists -- can be cause to uncork champagne.
For most such books, that is still true. But the transformation of Presidential aides from faceless figures to television heartthrobs and candidates from gray eminences to shock-radio guests, has certified politics as a celebrity business. That has brought political literature out of bookstores' current affairs racks and onto pallets at Price Club, next to tell-alls about Princess Diana.
The new breed of books come not from journalists or statesmen, but from celebrities and political insiders with stories to spill. And like the books about Hollywood, fame is often as much of a draw as whatever the authors or their ghost writers commit to paper.
The sums of money involved are huge. Mr. Powell is said to have received $6 million to write "My American Journey," and Little, Brown & Company recently bought the rights to a memoir by Mr. Clinton's 35-year-old former adviser, George Stephanopoulos, who reportedly auctioned his memoirs for upward of $3 million.
The payoff on winners can be immense: Publishers Weekly estimates that "My American Journey" sold more than 1.5 million hard-cover copies in 1995 alone.
But so is the price of a mistake. In publishing circles, the latest example is "Behind the Oval Office," the inside tale of President Clinton's political resurrection as told by its self-proclaimed engineer, Richard Morris. Random House paid Mr. Morris some $2.5 million for his story, a sum other publishers say would be tough to recoup without sales of perhaps half a million books.
"Behind the Oval Office" has had decent sales in some cities, several industry officials said. But to break even, it needs spectacular sales nationwide, a dim prospect for a book lacking stunning revelations by an author whose very name is poison among many readers.
The dangers of such deals are especially high. And because the risks are so great, some writers and editors reason, publishers are becoming less willing to take fliers on more sober books with more marginal prospects.
Yet publishing executives deny the gambles on celebrity and scandal leave less room for serious analysis. "We don't have a budget for buying books," said the top editor of one major house that is a leading sponsor of political books. "You try to buy good books as they come along. There's general pressure to pull one's socks up these days, but I don't think that affects what we purchase."
Mr. Barnett, the Washington agent who represents both Mr. Woodward and Mr. Stephanopoulos, emphatically agrees. The more sober accounts, he said "still get read, not in diminished numbers, but in increased numbers; I just don't accept the notion that it's Darwinian."

In an era awash in celebrity and cynicism, public taste in political books seems to be shifting. Below is a comparison of 1996's top five poitical works on The New York Times' Best Seller List and the top five all-time best sellers. Like baseball teams, best seller lists of different decades are not easily compared. More books are sold now, and The New York Times Best Seller List has grown. Before 1977, 10 books were included. Since then, the best-seller list has ranked the top 15 books.

HEADLINE: SMALL JETS ALTER AIRLINE ECONOMICS

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The bitter confrontation between American Airlines and its pilots union has its roots in a growing innovation in air travel -- small jets -- that the company wants to use on many routes.
Also known as regional jets or commuter jets, these aircraft are replacing turboprop planes on flights that have not usually attracted enough passengers to be served by larger jetliners. 
 While popular with travelers -- who like the jets' speed and ability to fly above turbulence -- these small planes are seen by the unionized pilots as a way for American Airlines to replace many of the larger jets, as well as their jobs.
But American's parent company, the AMR Corporation, continues to insist that the pilots at its American Eagle subsidiary, who earn less, must fly these jets if the company hopes to compete profitably with other carriers that already fly them.
The intransigence of both sides on the issue goes a long way toward explaining why they were willing to bear the heavy cost and disruption of a strike, which was averted for 60 days when President Clinton intervened early Saturday morning.
To a degree, the dispute at American Airlines is similar to the labor strife that resulted from significant changes in the steel and telecommunications industries. In those industries, new technology, like the steel industry's mini-mills, allowed companies to operate more efficiently with fewer workers.
By all accounts, the small jets are rapidly changing the complexion of the airline industry for many travelers. Some industry experts consider the introduction of the small jets to be similar to improvements that enabled aircraft to fly with fewer engines and smaller cockpit crews.
"The airline industry has always been able to provide travelers lower prices as a result of upgrades in technology," said Candace Browning, an airline industry analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, who estimated that half of all commuter airline fleets will be small jets instead of turboprops in 10 years.
The biggest user of the regional jets in the United States is Comair, a commuter partner of Delta Air Lines, which flies the 50-seat Canadair regional jet on such routes as Cincinnati to Des Moines, and Salt Lake City to Boise, Idaho.
Canadair, a subsidiary of Bombardier of Montreal, first introduced the small jets into service in 1992, and has delivered 154 of them around the world, and has orders to deliver another 76. Canadair is also planning to build a 70-seat version of its current 50-seat model. Airlines including Continental have also ordered a small jet, the Embraer-145, made in Brazil by Embraer.
The regional jets cost about $20 million each, compared with $35 million for a Boeing 737 that seats more than 100.
These jets are in many respects at the leading edge of a shift in the airline industry toward more point-to-point service. Although the industry has evolved in the last two decades around the notion of feeding passengers into big hub airports that require them to take a second flight to their destinations, airlines are also competing increasingly by offering more direct service. The small jets play into this strategy, since they are able to fly longer distances nonstop than turboprop planes, although not as far as larger jetliners.
The small jets are the latest tool at the airlines' disposal to serve routes that do not generate enough traffic to justify flights by larger aircraft.
Despite the sophistication of modern turboprop planes, they are widely perceived by travelers as inferior to jets. So much so that cities like Amarillo, Tex., guarantee a profit for American Airlines to offer jet service as part of its effort to grow its local economy. Without such subsidies, American would offer American Eagle service instead, possibly with a regional jet.
Assessing the long-term impact of the regional jets if they were placed into service in American Eagle or American is a matter of considerable debate between American and its pilots, who are represented by the Allied Pilots Association.
And their differences on the issue will undoubtedly continue to be a sticking point over the next two months in discussions with a Presidential Emergency Board of three mediators trying to head off another strike by American's pilots, which they will be free to do after 60 days.
Within 30 days, the mediators will try to come up with a proposal that they think both sides will accept. This week, the two sides are preparing presentations to the mediators, and the settlements that each side suggests do not have to be what was left on the table Friday.
The positions may revert to those they held before talks began in Washington last week. The company agreed last fall to offer a 5 percent wage increase over four years and 5.75 million stock options to be distributed among the 9,000 pilots at American. But in early January, the rank and file voted against that deal by a margin of almost two-to-one.
Almost two weeks ago, the pilots announced their new demand: an 11 percent raise over four years and 7.25 million stock options, as well as their insistence that all jet flying be done by American pilots.
People familiar with details of the recent negotiations that ended in the brief strike said that union leaders had realized that the company would not give in to the pilots' demands that they fly the small jets.
That explains why airline executives held their ground and took a strike that they had said they could not afford. Even though pilots halted their strike after 24 minutes, just the threat of a strike drove away enough passengers to cost the airline about $100 million in lost profits, executives said.
After the strike was halted, Donald J. Carty, president of American Airlines, said that the regional jet issue had been settled, but that the two sides could not agree on the size of a package of raises and stock options for the four-year contract.
But people familiar with the pilots' stance said the union was demanding higher raises for giving American what it wanted on the regional jet issue; in effect, the jet issue made the pilots dig in further on their demands about compensation.

HEADLINE: Torricelli's Internal Debate on Budget Issue

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
It is dizzying to listen to United States Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey make the case for a balanced budget amendment. And against a balanced budget amendment, and so on.
The newly elected Mr. Torricelli is still in temporary quarters in the Senate Office Building and not yet fully recovered from an unusually bloody campaign. He is mulling his position as one of four undecided freshmen, all Democrats, who could decide the issue, which was being debated in the Senate last week. The last time the amendment was debated, it failed by one vote, and this year's tally is expected to be just as close. 
 "I thought at some point I might be a potentially deciding vote on an issue of national importance, but I didn't think it would be before I unpacked or had been assigned a desk or a telephone," said Mr. Torricelli, 45, who had an unconventional voting record during his 14 years in the House of Representatives. He has broken with party leadership on high-profile votes and was particularly outspoken in his support of the Persian Gulf war.
As a Representative, Mr. Torricelli voted for a balanced budget amendment three times. Now he has serious reservations, although he still thinks it is a good way to keep the country from going into heavy debt. But he also worries about fiddling with the Constitution.
If the vote were today and his were the deciding vote, he said in a recent interview, he would vote for the amendment. But it is not today -- no date has been set for a vote -- so his one-man wrestling match goes on.
During the campaign, Mr. Torricelli routinely pointed to his support for the measure, as a way of answering a charge that he was a "tax and spend" liberal.
But the amendment is a top priority for Republicans, who unanimously support the measure, and he is under heavy pressure from his party to vote against it.
The pressure is being applied by, among others, his longtime friend, Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury Secretary, who campaigned for him and believes the amendment would be truly disastrous economic policy.
Mr. Torricelli has been given homework by Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, another fierce opponent, who presented him with several books to read.
And he has received multiple calls from the President, who invited him over recently. ("I watched the Super Bowl with him," the Senator said, "but it never came up.")
He is also talking with business leaders, economists and bankers.
In the House, Mr. Torricelli was known as bright but abrasive, even by Washington standards, and he seems to have reinvented himself as a bright but abrasive Senator.
This was demonstrated in a meeting with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and other New Jersey officials to prepare strategy on a transit bill. He lectured the Governor as if she were a slightly dull pupil.
"Most people will not be persuaded by the fact that we're a corridor state; that's our problem," he said, curtly dismissing her argument. "Some of us have to be a little more direct on this. In highly visible meetings in your party, you have to let them know they write off the Northeast politically at their peril. No more of these water projects for the South. They understand that language."
Still, Mr. Torricelli, who beat former Representative Richard A. Zimmer in a Senate race so negative that Mr. Torricelli now says he probably would not have run had he known how low it would go, insists that the more deliberative pace and civil tone of the Senate have put him in an almost contemplative frame of mind.
He says his internal arguments go something like this:
In the past, he voted for the amendment largely to send a message to the Administration as the deficit soared.
But now that problem has largely been solved.
But an amendment would insure that the excesses of the 1980's would never recur.
But is that reason enough to amend the Constitution? And what would happen in an economic or military crisis? And how to guard against the specter of Federal judges making decisions on tax policy?
He has introduced his version of an amendment, which would provide for a capital budget. Federal expenditures are now made through an operating budget, which he says discourages investment. His version would also exclude Social Security from budget calculations.
Critics say it is nothing more than political cover for Democrats who want to support a balanced budget amendment without necessarily balancing the budget. And even Mr. Torricelli says flatly that his version is not a real alternative because it has no chance of becoming law.
But he insists that it is possible to balance the budget without cutting Social Security, if Social Security is only slowly taken out of the mix.
After a long discourse on the ins and outs of his vote, Mr. Torricelli drops a hint that when it matters, he will not desert his party. "The U.S. needs to determine a proper level of debt," he said, "and it's possible several members could emerge to use votes on this to force new creative talking."
But then he drops a hint in the opposite direction. "The nation has survived one bout of fiscal irresponsibility, but if it recurs, the security of the U.S. would forever be compromised," he said. And he gives the impression that he is not even close to a decision.
"I understand this will be one of the most important votes I ever cast," he says, and smiles. "I'm taking an extraordinary amount of time talking about it."

HEADLINE: One Man's Tough Faith In Jazz, In Words And Action

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS 

 BODY:
Inside many people in the jazz business lurk advocates yearning to raise a flag on behalf of the music. They do it in different ways. Over the years Steve Backer, who is quickly reassuming his role as a pivotal figure in the jazz record business after a few years away, has done it by heavily promoting pop jazz to support his more cutting-edge artists.
Mr. Backer, 53, who recently assumed top-level positions at both RCA and Impulse Records, is now overseeing six separate reissue labels and busily signing new artists. And he is negotiating with several more companies to oversee their jazz programs. That he is allowed to operate for unrelated companies is a sign of the respect he has within the jazz world. 
 Mr. Backer has returned to jazz at a time when album sales are flat and there is a widespread feeling in the industry that too many recordings are being made and that too many of them are unimaginative and badly produced. Even worse, the record business at large is in a depression, meaning that jazz albums, generally perceived as ephemera, frequently get dropped, especially in the larger chain stores.
"I think that jazz sales go in cycles," Mr. Backer said. "But even if the general situation for music in the United States weren't so bad, with bad distribution and bad stores, jazz would still be in trouble."
Mr. Backer, a tall man with a close- cropped beard, entered the record industry in 1969, working the pop side of the market at MGM Records. Immersed in jazz most of his life -- his father was a saxophonist in New York -- he wanted to work for a music he loved, and so he took his pop marketing expertise and moved over into jazz.
In 1974, while working for Arista Records, he succeeded in doing something that now seems improbable, if not impossible: he marketed the avant-garde.
His roster included Cecil Taylor, Anthony Braxton, Oliver Lake, Julius Hemphill and Michael Gregory Jackson, musicians who can rarely raise an audience beyond their own small cults, at least in this country. But in the early 70's, thanks to Mr. Backer -- who was packaging them well, placing them in major record stores with displays and treating them with some respect -- their music was noticed.
"I had a theory that if you don't document the cutting edge of an art form, it stands a good chance of withering," Mr. Backer said. "And it could be documented because I had balance. I could sell fusion artists like the Brecker Brothers, to support the other music.
"But as importantly, the music was a real reflection of the times, sociologically and economically, and we figured out how to market the music, to package it as something important. It was a movement, and movements attract attention."
Mr. Backer worked his way through a series of other trends. He landed at Windham Hill, the New Age label, for a year. And when he went to RCA in the early 80's he was an influential part of a trend that defined jazz until the last few years. He began signing, at a clip, an entire generation of younger musicians, some remembered and some forgotten, including Danilo Perez, Roy Hargrove, Steve Coleman, Marcus Roberts and Mulgrew Miller.
This was on the heels of Wynton Marsalis's arrival on the scene, which opened the eyes of record executives to the potential profit -- and good will -- that might be reaped by having jazz subsidiaries. Over the years several labels were formed, often using the "young lion" marketing ploy as a sales angle.
And while Mr. Marsalis and the musicians who have followed have been controversial for their perceived conservatism, there isn't any doubt that the jazz environment was profoundly changed when their records were marketed by the major labels.
So where does that leave Mr. Backer now, in these dire times?
"To beat a situation like you have today, you can't think that a record is just 10 songs," he said. "You have to think in terms of meaningful producers, alternative marketing possibilities. You have to figure out how you help to create a new trend without being manipulative of the music or musicians.
"Whatever the new movement is, whether it's fusion or New Age or instrumental pop music or the young lions or the avant-garde, if you can be part of the movement you have a great chance of being successful."
"It's not even about the quality of the recordings, really," Mr. Backer said. "It's about a complex coalition of things, and when the mainstream press, for example, has tired of the young lion idea, it has to find something else to write about.
"Television shows, or fashion magazines, don't care about quality, they care about the package, and to break a jazz artist out you need that outside support. The music has to be sold as a pop product, where the artists signify something extra-musical."
Mr. Backer has signed the vocalist Dominique Eade and the tenor saxophonist Don Braden. He has his eye on the Jason Lindner Big Band, which regularly draws full houses on Monday nights at Smalls, the tiny Greenwich Village club with a rapidly growing reputation as a breeding ground for young artists.
"I was knocked out by what was going on at Smalls," Mr. Backer said. "But I don't want to give away what I intend to do. Suffice to say that the music is still developing and evolving no matter what's against it sociologically or geographically. The music continually evolves and it's just a question supporting the bands.
"My bet is that the new millennium will allow, at record companies, the coexistence of both adventurous and conservative music."

HEADLINE: Many Florida Blacks, Tossed by Population Shifts, Say They Feel 'Left Out'

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 14

 BODY:
M. Athalie Range became Miami's first black city commissioner in 1965, a time when the civil rights movement was "roaring," she says, and blacks nationwide had the promise of new political and economic frontiers.
A string of other black politicians followed her in the commission seat, the only one of the five seats ever held by blacks. But last November, three decades after Ms. Range fought to bring things like sidewalks and street lights to her constituency, the seat was lost to a Hispanic man. 
 For many blacks, that political setback has come to symbolize unfulfilled promise in the Miami metropolitan area, where so many other Floridians have prospered.
"We feel more or less left out," said Ms. Range, now an 81-year-old funeral director.
Florida, a state that in the last 50 years has leapfrogged to fourth most populous in the country, has been a magnet for retirees, immigrants and others seeking sunshine, a refuge or the kind of economic opportunity that comes with explosive growth.
But as whites have come from the northern states and Hispanic immigrants from foreign countries, Florida's transformation has come at a cost to part of its black population. Many restaurant and hotel jobs once held by blacks now go to white and Hispanic applicants. Black neighborhoods have been lost to urban development. And as their percentage of Florida's population has eroded, blacks have lost influence or failed to gain the economic and political foothold envisioned by many in the 60's.
Nowhere is this more evident than in Miami, where black residents talk of the sense of being passed by, rather than displaced. It plays out at polling places, where blacks have declined to a quarter of registered voters while Hispanic residents have grown to one-half of registered voters. As recently as the early 1970's, the number of blacks registered to vote here was more than twice that of Hispanic residents.
It plays out in black sections like Overtown and parts of Coconut Grove, where poverty, unemployment and low educational attainment contrast sharply with the tourist glitz and a booming downtown that almost engulfs them. And it plays out in ethnic tensions that have flared in riots, boycotts and a recent dispute over the leadership of a conference intended to promote understanding among ethnic groups.
The Rev. Willie E. Sims Jr., the assistant director of the Dade County Office of Black Affairs, said: "Most blacks here, when they go home to Alabama or Georgia for funerals or family visits, to the backward areas they fled for Miami, they find more blacks in elected positions, more blacks living well. Some say the car travels faster going north away from Miami than going back."
South Florida offers the clearest example of demographic changes that have occurred statewide. From 1950 to 1990, Florida moved from being the 20th-most-populous state to being 4th most populous, and at the same time, its black population also grew, to 1.8 million from 600,000, according to Census Bureau figures. But as a percentage of Florida's population over all, blacks dropped to 14 percent from 22 percent.
Of the 14 million residents now in Florida, 14 percent are Hispanic, say researchers at the University of Florida, and Hispanic residents may have already surpassed blacks as the state's largest minority.
In cities like Miami and Orlando, Hispanic immigrants have increased competition for jobs, social services and political influence. But in cities like St. Petersburg, which is 19 percent black and 76 percent white, with few Hispanic residents, the complaints of black residents have more to do with vestiges of the legal segregation that lasted until the 1960's. The attitudes and patterns of such segregation, sociologists say, continue informally through discrimination in housing, jobs and credit and in police practices around Florida.
After two disturbances in a black neighborhood in St. Petersburg in late 1996, prompted by the fatal shooting of a black teen-ager by a white policeman, an advisory panel to the United States Commission on Civil Rights found that while the killing had ignited the violence, feelings of alienation had fueled the undercurrent of tension that had exploded.
"I saw hopelessness, despair, nothing to look forward to," said Rabbi Solomon Agin, the panel's chairman.
Many of the frustrations mirror those of other blacks throughout the country. And blacks in Florida, like in the rest of the country, have also made significant advances after the end of legal segregation opened doors to schools, jobs and a better standard of living.
More blacks hold elective office in Florida than ever before: 210 in 1994 compared with 110 in 1980, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington. They include 4 of the 13 Dade County commissioners, 7 state legislators and a Congresswoman, Carrie P. Meek. A significant victory came last year when Nathaniel Glover Jr., 53, became the sheriff of Jacksonville, Florida's first black sheriff since Reconstruction.
"Certainly, we've come a long way," said Sheriff Glover, a Jacksonville native. "Ten years ago it wouldn't have happened."
But Census Bureau figures also show that 32 percent of Florida's black families lived below the poverty level in 1989, compared with 9 percent of white families and 20 percent of Hispanic families.
It was Fidel Castro's assumption of power in Cuba in January 1959 that made immigration concerns, not integration, the paramount issue in Miami as the exodus of Cubans to South Florida began. In 1960, Census Bureau figures show, Miami's population was 77 percent white and 22 percent "nonwhite," the category then used by the bureau. By 1990, it was 24 percent black, 12 percent white and 62 percent Hispanic.
In recent years, educational levels, government relocation aid and, in some cases, money from home have given immigrants, including blacks from countries like Jamaica, an advantage over Miami natives.
The divisions have affected in politics. The last two elections for mayor of Dade County, where half of the two million residents are Hispanic, and for the Miami City Commission, were fought along racial lines, with the black candidates losing despite near total support from black voters.
Of the five city commissioners, four are Hispanic and one is white.
Miami is also a place where a black "brain drain" is considered serious. Part of the problem, business experts say, is that Miami does not offer the level of professional jobs offered by cities like Atlanta. But black professionals say they find Miami inhospitable in other ways, from being shut out of jobs that require a knowledge of Spanish to the lack of nightclubs, restaurants and other places that appeal to blacks.
"There seems to be no stable black middle class," said Bill Diggs, 34, a black native of Augusta, Ga. Mr. Diggs is a telecommunications manager who first moved here from Wilmington, Del., for a job in 1987, left in 1989 for Atlanta and returned in 1995. "There is no jelling of the community," Mr. Diggs said. "We've almost become a caste system."
This time around, he settled with his wife and two children in neighboring Broward County. And this time, Mr. Diggs has found in Miami a black business and social network through the Black Executive Forum, a group that started two years ago to recruit and retain black professionals, among other things.
The forum is the result of what is known here as the quiet riot, a three-year tourist boycott of Dade County that was organized by black civic leaders and brought on by two events that happened in close proximity: the police beating of Haitian demonstrators who accused workers in a Hispanic-owned store of mistreating black customers and the snubbing of President Nelson Mandela of South Africa on his 1990 visit here by Cuban-American politicians for his refusal to denounce Mr. Castro.
The boycott, which county officials estimated had cost over $20 million in convention business, was called off in 1993 when civic leaders accepted economic goals to increase black participation in the tourist industry of the Miami metropolitan area.
Ari Sosa, who has been director of the Dade County Department of Community Affairs for the last 13 years, said other programs in the last three years to promote Hispanic- and black-owned businesses in each other's neighborhoods and increase black hiring, among others, had brought ethnic groups closer.
Incidents that could once have led to trouble have instead led to apologies, Mr. Sosa said. He also noted that in the dispute over the community relations conference, the meeting's planners settled for increasing the list of leaders to include all races.
Marilyn Holifield, a Miami lawyerwho helped organize the protest, said that "when we resolved the boycott, we didn't really win, but we made it possible for people to be sensitive in ways they never were before."
But no change has brought as much anticipation as the opening of the first major hotel in the area to be owned by blacks, the result of a $10 million incentive package offered by the City of Miami Beach as part of the agreement to end the boycott. The hotel, in the popular South Beach section, is to open by 1999.
Electoral defeats and other setbacks may give blacks the sense of "getting nowhere," said Ms. Range, the former city commissioner who served for five years, but a black-owned hotel will be a monument to the boycott and a symbol of hope. "People, both black and white, need to see something that represents the struggle, something we can put our hands on," she said. "It's something that's resulted from success."
