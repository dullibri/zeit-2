HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Havel's Aides Meet U.S. Bankers On Investment in Czechoslovakia

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
While President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia visited with President Bush and addressed Congress yesterday, his top economic advisers worked at cultivating investment for their country.
Rather than meet directly with business executives, many of whom remain skeptical about investing in Czechoslovakia, the officials are trying to build a network of Wall Street advisers and investment bankers who would help the Czechoslovaks draw foreign investment.
Two key architects of the evolving Czechoslovak economy are traveling with President Havel: Vladimir Dlouhy, the Minister of Planning, and Vaclev Klaus, the Minister of Finance. Both are strong advocates of foreign ownership of Czechoslovak companies to make them efficient and competitive in world markets. 
 
Party at the Guggenheim
The two officials were guests in New York last night at a party at the Guggenheim Museum given by Salomon Brothers and at a private dinner at the home of William Luers, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a former United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia.
The dinner guest list included E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Anthony Solomon, the bank's former president and now an investment banker; Robert Hormats, an investment banker at Goldman, Sachs & Company, and Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist who is advising the Czechoslovak Government.
Rather than rely on foreign loans to modernize industry - loans that might result in a burdensome foreign debt -the Havel team would encourage foreign companies to put businesses in Czechoslovakia and also to purchase some major state-owned manufacturing operations. Josef Tosovsky, president of the State Bank of Czechoslovakia, said yesterday in Washington that President Havel is not seeking credits or loans during his visit to the United States.
 
Legislation Planned
The Havel Government is drafting legislation that would permit foreign ownership and make other changes favorable to foreign investment. Under current law, a foreign company can be only a minority partner in a joint venture.
But anticipating that the necessary legislation will soon be adopted by Parliament, some big American companies are negotiating with state-owned Czechoslovak operations, particularly those manufacturers with products that could be exported to Western Europe, according to people involved in the discussions.
The General Electric Company, for example, is holding talks with the Skoda Engineering Works, a manufacturer of power equipment and other machinery, in competition against Siemens A.G. The Chrysler Corporation has held talks with a separate Skoda company, the manufacturer of autos. One competitor is Mazda. The idea is to produce an American- or Japanese-designed car at a Skoda factory for export to Western Europe. The lures are Czechoslovak engineering and manufacturing skills and low wages.
 
Talks on Glass Plants
Numerous Western companies, including some from the United States, have also talked with the Czechoslovaks about investing in that country's famous glass factories, particularly those making auto glass, said Jan Vanos, president of PlanEcon, a Washington consulting firm that specializes in Eastern Europe.
Smaller American companies have not gone beyond the inquiry stage, apparently preferring to wait until the new laws governing foreign investment are in place, said Fred Zeder, president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a Government agency that insures foreign investment by American companies.
Earlier this month, the Czechoslovaks asked Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, when he visited Prague, for help in forming a panel of American advisers. The group being formed includes Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve; John Whitehead, a former Deputy Secretary of State who is now an investment banker; Peter McPherson, executive vice president of the Bank of America, and Mr. Hormats.
''The panel is mostly a way for the Czechs to strengthen their ties with the American financial community and with companies that are potential investors,'' Mr. Hormats said.

HEADLINE: Foundation Sponsors Anti-Drug Effort

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Fifteen localities in the United States have been selected for a new initiative to curb alcohol and drug abuse, financed by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation of Princeton, N.J.
The foundation will spend $27 million over five years, the largest sum from any single private source to combat substance abuse.
Each of the 15 communities, selected from 331 applicants, is to develop a program intended to reduce demand for alcohol and illegal drugs among local residents. They include the cities of New Haven and Worcester, Mass., where there has been an upsurge in drug abuse, and six other urban locations. Rural communities were also chosen, including an area of northwestern New Mexico that covers portions of the Navajo and Zuni reservations. 
The foundation's president, Dr. Leighton E. Cluff, said the aim is to develop successful models that can be copied elsewhere.
The foundation sought to involve several elements of the local communities as they planned the models, said Prof. Anderson Spikard, a drug-addiction specialist from Vanderbilt University, who is directing the program.
 
'We Need a Single Overview'
''Customarily, people involved in fighting substance abuse usually work on individual piece,'' he said. ''They look at the elephant from their own perspectives, seeing the head or the tail. We need a single overview.''
Dr. Spikard said the planning would be done in each community by a coalition of educators, health officials, law-enforcement authorities and representatives of labor, business, religious organizations and government agencies.
Each place will receive $100,000 annually for planning work - some may require two years - and will be encouraged to seek more money from other foundations, business and government. Eight of the 15 will then be selected to receive $3 million each to continue developing their models.
Dr. Cluff said in Washington yesterday that if all 15 programs were deemed worthy they might each win additional money from the foundation, which has assets of nearly $2 billion.
The communities were selected on the recommendation of a national advisory committee headed by Dr. John Brademas, president of New York University.
 
U.S. to Announce Program
Next month the Federal Government will announce a substance abuse program that will provide a total of $50 million this year to help 150 communities. Many of the unsuccessful applicants for Johnson Foundation grants already are applying to the Federal Office for Substance Abuse Prevention, said Gale Held, director of the Division of Prevention Implementation.
She said that the government and foundation programs would be complementary, but that the Robert Wood Johnson venture was more comprehensive because it would provide for substance abuse treatment, not merely referral.
''We're impressed by what the foundation has put together,'' she said, ''assisting the communities in exactly what's needed,''
The foundation limited its selection to localities with a population of 100,000 to 250,000 - in some instances, one section of a large city was chosen - and sought to include diverse ethnic communities.
Four of the 15 localities are in California. In Vallejo, where drug arrests have increased 1,000 percent in seven years, the community will work in collaboration with the local Navy base, which already has an anti-drug program. In East Oakland, the prevention program will focus on schools and parks. In San Jose, the program will concentrate on the city's east side, home to large numbers of refugees from Southeast Asia and Latin America. In Santa Barbara, efforts will be made to combat alcohol abuse, particularly among pregnant women.
 
How the Programs Will Vary
The program for New Mexico will focus on alcohol abuse in the border towns surrounding the reservations where alcohol is banned. In West Charlotte, N.C., assistance will begin with help for those at high risk, like school dropouts, and expand to other groups. In an area of San Antonio, where there are no treatment centers, a comprehensive aid and follow-up program is planned. In Little Rock, Ark., neighborhood groups will be organized to conduct forums, marches and other activities. Milwaukee's program will focus on family needs in the central city.
In Kansas City, Mo., 100,000 residents will receive training in fighting drug abuse. In Columbia, S.C., nine groups are developing strategies to curb alcohol and drug abuse. In Washington the program will mobilize groups to develop preschool prevention activities in public housing projects and will involve business leaders in counseling youth.
Newark's program focuses on offering economic opportunities to reduce the allure of the drug trade in the city's poorest areas.
New Haven, which has high incidence of drug-related violence and pediatric AIDS, will receive help in reaching youth and women of child-bearing age with prevention and treatment.
In Worcester the program will try to enhance prevention for youth and families and test the benefits of offering incentives to keep patients in follow-up programs.

HEADLINE: Voice From Tiananmen Now Heard at Wellesley

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WELLESLEY, Mass., Feb. 20

 BODY:
The Wellesley College basketball coach had nothing but praise for her new point guard.
''She's poetry in motion on the break,'' Roxanne Dale said of her player, Cai Jinqing.
As recently as last June, Miss Cai had little time to practice her best shot, a three-pointer from the corner. Then, the shy, studious Miss Cai was a straight-A chemistry major at Beijing University and a spokeswoman for the student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. 
But after the People's Liberation Army moved into the square on June 4, killing hundreds of students and civilians, Miss Cai managed to escape and made her way to Boston, thanks to help from friends and relatives in America.
Miss Cai knows she was exceedingly lucky. Only a few of the student leaders were able to flee. Most were arrested, and many of her classmates at Beijing University are now faced with uncertain futures and long hours of political indoctrination.
 
Repercussions in Beijing
She still gets letters from friends at Beijing University. The entire freshman class has been kept at an army base for a year of political study. Under a new rule, graduating seniors will have to work for at least five years before being able to study abroad, the dream of many Chinese students. Many of the seniors, under suspicion by the Communist regime, are unable to find jobs.
''My friends say they have given up hope,'' Miss Cai said. ''After all the events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, they think China missed its chance to modernize and become democratic. They are all very depressed.''
This background of tragedy makes Miss Cai's rapid adjustment to life at Wellesley, one of the most prestigious and affluent women's colleges, all the more remarkable.
In her first semester last fall, the 20-year-old Miss Cai managed to get three A's and an A-minus, in her classes in economics, chemistry and art, all this without any special help in English, which she was using in class for the first time.
''She's a very smart woman,'' said Prof. Karl Case, who taught her in a class on microeconomics, her first economics course. ''I would hand out problem sets, and hers would be the best.''
 
Tiananmen Voice Recognized
Miss Cai's escape was engineered by one of her three older brothers, Cai Jinyong, a graduate student at Boston University. One day last May, watching the demonstrators in Tiananmen Square on television, he overheard what he thought was his sister's voice broadcasting by loudspeaker. Amazed and worried, he called his parents in Beijing, who confirmed Miss Cai was indeed participating in the protests.
So when the crackdown took place, he went to Boston University's president, John Silber, to ask for help. Waiving its usual requirements, the school granted her admission and a $10,000 scholarship. Her brother then rushed this paperwork by Federal Express to Beijing. At the same time, Miss Cai persuaded a sympathetic faculty member at Beijing University to write a letter vouching she had not participated in the demonstrations.
Armed with these documents, she got an exit permit from the Ministry of Public Security and a visa from the American Embassy.
But when she arrived in Boston, Professor Case happened to learn about Miss Cai from another Wellesley graduate, who had heard she was a star basketball player. An inveterate basketball fan, Professor Case arranged for her to tour the campus and try out in front of Ms. Dale, the coach. ''She canned three three-point shots, and we were convinced,'' Professor Case said.
But by then it was July and Wellesley's admissions process was closed. Complicating the situation, the school's president, Nannerl Keohane, was in Paris attending the 200th anniversary celebrations of the French Revolution.
 
Full Scholarship at Wellesley
So when Dr. Keohane returned, Professor Case greeted her at Logan Airport outside Boston with a report on Miss Cai. Soon Miss Cai found herself the recipient of a full $20,000 scholarship at Wellesley.
''It was very unusual, almost unprecedented,'' Dr. Keohane said of the school's action. ''But with memories of Tiananmen so fresh in our minds, we thought it was well worth it.''
Now Miss Cai faced a difficult choice, which school to choose. She felt a moral obligation to Boston University, but since she had no money of her own, the Wellesley offer solved her financial problem. To try to compensate, she took flowers to the officials at Boston University who had helped her.
At Wellesley, Miss Cai joins a long list of distinguished students from China. The first arrived in 1906, after a visit by senior officials of the Qing Dynasty, who came to inspect the school at the order of the Empress Dowager. Then there was also Soong Mei-ling, who went on to become Madame Chiang Kai-shek.

HEADLINE: Army Says Cuts May Mean Losing Some Officers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
The Army told Congress today that the Bush Administration's plan to shrink the military might force the Army to dismiss some career officers ''as a last resort.''
In its annual statement to Congress, the Army said that while it was committed to recruiting and retaining high-quality soldiers even as overall troop totals are reduced, it might have to dismiss some of the 375,000 career officers and noncommissioned officers.
Such reductions would be a new problem for the military. After World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, it was able to slim its ranks by turning loose thousands of draftees who were eager to re-enter the civilian economy. Today's soldiers and officers, however, are all volunteers, and for many the service is a career. 
The Army Secretary, Michael P. W. Stone, presented the statement in a closed hearing of the House Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Defense. Copies were issued at the Pentagon.
The other branches of the military said it was premature to discuss dismissals of career officers.
A spokeswoman for the Air Force, Lieut. Col. Peg Bowman, said: ''The Air Force hopes to accommodate the reductions in force through attrition, early-out programs, cutbacks in the number of people we are bringing in on active duty and of the number of civilians that we hire.''
A Marine Corps spokesman, Lieut. Col. Fred Peck, said: ''We don't anticipate any personnel cuts at this time. We have introduced a voluntary program where marines near the end of their period of enlistment can end their service up to 90 days in advance.''
In a statement, the Navy said it ''has worked very closely with Congress to protect personnel accounts from major cuts,'' and added, ''It would be premature to speculate on the impact to personnel until such time that Congress has made a final decision on the reprogramming.''

HEADLINE: Growers Reach for the Ballot in California Duel Over Pesticides

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb. 21

 BODY:
In a duel over pesticides that could have important implications for the rest of American agriculture, California growers today began collecting signatures for a ballot measure that they said would reform programs to protect food, water and farm workers from toxic chemicals.
The growers' measure comes in response to a separate ballot initiative proposed by environmental groups in October. That measure would gradually end 23 widely used farm chemicals by 1996 and transfer California's pesticide regulatory program from the state's Department of Food and Agriculture to the Department of Health Services.
The growers seek far less sweeping changes. If approved, their measure would increase penalties for unlawful use of pesticides. The growers said it would also expand the number of samples of fresh and processed food tested for residues of pesticides, establish panels of experts to study the hazards of pesticides and pay for research that would reduce or eliminate the use of some pesticides. 
Leaders of the farm groups said their measure is popular in California's Central Valley, the heart of the state's $16 billion farm industry, and expect to quickly collect the nearly 400,000 signatures needed to qualify it for the ballot in November.
 
The Importance of Pesticides
''Pesticides are a critical part of one of this state's most important industries,'' said Lee Stitzenberger, president of the Dolphin Group, a public relations company in Los Angeles that is managing the growers' campaign. ''Our reform proposal is based on sound scientific theories, not on scare tactics. In areas that we need more information to make decisions, we've proposed scientific panels to get the answers.''
Environmental leaders attacked the growers' proposal, calling it an effort to dupe voters and enable growers to continue using the most dangerous pesticides without interference. The real intent of the measure, they said, is approval of a provision in the growers' plan that says if both measures pass but the growers' initiative gains more votes, that plan will take effect.
''It's a classic fake reform,'' said Ralph E. Lightstone, a lawyer and pesticide policy specialist here with the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation. ''It rewrites dozens of sections of existing law without any substantive changes.''
Albert H. Meyerhoff, a lawyer in San Francisco with the Natural Resources Defense Council who is a co-author of the environmentalists' initiative, said: ''What the growers have proposed is a plan to continue the use of cancer-causing chemicals. They want to manage cancer, not prevent it.''
 
Similar Conflicts Elsewhere
At the center of both initiatives are conflicting views about the accuracy of scientific data on the hazards of farm chemicals and the adequacy of California's pesticide regulatory program. The same conflicts over science and regulation have risen in Washington, where a new farm policy law is under discussion, and in farm states like Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Texas and Wisconsin.
The outcome of the conflict in California, which in recent years has established most of the significant trends in pesticide regulation and in cultivation practices that reduce or eliminate pesticides, is almost certain to influence the debate elsewhere.
That facet of the dispute has not been lost on either side of the debate. Mr. Stitzenberger said the groups he represents, including the California Farm Bureau, the Western Growers Association, the California League of Food Processors and the California Cotton Growers Association, were prepared to spend millions of dollars on the campaign for their initiative.
''A lot of California farmers are already reducing their use of pesticides,'' said Jasper E. Hempel, a vice president for the Western Growers Association, a trade group based in Irvine, Calif., that represents fruit and vegetable farmers. ''But we are not going to let the environmental community put an arbitrary scientific standard on chemicals we can use.''
 
Separate Campaign Planned
Meanwhile, pesticide manufacturers are joining other industrial groups in planning a separate campaign against the environmentalists' measure. That campaign, also expected to cost millions of dollars, will be run by Woodward & McDowell, a political consulting group in Burlingame, Calif., which managed the campaign in 1984 to establish the state's lottery.
''We try not to telegraph what we're going to do,'' Jack S. McDowell, a partner in the firm, said in an interview Tuesday. ''But one feature of the campaign will be economics. People will know how costly the environmentalists' proposition will be to the state's economy.''
GRC Economics, a Washington-based consulting group under contract to the chemical companies, says the measures proposed by environmental groups to ban or restrict pesticides would lead to a 40 percent cut in the amount of fruits, vegetables, grain and cotton produced in California.
GRC Economics said late last year that the environmentalists' measure could lead to a $10 billion-a-year reduction in the state's economy by the end of the decade. Last month GRC revised the estimate of losses to $6 billion.
Mr. Meyerhoff was one of several environmental specialists who disputed both figures. For three decades, he said, farmers in California and elsewhere have predicted dire consequences each time a pesticide is removed from the market for safety reasons. ''It's never turned out to the be case,'' he asserted.
Mr. Meyerhoff also said some of the most successful and profitable farmers in California are those who produce food without pesticides.
''American farmers are being forced by consumers to consider more environmentally sound and safer agricultural practices,'' Mr. Meyerhoff said. ''These can be accomplished without severe economic pressure. We have the ability to turn the corner away from this chemical obsession in farming.''

HEADLINE: Why End Social Security to Save It?

 BODY:
The huge and growing surpluses in the Social Security trust fund make Congress uncomfortable. Some members don't like sitting on a large unclaimed pot of taxpayers' money. Others are angered by the use of a regressive payroll tax to pay the Government's bills. 
Representative John Porter, an Illinois Republican, offers a novel solution: Let workers own their own retirement accounts. He would return most of the present Social Security tax and then require workers to invest the rebated money in private savings accounts for their own retirement.
What would such privatization accomplish? First, it would eliminate the mammoth trust fund before Congress misuses the money. Second, the new investment would stimulate economic growth.
The idea is not as shrewd as it sounds. Sponsors are quick to advertise the benefits, loath to identify the costs. The omission is egregious because low-income families will bear those costs. Social Security skews benefits toward the needy. If the system is privatized, each family would fend for itself and the poor would be hurt.
Privatization attracts sponsors because of the forced new savings. Each worker's payroll tax would be cut, but so would his future retirement income. His private savings account would make up for the loss. That would be O.K. for the average taxpayer but it would mean a reduction for low-income families. Under the current system, those with low income would get less from a private savings account than they are currently scheduled to receive from Social Security.
And that's not the only loss involved. Many privatization plans would end other Social Security benefits like disability and survivors' insurance. A privatized plan would mean nothing to a young worker permanently disabled by injury or illness. The present Social Security system protects all such workers.
To his credit, Mr. Porter would overcome some of these problems. He would retain disability insurance and a minimum retirement benefit. But most low-income families would still do worse.
The most intriguing proposal has been made by Enid Borden and Bruce Schobel, both former high-level Social Security officials. They would return part of the payroll tax to workers. But unlike Mr. Porter, they would not reduce future benefits. The needy would be fully protected.
The drawback to this, and all privatization plans, is the fiscal reverberation. Giving workers back their Social Security tax would gut Federal revenue. To comply with Gramm-Rudman deficit targets while offsetting this precipitous decline, Congress would be forced to raise taxes and cut spending sharply.
In fact, the Borden-Schobel plan goes too far. It is, for one thing, an overly complicated way to raise the savings rate. The same goals could be more easily accomplished by revising the Gramm-Rudman target from zero to a surplus. Mr. Schobel argues that his way is better because Congress would find it easier to dodge new Gramm-Rudman targets than rebates to workers.
Schemes that sound too good to be true invariably are. Privatizing Social Security is no exception. It could raise the national savings rate. But that goal can be achieved in ways that don't devastate the elderly poor.

HEADLINE: A Worthy Setting for the Javits Center

 BODY:
New York City's Board of Estimate has a chance to make a good thing better today by approving a plan to rejuvenate the area around the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Four years after it opened, the Convention Center still sits in isolated splendor on Manhattan's West Side, surrounded by an uninviting mix of warehouses, parking lots, vacant land and commercial businesses, and a generous complement of prostitutes.
If the Board of Estimate approves the zoning changes, creating what's called a ''special district,'' the forbidding streets around the center would have a chance to come alive. The plan envisions a new hotel, a 49-story apartment building, plazas, trees and badly needed parking space - all without displacing anyone. 
The construction would generate jobs and transform a threatening wasteland into an inviting neighborhood that could only make the Convention Center itself more attractive. The center attracts three million visitors annually. But it is dark about 100 days a year, and operates at a loss. The center's health would surely improve if the area around it improved.
The City Planning Commission's plan for the special district has Mayor David Dinkins's endorsement. Other board members, though, have reservations. The new Manhattan Borough President, Ruth Messinger, is generally supportive. But she objects to the height of the apartment building, and worries that changing the neighborhood so fundamentally could displace nearby manufacturing jobs. Her concerns are worth the Planning Commission's attention and remedy, but are not worth sacrificing the entire proposal.
The Planning Commission has produced a good and thoughtful plan, one six years in the making. Even if the board gives its go-ahead, the city's fiscal dip may delay immediate development. But at the least, approval would set the stage for turning an ill-used piece of Manhattan into something of benefit to the entire city.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Ortega and Somoza

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
One Nicaraguan who believes that Violeta Chamorro actually may defeat the Sandinista President, Daniel Ortega, in Sunday's elections is Arturo Cruz Jr. - the son of a former presidential candidate, a former Sandinista himself, but also a former contra and national security assistant in the Reagan White House.
Few observers and not many more Nicaraguans agree; a final Washington Post/ABC News survey, for instance, gives Mr. Ortega a 48-to-32-percent lead, with 16 percent undecided or keeping mum. Mr. Cruz himself doubts that the unexpected victory he thinks possible would be the best thing for his country.
In a recent talk at the Americas Society in New York he suggested, but stopped short of predicting, that Mrs. Chamorro, the presidential candidate of a united opposition, could win because of respect for her prominent family, the disastrous economic decline of Nicaragua under the Sandinistas and her hard-hitting ''message'' - which he paraphrased as: ''We are fed up with Sandinistas, contras and the war.'' 
In a country where half or more of the population is under 30, with young men subject to the military draft, that could be an effective appeal. Even the U.S. invasion of Panama, as Mr. Cruz sees it, might help rather than hurt Mrs. Chamorro; it could encourage her supporters to vote, in the belief that if the election were stolen, the U.S. would come to her rescue as it claims to have done for Guillermo Endara in Panama.
Nevertheless, if Mrs. Chamorro should win against the odds, Mr. Cruz said, ''I think we are in trouble.''
A Chamorro victory, in his analysis, would force the Bush Administration to pour economic aid into Nicaragua; but such aid could not be effective because the country has suffered a massive loss of its ''human capital'' - half a million skilled artisans, professionals and managers who have fled a repressive regime.
''Money capital'' alone will not be able to redeem the Nicaraguan economy, Mr. Cruz predicted, and a Chamorro government would be blamed for continuing poverty and stagnation. Besides, he believes, the Sandinistas would have to yield the official government to her, but would manage to retain their control of the armed forces and thus keep a considerable hold on power.
A sizable victory for Mr. Ortega would not, on the other hand, constitute a Communist triumph. Instead, he sees Daniel Ortega as having converted the Sandinistas from ''a party of ideology'' bent on imposing a Marxist program to an ''electoral party'' organized to win elections and keep power.
On Feb. 14, The Miami Herald - a close observer of Central America -expressed a somewhat similar view, noting that ''Nicaragua has taken important steps toward a much more open and less repressive society than existed there just one year ago.'' One step cited was the release earlier this month of 1,033 political prisoners; another was the ''relative ease with which opposition parties have been allowed to organize and campaign.''
Daniel Ortega himself, The Herald commented, is ''behaving like a Western-style politician: trading his guerrilla outfit for civilian clothes, kissing babies on the campaign trail, and making substantial political concessions.''
Mr. Cruz dates the change from 1984, when Mr. Ortega was reaffirmed in power and the militant Tomas Borge (''the last believer'') was weakened. Now, Mr. Cruz thinks, ''Sandinismo is withering away'' as a Marxist-Leninist party; Mr. Ortega and his brother, Humberto, are moving instead toward a ''family over party'' regime similar to the Somoza dictatorship the Sandinistas overthrew in 1979, and one sadly familiar in Latin America.
Such a regime, in Mr. Cruz's judgment, can only make of Nicaragua another ''banana republic,'' with the processes of democracy and growth that once appeared possible having disappeared with the flight of so much ''human capital.'' Exports, for only one example, have fallen from $780 million in 1978 to only about $200 million expected in 1990.
Mr. Cruz does not expect Election-Day fraud, owing to the presence of effective international observer teams; but he believes Sandinista intimidation tactics during the campaign may have a substantial delayed effect on the outcome. True to his mixed political history, he also hopes for a mixed result in the voting - an Ortega victory by no more than 5 to 10 points.
An election that close, he believes, would force a coalition ''cabinet of national reconstruction'' including Violeta Chamorro and the united opposition parties. And that, Mr. Cruz claims to know, is also the secret best hope of the Bush Administration.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Drug War Victories

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
At the United Nations, in the vast hall of the General Assembly, one delegate after another gets up and announces how much his country hates narcotics.
The representatives of the big powers speak. So do representatives of countries whose yearly budgets do not amount to the value of the cocaine seized in one raid at one big drug warehouse in Los Angeles.
Mostly the speeches are lead dumplings, clunky with cliches; the ear glazes over. It seems like just one more talktalktalk U.N. meeting among more than 40 years of talktalktalk meetings. 
Then the realization comes that this week something important is going on at the U.N. That happens every once in a great while, maybe once a decade.
Some human issue, some human problem or yearning, becomes so important to the emotions of so many people that governments feel they must meet to be heard in support -even if they lack the money or influence or intent to do much about it.
Human rights was such an issue. So were hunger and the condition of women. The speeches of the delegates then were often hypocritical or meaningless.
Whole nations still starve. The brave are still tortured and imprisoned in dozens of countries. In the Middle East and Africa young women are still put under the knife for clitoral circumcision as they enter the flower of their youth.
But the fact that the governments represented at the United Nations, varied in virtue and villainy as they may be, feel they have to meet in special session to take up a human issue means something. It means they acknowledge that the concern has become a consensus beyond borders with a political potency that no longer can be ignored.
In that sense, a victory for political decency takes place at the United Nations.
And, almost unnoticed, a victory for cultural decency has taken place in the United States that is important in our own war against drugs.
The huge majority of this country's people have decided drug abuse is neither chic, amusing, sexy nor socially titillating but, in fact, rather disgusting. The popular decision -not unanimous, but strong - is that anybody who glamorizes drugs is not only a fool but a bore.
Proof is fairly simple. The attitude is now so widespread that our sensitive cultural delegates - the people who turn out movies, ads, TV series, lyrics and records - recognize its political and economic power.
Certainly we still have smirky, drug-loving rhymes from some of the rap-talkers, a more accurate description than rap musicians, and from time to time a sly reference to drugs in a rock record. But lyrics admiring drugs are no longer routinely expected or passively accepted.
And when was the last time you saw one of those once-endemic movies glorifying the drugginess of bikers or beatniks? Lord, how old-fashioned and dreary their self-pity seems now.
The growing revulsion and deglamorization of drugs comes mostly from common sense inducing common revulsion - too many lives are being lost or ruined for drug abusers to be entertaining anymore.
Particularly unamusing are well-off ''leisure'' abusers who provide most of the money that buys the guns and bullets for the drug killers.
Most sponsors and producers are grasping this, some because they don't see big profit in druggy entertainment but many others simply because they feel their own children endangered.
But many individual Americans, one by one, have actively helped arouse public disgust with drug criminality and abuse - preachers, teachers, mayors and members of Congress, professionals and volunteers in anti-drug programs of almost every industry.
And while we are at it, it would not hurt at all to acknowledge the work of William J. Bennett and the people who work with him, a professional, talented, drug-fighting team.
Professional drug fighters are realistic enough to know the distances yet to go to provide enough treatment slots for addicts, enough research money, enough police, enough Presidential attention to tie-ins between Americans and drug runners, such as the Honduran connection, detailed by James LeMoyne in The New York Times and by Mort Rosenblum in the current Vanity Fair.
But it is also realistic to acknowledge that, once in awhile, a victory in the struggle does creep up on us -whether in the General Assembly or in our national mind.
So a moment off for a tiny pat on the back, ours and the U.N.'s, then back to closing the distances.

Albany Redux: Faith and Politics Are in Conflict

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
''I'm a good Catholic,'' the Governor of New York, in the privacy of his Albany office, reminded a ranking Roman Catholic clergyman as they debated a proposed constitutional amendment.
''I'm bound to obey the Holy Father, and I'm bound to obey you in all matters of faith and morals,'' he said.
''But there's nothing in the law of the church that says I have to obey the church in matters that are economic, social or political. No, Father. That's not a part of the duty of the church to tell me that.'' 
''Any time you come to me on a matter of faith or morals where I've been wrong, you can be sure I'll go along with you, but this belongs to me. This is the Governor of the State of New York's duty, and it belongs to me. It doesn't belong to anybody else.''
The issue was children. The Governor was Alfred E. Smith. He was arguing for a Federal child labor law; leading Catholic clergymen were warning that government regulation would violate the sanctity of the family.
Sixty-five years later, the conflict between a Catholic public official's personal beliefs and his perception of his public responsiblity is reverberating in the conflict between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and his church over abortion. Last month, Bishop Austin Vaughan, an auxiliary bishop of the New York Archdiocese, warned that Mr. Cuomo was ''in serious risk of going to hell'' because of his support for abortion rights. On Tuesday, Thomas V. Daily, the new Roman Catholic Bishop of the Brooklyn Diocese, in which Mr. Cuomo was raised, said he would bar the Governor from speaking at local churches. Invitations from several are pending; Mr. Cuomo is offering the parishes the opportunity to reconsider.
''We have a political difference,'' Mr. Cuomo said yesterday. ''The difference between me and the Bishop is a political one, not a theological one.''
In 1984, the Governor took a calculated political risk when John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, publicly questioned the logic of public officials who claim to be personally opposed to abortion, yet are unwilling to impose their personal views on their constituents. He suggested that Catholics could not in good conscience vote for candidates who explicitly support a woman's right to abortion.
Rebutting the Cardinal, Mr. Cuomo declared that Catholics should practice the compassion that their church preaches by setting an example, not by passing laws. Last month, though, he responded to Bishop Vaughan by turning the other cheek. On Tuesday, the Governor was slapped again.
But it would be wrong to interpret his reticience this time as acquiesence.
He is hoping that the new Bishop becomes better attuned to the political mood of a state where the Legislature, presumably reflecting public sentiment, seems unlikely to limit abortion rights. It is not he who has strayed from the mainstream, the Governor figures, but the church hierarchy.
Mr. Cuomo is also preparing to confront the conflict publicly, as he did in 1984, if the new Bishop persists in ostracizing the Diocese's most prominent Catholic elected official (and in reviving, in the minds of some, the historic tension between clergymen of Irish descent and their Italian-American co-religionists).
That confrontation is likely to focus on apparent contradictions, rather than on the clergy's right to speak: Is every Catholic who declines to translate private beliefs based on church teaching into civic law a sinner? If abortion is not merely a Catholic issue, then are non-Catholic politicians condemned to hell, too? What about officials who would permit abortion in cases of rape or incest? Or those who vote for a budget that pays for family planning clinics that dispense contraceptives? From what level of church teaching are lawmakers allowed to deviate?
Meanwhile, the Governor, again confounding his critics, is embracing a middle ground in which more of his constituents might find comfort - promoting alternatives to abortion, like sex education, abstinence, contraceptives and adoption, and championing children's rights beyond the womb.
This latest conflict between a governor and his church differs in some respects from the one 65 years ago. Opposition to child labor laws then was generated by individual clergymen, not by church doctrine. But there may be parallels, too.
When the visiting cleric left Governor Smith's office, which was adorned with a picture of the Pope, Smith turned to Frances Perkins of the State Industrial Commission and said: ''He don't mean any harm. If he knew what you and I know he couldn't talk like that. How would he get to know? There's no way he can know.''

HEADLINE: United Way to Aid Smaller Agencies

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Under criticism for supporting only long-established charities, United Way of New York City expects to devote $70 million in the next five years to bolstering scores of small local agencies that help jobless youth, illiterate adults, AIDS patients, victims of domestic violence and the homeless.
United Way officials say they will also increase financing for agencies working to reduce racial tensions and curb crime in the city.
But the officials said that the fiscal changes would not mean a reduction in allocations to the older organizations, like the Red Cross and the American Cancer Society. Rather, they said that an anticipated 5 percent annual growth from United Way fund-raising campaigns would be used to help support the small agencies. 
''We are not trying to be a civil-rights organization, but we can build bridges between the business leaders who serve on our board and the communities in our city,'' said Ralph Dickerson Jr., president of the city United Way since 1988. He said the program is an effort to reach New York City's most under-served people.
 
Grants Pay the Rent
United Way leaders emphasized that their grants pay the rent, light and heat bills and so enable hundreds of local agencies operating under city contracts, to deliver services.
Under the new initiative, money will be given to agencies that handle any one of eight problems: AIDS, crime, drug abuse, family violence, homelessness, illiteracy, racial tensions and youth unemployment.
Under the planned allocation, United Way expects its 1990 net campaign proceeds to reach $51.2 million and will provide $6.5 million for the eight priorities. By 1995, United Way expects its income to reach $65.4 million and to allocate $20 million.
United Way of New York City is one of the largest of the country's 2,300 independent United Way affiliates and its program to reach the smaller agencies could influence other affiliates to do the same, said Tom Nunan, vice president of United Way of America.
 
Federation of Service Agencies
In the New York region in the last several years, United Way affiliates have been increasing their support for the homeless and for programs concerning AIDS, drug addiction and illiteracy, said Janet Weinstein, senior vice president of United Way of Tri-State, which represents 36 independent United Way organizations in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
The New York City organization has already designated some money under the new program. A $100,000 grant, for example, will help the city's fast-growing Asian population create a federation of service agencies comparable to the federations that link Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, black and Hispanic agencies - all recipients of United Way money. In addition, $480,000 will go to improve the management and fund-raising methods of Associated Black Charities, a seven-year-old federation of 59 agencies.
Unspecified sums will help agencies working in racially tense neighborhoods, Mr. Dickerson said. For example, he said, more money will be channeled to agencies working with teen-agers on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and in the South Bronx.
United Way collects contributions from corporations, foundations and individuals participating in payroll-deduction programs. By long-standing custom it shares part of its proceeds with five established agencies, or ''partners'' - the American Red Cross, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the Salvation Army and the United Hospital Fund. Under a 10-year-old formula, the five share 48 percent of United Way's net campaign collections.
 
Growing Minority Population
The United Way of New York City campaign raised $72 million last year, and after expenses, divided $51.2 million among the 400 United Way members, including the religious federations. The Red Cross received the largest share, $12.4 million.
Some critics of the disbursement system complain that dividing funds by formula has slighted organizations representing the city's growing minority population, many created in the last decade.
''African-Americans and minorities need to build their own independent philanthropic organizations to meet the needs of their communities,'' said Kermit Eady, president of the Black United Fund, which declined United Way membership and raises its own funds. David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society, noted that United Way's critics have questioned whether the existing sharing formula met the greatest needs of those living in poverty.
But Mr. Dickerson defended the partnership arrangement, arguing that the Red Cross and Salvation Army were major providers of shelters and services for the poor.

HEADLINE: Bishop Mugavero Sees Liberal Legacy

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
The day after Pope John Paul II appointed a new, self-proclaimed conservative bishop to head the Diocese of Brooklyn, the departing bishop said that he was confident that his liberal legacy would continue in the diocese.
''It's not one person'' who sets the tone, Bishop Francis J. Mugavero said in an interview yesterday.
''And, remember, most of the priests and the religious and the lay people in the diocese were born in Kings and Queens,'' he added, using the official names of the counties that make up the two-borough Diocese of Brooklyn. ''It's in the blood.'' 
Since the appointment on Tuesday of his successor, Bishop Thomas V. Daily of Palm Beach, Fla., some Brooklyn Roman Catholics have expressed concern that their long-independent diocese would become subservient to its larger neighbor, the Archdiocese of New York, and its powerful leader, John Cardinal O'Connor.
 
Playing Down Differences
Bishop Daily, who has already criticized Gov. Mario M. Cuomo for his support for abortion rights, has expressed views closer to those of the Cardinal than Bishop Mugavero.
Bishop Daily, who spent most of his career in Boston, was appointed despite Bishop Mugavero's publicly stated preference for a successor ''who knows the territory.''
But in the interview, Bishop Mugavero, who has reached the mandatory retirement age of 75, minimized both the geographical and ideological differences between himself and Bishop Daily.
He said that he was confident that the diocese, with 1.6 million Catholics, was ''in good hands'' with Bishop Daily at the helm.
 
Similarities to Boston
''He had a great experience in Boston,'' Bishop Mugavero said. ''Boston is very similar to Brooklyn.''
He noted that like Brooklyn and Queens, Boston has a multi-ethnic population, large poverty-ridden pockets and racial divisions. ''He grew up in that atmosphere. He understands it.''
''He's smart, you know,'' the Bishop added. ''He can pick things up. He has good experience up there.''
As for the liberal-conservative contrast that has been drawn between them, Bishop Mugavero said the labels were insufficient to encapsulate issues that are far more complex. ''In terms of Catholic doctrine and faith, it's conservative,'' he said, ''but in terms of human services, you've got to be liberal.''
 
Wide-Ranging Issues
As Catholic bishops, both Bishop Mugavero and Bishop Daily are members of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, a body of 300 prelates who try to help apply Catholic teachings to the particular needs of Americans. The bishops have made a wide range of public statements on issues like abortion, homosexuality, AIDS, nuclear war and the American economy. While Bishop Mugavero has been associated with the liberal wing of the conference, Bishop Daily is regarded as a conservative.
At a news conference in Brooklyn on Tuesday, Bishop Daily embraced the conservative label and confirmed it when he said that he would bar Governor Cuomo from speaking in the diocese's 220 churches because of his views on abortion. The Governor has said that as a Catholic, he is opposed to abortion, but does not want to impose his views on others.
During his 22 years as bishop, Bishop Mugavero has written more than 20 official statements, known as ''pastoral letters,'' strongly condemning abortion. But, an aide said, his comments on abortion to Governor Cuomo and other Catholic politicians have been made in private rather than in public forums.
A review of Bishop Mugavero's tenure as Bishop shows that he has been involved in a number of issues.
 
Advocate for the Poor
He deplored ''racially motivated violence'' after the much-publicized racial murders in Bensonhurst and Howard Beach. He founded the Campaign for Human Development, a national fund-raising drive for self-help poverty programs, and was one of the founders of the Nehemiah housing program, which enables the poor to buy their own homes.
He also founded the first diocesan office to provide spiritual and social assistance to new immigrants. And has been a vigorous advocate for the rights of undocumented aliens.
Bishop Mugavero has been a strident voice for priestly celibacy, but he has maintained friendly relationships with priests who have left their parishes to marry.
He has been a strong advocate of keeping families together, but he has been understanding of families in distress. As a result, he has used the canons of the church to grant annulments where they are permitted. His diocesan tribunal, which rules on annulments, is one of the best staffed and most efficient in the nation.
When he ventured into politics, he was bipartisan. In 1973, for example, he wrote an open letter to the four New York City candidates for mayor saying that the city suffers from ''Manhattanopia,'' a syndrome that results, he said, in an excessive focus on one borough, often to the exclusion of the rest.
In his retirement, Bishop Mugavero will continue to live in the official residence in the Fort Greene section that he has occupied for 22 years. Bishop Daily will live in a nearby rectory next to the headquarters of the Brooklyn Diocese.
''It's better that way,'' Bishop Mugavero said.

HEADLINE: Architect's Challenge: Making 60 Rooms Cozy

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN

 BODY:
EVEN its architect cannot seem to keep the number of rooms straight. ''I think there are about 60 of them, and 11 or 12 bathrooms,'' Francis C. Klein said of the mammoth private house that he has just completed on a 13-acre property in Fairfield County, Conn.
''What I do know,'' added the architect, who is based in Montclair, N.J., ''is that the house is as long as a New York City block.''
Three floors high, 200 feet long and 21,000 square feet in all, the house was completed last December after a two-and-a-half-year haul: six months to design it, two years to build it. Among its rooms are a squash court, a ballet studio, a dining room for 18, two laundry rooms, a 24-foot-square kitchen, and stair landings big enough to double as children's play areas. 
A recent inventory placed the number of telephones, each with 20 lines, at 50. ''They may get more,'' Mr. Klein said. And this is just a weekend and summer home.
''The only new house that I ever heard of on the East Coast that's bigger is Ivan Lendl's and that included an indoor basketball court,'' Mr. Klein said. Yet this house is about a third the size of the Aaron Spelling's two-year-old Hollywood mansion, which is 65,000 square feet. And it has about half as many rooms as Mar-a-Lago, Donald and Ivana Trump's home in Palm Beach, Fla.
Mr. Klein is no novice to large scale. He said he built about a half-dozen ''pretty large houses, 4,000 to 5,000 square feet, in the Hamptons.'' He said ''a normal house is about 2,000 square feet, and a big house in the New Jersey suburbs is 3,000 square feet.''
The clients, who want to remain anonymous, rent an apartment in New York City. The husband is a commodities broker and squash champion; the wife recently stopped working in his business to take care of their three daughters, all 6 years old or younger. Two older girls from his previous marriage visit often.
The architect said of his clients: ''He is New York and Brooklyn, and Coney Island is especially important to him. She likes simple things - large and simple things.
''She showed me clippings of English country and Shaker houses. He clipped Colorado ranches. I came out of a more shingle-style background.''
Mr. Klein worked for I. M. Pei & Partners in New York before opening his own firm five years ago. Two staff architects, Susan Guppy and Tim Fleck, worked on the project.
At a time when most architects are battling the problems of tiny spaces, Mr. Klein had the dubious privilege of designing a house that would look and feel smaller than it is.
''I call that a real challenge,'' admitted Mr. Klein, whose wife is the owner's sister. ''It was hard to make it human, and it's still pretty hard to comprehend the whole thing.
''Lots of light, big rooms and places to run around were my instructions. They're very informal, active people. Not tuxedo party types.''
Like the proverbial Topsy, the house just seemed to grow and grow. ''We realized pretty early on that it was very, very big,'' he said. ''It was my job to make it work.'' On the exterior, the house looks like a series of cozily scaled buildings - a mini-Main Street. The look is part hunting lodge, part Western ranch, part English country and part Alpine chalet, with touches of Shaker simplicity - a hard-won synthesis of what the clients had in mind.
The house is set on a hill and approached along a winding unpaved road that weaves through heavy woods. The final approach is surprisingly approachable; one could even call the 200-foot-long facade with robin's-egg blue trim quaint.
''Siting was very important,'' Mr. Klein said. ''If you arrived head-on, instead of at an angle, it would have been overpowering.''
The house is clad with Connecticut stone and tongue-and-groove vertical cedar siding with a copper-colored pigmented stain. The wood-shingle roofs are edged in copper, and the drainpipes are copper. The elements of the facade are connected with flagstone and fretwork-trimmed porches (''They had just been to Austria and brought back some pictures of chalets for me to think about,'' Mr. Klein said), and enlivened with what seems to be a catalogue's worth of bay, double-hung, casement and sliding windows and skylights.
''One of the basic concepts was to find a balance between coherence and variety,'' the architect said. ''Although all the normal family relationships take place - for example, keeping an eye on the kids, cooking, entertaining - everything is far.''
The architect compensated by balancing the 150-foot-long hallways with 8 1/2-, 10 1/2- and 20-foot-high ceilings and grouping the myriad windows in inventive configurations. ''Everything is overscale,'' the architect said.
Even the architectural drawings had to be printed on paper measuring three by four feet to be workable. ''When I first showed them to the structural engineer,'' Mr. Klein recalled, ''he thought I had the scale marked wrong on the drawings.''
Four 10 1/2-foot-high Tuscan pine columns define the marble-floored entrance hall, which opens to a 20-foot-high room. ''That's the family room,'' Mr. Klein said. ''There is no room called a living room in the house. This is a very child-oriented family. They don't sit around much.''
For the time being, that's just as well, as the house is essentially unfurnished. Recently a dozen beds were delivered; delivery trucks pull up often. But many rooms are still filled with boxes.
In the 24-by-40-foot music room, there is not only a grand piano but a sampling of the owners' collection of musical antiques, a pinball machine and a vintage jukebox. ''A merry-go-round will probably be next,'' Mr. Klein said.
Only the kitchen and the library are complete. In the library, glass-topped cases hold rare books, while floor-to-ceiling shelves are lined with titles that range from ''How to Design and Build Your Own Home,'' and ''How to Teach Your Baby to Swim'' to ''Boy Broker'' and ''Jefferson at Monticello.''
Piles of children's books surround the window seat. ''They really want to encourage reading,'' Mr. Klein said. A staircase leads to the children's wing on the second floor.
He added that inside, orientation was the major issue. ''Even the contractors - 'It's not a house, but an inn,' remarked one - had to think about it by areas,'' said the architect, who was concerned with providing the occupants and their visitors with visual cues. ''This can get very confusing, especially for small children.''
Mr. Klein said construction costs were in the $150-a-square-foot range.
''That's good quality, middle-of-the-road domestic construction,'' said Mr. Klein. ''Luxury building can be double or more. And there are some economies of scale. You pay for the truck whether you buy 3 or 250 windows.''
One potentially astronomical operating expense is air-conditioning. ''They hate it and will never use it,'' Mr. Klein said. ''But they put it in, in case they ever decide to sell the house.''
For the family's use, the architect installed about two dozen ceiling fans. Twenty transom windows, operated by two manual cranks, also provide ventilation. ''Just like in old schoolhouses,'' Mr. Klein said.
The architect also provided two exits for each of the eight second-floor bedrooms, ''in case of a fire,'' he said. ''The balconies, which are both exits and play areas, became an important design element.''
Most of the woodwork in the house is standard-issue including the main staircase with its 60-foot-long balustrade and 200 Shaker-style spindles. But the kitchen cabinets were custom made of cherry, with 110 Shaker style knobs.
Doors, bathroom sinks and tiles were all off-the-rack items. ''That was our attempt to be reasonable,'' Mr. Klein said. ''We didn't ransack the earth to get anything unusual.''
Nevertheless, the quantities are mind-boggling: 14,000 square feet of oak flooring, 1,000 square feet of floor tile, 1,000 square feet of marble tile, 1,000 light fixtures, close to 200 doors and 250 windows.
''That was a nice order,'' Mr. Klein said. ''I think the company sent me a monogrammed pen for specifying their product.''

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
Purchase of Cummins Stake Looks Less Sacrificial Now

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
When the family that founded the Cummins Engine Company bought out an unwelcome suitor last July, family members made much of the fact that the $72 million they had personally paid Hanson P.L.C. for its 10 percent stake was $5 million more than the going price.
''We ate the premium,'' boasted William I. Miller, a 33-year-old descendant of the family that put the world's largest independent maker of diesel engines on the map 70 years ago. ''It was not a very 80's thing to do,'' he added.
The story of their apparent sacrifice played well to a public hungry for examples showing the vulnerability of corporations and their financial backers in an age of easy takeovers and short-term profiteers. Hanson is a British conglomerate well known as a corporate raider. Statements at the time by the family patriarch, J. Irwin Miller, the 80-year-old retired chairman of the diesel-engine maker, reinforced the feeling that the family was taking a stand against a Wall Street driven by institutional investors preoccupied with quarterly gains. 
But the deal has returned to haunt the company and the three members of the Miller family. A large dissident shareholder of Cummins, Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., challenged the transaction's fairness in a suit it filed last week in Federal District Court in Indianapolis. In the suit, Industrial Equity contends that the Miller family was motivated by greed, not by charity, and that Cummins used the Miller family to disguise what was, in fact, ''greenmail,'' the use of shareholder money to buy off an unwanted predator.
Cummins's advisers declined to comment yesterday on the allegations because of the suit, and William Miller's secretary said he was out of the office and unavailable for comment.
But a closer look at the transaction shows that the family, while easing fears that an American institution and its community might fall into unfriendly foreign hands, bought the Hanson stake only to divest itself of its entire stock holdings immediately in exchange for an enviable package of new securities issued by Cummins.
The result should earn the Millers millions of dollars in annual profits that they would not have received otherwise.
In trying to force a public re-evaluation of the transaction, Industrial Equity faces some hurdles, not the least of which is the written opinion Cummins secured from its advisers at Morgan Stanley & Company attesting to the deal's fairness.
In addition, more than one United States company has paid greenmail to Industrial Equity, itself controlled by Brierley Investments Ltd., a New Zealand corporation. The practice of paying greenmail is legal but questionable, and it does not make the recipient too popular. Nor will it help Industrial Equity's case that it waited seven months before challenging the fairness of the July transaction. Bruce Hancox, a senior official at Industrial Equity, said the delay was largely to avoid impairing his company's campaign to secure a seat on Cummins's board.
But Industrial Equity's track record as a corporate raider and its slowness in challenging the transaction do not undermine its contention that the deal was generous to the Millers, and many securities analysts, traders and economic experts who reviewed the terms agree with it.
''They got themselves into a much better position than they were before,'' said George Froley, managing director of the Froley, Revy Investment Company, a Los Angeles money management firm that specializes in stocks and bonds that can be converted into other securities.
In fact, the experts say, the two-step deal should have raised red flags almost immediately. ''Anytime you have a large holder surrendering his equity stake and taking back securities, I think you want to look very closely at the terms of those securities to see if he might have gotten a substantial premium for his holdings,'' said John Finnerty, a professor of finance at Fordham University who specializes in securities innovation.
Complexity certainly helped obscure the true pricing of the Cummins deal with Hanson. Before the deal, the Miller family owned 580,269 Cummins shares, representing a 5 percent stake. In July, the family bought Hanson's 1.043 million shares for an average price of $69.33 a share - $4.83 above Cummins's $64.50 share price at the time.
Had the Millers stopped there, they would have insulated Cummins's management from charges of paying greenmail while boldly displaying their own vote of confidence in Cummins by increasing their exposure to the ups and downs of its stock.
But that did not appear to be their intention, as is clear from the back end of the transaction. The same day they purchased the Hanson stake, the Millers swapped their new-total holdings of 1.6 million common shares for a $104.7 million package of Cummins securities. Some securities were labeled subordinated debt and some were called preferred stock for Cummins's tax purposes, but they were otherwise identical - and equally generous to the Millers.
For one thing, the securities yield 10 percent annually, 6.6 percentage points more than the 3.4 percent that Cummins's common stock was yielding last July. Over five years, that fatter income stream will put $52.4 million into the Millers' pockets, versus the $17.6 million in dividends they would have been entitled to as owners of 1.6 million common shares. The $34.8 million differential might even be understated if continued losses and heavy capital spending force Cummins to cut its common dividend, as some analysts fear.
Then, at the end of five years, when the securities mature, the Millers can expect to receive at a minimum $104.7 million in cash, when the company redeems their holdings for 100 cents on the dollar, so long as the company is still a going concern. The Millers could do even better. Their securities are convertible at $83.85 a share, which means that they can turn their convertible stake into 1.248 million common shares in lieu of demanding that their $104.7 million holdings be redeemed at face value should Cummins's stock price soar.
This bit of financial engineering gives the Millers protection from loss in return for sacrificing only some of their potential gains. In effect they purchased a ''put option,'' giving them the right to sell their shares back to the company at a fixed price at the end of five years. That explains why the company's stock plunged right after the three-way deal was announced: the company's most influential investor had essentially moved from a bullish position on the company's stock to a hedged position.
The Millers' strategy would backfire only if the common stock, now at $45.875, surpassed its all-time high of $94.75.
''You've got to have fairly high appreciation in the common stock in order for the common stock to be the better alternative,'' Professor Finnerty said. ''There's that possibility, but a rational investor would probably take the 10 percent yield that goes with the convertible securities.''
Indeed, it is hard not to find the convertible securities the more attractive alternative. The Millers are poised to enjoy a fatter and more secure dividend income and to avoid losses on their stock holdings if the stock plunges. If the company gets into deep financial trouble, the Millers will also receive some preference over the common stockholders.
Given all that, the $5 million premium begins looking like a fairly cheap price to have paid for the privilege of being freed from the risks of a struggling company. Other shareholders will face all the fury of a fluctuating stock price.

HEADLINE: U.S. Policy On Deposits Is Criticized

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said today that regulators were searching for ways to permit very large banks to fail without the Government bailing out all depositors and creditors who might face losses.
Mr. Seidman said the regulatory policy under which the Government provides full protection for institutions it considers ''too big to fail'' had become too expensive.
That policy reflects the view of many regulators that many of the largest banks and savings and loans cannot be dissolved because they are so large that such action would create huge losses to uninsured depositors and send shocks through stock and credit markets.
 
Full-Coverage Policy
So the Government now routinely steps in to assure depositors that they will be covered for their full deposits. 
In effect, this policy has created unlimited depositors' insurance at the large institutions, in contrast to most Federally insured banks and savings and loan institutions, where depositors are guaranted against losses of up to $100,000.
Testifying before the House Banking Committee, Mr. Seidman suggested that the policy should change.
''You are going to have to have a system in which depositors at all institutions can lose something,'' Mr. Seidman said, adding that drains on the F.D.I.C.'s resources in recent years had led him to conclude that ''we have to find some way to reduce the risk and losses from deposit insurance.''
 
Congressional Consideration
To bring about the change Mr. Seidman is contemplating, regulators could simply adopt policies that abandon the ''too big to fail'' approach. Acknowledging that such a change would have broad and unknown effects on the financial markets and on investors, Mr. Seidman suggested today that such a step would be more appropriate for Congress.
But he cautioned that any change in how collapses are handled should retain protections against disruption of the financial markets.
Mr. Seidman said the F.D.I.C. had not agreed on any one approach to changing current policy, which was adopted in 1984 when regulators decided to cover all deposits and creditors at the Continental Bank and Trust Company in Chicago, rather than risk a financial panic.
Richard G. Darman, the President's budget director, warned earlier this month that shakiness in vast areas of Government guarantees and insurance were almost certain to cost taxpayers ''tens of billions of dollars,'' and that measures had to be taken to reduce the taxpayers' exposure to such losses.
Since deposit insurance covers more than $3 trillion of funds at commercial banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions, it is at the core of concern about the potential liability to taxpayers.
 
Shift in Stance
Mr. Seidman has repeatedly told Congress in his four and a half years as F.D.I.C. chief that he saw no way around the ''too big to fail'' policy. But today, he noted that covering all depositors and most creditors in large bank failures has created by far the largest losses at the F.D.I.C.
The savings and loan bailout signed by the President last summer calls for spending $159 billion over the next 10 years to shut and sell hundreds of sick institutions. But lawmakers then did not address the deposit insurance crisis and how it has contributed to the increased risk-taking by some banks that landed them into deep trouble. Instead, the Treasury was directed to conduct an 18-month study on deposit insurance. Comments are to be submitted by the end of next month.
Financial experts have noted that in the early and mid-1980's, savings associations made extremely risky investments in raw land and building projects. To attract money to make such loans, the institutions offered high interest rates on deposits, gaining billions of dollars almost overnight. But in the end they had large losses.
 
Risks Often Ignored
Depositors who know they are backed by Federal insurance have little incentive to discriminate between conservative, well-run banks and high-flying, poorly run ones. This means that deposits flow to the highest payer, regardless of risk, and losses are borne by the Govenrment, and ultimately the taxpayer.
''Without any market penalties for assuming more risk,'' Mr. Seidman added, banks are actually encouraged to do keep doing so.
The ''too big'' policy has irked thousands of small bankers around the country for years. They argue that there is a double standard, since, when some of their members have become insolvent, the F.D.I.C. has observed its limits on covering deposits.
Mr. Seidman, who has been sympathetic to this argument, has said that the F.D.I.C. has tried to prevent depositors at small banks from losing by pushing hard to find buyers for the entire bank. But that policy has not always worked, and the F.D.I.C. has had to liquidate some small banks, forcing some depositors to take losses.
 
Several Proposals Studied
Mr. Seidman said the F.D.I.C. was studying several proposals. One would impose an immmediate 10 percent loss on all uninsured deposits when a bank failed, essentially returning 90 cents on every uninsured dollar. Another plan calls for the banking industry to establish its own form of private deposit insurance to cover amounts above $100,000.
Mr. Seidman said deposit insurance reform was vital if the Bank Insurance Fund, which insures deposits at commercial banks, was to remain solvent over the long term.
He said its reserves were close to an all-time low relative to total deposits insured, and that if the banking industry saw a repeat of the crisis in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, the money could be exhausted and taxpayers might have to bail out the system once again.
But he added, ''At this time, we don't see any area that is going to result in that level of bank failures.''

HEADLINE: Court Backs Broad Definition for Securities

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Endorsing a broad interpretation of Federal securities law, the Supreme Court ruled today that many unsecured promissory notes, sold privately and not traded on any stock exchange, were subject to Federal regulation as securities.
The 5-to-4 decision reversed a Federal appeals court in St. Louis, which held that some $10 million worth of notes sold by an agricultural cooperative, unsecured and payable on demand, were not securities.
In 1984, the cooperative went bankrupt and defaulted on notes held by more than 1,600 people, some of whom sued the cooperative's accountant for fraud. 
A jury awarded the holders $6.1 million against the accountant, Arthur Young & Company, now known as Ernst & Young. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which overturned the judgment, ruled that Federal law did not apply because the notes were not securities.
In deciding today that the Eighth Circuit was incorrect, the Supreme Court resolved an ambiguity that has existed since passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Those laws provide a framework for Federal regulation of securities, defined to include stocks, bonds and a variety of other financial instruments including notes with a maturity of at least nine months.
But the term notes is so general that courts had little guidance as to what came within the laws' definition. The lower Federal courts had been widely divided.
The Supreme Court adopted an approach that has been developed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, and that is also favored by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The opinion, written by Justice Thurgood Marshall, outlines an analysis based on ''economic reality.''
First, Justice Marshall said, ''we examine the transaction to assess the motivations that would prompt a reasonable seller and buyer to enter into it.'' He said a note was likely to be a security ''if the seller's purpose is to raise money for the general use of a business enterprise or to finance substantial investments and the buyer is interested primarily in the profit the note is expected to generate.''
By contrast, he said, a note issued ''to facilitate the purchase and sale of a minor asset or consumer good'' or to solve a temporary cash-flow problem is most likely not a security.
The second step, Justice Marshall said, was to decide whether there was ''common trading'' in the note ''for speculation or investment,'' which would give the note the quality of a security. Next, he said, a court should assess ''public expectations.''
Justice Marshall said that if these factors indicated that the note was a security, a court should then consider whether Federal regulation was necessary.
Justice Marshall said a note should generally be presumed to be a security unless it bears a ''family resemblance'' to a list of transactions that the Second Circuit had identified as not being securities. These include mortgage notes and short-term business and consumer loans.
The Court said a note could still be a security even if it had no fixed term and was payable on demand, as was the case with the cooperative notes.
In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said that notes payable on demand could not qualify as securities because they did not meet the statutory test for a maturity of at least nine months.
The majority opinion, Reves v. Ernst & Young, No. 88-1480, was joined by Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy. The dissent was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Can Macy Endure Price-Cutting?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
MORE than three years after its leveraged buyout, R. H. Macy & Company is encountering doubts about its ability to survive if the current wave of price-cutting by major retailing chains continues. Moody's Investors Service said yesterday that it was considering cutting the rating on Macy's already low-rated ''junk bonds,'' sending the prices of the bonds down further and prompting an angry response from the company.
The Moody's statement said the rating agency was worried that Macy ''might not have the financial flexibility to cope with any long-term price competition.''
The dispute centered on just how much Macy has been and will be hurt by the price-cutting that was prompted in large part by the financial problems of competitors, most notably the subsiaries of the Campeau Corporation, which have filed for bankruptcy protection. 
''We've done all the scenarios, and we have sufficient liquidity in every scenario we try,'' Myron Ullman, Macy's chief financial officer, said in an interview yesterday. ''We expect to return to historical levels of profitability.''
The reassuring statements from management provided little help for Macy's bond issues, which fell sharply and now show yields of well over 20 percent. Such a high yield signals substantial investor worry regarding the ability of a company to pay its bills. Just over a month ago, the Macy 14.5 percent senior subordinated debentures, due in 1998, were trading at $980 per $1,000 bond. Yesterday, the bid price fell $70, to $720, traders said.
There is no question that Macy had a rough time as 1989 ended. In a letter to investors last week, the company said December sales were up 9.5 percent, or 7.7 percent on a comparable store basis, but it added that price-cutting ''will have a significant adverse effect on margins and the bottom line.''
Reacting to Moody's yesterday, the company added that ''the quarterly results Macy's expects soon to report are the product of a previously stated plan to protect market share during the all-important Christmas season and enter spring with appropriate inventory levels.'' It said, ''That plan was successfully executed and Macy's continues to be a strong force in the marketplace.''
Macy has recently trimmed staffing and inventory levels in a reorganization eliminating some management positions.
Despite the heavy interest burdens stemming from its 1986 leveraged buyout and the 1988 purchase from Campeau of Bullock's, a California retailer, Macy reported a profit in the Christmas quarter a year ago. Figures for the recent quarter, ended Jan. 27, will not be out until mid-March, but a loss is expected.
Trying to reassure investors that things are getting better, Macy's statement yesterday said preliminary results for February ''indicate that bottom-line performance will be well ahead of last year's level.'' The company did not say whether it made any money in February of last year.
Macy called Moody's action ''totally unwarranted'' and complained that it had no contact from Moody's before the statement was issued. A Moody's official said that was standard procedure, and added that the company would get a chance to make its case before a rating decision was made.
Macy's statement said the company's ''financial structure is sound, with ample liquidity to meet the short-term as well as the long-term needs of the business.'' It added that ''Macy has recently met with its principal bank lenders and they are comfortable with Macy's financial position.'' ''We trust,'' it said, ''with the benefit of further information, Moody's will reach this same conclusion.''
Moody's currently rates the three major publicly traded Macy bonds as B-3, a low level of junk bond. A further cut would be to Caa, a rating that Bill Mendenhall, a Moody's analyst, said was ''a rating where you would really see the company having difficulty getting out of the situation they are in.'' Moody's main competitor, the Standard & Poor's Corporation, already rates some Macy bonds at CCC, a level equivalent to Moody's Caa.
Macy's results had indicated that the company was doing well enough to meet its obligations. Although margins dipped in the October quarter, the last that has been reported, for the 12 months through October it still had ample cash flow to cover interest payments.
Macy still has friends on Wall Street. Evan Mann, a high-yield bond analyst at Dillon, Read, said that even assuming margins stayed as low as they were in the October quarter, and that sales gains were poor, his projections indicate that Macy could meet all its obligations in future years.
''Assuming the economy doesn't really slip into a severe recession where consumers totally stop spending, the company should be a survivor long-term,'' Mr. Mann said.
But junk bond buyers, who have been burned before, are cautious. Mr. Mann said that investors he talked to found his calculations interesting, but they were unwilling to act until they saw the results of the Christmas quarter.

HEADLINE: Dow Finishes 13.29 Lower After a Big Decline Earlier

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices fell yesterday, pulled down initially by a report of a 1.1 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index for last month.
The larger-than-expected rise in the index was the biggest in more than seven years and and traders said it precipitated a drop of about 28 points in the Dow Jones industrial average shortly after the market opened.
But the Dow revived somewhat to finish 13.29 points lower, or five-tenths of 1 percent, to 2,583.56. On Tuesday, it had tumbled by 38.74 points, or by 1.5 percent, as traders worried about a sharp rise in long-term Treasury interest rates. 
 
Lowest Since Jan. 30
The Dow's closing level yesterday was the lowest since Jan. 30, when the average finished at 2,543.24. Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday outnumbered advancing ones, 963 to 577.
The traders said yesterday's drop was also aggravated by a decline in the Tokyo stock market, where the Nikkei index of 225 issues plunged by 1,161.19 points, or by 3.15 percent, to 35,734.33. It was the third-largest daily drop in the indicator's history and the equivalent of about an 80-point drop in the Dow.
The Japanese market made a slight recovery today after an early selloff. The Nikkei index edged up 92.51 points, to close at 35,826.84.
The sharp decline in Japan was primarily attributed to concern over the worldwide increase in interest rates, although some analysts suggested that it was related to Tuesday's weakness in the American stock market.
''The market's decline here was in sharp contrast to the plunge in Tokyo,'' said Robert Ritter, the chief technical analyst at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. ''It appears as if either the Japanese market reacted to Tuesday's decline in the United States, or else the connection is not as precise as many observers seem to think.''
 
Considering Other Factors
He said higher interest rates and declines in profits were affecting equity markets in both countries, but other factors were also coming into play.
''In the United States, the budget deficit and tax policy are affecting different industry sectors, while a changing foreign policy should benefit several important industrial and economic areas,'' Mr. Ritter said. ''Japan has its own special economic and domestic problems.''
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks dipped by 0.32 point, to 327.67, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell by 0.30 point, to 181.07.
Volume on the Big Board rose to a moderate 159.2 million shares, from 147.3 million on Tuesday.
Among individual issues, Digital fell by 1 1/8, to a 52-week low of 72 7/8, after the company said that it was ''walking a fairly thin line'' on whether it would report profits for its third quarter ending in March.
I.B.M., which rose by 2 points, to 104 7/8, helped stabilize the market.
 
Texas Instruments Up
Texas Intruments rose by 3/8, to 32 1/4, after the Dallas-based company said it had produced its first memory device that can store 16 million pieces of information. A company spokesman said the first high-memory chip was produced on Feb. 12, a day before I.B.M. said it had built its first 16 million-bit chip. Texas Instruments said such chips were prototypes and were not ready yet for commercial shipment.
USAir remained unchanged, at 28 1/8, although the company's stock was upgraded to ''buy,'' from ''neutral,'' by Edward Starkman, an analyst for Paine Webber Inc.
The AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, jumped by 1 1/8, to 56 3/4. Timothy Pettee, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company, said he had raised his rating on the stock, also to ''buy,'' from ''neutral.''
 
UAL Rises to $132.25
The UAL Corporation climbed by 5 1/8, to 132 1/4. The stock of the company, based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., advanced before today's board meeting, but takeover analysts said the meeting should produce little other than the possible announcement of collective bargaining agreements with the company's three primary unions - the pilots, flight attendants and machinists. Together, they are seeking to acquire 75 percent of UAL, the parent of United Airlines.
The gains in UAL and AMR gave the Dow transportation average a solid 16.72-point advance, to 1,084.64.
The active blue-chip issues included Philip Morris, off by 1/8, to 37 5/8, and the busiest Big Board issue on a volume of nearly 2.3 million shares; A.T.& T., down by 1/4, to 38 3/4; General Electric, off by 3/8, to 60 1/2; Chemical Bank, down by 1/8, to 26 1/4, and W. R. Grace & Co., off by 1/4, to 29 1/4.
On the American Stock Exchange, the Amex market-value index fell by 1.93 points, to 352.95.
In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index declined by 2.31 points, to 421.52. Microsoft dropped by 4 1/8, to 96 1/8. The company, based in Redmond, Wash., said it knew of no developments to explain the decline, or a 2 1/4-point rise on Tuesday. Chemical Bankingd(Chemical)

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher; Gold Prices Move Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly higher in thin, nervous trading yesterday after a mixed performance overseas.
On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $418 an ounce, down $1.90 from late Tuesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $417.80 an ounce, off $2.10.
The dollar started out higher in Japan, but it fell back in Europe as dealers became unnerved by falling stock prices in Tokyo and a bond market rally in West Germany. Those worries, however, failed to have a big impact on traders in New York.
 
No Incentive
''I don't think there's any incentive to buy or sell,'' said Earl I. Johnson of the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago. ''The market needs more information on the U.S. economy.
The dollar had little reaction to a Government report showing a 1.1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index for January, Increased inflation reduces prospects for lower interest rates, which would usually depress the dollar, dealers said.
They said the market had anticipated higher inflation when the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, testified before Congress on Tuesday.
In New York, the dollar traded at 1.6725 marks, up from 1.66835 marks on Tuesday, and 145.50 yen, up from 145.155 yen. The pound cost $1.7125, up from $1.7115.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.4795 Swiss francs, up from 1.4785; 5.6730 French francs, up from 5.6670; 1,238.00 Italian lire, up from 1,237.50, and 1.19825 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20075.
Silver prices slipped, with silver for current delivery closing at $5.272 an ounce, down from $5.332 Tuesday. Silver fell 2 cents in London, to $5.33 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Bush, on West Coast, Skirts Two Conservation Issues

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 21

 BODY:
President Bush traveled on the West Coast today, raising campaign money and skirting two conservation issues that have complicated his effort to find new political ground on the environment.
In Portland, Ore., Mr. Bush offered his familiar "find-a-balance" formula to environmentalists and to Republican politicians and timber industry executives. They have been at odds over proposed restrictions to logging on millions of acres; environmentalists say the restrictions are needed to protect the Northern spotted owl from extinction, and opponents say they would wipe out thousands of jobs in logging communities.
In his public comments, the President seemed to lean slightly more toward those who argue that economic considerations outweigh the need to protect the owls. But he carefully avoided taking any clear position before June 23, when the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is to rule on whether the owl will be protected under the Endangered Species Act. 
"I'm interested in the owl," he said, "but I'm also interested in jobs for the American family."
 
Debate Over Offshore Oil
 Mr. Bush also stayed away from discussion of offshore oil drilling while in Los Angeles, where debate over exploration for oil along the coast has been a major political issue for him since the 1988 Presidential campaign.
Mr. Bush has come under mounting pressure from environmental and industry groups to announce a policy on Federal oil leasing off California and Florida, and promised last week to announce a decision within days. But White House aides made it clear in advance that the President was not going to use this trip to do so. Instead, he attended a Republican fund-raising event at a Bel Air mansion, where participants paid $15,000 to $25,000 a plate.
The day reflected Mr. Bush's grappling with environmental issues in the 16 months since he took office. While the President has earned praise from environmentalists for proposing revisions to the Clean Air Act to reduce acid rain, he has tempered his avowals of support for environmental causes by saying they must be balanced with economic concerns.
 
'Save Every Subspecies?'
 The Administration's recent handling of the protection of endangered species has been typical of this approach. Last week the White House rejected a suggestion by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. that the Endangered Species Act be revised to take economic considerations into account.
But Mr. Bush's comments in Portland seemed to reflect Mr. Lujan's notion. "I want to be known as the environmental President," he said, "but I also want to be concerned about a person's ability to hold a job."
In making his suggestion, Mr. Lujan also commented on a debate over whether to allow construction of an observatory in Arizona that environmentalists say will cause the extinction of a subspecies of squirrel, the Mount Graham red squirrel. "Do we have to save every subspecies?" he asked.
That argument had strong resonance in Oregon's debate over the Northern spotted owl, a subspecies of the spotted owl that lives in dense older forests in the Pacific Northwest. As loggers thin those forests, the owl becomes easier prey to the great horned owl. Last month an interagency commission recommended that logging be banned on 8.4 million acres of forest in Washington, Oregon and Northern California to protect the spotted owl.
No action can be taken until the Fish and Wildlife Service determines whether the spotted owl is a "threatened" or "endangered" species under the law. After that, the Administration and Congress would have to agree on a way to save the owl.
 
'A Passive Kind of Owl'
 Some opponents of a logging ban have echoed Mr. Lujan's arguments. "There are millions of owls in the world," said Representative Denny Smith, an Oregon Republican. "This little puppy just happens to be a passive kind of owl that's being run over by the great horned owl."
While Mr. Bush was in Portland on Sunday and today, Mr. Smith and others put pressure on him to take a stand on the dispute. Instead, he offered his split-the-difference formula.
Today, at a fund-raising breakfast for David Frohnmayer, the Republican candidate for governor in Oregon, Mr. Bush drew loud applause when he said: "I reject those who would ignore the economic consequences of the spotted owl decision. The jobs of many thousands of Oregonians and whole communities are at stake."
Then he added a sentence that left his audience silent but cheered some of the two dozen protesters who stood outside. "But I also think that we ought to reject those who do not recognize their obligation to protect our delicate ecosystem," he said.
"Common sense tells us to find a needed balance," he said in conclusion. "Together, I'm convinced we can work to find that balance."

HEADLINE: Big Funds Pressing for Voice In Management of Companies

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Many investment managers, who oversee funds with billions of dollars of company shares, want more of a say in how American corporations are run. And more of them are starting to use their financial muscle to try to obtain it.
The recent effort by several state pension funds to influence the selection process of a new chief executive at the General Motors Corporation is but one example of the new assertiveness of large investors. Increasingly, pension and mutual fund managers are challenging what they consider the inefficiency and wastefulness of many American corporations.
 
Seats on the Board Sought
While some are seeking better communication with directors, others want a seat on the board, either for themselves or for an appointed representative. Their stated aim: to improve corporate performance and thus increase the value of their shareholdings. 
''We're going to be as active as we can be,'' said Roland M. Machold, who oversees New Jersey's $28 billion in pension fund money for thousands of the state's employees.
Institutional investors are becoming increasingly important in the marketplace because the funds under their control are growing sharply while individual investors are leaving in droves. And as the investment funds hold ever-larger portions of major American companies, they feel they face no alternative but to get more involved. They cannot sell their holdings without taking big losses because the act of selling would drive down the value of the shares.
The trend toward investment-fund activism, should it gain momentum, would represent a significant shift in the balance of power in corporate governance, reducing the dominance of managers and giving greater influence to major shareholders.
The new activism differs markedly from earlier efforts. In the past, public pension funds typically pushed ideological goals - putting pressure on companies to withdraw from South Africa, for example. But this time, the fund managers are pursuing mainly a business agenda.
Moreover, academics and financial executives observing this trend assert that the critical ingredients for waging a successful campaign appear to be falling into place. The main ones include: a nucleus of pension and mutual fund managers willing to abandon their traditional role as passive investors and take the lead in getting more involved in company policies; encouragement in Washington from members of the Bush Administration for their efforts, and, perhaps most important, increasing economic necessity.
 
'An Ownership Culture'
Taken collectively, said Robert A. G. Monks, president of the Institutional Shareholders Service Inc., a Washington proxy-advisory firm, these steps are ''the beginnings of the development of an ownership culture.''
More aggressive owners could well pose a challenge to sleepy chief executives or those who treat their companies as personal fiefdoms. To be sure, fund managers are not owners in the traditional sense; they are fiduciaries, making investments on behalf of others, like employees or investors. Nevertheless, some of the country's leading institutional investors are exhibiting the kind of assertiveness associated with owners.
These are some of the examples:
* The fund managers of New York and California have been successful in getting General Motors management to discuss the criteria used to select and monitor the company's new chief executive.
* California's public pension fund has asked the directors of UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, to investigate the company's decision to pay $58 million in investment banking fees for a failed management-led bid for the company. Other large investors, including the public pension fund of Massachusetts, are supporting that effort.
* Two large money-management companies, Fidelity Investments and the Mutual Shares Corporation, have made changes in their investment policies to make it easier for them to join others in influencing managements and boards. Fidelity's general counsel, Robert C. Pozen, says his fund managers also work behind the scenes with companies they are concerned about.
* California's fund manager has submitted shareholder proposals to Avon Products, TRW and Occidental Petroleum to establish ''shareholder advisory committees'' that would work closely with the boards of those companies.
* California's pension fund has also written a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking 48 regulatory changes that would facilitate communication among large shareholders and give shareholders a greater say. Fidelity has expressed its support for such an effort.
 
Others Ready to Move
Clearly, efforts to date have been concentrated in a handful of public funds, like California's. But other fund managers said that did not reflect a lack of interest on their part, but rather a calculated decision to push the better-organized funds to the forefront.
''We've basically said, 'You guys take the lead, and we'll join you where it's appropriate,' '' said Paul F. Quirk, who oversees the Massachusetts public pension fund system.
Mr. Quirk noted that Dale M. Hanson, who manages more than $56 billion in assets for the State of California, has just been put in charge of a new strategic planning committee of the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents more than 60 public funds. The purpose of that committee will be to insure more coherence in efforts involving council members.
''There was more this year, and there will be a lot more of it next year,'' said Mr. Quirk, the chairman of the council's executive committee. Mr. Hanson has already engaged a research group to help identify companies with poor performance records.
 
Sharp Growth
Fund managers are in a better position to exercise their potential for power than even a few years ago because of the big growth of the money under their control and the simultaneous decline in the role of the individual investor in the market.
Twenty-five years ago, according to the Securities Industry Association, institutional investors owned 16 percent of all equities, with households making up the rest. By mid-1989, institutions made up 43 percent of stock ownership. And at large companies, ownership is even more concentrated: Big institutional investors own 52 percent of the equity of the top 50 companies in the United States, a Columbia University study found.
''By the year 2,000, they will own two-thirds of the equity of major corporations,'' said Ira M. Millstein, a lawyer at Weil, Gotshal & Manges who headed a study group for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York on this issue.
 
New Power Feared
To some critics, the prospect that a small group of money managers could wield influence over American corporations conjures up sinister images of smoke-filled rooms and greedy power brokers. And the fact that some of the leading figures in this movement come from state, as opposed to private, pension fund circles, serves to accentuate this fear since, as appointed or elected officials, they may harbor political, rather than business, agendas.
Fund managers are also frequently blamed for exacerbating corporate America's focus on short-term, quarterly profits, because that is how the managers are evaluated and paid.
Other fund managers, however, argue that a tighter link between the owners of companies and their managers is essential if corporate performance is to be improved and the United States is to become more competitive.
 
Keeping Management Alert
Indeed, with more states enacting laws that inhibit hostile takeovers and many corporate raiders now busy running the industrial companies they have acquired, pension fund activism is increasingly seen as one of the few ways of keeping management on its toes. Institutional investors are not necessarily regarded as wiser than individual investors -just larger and better organized and thus more to be reckoned with.
As Mr. Millstein, who has been particularly active in trying to nudge corporate pension funds, put it, ''If it becomes perceived that they won't vote, won't act, then to whom is corporate America going to be accountable?''
The Bush Administration, unlike its predecessor, seems to be encouraging a more activist approach. In a recent speech to leading chief financial officers, David Ball, an Assistant Secretary of Labor, said that if fund managers believe that a company is poorly run, they can persuade management to change its behavior, they can change management, or they can sell the stock. The latter - far and away the traditional response - is hardly satisfactory, Mr. Ball added, because the sale of a large block of stock could depress prices by as much as 15 percent, making that a costly exit.
 
Proxy Examinations Urged
''Institutional investors have a duty to carefully examine proxy proposals and to reject those which would benefit management as opposed to benefiting the company,'' he said.
Few corporate executives truly welcome new-found assertiveness by large investors, but none was willing to say so publicly for fear of antagonizing them.
''Most companies are very wary,'' said Mr. Machold of New Jersey. ''They regard any large shareholder not as an asset but as a liability. We can't even get them to return our phone calls.'' Mr. Machold's frustration points to the underlying flaw in the public funds' strategy. According to one leading acquirer of corporations, no one will listen to the funds until they are prepared to undertake a show of force, namely, the initiating and winning of a proxy fight.
In 1989, several funds won a proxy fight involving the Honeywell Corporation's attempt to stagger the election of its directors. Shortly thereafter, the management restructured the company and the stock rose. According to one leading public pension fund manager, ''We're looking for another Honeywell. That is one way to get the message across.''
Future efforts are also likely to focus on making boards of directors more responsive through such suggested measures as insuring that at least two-thirds of a board's members are completely independent of management and paying directors and managers less in cash and more in stock.

HEADLINE: A Rising Sun Beckons, to Highly Paid Drudgery

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil

 BODY:
At 24 years of age, Hiroyaki Chibana embodies a new kind of success story in Liberdade, this city's Japanese neighborhood.
Fed up with scraping out a living pumping gas and hawking meat pies, he set off at 18 to seek his fortune in Japan, a land his parents had abandoned decades earlier.
Today, he is the proud owner of a busy corner luncheonette, the fruit of earnings saved from a two-year stint in an Osaka metal shop.
''I just sent my brother off to Tokyo to put together a stake for a new venture,'' the young entrepreneur said, standing behind his counter, wearing a blue uniform embroidered in white letters: ''Lanchonete Chibana.'' 
 
Migration in Reverse
Brazil, once a country of such promise that it attracted this century's largest Japanese emigration, is now watching Japanese-Brazilians fighting to travel to Japan to take manual jobs disdained by Japanese.
Helping to sell out the economy-class sections of flights between here and Tokyo, Japan's robust economy is experiencing a labor shortage that is expected to grow to a million jobs by the year 2000.
On this end of the 27-hour flight, Latin America's prolonged economic stagnation is causing a reverse migration of some of the components of the melting pot. In Peru, much of Lima's Jewish population has quietly left for the United States. In Argentina, grandchildren of Italian and Spanish immigrants are leaving for ancestral homelands, now prosperous members of the European Community.
''It's not just the Japanese,'' said Akito Haneda, manager of Sol Nascente (Rising Sun), a company that helps Brazilians land jobs in Japan. ''It's the same at the consulates of Portugal, Spain and Italy.''
 
A Broken Promise
But with Brazil's Japanese population, the broken promise of development is perhaps the sharpest.
At the end of World War II, Japan and Brazil had roughly comparable living standards. Today, Japan has a per capita income of $20,000 and Brazil has a per capita income of $2,300. This month, prices in Brazil are expected to jump 70 percent -equivalent to more than a decade of inflation in Japan.
''When I was young, everyone said Brazil, Brazil, Brazil,'' recalled Seitoku Ifuku, who emigrated here in 1963 and who is now returning to work in Tokyo. ''Now, they say Japan, Japan, Japan.''
At the Japanese Consulate here, Shunsaku Ohno, the consul general, shuffled through files and came up with these statistics: In the last two years, the number of passports issued to Japanese citizens doubled to 9,418 and the number of visas issued to Brazilians tripled to 18,328.
Some Brazilians say they believe that the Japanese emigration could eventually hurt the supply of food to Sao Paulo, South America's most populous city.
 
Settled First on Plantations
According to Sao Paulo Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper here, job opportunities in Japan have drawn away at least 700 able-bodied workers from Bastos, a Sao Paulo town described as Brazil's largest center for egg production. In Mogi das Cruzes, a state center for vegetable production, a rural union leader said recently that his membership of 1,700 families has lost 600 members to jobs in Japan.
First arriving here in 1908, Japanese settled largely in rural areas. At the time, rapid industrialization and increased taxes impoverished rural Japan, according to Katsunori Wakisaka, director of the Center of Japanese-Brazilian Studies here.
With their 45-day steamship fares paid by the Japanese Government or by the Sao Paulo State government, the immigrants worked first on coffee plantations and then started truck gardens. After the United States largely barred Asian immigration in 1924, Brazil emerged as the largest destination for Japanese emigrants. With the exception of the war years, Brazil retained this position until emigration stopped in the early 1960's.
As a sequel to this movement, Brazil has 1.2 million people of Japanese descent, slightly more than the United States. A recent census showed 71 percent to be in Sao Paulo State and 12 percent to be in neighboring Parana State.
 
The Largest Colony
''My country is home to the largest population with Japanese blood outside of the Japanese archipelago,'' Brazil's President-elect, Fernando Collor de Mello, told a Japanese business group in Tokyo in January, in a speech intended to drum up investment and trade.
Brazilians of Japanese descent largely go to Japan on tourist visas to take jobs that the Japanese press calls ''the three k's'' - kitanai, kiken, kitsui (dirty, dangerous, difficult).
Living frugally, often in factory dormitories, workers often manage to save as much as $1,500 a month.
For many, a trip to Japan is the equivalent of a small business loan.
In Brazil, bank credit is largely reserved to large, established companies. One dental school graduate used his earnings to buy dental equipment. Others have used the money to pay for college educations or, like Mr. Chibana, to start small businesses.
''One generation died poor, their children are living poor, their grandchildren have the right to make money,'' said Noriko Bruce, a Japanese-Brazilian who has seen several cousins leave in recent months for Japan.
Despite their Japanese ancestry and, in some cases, command of the Japanese language, many Japanese-Brazilians complain that Japanese society greets them with almost the same chill reserved for manual laborers imported from other third-world countries like Pakistan or the Philippines.
 
Bias Taken for Granted
''We are discriminated against in Japan,'' said Celia Abe Oi, an editor for Diario Nippak, a newspaper for Japanese-Brazilians.
''Our parents went off to make their futures,'' she said over a plate of sushi at a restaurant here. ''We come back failures, not speaking Japanese well, and taking jobs that Japanese won't take.''
But everyone interviewed here predicted that the reverse migration will grow.
Enrollment in Japanese language lessons in Brazil has increased to 40,000. Japanese companies here are losing their personnel of Japanese descent. Last year, five Brazilian employees of the Japanese Consulate left for Japan.
Distilling the economic logic, the editor asked, ''If you were earning $1,700 a month, how would you like to go back to earning $200 a month?''

HEADLINE: U.N. Drug Plan Puts Stress on Reducing Demand

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 22 - T

 BODY:
he United Nations today approved a new anti-narcotics plan that stresses the need to reduce demand in the industrialized consuming countries and to compensate poor drug-producing countries for losses suffered by curbing the trade.
The plan, approved by a General Assembly committee and scheduled for formal adoption on Friday, continues the evolution in United States policy apparent at the Cartagena meeting between President Bush and the Presidents of Bolivia, Colombia and Peru, diplomats said.
At that meeting, the United States recognized its duty as the world's biggest market for illicit drugs to cut demand and aid producing countries that reduce output, in addition to taking vigorous measures against traffickers and destroying supplies. 
''This is the first time the world has so clearly recognized the need to address the demand and development aspects of the drug crisis instead of concentrating on production and trafficking,'' said Colombia's United Nations representative, Enrique Penalosa.
The American delegation leader. Melvin Levitsky, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters, said, ''The agreement has overcome the false division between demand and supply and stopped finger pointing as to who is responsible for the crisis.''
 
Not Legally Binding
The new plan and an accompanying political declaration are not legally binding. And nations attending this special session of the General Assembly gave no firm commitments to increase spending on the fight against drug abuse or to provide more aid to poor countries that eliminate their drug industries.
But the four-day meeting has demonstrated the depth of concern both developed and developing countries now feel about the drug problem and their willingness to share the task of combating it.
The plan commits all countries to the development of national strategies to ''give higher priority to prevention and reduction of drug abuse with a view to elimination of the illicit demand for drugs.'' These strategies should include an analysis of the causes of demand, educational measures to combat addiction and treatment and rehabilitation programs.
The United Nations will act as ''an advisory center'' for the collection, analysis and dissemination of information about the drug trade, with such specialized agencies as the World Health Organization playing an expert role.
The plan also commits countries in general terms to do more to aid the poorer producing nations overcome the economic losses many suffer from curbing output by developing alternative crops and providing markets for them.
During this week's special Assembly session, many speakers from the drug-producing countries of Latin America and Southeast Asia called on the industrialized world to do more to reduce demand and compensate them for eliminating their drug industries.
''The process must be gradual because narcotics accounts for 24 percent of our gross national product,'' Foreign Minister Carlos Iturralte-Ballivian of Bolivia said.

HEADLINE: Japan Backs Cheney's Troop-Cut Plan

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Nearing the end of his trip to Asia, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney won general approval from Japan on Thursday for a proposal to reduce American forces in East Asia and the Pacific by 10 percent, including a 5,000 to 6,000 cut in troops stationed here.
After discussions with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and top Japanese officials and political leaders, Mr. Cheney also said he was pleased with way the Japanese received the American request that Tokyo increase its share of the expenditure for the American military presence here.
The Secretary and his aides said that no specific numbers were discussed on increasing the Japanese share of the $7.5 billion American military expenditure in Japan, which is now about 40 percent. American officials said details would be worked out later this year. 
Mr. Cheney is on a two-week tour of South Korea, the Philippines and Japan to discuss what the Pentagon calls an ''East Asian security initiative'' aimed at cutting military forces in response to the perceived lessening of the threat from the Soviet Union.
 
Preserving 'Combat Capability'
Whereas in Europe, American allies have welcomed a reduction in United States troop strength, American allies in Asia are more wary of what they say is a continuing Soviet threat, reflected by the hostility of North Korea and Soviet modernization of its ground and naval forces throughout the region.
Mr. Cheney was said by Japanese officials to have assured Mr. Kaifu and others that the proposed reductions would be carried out ''without damaging combat capability'' of American forces.
In response, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama was said to have called the American proposals ''prudent and appropriate.'' But Japanese officials said Mr. Kaifu and Mr. Nakayama stressed that it was premature to think that East Asian and the Pacific were places of defused tension like Europe.
In a larger sense, Japanese officials say privately that they are worried that an overall reduction of the American presence in Asia would reawaken fears in other parts of the region about the growing influence of Japan.
 
Fear of Tokyo Military Threat
They say the United States is a healthy influence that reassures Asian countries that they need not fear the possibility of a Japanese military threat that would follow its expanding economic influence down the road.
According to a Japanese official, Mr. Nakayama told Mr. Cheney that despite welcome changes in other parts of the world, ''we have to be mindful of elements of instability and unpredictability'' in Asia.
The official quoted Mr. Cheney as in agreement, and responding in the meeting, ''Over all, the Asian Pacific situation has not seen as much improvement as we have seen in the European theater.''
American officials said Mr. Cheney has tried to avoid specific numbers in addressing the question of how best to reduce the general presence of American forces in Asia. But they said that 10 percent was a general goal, and that specifics would be worked out by military commanders.
 
Difficult Philippine Visit
The United States troop presence in East Asia and the Pacific consists of about 50,000 troops in Japan, 43,000 in South Korea and 18,000 in the Philippines. Mr. Cheney said a ''ballpark figure'' of 5,000 to 6,000 was the goal in Japan.
Last week, Mr. Cheney persuaded the South Korean Defense Minister, Lee Sang Hoon, to accept in principle the gradual withdrawal of about 5,000 noncombatants from that country. American officials said the Philippine Defense Minister, Fidel V. Ramos, also had ''agreed in principle'' on a reduction.
The rockiest part of Mr. Cheney's trip has been the visit to the Philippines, American officials said. There, President Corazon C. Aquino declined to meet with Mr. Cheney, in protest against American plans to reduce American economic aid to Manila.
In his meeting with Mr. Ramos, Mr. Cheney promised ''to do what he could to get the full amount pledged'' given to the Philippines, according to Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Guardian of Baker's Door at State: A Quick Study Who Rose Rapidly

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
When people who have worked with Robert B. Zoellick are asked to talk about him, they sound a little like the brainwashed servicemen in ''The Manchurian Candidate,'' who uniformly refer to their sergeant as ''the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life.''
For Richard G. Darman, the budget director who was Mr. Zoellick's boss at the Treasury Department, he ''can do more first-class work in 24 hours than 12 ordinary people could do in 24 years.'' For George D. Gould, a former Under Secretary of Treasury, he is ''the most talented man I ever worked with.'' Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, calls him ''one of the most effective officials in Washington.''
Is the 36-year-old workaholic whiz kid who serves as Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's counselor and confidant really that good? Maybe. Maybe not. A Rapid Rise Mr. Zoellick is the kind of guy everyone would like to have working for him, a behind-the-scenes operative who combines intelligence, energy and good judgment. The brief against him is that he can be abrupt and abrasive and that he is in a position too powerful for his level of foreign policy experience and expertise. 
A Darman protege, Mr. Zoellick was discovered and promoted in 1986 by Mr. Baker, who was then Treasury Secretary. Later, using his influence in the Bush campaign, Mr. Baker wedged his young charge past longtime Bush operatives and installed him as issues director for the 1988 Presidential campaign. Then, when Mr. Baker took over at State, he jumped him to the head of the line. So far, Mr. Zoellick has kept his constituency of one very happy.
''He is an extremely capable and talented young man who is rendering extraordinary service to his country,'' Mr. Baker said. ''I rely greatly on his counsel and advice.''
As counselor, a sort of minister without portfolio, he is a combination ideas man, troubleshooter, adviser, hands-on negotiator and executive secretary for Mr. Baker. Every piece of paper that is sent to Mr. Baker must first pass through his desk, where, Mr. Zoellick said, he ''institutes some quality control.'' He is also the first to see the replies.
Most important, he integrates the strategic planning of the policy planning office with the department's day-to-day operations and even conducts some of the diplomacy himself.
 
Foreign Policy Novice
In May he went on a secret mission to Bonn with Robert M. Gates, the deputy national security adviser, to paper over differences with the Germans on short-range nuclear missiles. In October he accompanied Mr. Greenspan to Moscow to teach the Soviets about capitalism. And he largely wrote Mr. Baker's speech to the Berlin Press Club in December, which offered an American blueprint for the future of Europe.
When he took the State Department job a year ago, Mr. Zoellick was a foreign policy novice. He has learned a lot about geopolitics since the day last spring when he gave new ambassadors a global overview that one listener described as ''full of cliches.''
He has also learned the hard way about global travel. On his first visit to Oman, the socks, T-shirts and shirts he sent to the palace guest house laundry came back with a $100-plus tab. ''He now travels with lots of shirts,'' said Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman.
If Mr. Zoellick has one unique advantage in his job, it is that he not only has Mr. Baker's ear, he also has his eye. They see the world through the same geopolitical prism, focusing in on those policies with high potential for success and low risk for criticism at home. Mr. Zoellick can predict Mr. Baker's foreign policy strategies months in advance and present issues to him in precisely the form that Mr. Baker wants them.
''The nature of my job is to think in advance of what needs to be done and not wait to be asked,'' he said. ''One nice thing about my job is that I'm not frequently told what to do.''
 
Two Briefing as One
Mr. Zoellick and Dennis B. Ross, the director of policy planning at the State Department, who met on the Presidential campaign, have transformed the way the department makes decisions, largely eclipsing the role of the assistant secretaries. The duo has also assumed many of the responsibilities traditionally carried out by the department's No. 2 and 3 positions, the Deputy Secretary and the Under Secretary for Political Affairs. They have become so close that they routinely brief journalists as a single ''senior Administration official.''
Over the past year, veteran State Department officials have learned that the only way to Mr. Baker is through Mr. Zoellick. ''We've adapted,'' one senior State Department official said of Mr. Zoellick. ''We no longer view him as a rival. We view him as the person who can make things happen.''
Mr. Zoellick is not shy outside the department either. When Southeast Asian ambassadors had a luncheon meeting with United States Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills and Mr. Zoellick several weeks ago, he was the one who explained American policy toward economic cooperation in Asia.
Mr. Zoellick dazzles some colleagues and frightens others with his rigorous work ethic. As a clerk for Judge Patricia M. Wald of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1982 and 1983, he worked until 10 or 11 every night and then ran the seven miles home. ''Uphill, I might add,'' he said. On route to Paris for a Cambodia conference last summer, he read biographical material on Prince Norodom Sihanouk while everyone else was sleeping. He carries his own cheese, crackers and raisins on the road because there is never enough time for room service.
 
Stickler for Detail
Like Felix Unger of ''The Odd Couple,'' Mr. Zoellick is also fastidious in his work habits and a stickler for detail. He approaches issues didactically, packaging them in discreet blocks with enumerated points.
''Look at his handwriting, with the little fine-point pens and pencils, neat and precise with numbers, letters and parentheses,'' said James P. Pinkerton, Deputy Assistant to the President for Policy Planning, who worked with Mr. Zoellick on the 1988 campaign. ''Here's a smart, organized guy who manages to pull it off without being a nerd.'' One European diplomat called him ''precise and meticulous,'' adding, ''He looks as if he could be an accountant.''
But as a function of his finely tuned sense of efficiency, he loses patience with those who he believes do not work as hard as he does or are not as smart as he is. ''If he has one problem it's that he could probably delegate more than he does,'' one colleague said. ''He doesn't trust many people in the building.'' When asked about his brusqueness, Ms. Tutwiler said, ''Sometimes he can be snappy. We all can. In any bureaucracy when you get served up the lowest common denominator or shoddy work there is a lower tolerance level.''
He does delegate responsibility, he insisted, up to a point. ''I'm quite happy when I find people who can help do the work to let them do it,'' he said. ''But I have very high standards.''
To prove that he can lighten up, he keeps an illustrated copy of ''Guinea Pigs: A Complete Pet Owner's Manual'' on his coffee table in his office. ''It's a test,'' he explained, ''to see if people react to it.'' He divides visitors into three categories according to their response: those who pretend the book is not there, those who see the book and are uncomfortable and those who are amused.
 
Working on 2 Degrees
The son of what he calls ''some plain old Midwestern people'' from rural Illinois, Mr. Zoellick got himself on the public policy fast track as Mr. Darman's teaching fellow at Harvard University while he was working simultaneously working on a master's degree in public policy and a law degree. He took a leave of absence from Harvard to work in the criminal division of President Jimmy Carter's Justice Department, and after graduation worked in law firm of Joseph A. Califano Jr., a Democrat who later served as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare under Mr. Carter. Mr. Zoellick then became assistant to the chairman of the Federal National Mortgage Association before landing a job as Mr. Darman's special assistant at the Treasury Department.
Within a year, Mr. Baker, then Treasury Secretary, promoted him three times. ''He had a kind of key people strategy, that it was important to get to know key people and get the opportunity to watch people he thought would be leaders,'' Judge Wald said.
He denies that he is a workaholic. He eschews the Washington social circuit, preferring to read military histories or visit area Civil War battle sites. He and his wife, Sherry, a published novelist - whose books include ''Raise a Tiger'' - and amateur ornithologist, have identified 55 species of birds in their backyard in northwest Washington. They also enjoy hosting theme murder mystery dinners for costumed guests to guess the identity of the imaginary killer.
He described his relationship with Mr. Baker as strictly professional, which suits him fine. ''Some people need a constant sense that their boss is their friend or they want to socialize with him on the outside,'' he said. ''I'm quite pleased I don't have to go hunting or play golf.''
A self-described ''public policy junkie,'' Mr. Zoellick would like nothing better than to stay in government. ''I'd like to spend as much of my life and career in public policy as possible, but I recognize that's not very likely to be the case. But I'd be quite pleased if there was a period of Republican hegemony for the next 40 years.''

HEADLINE: Bush Vows to Combat Crisis of Medical Litigation

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Feb. 22

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he had directed his Domestic Policy Council to determine what steps were necessary to stem a malpractice litigation crisis that he said threatened the health of the nation's medical system.
Mr. Bush addressed the issue of malpractice in a speech to a group celebrating the 114th anniversary of Johns Hopkins University, one of the nation's pre-eminent medical research centers. As he spoke, some 200 demonstrators, including doctors and other faculty members from Johns Hopkins institutions, stood outside in the rain protesting his Administration's health policies. 
The President urged doctors to avoid practicing ''defensive medicine'' and said it was time to restore ''common sense and fairness to America's medical malpractice system.''
White House officials said Mr. Bush was referring to what he saw as an excessive number of malpractice lawsuits, and too high insurance premiums for doctors. The American Medical Association estimates that the cost of malpractice lawsuits and of doctors' insurance premiums related to malpractice is about $14 billion a year.
 
Incentives for State Action
An official said the Domestic Policy Council was looking at a number of options, including encouraging states to establish their own policies. For example, boards might be set up to handle malpractice cases to cut the number of lawsuits and damage awards.
Critics of the Administration's approach, including the American Trial Lawyers Association, cite studies by the General Accounting Office and the Rand Corporation concluding that the cost of lawsuits is not excessively high. The lawyers say most awards are relatively small and fully justified.
But today Mr. Bush said the fear of malpractice ''has not only hurt medical innovation and treatment, it's also hurt medical volunteerism.'' He added, ''Many doctors used to give a day a week to the needy, and I'm convinced that, if not for the liability issue, many more would donate time today.''
He also said: ''We've got to remember a simple truth: not every unfortunate medical outcome is the result of poor medicine. You cannot make life risk-free. No risk means no progress.'' #672 Signatures on Petition Outside, the protesters circulated a petition saying Mr. Bush had ''neglected as well as damaged'' the public health. They said they had collected 672 signatures, including those of 40 members of the Johns Hopkins faculty.
The petition complained that 70 percent of the money for the war on drugs went to law enforcement, leaving only 30 percent to be spent on prevention and treatment.

HEADLINE: Mr. Havel's Profound Paradox

 BODY:
''You can help us most of all,'' Vaclav Havel told Congress Wednesday, ''if you help the Soviet Union on its irreversible but immensely complicated road to democracy.'' The Czech President, who embodies his country's emergence from Soviet domination, called this remark paradoxical. Maybe, but it also expresses a profound truth and suggests a wise course of action for the West. 
Eastern Europe's democratic revolution owes much to Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika. This revolution would surely be at risk if the reformers in Moscow fell victim to an authoritarian backlash. A restored hard-line regime in Moscow would do everything it could to eliminate nearby models of democracy that could inflame the Soviet people.
Mr. Havel did not spell out how the West could help democracy in the Soviet Union. He reiterated his support for East-West arms control treaties. In the past he has endorsed efforts to develop free markets in the Soviet Union and eventually tie them to the larger free trade economies of the West. President Bush and other Western leaders have made a good start in both areas.
But the import of Mr. Havel's words is that the West needs to do much more, and soon. Careful diplomacy and great tact will be required to engage proud Soviet leaders in such discussions. But there's no doubt the West could provide enormous help: technical assistance on everything from breaking transportation logjams to pumping oil; advice on how Moscow can best spend Western credits; the food aid and medical supplies that may also be necessary if Moscow is to navigate the next two years of retrenchment.
Mr. Havel is saying that the situation in the Soviet Union and the fate of Eastern Europe are inextricably linked. He is also courageously and sensibly asking the West to understand and act on that fact.

HEADLINE: New York Can't Go It Alone in the Fight to Control Acid Rain

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I read with interest ''Acid Rain: Plenty Bad Enough'' (editorial, Jan. 29), which strongly supports the need for Congress to enact national acid rain controls. As you indicate, the time to address this serious pollution problem has long since passed.
While the recent work by the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program has been noteworthy, I believe some additional facts regarding acid rain damage in New York and the state's efforts to address the problem need to be identified. 
New York began documenting the effects of acid rain in the 1970's. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, in conjunction with the Empire State Electric Energy Research Corporation, recently completed a four-year survey of 1,469 Adirondack lakes. Your editorial states that 11 percent of the lakes in the southwestern Adirondacks are already acidified, and 36 percent are in danger of becoming so. The problem is more widespread. The lakes study concluded that 24 percent of the Adirondack lakes are acidified and have a pH of less than 5. Eighteen percent of the lakes have a pH between 5 and 6, indicating that they have either been affected by acid rain or are threatened by this pollution. These results speak more strongly for immediate action than the assessment program's results.
Obviously, whenever possible, political solutions should be based upon sound scientific judgments. In that spirit, I signed the State Acid Deposition Control Act in 1984. As a result of this initiative, the state has clearly identified three major areas that are especially sensitive to acid deposits: the Adirondacks, the Catskills and the Hudson Highlands. The 1984 law also set forth requirements to reduce the level of sulfur dioxide emissions from New York State sources.
As a result, New York became the first state actually to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide in an effort to address the acid rain problem. In 1988 the first phase of reductions went into effect, and New York sulfur dioxide emissions have been reduced by more than 17 percent.
In the absence of a national initiative, New York has, like Minnesota, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, acted on its own to require reductions in the emissions that cause acid rain. However, the interstate transport of acid rain and acid rain precursors makes it impossible for individual states alone to solve the acid rain problem. Congress must move now to implement an acid rain program as part of its clean air debate.
Both Congress and the Administration have proposed a 10-million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions. We believe that, if properly targeted, 10 million tons is a reasonable minimum goal.
In addition, we support a proposal made by both the Administration and Congress to establish a cap on future emissions to assure that the benefits from actions we take are not eliminated by future growth.
New York State has led the way on acid rain control. I now repeat my plea to Congress and the Administration to resolve their remaining differences and to implement a strong national acid rain program that will protect New York, other areas of the country and Canada.

California French
The California grill called Melrose, in the West Village, has recently dropped its prices by about 20 percent to become a solid economy-priced spot called Barrow Street Bistro. The setting has been modified slightly - sponged ocher walls, paper tablecloths, soft lighting - and the food by Lynn McNeely, formerly of the now-defunct Alex Goes to Camp, on Third Avenue, is an appealing blend of down-home country French and subdued California. Fine starters include ricotta-filled ravioli in a fresh tomato sauce potent with garlic and basil ($5); leek-and-goat cheese tart with an exceptionally delicate crust ($7), and crisp rosti potatoes served with salmon tartar, creme fraiche and sevruga caviar ($8).
For main courses, there are a delicious rib-eye steak in a shallot-sweetened green peppercorn sauce, with Swiss chard and gratin potatoes ($19); fresh, mild calf's liver with pearl onions and raisins ($13), and grilled lamb chops with terrific green lentils cooked with balsamic vinegar and smoked bacon ($19). The only flub was grilled chicken that got too close to the flames, leaving it acrid ($11). Considering that food prices are moderate, it is odd to see a wine list on which three of the four California reds are Opus One, from $48 to $95. Be forewarned, too, that at this stage, the kitchen can be annoying slow. Barrow Street Bistro, 48 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South (691-6800), serves dinner 5:45 to 11 P.M. Tuesday to Saturday; 5 to 10 P.M. Sunday. Mastercard, Visa and American Express are accepted.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Sees End to Price Rises

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said today that the surge in consumer prices last month was an aberration, was unlikely to continue and might already have eased.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks, in response to questions from senators, appeared to signal that the Fed would not raise interest rates soon to counter inflationary pressures.
The chairman, the Government's most important economic policy maker, also repeated his view that the danger of recession had probably passed. Thus, the prospect seems to be that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates where they are for the time being. 
The Labor Department reported on Wednesday that consumer prices had soared 1.1 percent in January, the biggest monthly increase in more than seven years.
 
No Sign of Inflation
Asked about the figures today by members of the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said that looking at all the data available to him he saw no indication that the threat of inflation had become more serious.
''As best we can judge, while the rate of inflation is higher than we would like, there is no evidence that it is accelerating,'' he said.
He said he would be ''most surprised'' if the Consumer Price Index continued to rise markedly and predicted that it might begin to drop.
Both the stock and bond markets were bolstered by Mr. Greenspan's remarks, traders said, and his testimony apparently contributed to a strong gain in the benchmark 30-year bond. The Dow Jones industrial average, however, weakened during the day and closed off 8.79, at 2,574.77.
 
Sequel to House Testimony
By law, Mr. Greenspan must appear before House and Senate committees every six months to discuss the state of the economy and the outlook for monetary policy. His Senate testimony today was a sequel to his appearance on Tuesday before a House subcommittee.
In response to questions, he made these new points:
* The main cause of rising interest rates in West Germany and Japan is the ''extraordinary'' investment opportunities provided by the changed political climate in Eastern Europe.
* The economic slowdown in New England does not represent a recession but ''feels worse than it is'' because of the extent of the economic boom there in the late 1980's.
* Measures to increase personal savings should be rejected if they increase the Federal budget deficit.
If the implication is correct that the Federal Reserve plans to leave interest rates alone for the foreseeable future, that would mark a significant change from the policy last year. The Fed pushed rates up in increments for the first several months of 1989 to try to fight inflation and then let them slide gradually for the rest of the year as a hedge against recession.
In general, higher interest rates are a rein on the economy, and lower ones stimulate it.
 
Demand for Savings
Real interest rates - the rates in excess of the inflation rate - are abnormally high in the United States, Mr. Greenspan said, for two reasons. First, he said, the supply and demand for savings are out of balance, with little savings and a great demand for money for investment. Second, he added, high inflation rates in the past have left a residual fear that inflation will return. Real interest rates are now running more than 4 percent.
His remarks echoed those of analysts who commented on Wednesday, after the release of the consumer price data, that they did not view the surge as disturbing because of the special one-month factors that contributed to it.
Asked about interest rates in West Germany and Japan, Mr. Greenspan said the sharp rise since the first of the year had resulted much more from events in Eastern Europe than from a potential for inflation in those countries, and he said he doubted that there would be a long-term effect on interest rates here.
 
'No Historical Precedent'
The ''huge investment requirement'' and ''potential for significant rates of return'' in Eastern Europe have ''no historical precedent,'' Mr. Greenspan said. Interest rates have risen, he continued, because there were not enough savings in the world to finance all the investment opportunities, and that ''led the markets to grope for an equilibrium.''
By now, he said, the markets have accommodated the expectations, and he does not anticipate further steep rises in rates overseas.
Mr. Greenspan said unemployment in Massachusetts was only 4.5 percent in the last quarter of 1989, well below the national average. He said that New England's economy had advanced in the late 1980's ''at a pace that was clearly unsustainable'' and that ''the process of slowing down exaggerates the underlying weakness.''

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
German Options On Money Union

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
CHANCELLOR HELMUT KOHL means to use his country's powerful currency as the catalyst for uniting East and West Germany. A cardinal aim of Mr. Kohl's plan for rapid monetary union is to check the emigration of Eastern workers to the West. Far more than 400,000 East Germans have moved into West Germany, and the exodus is continuing at a rate of about 2,000 a week.
Last week, West Germany's five leading economic research institutes stated, in a letter to Mr. Kohl, that his plan for quick monetary union with the East would be costly and ineffective in slowing the migration of refugees to the West. The institutes, which are official and independent advisers to the Chancellor, said monetary union would not solve the ills plaguing the East's economy. The enormous excess money supply of East Germany, they said, should first be blotted up through the sale of state assets to individuals and companies. 
But Chancellor Kohl has rejected this criticism and also that of Prime Minister Hans Modrow of East Germany, who has complained bitterly of the West's unwillingness to provide immediate financial aid. Mr. Kohl means to hold back until after East Germany's first free elections on March 18, after which Mr. Modrow may be out of office.
Monetary union, with the valuable West German mark replacing the virtually worthless East German mark, would itself be a form of financial aid. And there is a good chance that introducing the West German mark in the East would accelerate the pace of economic reform. For the use of Western marks would restore a genuine relationship among East German wages, prices and productivity, and thereby get rid of the existing garble of monetary and economic relationships, sustained only by Government subsidies and controls. Substituting the West's marks for the East's would resemble the informal ''dollarization'' of economies in distress, like those of Argentina or Israel. But the use of dollars to replace national currencies, in the case of australs or shekels, was only a means of creating meaningful prices and providing a medium of exchange that would retain its value. The prospective German currency reform would go much deeper, linking wages, prices, productivity and profits. It would thereby set East Germany, with its entrepreneurial and technological traditions, on a course toward strong growth.
The best precedent for such a union was the currency reform of 1948, which set West Germany on its course toward becoming the most powerful economy in Europe. Adolphe Warner, an economic adviser to the Deutsche Bank, who served as deputy financial adviser to Gen. Lucius Clay in the United States military government after World War II, said in an interview this week that German monetary union should follow the basic pattern of the 1948 reform. That reform substituted the current marks for Reichmarks, which were in enormous surplus. The exchange took place at an average rate of 100 Reichmarks to 6.5 current marks. What is the right rate for exchanging marks now? Nobody can be sure, because the problems of valuation are extremely complex, and mixed with problems of macroeconomic management. The first and most essential job is to figure out the aggregate number of West German marks with which to replace the existing number of Eastern marks. If the substitution rate is too generous, there will be too much money and inflation will result. If the exchange rate is set too low, the aggregate money supply will be too small to sustain economic growth and high employment.
As in the 1948 monetary reform, different exchange rates could be used to meet different problems. For instance, the East's and West's marks might be exchanged one to one to provide retirement benefits and to sustain workers' earnings. That rate would tend to hold workers in the East. But beyond some per capita quota at the preferred rate, a much lower rate could be used to exchange the huge surplus of East German marks, held over in currency hoards or bank accounts, much of it gained in black markets. To mop up those surplus Eastern marks, Mr. Warner suggests an exchange rate of 10 to 1 - roughly midway between the former black-market rate of 13 Eastern marks to one Western mark and the more recent 6 to 1, which has been based on speculation that the East's marks would be converted.
Otto Lambsdorff, head of the Free Democratic Party, a partner in Chancellor Kohl's coalition Government, said in New York this week that although he, too, would have preferred to put economic reform ahead of monetary union, he thought monetary union would force the pace of economic restructuring in the East. He noted that ''capitalism'' remains a dirty word in the East and suggested using ''social market economy'' - the term coined by Ludwig Erhard, Economics Minister from 1949 to 1957 - as the basis for a new East German economy. A united Germany would remain firmly linked to Europe and to the West, he said, repeating Thomas Mann's plea for a ''European Germany, not a German Europe.''

Nearly 2 Years Later, Pennzoil Fills Position

BYLINE: By Daniel F. Cuff

 BODY:
The Pennzoil Company yesterday named James L. Pate its chief operating officer, filling a vacant post in its top management.
Mr. Pate, 54 years old, who has been an executive vice president at the energy company, will be responsible for its operating divisions and corporate functions.
The post of chief operating officer has been vacant since April 1988, when Randal B. McDonald became chief executive officer and the likely successor to J. Hugh Liedtke, who continues as chairman. Mr. McDonald, 58, who came to the company from the Arthur Young accounting firm, had long been associated with Mr. Liedtke and Pennzoil's financial dealings. 
Mr. Liedtke, 68, who took control of the company in 1962, has been the company's only chairman and longtime chief executive.
The company, based in Houston, has spent much of the $3 billion it was awarded in 1988 from Texaco Inc., after a four-year fight over Texaco's purchase of the Getty Oil Company. Pennzoil has bought 8.8 percent of the Chevron Corporation, the nation's fourth-largest energy company, and Chevron is seeking to force Pennzoil to sell the stock.
Mr. Pate, an economist by training, joined Pennzoil in 1976. He has served as the company's chief economist, among other positions. In 1981, he won the first annual Silbert Economic Forecasting award, sponsored by the Sterling National Bank and Trust Company, for accurate forecasting of the gross national product and the inflation rate.
In 1974, President Gerald R. Ford named Mr. Pate an assistant secretary of commerce, and the economist subsequently became a special adviser to the White House. He was also director of business research for the B. F. Goodrich Company, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and an economics professor at Monmouth College.
Mr. Pate was away from the company yesterday and was unavailable for an interview, a spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Late Selloff Pushes Dow 8.79 Points Lower

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stocks fell broadly yesterday, depressed by late selling, and after being nearly 30 points higher than its opening level about 2 P.M., the Dow Jones industrial average finished 8.79 points lower, at 2,574.77.
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange, which had trailed advances by nearly 2 to 1, finished ahead of gaining ones, 753 to 715.
Volume on the Big Board jumped to 184.3 million shares, many of which changed hands in the last hour of trading, from 159.2 million shares on Wednesday.
 
Early Session Action
''Near the beginning of the session, a lot of traders realized that what happened in Japan earlier in the week, when the Nikkei 225-stock index plunged 1,161.19 points, or 3.15 percent, to 35,734.33, was influenced by index-arbitrage sell programs, not just by interest rate concerns or institutions unloading stocks,'' said Peter G. Grennan, the head of stock index futures trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
The early market was also influenced positively by the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, who told the Senate Banking Committee yesterday that rises in food and energy prices last month would reverse and that there was no evidence of expanding inflation.
The traders said the stock market began to weaken in the afternoon when a firm using the strategy known as ''tactical asset allocation'' - the switching between stocks and bonds - executed a large sell program about 2 P.M.
''Such shifting of exposure is usually done through the futures market, which is the fastest and most efficient way to accomplish the switch,'' Mr. Grennan said.
Although American stocks ended on a negative note, some experts remained optimistic.
''The stock market is consolidating from an oversold condition,'' said Harold A. Mackinney, the head of the investment policy committee at the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in Providence, R.I. ''January's inflation results are now behind us, and they will represent the worst numbers for 1990. The bond market has overreacted to the recently released Producer Price Index and Consumer Price Index results, and significantly lower interest rates should be evident soon.''
 
Broader Gauges Fall
In the broader market yesterday, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks dropped by 1.97 points, to 325.70, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped by 0.79 point, to 180.28.
Among individual issues, UAL fell by 5 3/4, to 126 1/2. The parent of United Airlines, based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., said its board had not received an acquisition proposal from its employee groups or any other party.
Honeywell edged up by 3/4, to 77 3/8. Analysts attributed the rise to a conclusion by investors that the recently released earnings of the company for the fourth quarter showed that it was benefiting from a restructuring begun last year.
Pfizer plunged by 4 1/2, to 59 1/4. The company, whose artificial heart valves by its Shiley unit have been the subject of lawsuits, will appear on Monday at a Congressional hearing in Washington on regulation of the medical-device industry.
 
Active Blue Chips
In other active blue-chip trading, Philip Morris rose by 1/2, to 38 1/8; I.B.M was off by 1 5/8, to 103 1/4, and A.T.& T. fell by 5/8, to 38 1/8.
On the American Stock Exchange, the Amex market-value index rose by 0.40 point, to 353.35, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index gained 1.23 points, to 422.75.
In over-the-counter trading, Apple Computer dropped by a point, to 33. The analysts said they expected more layoffs and price cuts on products than the company, based in Cupertino, Calif., has announced in recent days as it tries to lower costs to increase earnings and revenues.
Lin Broadcasting dropped 3 points, to 109. The traders said a Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette analyst, Dennis Leibowitz, had removed the New York-based company from his list of recommended stocks, cutting his rating to ''moderately attractive.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Late Rally Sends Prices Soaring

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
A late rally sent prices of Treasury securities soaring and yields tumbling yesterday.
Dealers said a combination of positive market factors developed in the afternoon that caused heavy buying of Treasury paper, especially long-term bonds.
In late trading, for example, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.5 percent issue maturing in 2020, were being offered at 99 12/32, up by 26/32, while the yield dropped to 8.56 percent, from 8.64 percent the day before. The long notes, the 8.5 percent ones of the year 2000, climbed by 14/ 32, to 99 25/32, with the yield falling to 8.53 percent, from 8.60 percent. 
 
'Classic Market Squeeze'
''What we witnessed today was a textbook example of a classic market squeeze,'' said Jonathan B. Greenspan, the chief trader at the Aegis Capital Management Corporation. ''There were four key ingredients for a squeeze in place when the buying panic began just before the close of the Chicago bond futures market at 3 o'clock, New York time.''
First off, most institutional and other retail investors have been absent from the bond market this week. This caused nervous dealers and speculators to protect themselves against a price decline by selling securities short, which involves selling contracts in the futures market of equivalent value to the securities held. If securities prices rise, those who have sold futures contracts, which are promises to buy or sell a certain amount of goods at a specified price by a certain deadline, will have to buy them back at a higher price. The value of the securities they own, however, will have risen.
In the early afternoon, it became apparent that strong Japanese interest contributed to the $30.1 billion in bids that were placed for the $8 billion in five-year Treasury notes auctioned yesterday, and that sale went well. Auctioned at an average yield of 8.53 percent for a 8.5 percent coupon, the notes quickly went to a premium, with the yield falling to 8.46 percent.
To further unnerve the short-sellers, the dollar was higher against the Japanese yen. Some of the dealers said this encouraged substantial Japanese interest in the five-year note sale.
 
Demand for 8.5% Notes
More bad news for the shorts came when $10 billion in 8.5 percent notes, which were auctioned on Wednesday at an average yield of 8.50 percent, were also in demand yesterday and fell to a yield of 8.39 percent late in the session.
The final blow for short-sellers came just before the close of the Treasury bond futures market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The spot March contract closed up by 1.1 points, to 93.4. Mr. Greenspan of Aegis Capital Management said that ''many shorts who could not or would not buy out of their contracts in Chicago came into the New York cash market and bought Treasury paper to offset their positions and thus prevent further losses.''
Robert H. Chandross, the chief economist at Lloyds Bank, said some of the short-covering that developed yesterday in Chicago and spilled over into cash market might have also reflected the generally positive sentiment that pervaded the fixed-income market at the time.
''For one, the Government reported a $9.9 billion surplus for last month,'' Mr. Chandross said. ''With this week's note auctions out of the way, there won't be much new Treasury paper coming to market for a while, and the unexpected comments by chairman Greenspan before the Senate Banking Committee this morning also helped improve market sentiment.''
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Senate panel that inflation pressures were not as serious as suggested by the 1.1 percent jump in the Consumer Price Index for January. Some of the credit market analysts interpreted this as paving the way for the Fed to lower interest rates without seeming to concede to White House and Congressional pressures to ease credit and thus stimulate the economy. Most had expected the Fed chairman to reiterate his fears that inflation remained a threat.
 
Stopping 'Well Short'
''Mr. Greenspan stopped well short of promising to ease credit,'' Mr. Chandross of Lloyds Bank said. ''Perhaps overlooked in his testimony was that domestic interest rates should be attractive enough to encourage the inflow of foreign capital. We don't think the Fed is about to ease.''
As for the central bank, it again refrained from intervening in the money market. The primary interest cost, the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans, held at 8 5/16 percent for most of the day.
Meanwhile, discount rates on Treasury bills continued to fall. The rate on the 90-day bills dropped by 9 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.70 percent; six-month bills lost 4 basis points, at 7.70 percent, and the one-year bills declined by 6 basis points, to 7.58 percent.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of five-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Average Price	99.805	Average Yield	8.53%	Low Price	99.805	High Yield	8.53%	High Price	99.847	Low Yield	8.52%	Accepted at low price	52%	Total applied for	$30,131,200	Accepted	$8,044,920	N.Y. applied for	$28,074,614	N.Y. accepted	$7,477,934	Noncompetitive	$464,000	Interest set at	8 1/2%

HEADLINE: British Curb On Rate Swaps

 BODY:
Britain's Court of Appeal ruled yesterday that interest rate swaps are legal for local government authorities if they are used to limit interest rate risks but not if they are used for speculative trading for profit.
 
The decision involved the
Hammersmith and Fulham Council, which made dozens of speculative interest rate swaps totaling 6 billion (about $11 billion) that were not needed to manage its debt of 350 million. 
 
Last year, the London High
Court ruled that those swap agreements were not legal because the council was not authorized to trade speculatively.
By voiding the swap agreements, that ruling could have caused losses of $150 million for major American, Japanese and British banks. Banks led by Midland Bank, Barclays Bank, Security Pacific National Bank, Chemical Bank, and Mitsubishi Finance appealed.
The appeals court ruled that local British authorities may enter into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of limiting rate risk.
In interest rate swaps, companies, local governments and banks agree to exchange interest rate payments on their borrowings for a specified period of time.

Dollar Closes Mostly Lower But Posts Gain Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose to its highest level since September against the yen but finished mostly lower against other major currencies yesterday.
Gold prices fell worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $415.70 an ounce, down $2.30 from late Wednesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold of $416.20, off $1.60. 
The dollar rose to its highest level since September against the yen, which languished amid dimmed prospects for higher interest rates in Japan. The market has been expecting the Bank of Japan to raise the nation's discount rate.
''Japan's interest rates are a lot lower than everybody else's interest rates,'' said Bob Morrissey, senior trader at the Bank of Boston. ''Given that, people are looking for a much weaker yen.''
High interest rates make a nation's fixed-income securities attractive to investors, who need that nation's currency to make their investments.
Earlier in Europe, the dollar put in a mixed performance while confined to well-established ranges. When trading shifted to the United States, the dollar appeared to firm but ultimately finished lower against all major currencies except the yen.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.23 yen, up 0.08 yen from Wednesday's close. In New York the dollar continued to rise, closing at 146.53 yen, up from 145.50 yen on Wednesday.
In New York trading, the price of a British pound was $1.7133, up from $1.7125 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.6717 West German marks, down from 1.6725; 1.4755 Swiss francs, down from 1.4795; 5.6620 French francs, down from 5.6730; 1,236.00 Italian lire, down from 1,238.00, and 1.1949 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1983.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $417.45 an ounce, from $418.85 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold closed at $417.25, down $2.25 from late Wednesday. Gold in Hong Kong dropped $2.85 to close at $416.83.
Silver prices also fell. On the Comex in New York, silver for current delivery slipped to $5.268 an ounce, from $5.272 on Wednesday. In London, silver fell to $5.28, from $5.33 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East: The Germanys;
Bush to Press Kohl at Camp David On Easing Poland's Border Fears

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
When President Bush meets over the weekend with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he will urge the West German leader to calm Polish concerns about the future of the Polish-German border, Administration officials said today.
Mr. Kohl arrives on Saturday morning for two days of talks with Mr. Bush in the informal atmosphere of Camp David, the Presidential retreat near Thurmont, Md.
Mr. Bush will ask Mr. Kohl to clarify his timetable for German unification and will urge him to address Polish concerns about the boundary between Poland and Germany, the Administration officials said. Poland has asked for guarantees that the current border, along the Oder and Neisse rivers, be made permanent and that a united Germany formally forswear any effort to reclaim part of prewar Germany that is under Polish control. 
Poland's apprehensions are rooted in history. Poland has often been a victim of German aggression. Germany invaded Poland in 1939, and the Nazis occupied Poland in World War II.
So far Mr. Kohl has been ambiguous about the border. When traveling abroad, he says Germany has no intention of tampering with the boundaries established after World War II. But when he is in Germany, he says the issue can be decided only by the parliament of a united Germany.
Mr. Kohl's vagueness is motivated in part by domestic politics. He does not want to lose the votes of strongly conservative Germans who might want to reassert territorial claims in western Poland.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Kohl are also expected to discuss ways to keep a united Germany in NATO and defy heavy Soviet pressure to weaken German links with the Atlantic alliance.
Mr. Kohl is expected to ask Mr. Bush to support a speed-up in the process of unification that would conceivably permit East Germans to vote in West Germany's December elections.
The visiting German leader is expected to contend that only rapid unification can avert the economic and political collapse of East Germany and stem the flood tide of East Germans leaving for West Germany.
Mr. Kohl's visit comes just three weeks before East Germans go to the polls to choose a new government. One of the chief functions of the new government will probably be negotiating the terms of union with West Germany.
 
Food Subsidies Reduced
In the last few weeks, East Germany's economic crisis has become more severe. Alarmed at the reduction in Government food subsidies, East Germans have rushed to buy flour, sugar and meat, and the East German Government has promised emergency measures to keep up basic food supplies.
West German officials now say that East Germany might seek union as soon as possible after its March 18 elections.
Robert Gerald Livingston, director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said that under the West German ''constitution'' - the Basic Law of May 23, 1949 - the constituent states of East Germany could vote to become part of West Germany. American officials say they believe that some of the East German states, or Lander, might do just that after the elections next month.
American and West German officials said Mr. Kohl would probably discuss that possibility with Mr. Bush when they meet over the weekend. The West German Interior Minister, Wolfgang Schauble, apparently discussed it with American officials when he was in Washington this week to help prepare for Mr. Kohl's visit.
 
'Reconstituting the Lander'
A Western diplomat said tonight that Germans were ''thinking more and more'' about that provision of the Constitution, Article 23, as a vehicle for the swift unification of the Germanys.
Mr. Kohl's plan for German unity, issued in December, made no reference to that article. But ''things are moving so fast in Germany'' that there is increasing interest in the constitutional procedure for incorporating East German states into West Germany.
After the March 18 elections, Mr. Livingston said, ''the East German Parliament will probably pass a law reconstituting the Lander'' abolished in 1952. Then in May of this year, he said, the constituent states of East Germany will elect their own legislatures, which could adopt resolutions to merge with West Germany.
Thus, it appears that Mr. Bush will get the clarification he seeks on Mr. Kohl's timetable for unifying Germany, and the Chancellor will make clear that he wants to achieve that goal sooner rather than later. Administration officials said that Mr. Bush believed it was in the long-term strategic interest of the United States for Germany to be unified and solidly anchored in the West.
Mr. Bush is expected to use his meeting with Mr. Kohl to underline the importance of continued German membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr. Bush will probably urge Mr. Kohl to stand firm in support of that position as a way to reassure his neighbors in Western and Eastern Europe that they have nothing to fear from a unified Germany.
 
Kohl's Vision of Unification
In Canada on Feb. 13, East and West Germany and the four major World War II Allies agreed on a framework for negotiating German unification after 45 years of division. Under that formula, the ''two plus four'' concept, the two Germanys would discuss the economic, political and legal aspects of unification. Then the four Allies would meet with the two Germanys to discuss security issues like the size of the army for a unified state and its ties to NATO.
'' 'Two plus four' is a misnomer,'' Mr. Livingston said. ''It will be one plus four. The Germans will come into those discussions with a united delegation. They'll come in under one flag.'' Administration officials said Mr. Kohl would discuss such questions when he lays out his vision of a unified Germany at Camp David this weekend.
The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said Mr. Bush and Mr. Kohl would talk about ''the full range of issues related to changes in Eastern Europe,'' including the future of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
''We don't anticipate any new agreements or announcements,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. Rather, he said, the weekend provides ''an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss the status of events, where they think things are going.''

HEADLINE: DOUBTS ON SUPPLY SPUR PREDICTIONS OF HIGH OIL PRICES

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
New doubts about the world's ability to pump enough oil to keep pace with growing demand have convinced many analysts that oil prices will rise much more rapidly than previously expected, by about 50 percent within five years.
Increases are typically passed along to consumers fairly quickly, which means prices for gasoline and heating oil would rise sharply. From 1975 to 1981, a period when a barrel of oil went from about $13 to over $36, gasoline prices in this country more than doubled, from 58 cents a gallon to $1.33.
Until recently, most oil executives and analysts had anticipated that prices, now averaging about $20 for a 42-gallon barrel, would rise at a rate slightly above inflation during the 1990's, to not more than about $25 a barrel by 1995. But now they say $30 oil is likely by then. 
Many analysts say the supply-demand balance has been shifted by factors including declining output in the United States and the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producers outside OPEC; moves by newly independent Eastern European nations to buy oil from the Persian Gulf; energy demand in East Asia that is growing far faster than had been expected, and constraints on production arising in the oil-rich Persian Gulf.
 
'A Lot of Imponderables'
The speed of the climb in oil prices ''will catch a lot of people by surprise,'' said Mehdi Varzi, head of energy research at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. ''By 1995, it is more than likely that we would have $30 oil.''
George F. Friesen, an analyst at the Deutsche Bank Capital Corporation in New York, said, ''There are a lot of imponderables, but I would say the risk of oil prices spiking is greater now than at any time in the last 10 years.'' He also said $30-a-barrel oil by 1995 is a strong possibility.
In interviews, about two dozen industry executives, securities analysts, consultants and economists agreed that future price increases for oil might be much steeper than had been predicted even six months ago.
 
Many Nations Taking Steps
A far smaller number disagreed, contending, among other things, that many nations anticipating such price increases are already taking steps to mitigate them, including installing more energy-efficient equipment and switching to alternative fuels like natural gas. These experts also say the Persian Gulf producers will be able to expand production capacity to meet whatever demand exists in five years.
A surge in oil prices would threaten the economies of major oil-consuming nations like the United States, Japan and West Germany with rising inflation, higher interest rates and slower growth or recession. Many economists attributed the 1981-82 recession in the United States, the worst since World War II, to the sharp increase in oil prices in 1979.
Within the United States, property values and employment would rise in energy-producing states like Texas, Colorado and Alaska, and decline in the Northeast and Midwest, said Stephen P. A. Brown, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
With every $1 increase in oil prices, Texas adds 15,000 jobs and New York State loses 11,000, Mr. Brown said. The nation as a whole loses 78,000 jobs for every $1 rise, he said.
The nation's trade deficit, which included $49 billion in payments for imported oil in 1989, would soar with rising oil prices. Then, over time, some combination of conservation, a slowing economy, rising domestic oil production and more use of alternative fuels would ease import demand, economists say.
Because of the change in the supply-and-demand picture for oil, the widely held view now is that the average price for West Texas Intermediate crude, the American benchmark grade, will exceed $20 a barrel this year for the first time since 1985. The price of West Texas crude fell to $21.42 a barrel yesterday, and has remained above $21 throughout the winter even though unusually warm weather has lowered heating-oil demand since the year began. The average figure last year was $19.65, and in 1988 it was $15.98.
Most analysts expect the price to decline to below $19 a barrel by late March, when demand usually slows.
 
Trends Becoming Clear
But the price could well rise again after that, many industry experts said, because of trends that have become clearer in recent months. For one thing, global consumption has been growing - by an average of more than a million barrels a day since prices collapsed in 1986, to 52.1 million barrels a day last year, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris. Global consumption - excluding the Soviet Union, China and Eastern Europe - is expected to break the 11-year-old record of 52.3 million barrels a day this year.
Many economists say the rapid growth of demand in the Far East, where many nations' rapidly industrializing economies are growing quickly, will keep demand rising at close to that rate even if United States demand does not grow.
In Japan, the Government three years ago estimated growth in total energy use at 1 percent a year. But after a surge that put the total above 5 percent in 1988, the Government revised its estimate to an average of 3.2 percent through the 1990's.
Private economists also expect the growth in energy use in Southeast Asia to average 5 percent a year through 2000. Oil use is also rising rapidly in South Korea, where gasoline demand soared by 27 percent and 29 percent in the last two years.
 
Lower Soviet Exports
Eastern Europe could add three million barrels to demand for OPEC oil in this decade because the Soviet Union, with limited oil available for export, is starting to export less to the former Communist bloc, said David T. Mizrahi, editor of the Mideast Report in New York.
At the same time, the world's supply-and-demand picture for oil is being changed by falling production in the Soviet Union and the United States. In the last year, those two nations have together reduced output by about 5 percent, or a million barrels a day, to about 19 million barrels a day.
As a whole, non-OPEC nations -excluding the Soviet Union, China and Eastern Europe - are pumping about 29 million barrels a day, or about the amount they were when oil prices collapsed in January 1986.
But over the same period the 13 OPEC nations have raised output by nearly five million barrels a day, to an average of 21.7 million last year, meeting virtually all the extra demand.
 
Question Is Changing
Indeed, the question about OPEC is changing from whether the group can limit oil production enough to keep world oil prices at whatever levels it wants, to whether it can expand its ability to pump oil enough to match rising demand, experts say.
Some analysts say the Persian Gulf OPEC nations - Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia - will be unable to add enough capacity to overcome production declines elsewhere within OPEC. Three other members, Algeria, Gabon and Ecuador, are not expected to be exporting much oil, if any, by 2000.
OPEC's Secretary General, Subroto, said in Houston this month that OPEC sees demand for its oil rising to 29 million barrels a day in 1995. To meet it, he said, OPEC must expand daily capacity by at least a million barrels in each of the next five years.
Dr. Subroto, who is from Indonesia, said OPEC must spend $60 billion to add this capacity, and he called on governments, bankers and private oil companies in oil-consuming nations to link arms with the organization on the project. Both sides have a large stake in keeping oil prices stable, he said.
Dr. Subroto's contention is that without some combination of loans, investments and technical help from major oil-consuming nations like the United States and Japan, OPEC may be unable to keep its oil-pumping capacity ahead of rising demand. Western and Japanese bankers and private oil companies are wary of expanding ties with the Arab oil producers.
Dr. Subroto said OPEC nations fear a sharp increase in prices, remembering the early 1980's, when high prices slashed long-term demand and sent many of their economies into hard times.
 
Less Competition for OPEC
By contrast, analysts say, if oil prices rise only modestly, OPEC oil will face less competition from increased production in non-OPEC nations, where drilling costs are higher than in the Persian Gulf, as well as from conservation and uses of other fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or nuclear energy.
The organization's current view is that it can keep demand for OPEC oil growing if prices average $18 a barrel, adjusted for inflation, over the next several years. At current inflation rates, the nominal price for OPEC oil would rise to about $23.40 a barrel in 1995 if OPEC can keep its output matched to growing world demand.
Many analysts and economists are skeptical of OPEC's assertions that it needs help in expanding its capacity, and question the group's real intentions. And some say the worries about a coming global production shortage in oil are vastly overblown.
M. A. Adelman, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, estimated that Arab oil producers could easily finance five million more barrels of capacity from their own revenues at a cost of less than $6 billion. Most of the new production, and money, will come from Saudi Arabia, he said. That nation, already with a fourth of the world's known reserves, recently announced discoveries of large oilfields.
Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy analyst at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said Saudi Arabia could expand its production capacity in five years ''without an enormous capital expenditure.'' Privately, Dr. Subroto has put the total required by Saudi Arabia at $30 billion, a figure many analysts dismiss as extravagantly high.

HEADLINE: BUSH PICKS A CHIEF TO LEND NEW LIFE TO RIGHTS PANEL

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
President Bush selected Arthur A. Fletcher today as chairman of the troubled Civil Rights Commission, a move that civil rights leaders lauded as a signal that the Bush Administration was taking the commission more seriously than the Reagan Administration did.
Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, said today that by nominating Mr. Fletcher, Mr. Bush hoped to show that he wants to restore the commission as ''an effective institution.''
''We have felt that it could be stronger and more forceful in representing the concerns of minorities and others and we expect it to operate in that fashion,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. ''We think they can do a better job.'' 
 
Longtime Bush Supporter
Mr. Fletcher, who is 65 years old, served as Assistant Secretary of Labor in the Nixon Administration, as a deputy Presidential assistant for urban affairs under President Gerald R. Ford and as an adviser to President Reagan. He is now a management consultant in Washington.
Mr. Fletcher said that the President had promised him ''open access'' today and had told him about the commission, in essence: ''You got the ball. Invigorate it.''
The new chairman said his first move would be a blanket review of ''every piece of civil rights legislation passed in the last 25 years.''
 
Restoring Panel's Reputation
''In the light of what is happening to the economy both domestically and internationally, the Civil Rights Commission needs to take a hard look at each piece of civil rights legislation passed by the Congress and make some determination about whether it is effective as it stands or needs improvement.''
He said he would try to restore the commission's old reputation as the conscience of the nation.
Civil rights groups, which complained that in the Reagan era the commission was discredited as the Government's enforcer of civil rights, praised the selection of Mr. Fletcher, who must be approved by the other members of the commission.
''It's a good signal to the civil rights community,'' said Althea T. L. Simmons, the director of the Washington bureau of the N.A.A.C.P. ''By selecting someone to serve as chair with some credentials in civil rights, it proves that the President has some sensitivity with reference to the commission.''
 
Concern About Overall Shape
But Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of more than 180 organizations, said he worries that the overall tenor of the commission is still far too conservative. ''Regardless of the Fletcher appointment,'' he said, ''there are too many right-wingers on the commission to restore its credibility.''
He said he wanted to see how Mr. Bush proceeded with other appointments to the commission, adding that the President would also have to work with Congress to make the commission once again bipartisan and independent.
Mr. Fitzwater said there was another vacancy on the eight-member commission that will be filled soon. Congress appoints four of its members and the President appoints four.
The commission was established in 1957 to evaluate Federal laws and the effectiveness of the Government's equal opportunity programs. It also serves as a research center for civil rights information. The panel has no enforcement authority.
During the 1980's, the commission became a battleground where Reagan Administration officials and representatives of minority groups fought over competing visions of civil rights and equality.
A year ago, Administration officials indicated that Mr. Bush wanted to name Mr. Fletcher to the commission and later to the chairmanship, but the chairman, William Barclay Allen, refused to resign.
 
'What Is a Minority?'
Also last year, Mr. Allen was arrested at gunpoint on an Indian reservation in Arizona. The incident, in which Mr. Allen was questioned by the police and released, involved an allegation that he had kidnapped a 14-year-old Apache girl in an adoption case in which he had taken an interest. His colleagues on the commission learned of the incident only weeks later from Arizonans in Congress.
Mr. Allen also angered the other commissioners by delivering a speech titled ''Blacks? Animals? Homosexuals? What Is a Minority?'' The speech was formally condemned by a 6-1 vote of the commission as ''thoughtless, disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory.''
 
Resignation Last Year
Hitting back at the Bush Administration as ''too reticent to contribute to the debate on civil rights,'' Mr. Allen finally agreed to resign late last year, with three years left of his term.
The commission has been criticized by civil rights groups who say it has become irrelevant. During the Reagan Administration, they complained that the President was stacking the commission with conservatives who took positions opposing affirmative action.
In the 1980's the commission lost its reputation as a bipartisan body. It was rent by a highly political internal debate over the basic principles of civil rights and the meaning of equality.
 
With Bush at United Nations
Mr. Fletcher was executive director of the United Negro College Fund for two years in the early 1970's, and in that period he also served with George Bush, the chief United States delegate, at the United Nations. Mr. Fletcher was an alternate United States representative to the 26th session of the General Assembly.
He was born in Phoenix and graduated from Washburn University in 1950. He did graduate work at Kansas State University and San Francisco State College.
Mr. Fletcher's involvement in the civil rights movement began early. In 1954, he was teaching in a rural elementary school in Kansas and, stunned by the unfair treatment of black students, helped raise money for the pending Brown vs. School Board of Topeka desegregation suit, which was successfully fought up to the United States Supreme Court.
In 1969, as President Nixon's Assistant Secretary of Labor, Mr. Fletcher fought for affirmative action and issued the order that spurred enforcement of the Equal Employment Opportunity Law.
He said his background made him want to try to get as much as he could out of government for the nation's nonwhite labor force.
Mr. Fletcher, who is 6 feet 4 inches tall, also played end for the Los Angeles Rams and the Baltimore Colts in the early 1950's. The career was brief, cut short by an injury.
He is known as a talkative and good-natured man who likes a good argument, and he says he has had his share of arguments over the years with blacks who did not understand how he could work for Republican Presidents.
Asked why he had become a Republican, Mr. Fletcher replied: ''I'm from the state of Kansas, where all blacks are Republicans. As a kid coming up, the role models I saw, lawyers, doctors, schoolteachers and businessmen, were all Republicans.''

HEADLINE: Anger in Congress Over Aquino's Snub

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
President Corazon C. Aquino's refusal to meet with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney during his visit to the Philippines this week has stirred anger among Democrats and Republicans in Congress and accelerated proposals for moving American forces from that country to other locations in the Pacific region.
At a White House meeting this week, Congressional leaders from both parties expressed their dismay to President Bush over the diplomatic snub, echoing in more subdued terms some of the angrier comments expressed by legislators in floor speeches and comments over the last several days. Members of the House were particularly sharp in their criticism of Mrs. Aquino, and some suggested that cutbacks in American aid to the Philippines might also come.
Representative Toby Roth, a Wisconsin Republican who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, noted that the United States had given hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Philippines and that Mr. Bush had assisted Mrs. Aquino's Government in December by calling in American fighter planes to help put down a coup attempt. 
''I have a solution to the problem,'' he said. ''Let them keep their bases. We do not want them, we do not need them. They are only an albatross around the neck of the American people.''
 
Domestic Needs Cited
Mr. Roth said there were plenty of domestic needs for which money now going abroad could be used.
''We like the people of the Philippines, but it is incumbent upon us to send them a strong message,'' he said. ''America is a strong horse willing to pull a heavy load, but we are not a dairy cow to be milked.''
The Subic Bay Naval Station and Clark Air Base are the principal American military installations in Southeast Asia and among the largest outside the United States. There are about 18,000 American military personnel in the Philippines, and 20,000 dependents. The United States is one of the major employers in the country.
In recent years, rising nationalism in the Philippines has made the bases a political target of rebels on the left and of more moderate opposition members who believe Mrs. Aquino is too close to the United States.
The 1947 lease covering six American installations including Clark and Subic Bay is scheduled to expire in 1991 unless the two nations can negotiate a new agreement.
Lawmakers in the United States are irritated at the direct linkage the Philippine Government appears to be making between the bases and increased economic aid. ''There has always been Congressional concern that we are paying rent through foreign aid even though those bases are supposed to serve mutual security interests,'' said a foreign policy aide to Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Senate Appropriations Subcommitee on Foreign Operations.
 
Inaccurate News Reports Charged
A week before Mr. Cheney's visit, Mrs. Aquino announced that she would not meet with the Defense Secretary, saying American news reports had inaccurately characterized her discussions with other American officials who had visited recently.
Mrs. Aquino also complained that Washington had failed to live up to a 1988 aid agreement covering the last two years of the bases agreement because this year's allotment had been reduced by $96 million. Still, the Philippines ranks among the top five recipients of American aid.
Mrs. Aquino's complaints about the cuts in aid were generally supported by politicians in the Philippines, and some lawmakers here said they understood Mrs. Aquino's political need to demonstrate her independence from Washington. But even those most sympathetic to her said she had gone to far in refusing to see Mr. Cheney.
''I think that Mrs. Aquino's action was regrettable because the United States has been a great friend to the Philippines,'' said Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for making foreign aid allocations.
Mr. Obey said the Philippines received $289 million in assistance last year and $467 million this year. ''If that's a loser, I'd hate to see a winner,'' he said. ''I think it comes with ill grace to the Philippine Government to object to a 62 percent increase over last year.'' He said this was the largest increase for any country in the foreign aid bill.
The Administration has already been reviewing alternatives to the Philippine bases. According to Congressional officials, Guam and Singapore have been examined as possible relocation sites for some installations.

HEADLINE: Ex-Trustee Buys College At Bankruptcy Auction

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Feb. 23

 BODY:
In what is thought to mark the first time that an entire educational campus was put on the auction block because of bankruptcy, Bishop College, once the largest black college in the Western United States, was sold this morning after years of scandal and financial distress.
When the bidding started, there was talk among spectators that the 130 acres and 22 buildings would be sold in parcels to real estate developers.
But when the gavel fell, the new owner was Comer J. Cottrell, a former trustee of the college, who paid $1.5 million for the property with buildings now boarded and crumbling. He plans to turn it back into a predominantly black college, perhaps as early as next year. 
 
'A Lot of Love Into That Place'
''I put a lot of love into that place,'' said a tearful Mr. Cottrell, a 58-year-old Dallas businessman who resigned from Bishop's board in 1986, two years before the college closed. ''It won't be precisely what it was before. It will be a college that is operated as a business.''
If ever a college was sold at a bankruptcy auction before today, nobody seems to know when. ''It's the first one that we've ever done,'' said Dick Ritchie, president of Assets Liquidators, which handled today's proceeding and has sold everything from hotels to marinas. ''I don't know of anyone who's auctioned a college.''
Last year, the Robert Morris College campus in Carthage, Ill., was put up for auction because of falling enrollment, not bankruptcy, and a community group submitted the only bid. The campus is expected to reopen as a school for Hispanic students.
At Bishop, the unusual sale was the latest twist in a story that began in 1881 when Bishop was founded by nine freed slaves and a group of Baptist missionaries. The college was named for Nathan Bishop, a white Union Army colonel who gave the money to start the college. It was originally in Marshall, Tex., but moved here in 1961 and flourished with Dallas's economy.
At its height in the early 1970's, the enrollment was nearly 2,000, and the college had a national reputation for producing Baptist preachers.
 
Falsification of Loan Applications
But in 1974, 15 administrators were charged with falsifying names on applications for student loans and cashing the loan checks themselves. Most of the group was convicted.
Five years later, the president and two top administrators were indicted on charges of mismanaging Bishop's finances. The president and one administrator were acquitted, and the second administrator was convicted on minor charges.
But the two incidents were the begining of the end for Bishop. Donations dwindled, and the school's annual budget, once over $9 million, dropped by a third. Enrollment began to decrease too, reaching a low of 300 when the doors closed in August 1988.
Mr. Cottrell, who owns the Pro-Line Corporation, a hair-products concern that is the 18th-largest black-owned business in the nation, played a prominent role in efforts to avert the school's collapse.
 
Layoffs and Fund-Raising Drives
In 1981, a year after an audit showed that the college owed $3.5 million to the Federal Government, Mr. Cottrell was named acting chairman, a position he held for five years. His tenure saw sharp layoffs and ambitious fund-raising drives, but to no avail. By 1986 the school was $7 million in debt. That year it lost its accreditation.
By 1988 the debt had grown to $20 million and a bankruptcy judge ordered that the property, already whittled down to 130 acres from 400 acres, be sold.
The attempts to sell the property were as ill-fated as the attempts to save the college. Last year, Panditha Sujatha Nadarajah, a wealthy American woman of Sri Lankan descent who lived in Lubbock and preached the Buddhist faith, offered $10 million for the property and left ten sapphires worth $75,000 as collateral.
She then went to Sri Lanka for the remainder of the money but was detained there when local gem dealers accused her of defrauding them of $4.2 million. The woman said she was being held hostage in her hotel room in Sri Lanka. The bankruptcy judge overseeing the Bishop case disqualified her offer and ordered that the property be auctioned.
 
Bidding Takes 10 Minutes
The bidding today, in a hotel conference room here, took only 10 minutes. Though there were dozens of spectators, only two people bid, Mr. Cottrell and a man in sunglasses and a blue suede jacket who left immediately after the auction.
The minimum bid was $1 million, and Mr. Cottrell said no one was more surprised than he when his $1.5 million bid was accepted.
''I expected to go about $5 million,'' he said, still shaking after the gavel sounded. ''Maybe that's why I'm so emotional.''
He said he did not know where he would obtain the estimated $40 million to renovate the crumbling campus, and had not decided whether to change its name.
''I just know it will be a college again,'' he said, adding that he hoped the first classes could be held in the fall of 1991. ''It will be in business and filled with kids, because I'm going to be electric.''

HEADLINE: Pittsburgh Urged to Revive Mills To Turn Out High-Speed Trains

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Carnegie Mellon University proposed today that Pittsburgh become the nation's center for manufacturing high-speed railroad lines that are being considered by many states.
The university's proposal, which was based on a six-month study in conjunction with executives of major Pittsburgh corporations, envisions a public-private venture that would use the city's idled steel mills to build high-speed trains and tracks.
As a start, the study recommends laying a $400 million, 19-mile line from downtown Pittsburgh to the Greater Pittsburgh International Airport, which is undergoing a $600 million expansion.
The proposal includes magnetic levitation, or maglev, in which powerful electromagnets raise passenger cars about six inches above a guideway and then propel them at up to 300 miles an hour. High-speed trains with steel wheels are slower and more costly to maintain. 
 
Overseas Prototypes Rolling
Many states are studying maglev as a way to modernize rail lines and relieve airport and highway congestion, and prototypes of maglev trains are carrying passengers on test tracks in West Germany and Japan.
The Department of Transportation, which committed $10 million to study maglev this year, estimates that if no improvements are made, traffic jams will waste 12 billion working hours a year by 2005 and airline delays will cost passengers $13 billion a year by 2005. Both estimates reflect a 400 percent increase over 1985.
''Maglev is the future,'' Dr. Richard M. Cyert, president of Carnegie-Mellon University, said before the announcement. ''It is also critical to the future of Pittsburgh.
 
More Businesses and Jobs
Seven years ago, he said, the university sought to develop a computer software industry in Pittsburgh, and now over 60,000 people work here in more than 600 high-technology businesses.
Carnegie Mellon's research was supported by city and county agencies, unions and half a dozen major Pittsburgh corporations, including AEG Westinghouse Transportation Systems, Union Switch & Signal and the USX Corporation. They have formed a corporation, Maglev Inc., that will conduct a final two-year study of technical and financial issues.
Pennsylvania has contributed $300,000 toward the $1.5 million study. A consortium of Japanese companies pledged $250,000 for it today.
''A new transportation system is an essential factor for the success of the U.S. economy,'' said Jitsuro Terashima, a spokesman for the consortium and general manager of strategic information and corporate planning for Mitsui and Company, a trading company.
 
Reawakening the Steel Mills
The Carnegie Mellon researchers reported that $27 billion worth of similar projects are under study and that the nation might ultimately spend $211 billion on maglev systems built in vacant Pittsburgh steel mills. Federal support is considered crucial in starting most maglev projects.
Another consortium of Japanese and German companies have agreed to build a 20-mile maglev system between Orlando International Airport and the Epcot Center at Disney World. The goal is to begin operation of that system on Oct. 1, 1994. Other potential routes under study are Boston-Washington, Boston-Albany, Cleveland-Chicago, Detroit-Montreal and Quebec City, Philadelphia-Harrisburg, PIttsburgh-Cleveland, Miami-Jacksonville, Tampa-Orlando and San Francisco-San Diego.
''There are circumstances in which high-speed rail is a good investment,'' said Louis S. Thompson, a railroad adviser to the World Bank in Washington. ''For the most part, you will not find the opportunity in the United States where the passenger revenues are going to justify the construction and operation of the system.''
 
It's New, but It's Changeable
The technology for magnetic levitation was patented by Dr. Gordon Danby and Dr. James Powell of the Brookhaven National Laboratories on Long Island, but companies in Japan, West Germany and Britain took the lead. A German company, Transrapide International, has developed the most advanced system, and Maglev Inc. in Pittsburgh is seeking the exclusive license to build Transrapide systems in the United States, said James C. Roddey, acting president of Maglev Inc.
''The operative word here is feasibility,'' he said, referring to the proposed maglev line in Pittsburgh and the creation of a new industry. ''We have Carnegie Mellon's preliminary feasibility study indicating that we are justified in going the next step.The difficult part is that we're dealing with a new technology that is changing rapidly.''
The project could provide thousands of jobs as well as impetus for major urban renewal, said Meyer Berger, a real estate developer and spokesman for Maglev Inc. He envisions razing a 65-acre South Side industrial slum between Station Square and the 10th Street Bridge and replacing it with a maglev terminal, hotels, office buildings and a check-in center for the airport.
''People would buy their airline tickets here, check their bags and ride out to the airport in five or ten minutes,''
Mr. Berger said. ''We would make it so darn easy for people that they would have to use it.''

HEADLINE: Talking Troops and Dollars in Korea

 BODY:
Korea's militarized North-South frontier remains dangerous even at the end of the cold war that prompted it. Pyongyang is still armed to the teeth, rigid and unpredictable. What has changed is the ability of South Korea, after years of stunning growth, to help pay for its own defense. 
The Pentagon, pressed by Congress to contain spending, now seeks a more balanced partnership. Reapportioning costs makes military and budgetary sense. South Korea agrees in principle, arguing only over specifics of numbers and timing.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney began discussions last week, at the start of his current Asia-Pacific tour. He did not announce Washington's target amounts for individual countries. For Korea, these are said to include doubling Seoul's present cash contribution of $300 million, shifting operational command to a Korean general and cutting back the current U.S. garrison of 44,000 by 10 to 12 percent. Mr. Cheney brought a similar message to Tokyo. The Bush Administration must come to terms with Congressional budget-makers as well as with Seoul. Secretary Cheney reports to Congress on his regional savings proposals April 1. Legislators will expect Korea and Japan to contribute their fair share. The hard-pressed Aquino Government in Manila has just been asked to swallow a cut in compensation payments for U.S. bases. How can prosperous, politically stable Seoul be asked for less?
Korean negotiators will point out that Seoul contributes more than cash. It also provides valuable real estate, tax exemptions and other items worth hundreds of millions. Counting the costs of South Korea's own armed forces, Seoul devotes a hefty 5.4 percent of its gross national product for defense, roughly the same percentage as the U.S.
Moreover, the U.S. gains other benefits from its Korea-based troops. Although their only formal role is to aid in South Korea's defense, they are a large factor in America's military presence in the Western Pacific. Even in the post-cold-war era, Asians worry about revival of the rivalries and ambitions of Moscow, Tokyo and Beijing. Many Asians find reassurance in that military presence.
Some Korean nationalists resent it, and object also to U.S. pressure on trade issues. The Korean Government argues that, by standing up to such pressures, it makes a further, intangible contribution to U.S. interests. In any case, Seoul will try to bargain for smaller troop cuts.
Yet South Korea, whose economy has more than doubled since 1983, can afford to pay more. And Washington can no longer afford to pass up reasonable defense savings.

HEADLINE: To Ortega: Throw the Election

BYLINE: By John B. Oakes; John B. Oakes is former Editorial Page Editor of The New York Times.

 BODY:
It isn't going to happen. But the smartest thing President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua could do for his country in the short run (and for himself in the long run) would be to do the unthinkable: throw tomorrow's presidential election to his principal opponent, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
Mrs. Chamorro is, of course, the candidate of the ''united'' opposition, consisting of disunited anti-Sandinistas from every shade of the political spectrum. More important, she is also the candidate of President Bush and the State Department. In part, her campaign has been paid for by the U.S. taxpayer, and she has Washington's wholehearted moral and political support. 
If Mrs. Chamorro wins - even if the vote count is seriously flawed in this most closely monitored election in Latin American history - the last person to complain will be President Bush.
If President Ortega wins - even in an election judged by independent observers to be reasonably clean -there's still no telling what President Bush might do.
With such advisers on Latin American affairs as Vice President Quayle and chief of staff John Sununu, he is capable of declaring, in the face of the facts, that the election was a fraud and that the United States is not obligated to demobilize the contras and call off our shameful and illegal proxy war.
An Ortega victory, fair or foul, will also furnish President Bush with an excuse to continue the devastating trade embargo and economic war against Nicaragua, which has done at least as much as the Sandinistas' inept leadership to destroy their country's economy and reduce the standard of living to subpoverty levels.
A Chamorro victory would change all that. It would force Mr. Bush - if he expects to retain his fast-disappearing credibility in Latin American policy - to make an all-out effort to pull Nicaragua out of the economic mire into which we have done our best to sink it. Immediate lifting of the trade embargo would be a requisite first step. It would have to be speedily followed by a large-scale program of aid, at least comparable to that poured into Nicaragua's ''democratic'' neighbors Honduras, El Salvador and Panama.
It would be Mr. Bush's responsibility to help Nicaragua bring its raging inflation under control and to restore a modicum of the public services that a nation at war has had to allow to fall into ruin.
A Chamorro victory would, in short, relieve the Sandinistas of the impossible task of reviving the economy by themselves or with whatever help they could still squeeze out of the European democracies. It would shift a major part of the burden to the U.S., which would be morally bound to shoulder it.
The Sandinistas could relax while watching the bitterly divided Chamorro coalition fall apart between now and the next election. Nothing more than U.S. support and the hope of ousting the Sandinistas holds it together. Adding to the instability would be the questionable loyalty of the army in a non-Sandinista regime.
Along with the presidential contest, some 100 seats of the National Assembly will be up for grabs, as will be hundreds of local and municipal offices.
Even if Mr. Ortega is not lucky (or smart) enough to lose the presidency, the Sandinistas will surely have a sufficiently large voting block in the Assembly to give them a powerful position from which to criticize Mrs. Chamorro's government, demand dissolution of the contras (of whom 10,000 are still under arms in Nicaragua and Honduras) and complain of inadequate United States reparations.
Either way, with the probable victory of Mr. Ortega or the possible victory of Mrs. Chamorro, the bankruptcy of Reagan-Bush policy toward Nicaragua becomes clearer every day.
Either way, but particularly if, as expected, Mr. Ortega wins, Mr. Bush could show himself to be the statesman he claims to be by wiping the slate clean and beginning to build a decent relationship with Nicaragua. After all, the Nicaraguans can't be all bad, because their favorite national sport is baseball.

HEADLINE: Jose Napoleon Duarte, Salvadoran Leader In Decade of War and Anguish, Dies at 64

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Jose Napoleon Duarte, the former President of El Salvador who oversaw a shaky experiment in centrist civilian government after nearly a century of military rule, died yesterday at his home in San Salvador, his doctor said. He was 64 years old and had been diagnosed in May 1988 as having advanced liver cancer.
Mr. Duarte, who left office in June 1989 after a five-year term, played a central role in Salvadoran politics for a quarter-century. He was viewed by Republican and Democratic administrations in Washington as an advocate of democracy who could provide a bulwark against Communism in Central America. His Christian Democratic Government was therefore deemed worthy of vast amounts of American aid to counter a leftist insurgency and to try to address the country's harsh inequities.
But his Government was widely criticized in later years as ineffective and plagued by corruption, and in March 1989, with Mr. Duarte constitutionally barred from seeking another term, a rightist, Alfredo Cristiani, was elected to succeed him. 
Mr. Cristiani, who was in Taiwan yesterday, sent condolences to Mr. Duarte's family, Salvadoran radio reports said.
In Washington, the White House issued a statement saying, ''President Duarte was the father of Salvadoran democracy, a dedicated servant to the people of El Salvador and a firm friend of the United States.'' The Administration said Vice President Dan Quayle would attend the funeral.
Mr. Duarte showed physical resilience in his last months in office after cancer surgery in Washington in June 1988. Medical experts said he was not expected to survive to the end of his term, but he continued to carry out many functions of office and had a role in Central American peace initiatives.
Mr. Cristiani's decisive victory over the Christian Democratic candidate, Fidel Chavez Mena, led to concern that the post-Duarte era would be one of extremism and polarization, and to questions in Washington about whether El Salvador should continue to receive high levels of American aid. Mr. Cristiani's party, the Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, has often been tied to the rightist death squads that have killed tens of thousands of Salvadorans.
 
The Middle Ground
 Some admirers of Mr. Duarte saw the voters' preference for Arena as an illustration of how Mr. Duarte was overwhelmed by the divisions and violence in Salvadoran society.
A well-to-do civil engineer, Mr. Duarte helped to found the Christian Democratic Party in the 1960's, becoming its first secretary general, and three times was elected Mayor of San Salvador, the capital. In the 1960's and 1970's he seemed to personify the hope that a middle ground could be found in easing the nation's perennial strife.
But in 1972 Mr. Duarte was denied victory in a presidential election widely viewed as fraudulent, and when he then gave support to an unsuccessful coup attempt by liberal military officers, he was forced into seven years of exile.
After his return, he joined a ruling civilian-military junta in 1980 and was appointed President later that year, serving until 1982. Mr. Duarte regained the presidency in an election in 1984 after two years out of Government.
Even with Mr. Duarte's election, the military was widely viewed as the country's most powerful institution, through which wealthy Salvadoran families traditionally wielded oligarchic power.
 
A Focus of Discontent
 As President, the sad-faced, stocky Mr. Duarte became the focus of discontent among ordinary Salvadorans, who accused him and his political allies of failing to run the country well.
Efforts to defeat the guerrillas militarily and to negotiate peace with them failed under President Duarte. The decade-old war remains at a stalemate, with more than 70,000 people dead, one in four Salvadorans displaced and the guerrillas in control of perhaps a third of the country.
The guerrillas' degree of success was achieved despite the fact that Salvadoran governments had received more than $4 billion in United States aid since 1981, much of it for the armed forces.
But while his efforts failed to resolve some of the most pressing social and economic problems of the country, they represented, after nearly a century of dictatorship, a step toward democracy in a profoundly undemocratic society.
Robert E. White, United States Ambassador to El Salvador during the Carter Administration, said Mr. Duarte stood ''for reform, for negotiation, and for an end to the savagery of the armed forces.''
Mr. Duarte's Government was often cited by the Reagan Administration as a prime instance of the spread of democracy in Latin America. The Bush Administration sought to sustain bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for large-scale United States aid to the new rightist Government.
 
Family and Early Life
 Jose Napoleon Duarte Fuentes was born on Nov. 23, 1925, in San Salvador to Amelia Fuentes de Duarte and Jose Jesus Duarte.
Mr. Duarte's beginnings have been described by himself and others as very simple, but in his memoirs, ''Duarte: My Story'' (G. P. Putnam, 1986), he wrote that his father came to be the owner of a fashionable tailor shop in San Salvador and was president of the Salvadoran Workers Society, a craftsmen's group.
President Duarte also wrote that his father declined the post of Labor Minister in 1931 but then took ''charge of the production of army uniforms'' for a time. Later the tailor shop went bankrupt, the son reported, and the father ''began baking and selling candy'' and went on to win ''a modest fortune in the national lottery.''
The younger Duarte attended the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., before beginning his career as a civil engineer in San Salvador.
He was drawn into politics in 1960 by a group that sought a middle ground between Communism and military totalitarianism. It was then that he helped found his party.
In 1972, he was one of four candidates in the presidential election and by all accounts was robbed of a victory.
Partial election returns indicated that he was ahead when the Government forbade additional radio reports about the outcome of the balloting. The following day, Col. Arturo Molina, the candidate of the governing National Conciliation Party, was declared the winner over Mr. Duarte by 22,000 votes.
 
From Exile to a Junta
 Not long afterward, on March 25, 1972, liberal military men mounted an unsuccessful revolt to which Mr. Duarte, speaking on the radio, lent his support. He was later arrested and beaten by plainclothes policemen before being released into exile. He settled in Caracas.
While in exile in 1977, Mr. Duarte later recalled in his memoirs, he visited Washington hoping to generate backing for the cause of democracy in his country. But he was given a cool reception. Only one Congressman, Thomas R. Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, was willing to meet him.
''My welcome to the United States has fluctuated in direct ratio to my political fortunes,'' Mr. Duarte wrote wryly in the memoirs.
After seven years in Venezuela - he took up painting there - he returned to El Salvador after a coup in late 1979, in which dissident military officers ousted the military strongman, Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero. At the invitation of the army, Mr. Duarte led a civilian-military junta, serving as President from 1980 to 1982. While in office, he denounced violations of human rights and spoke in favor of reconciliation with the insurgents. He also helped to undertake a controversial agrarian redistribution program, which fell short of its goals.
After the killing of four American churchwomen outside San Salvador in December 1980, he came under strong international pressure to bring the killers to account and to push El Salvador's largely dormant judicial system to respond.
''Americans find it hard to believe that our legal system is so different from theirs,'' he said in his memoirs, ''or that I had so little influence with the courts.''
''All the obstacles that had to be overcome illustrated how our justice system was the result of a corrupt society, a social breakdown, a loss of human values,'' he said.
Five men who were Salvadoran National Guardsmen at the time of the slayings eventually went on trial for them, but not until May 1984. They were convicted of aggravated homicide and sentenced to 30-year prison terms.
 
A Taint and a Victory
 Mr. Duarte's decision to join the junta had complex consequences. It led to his becoming President, but it also linked him, in the estimation of many, with the brutal aspects of the junta, notably the killing of thousands of Salvadoran civilians by the military and death squads.
In the months before the 1984 elections, critics in his party contended, as he wrote in his memoirs, ''that my participation in the junta tainted me, that I was associated in people's minds with the violence that took 40,000 lives.''
Still, Mr. Duarte proved widely popular; he received 54 percent of the votes in a runoff election. He asserted that peace would be restored, and assured the skeptical populace that even if he could not do it, the United States would do so swiftly, with its resourcefulness, its weaponry, its money. His admirers in those days saw him as high-minded and tenacious, although critics viewed him as a long-winded egomaniac.
In 1985, Mr. Duarte's Government had the guerrillas on the run, but it failed to introduce effective economic and social measures, just as land-reform measures earlier in the 1980's had proved ineffective, and the insurgency flourished anew, with rebels re-establishing a military and political presence in the capital.
Critics contended that as President, Mr. Duarte was simply not up to the challenges at hand in El Salvador, and they argued that the most dramatic example of this inadequacy was his reaction to the kidnapping of his daughter Ines Duarte Duran by rebels in 1985.
As part of a deal to obtain her freedom, he forced army commanders to set free more than 100 imprisoned rebels. She was released after being held captive for 44 days, but the army complained that the swap was a surrender to the rebels.
Mr. Duarte seemed deeply shaken by the episode, and some critics said it had a paralyzing effect on him.
Mr. Duarte is survived by his wife, Maria Ines Duran, and six children. Their son Alejandro was Mayor of San Salvador until he was defeated in the March 1988 elections.

The Economy
 Many analysts are convinced oil prices will rise more rapidly than previously expected, climbing 50 percent within five years. They have new doubts about the world's ability to pump enough oil to keep pace with demand. [Page 1.] Auto sales fell 11.5 percent in mid-February, as a strengthening of the automotive market early in the month seemed to fade. Sales of domestically made light trucks were down 13 percent. Analysts said sales dropped off because rebates and other incentives were less generous than earlier in the year. [33.] A Senator is urging the F.C.C. to help break the stalemate in a dispute over rules that prevent the networks from owning a stake or sharing in the syndication profits of programs they broadcast. [35.] Athletes were urged to reject tobacco company sponsorship of sports. The Secretary of Health and Human Services spoke at a meeting protesting the Virginia Slims tennis tournament. [12.] The Justice Department defended its proposed deal with Exxon to settle criminal charges arising from the Alaska oil spill. [9.] 
 
INTERNATIONAL
 Renault and Volvo announced a far-reaching alliance under which each will own large shares of the other. State-owned Renault is the biggest industrial concern in France and Volvo is Sweden's leading industrial company. The deal creates the world's largest truck maker and a formidable force in the auto market. [33.] West Germany might use more than one exchange rate in forming a monetary union with East Germany, officials in Bonn said. For example, pensions and long-term savings of East Germans might be given a more generous exchange rate than money in circulation. The officials stressed that no decision had been made. [33.]
 
Companies
 Regulators seized Imperial Savings and Loan, one of California's largest savings institutions. Imperial, based in San Diego, had one of the savings industry's biggest holdings of ''junk'' bonds and has been hard hit by the steep drop in junk bond prices. [33.] Ernst & Young resigned as Pepsico's auditor after another client, Coca-Cola, issued an ultimatum that the accounting firm choose between the soft-drink giants, Pepsico said. [33.] Drexel said it paid $260 million in bonuses to its executives in the two months before the firm's parent filed for bankruptcy protection. Senior executives of the firm had previously said the bonuses totaled as much as $350 million. [37.] A proposed slate of directors for Lockheed was put forward by Harold C. Simmons, the Dallas financier who is waging a proxy fight for control of the board. [35.]
 
 
 
Markets
 Stock prices retreated again, pulled down by worries about interest rates and another exceptionally steep decline in the Tokyo stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day at 2,564.19, a drop of 10.58 points. For the week, the Dow fell 71.40 points, or 2.7 percent. [36.] Treasury securities prices were essentially unchanged, but the closing quotes masked volatile price moves here and overseas. [36.] The dollar rose against most major currencies but traders saidthe yen was again the center of attention. Gold prices slipped.

HEADLINE: Sales Drop In Vehicles Is Reported

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Sales of domestically produced cars fell 11.5 percent in mid-February, as a strengthening of the automotive market early in the month seemed to fade.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales was 6.2 million cars, down from a rate of 7.2 million in the early part of the month. Last year at this time the rate was 7.7 million.
In the 10 days from Feb. 11 to 20, sales totaled 164,227, down from 185,672 in the comparable period last year. 
Light-truck sales also fell during the 10 days, to 93,836, from 107,822 a year earlier, a drop of 13 percent.
 
Combined Sales
Combined sales of cars and light trucks totaled 258,063, down 12.1 percent from 293,494 in the 1989 period.
The 10-day figures for domestically made cars represent roughly 70 percent of total car sales in the United States. Sales of imported cars are reported monthly.
A General Motors Corporation spokesman said that rebates had been trimmed slightly, possibly contributing to the slowdown in sales.
Joel Pitcoff, a Ford Motor Company sales analyst, said some incentive programs ended during the month's first 10 days. But he said, ''We continue to receive good reports on sales traffic in the showrooms and orders from dealers are increasing.''
 
Success of Transplants
The so-called transplants, cars made in this country by Japanese auto makers, continued to gain market share at the expense of the domestic companies. Car sales of transplants totaled 21,622 in the period, up from 13,615 a year earlier.
Cumulatively, more of the five Japanese transplants built in this country were sold than cars sold by the Chrysler Corporation, the smallest of the Big Three.
Since the start of the year, the Big Three domestic manufacturers have been reducing their stock of unsold vehicles by keeping production slow. Charles Brady, an automotive analyst for Oppenheimer & Company in New York, estimated that the current inventory stands at about a 65-day supply, which is ''a bit light for this time of the year.'' In early January, there was a 98-day supply.
''It's important to remember that in recent years the middle 10 days of the month always has been the weakest,'' Mr. Brady said. ''The question now is whether the companies will have enough cars heading into the spring selling season.''
Scott Merlis, an automotive analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, said that ''the midmonth cooldown is understandable after a bang-up January,'' when incentives were large, encouraging strong sales. Mr. Merlis, noting the relatively low inventory, predicted that auto production could be strong in the second quarter ''and give the economy a nice shot in the arm.''
G.M. car sales were off 19.7 percent, to 75,232, from 93,715 a year earlier. G.M.'s biggest declines were in the Pontiac and Oldsmobile divisions. Buick, which has recently enjoyed some high quality ratings from outside analysts and has been promoting that aggressively, was the only G.M. division to post a sales increase for the period.
 
General Motors
G.M.'s light-truck sales, which include utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks, fell 7.4 percent, to 38,289, from 41,354 a year earlier.
Ford car sales fell 14.1 percent, to 46,943, from 54,662 a year earlier. Ford's light-truck sales were off 15.4 percent, to 32,466, from 38,382 a year earlier.
Chrysler's car sales were off 13.7 percent, to 20,430, from 23,680 a year earlier. Chrysler truck sales, a large part of which consist of the company's popular mini-van, fell 21.2 percent, to 19,569, from 24,841 a year earlier. Last month the No. 3 auto maker offered its first rebates ever on the mini-van, prompting strong sales but cutting deeply into profit; the incentives ended at the beginning of February.
Honda Motor Company's sales of cars built in this country were up 12.5 percent; the Toyota Motor Corporation's car sales were up threefold; the Mazda Motor Corporation had a gain of 56 percent in cars, and the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation's car sales rose 60 percent. Only the Nissan Motor Corporation had a downturn in car sales, off 2.1 percent. Nissan's truck sales, however, were up 8.2 percent.
 
CHRYSLER DELAYS PLAN
 HIGHLAND PARK, Mich., Feb. 23 (Reuters) - Chrysler said today that it had indefinitely deferred plans to slow down assembly lines at its plants in Belvidere, Ill., and Newark, Del.
The company also said its seven United States car and truck assembly plants will operate without interruption during March at current operating rates.
Chrysler plans to shut the Belvidere and Newark lines the week of April 2. The Belvidere plant may also be shut the week of April 9, Chrysler said. But Chrysler has dropped its plan to have production resume at the two plants at a lower level than before the shutdowns.
The No. 3 auto maker said there would be some hourly layoffs at Belvidere and Newark because of other changes in model production.
Reductions in production and manpower at Chrysler's assembly plant in Toledo, Ohio, will proceed as scheduled in April.

HEADLINE: Perrier Rival Talks of 'Serendipity'

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
At Evian Waters of France Inc., some executives are uncomfortable with the word ''opportunity.'' It sounds, well, opportunistic when discussing the troubles at Perrier, the rival French water company that earlier this month recalled millions of its bottles of sparkling water after a few were found to contain traces of the chemical benzene.
On the other hand, Evian's chief executive, David S. Daniel, seems uncommonly fond of the word ''serendipity,'' using it several times in an interview this week. Now with bottles of Perrier, the industry leader by far, whisked off supermarket shelves and restaurant tables from Beverly Hills to Manhattan's Upper East Side, Evian starts a new advertising campaign on Monday. 
While the campaign was conceived last year, long before Perrier's troubles, it could not come at a better time for Evian. Trade publications estimate that the company will spend $6 million on advertising, 50 percent more than last year.
 
Distribution Broadened
Evian has also increased its distribution network. Mr. Daniel has spent the last 18 months signing up bigger and more aggressive distributors in important areas like Washington, Philadelphia and Southern California, where a lot of people like expensive bottled water.
''Serendipitously, we are ready for business!'' Mr. Daniel said. Evian, based in Greenwich, Conn., is a unit of Boussois Souchon Neuvesel, a large Paris food company that also makes Dannon yogurt and Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce.
Another fortunate circumstance for Evian is that it owns Saratoga water, which like the unavailable Perrier, is a sparkling water that people like as an alternative to liquor and wine. Mr. Daniel says East Coast restaurants are clamoring for Saratoga, which is produced by a small company in upstate New York. A new Saratoga ad campaign, about one-third the size of the Evian drive, will start on March 5.
But whatever Evian does is likely to leave it a distant No. 2 to Perrier. Distributors, many of whom sell both Evian and Perrier, report that while supermarkets are scrambling to fill their Perrier void with Evian and other bottled waters, they are still asking when Perrier will return. When Perrier announced its American recall Feb. 9, executives said the withdrawal might last as long as three months.
According to Beverage Marketing, Perrier Group has 23.9 percent of the American market, compared with 1.7 percent for Evian, which is the seventh-largest bottler in the United States.
 
'Making Tremendous Inroads'
Still, industry consultants agree that Evian is doing well. ''Evian is being plugged in everywhere and they are making tremendous inroads into Perrier's turf,'' said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a food and beverage industry consultant that conducted a nationwide survey of retailers this week. This was all the more surprising, Mr. Pirko said, because Evian, a still water like tap water, does not directly compete with Perrier.
Hellen Berry, market research director for the Beverage Marketing Corporation, an industry research company, said, ''Saratoga has been quite successful in getting into many, many bars and restaurants.''
Like Perrier, Evian sold itself as a 1980's power drink for what Mr. Daniel called ''the word that begins with Y, ends with E, and has two P's in the middle.''
 
New Look at the Market
But Mr. Daniel, 34 years old, said he thought the young professional image was a myth. A former marketer with Pepsico, where he worked on caffeine-free regular and Diet Pepsi, Mr. Daniel joined Evian in 1987 as marketing director and became chief executive in May 1989. He commissioned a market survey soon after he joined Evian to determine who was Evian's customer. Other than an age range that tended to cluster around 36, Evian customers are found in social and economic groups across the board, he said.
Unlike Perrier, Evian emphasizes that one can drink its water at any time of day. As a carbonated mineral water marketed mainly as a non-alcoholic aperitif, Perrier tends to be taken at meal times. That is why more than a third of is bottles are shipped to restaurants, hotels and bars, compared with 5 percent to 10 percent for Evian, a proportion the company wants to increase substantially. Both companies place the rest of their water in supermarkets, convenience stores and mass merchandisers like K Mart.
Earlier Evian television campaigns showed sleek athletes sweating in gymnasiums as a narrator, with Nautilus equipment clanging in the background, almost ordered viewers to buy Evian. More recent commercials showed men and women in repose around a swimming pool, as a Spanish melody played.
The new television ads, shot in Hawaii and Yosemite National Park in California, continue the more restrained approach. The campaign, both for print and television, was prepared by TBWA, a New York advertising agency.
 
Benefits Described
Directed by Bruce Dowad, best known for his warm glow, slow-motion ads for the Canadian tourism bureau, the Evian television ads emphasize it as a water so pure that it is ''Nature's Gift.'' Solitary runners, swimmers and bike riders refresh themselves with Evian. A new print ad, also running on Monday, describes the physical benefits of water and is unusually long - 2,500 words on a full page. The ad mentions Evian only incidentally because, as Mr. Daniel puts it, ''consumers still have a lot of questions about bottled water in general.''
Evian's print ads feature a photograph of the French Alps captioned ''Our Factory,'' and a close-up of a luxurious meal in a restaurant that is captioned, ''To improve this meal, just add water.''
In Philadelphia last month, Evian signed as its distributor Coca-Cola Bottling of Philadelphia, which services more than 25,000 retail outlets in that city and in Delaware and South Jersey. It replaces about 25 distributors with only 3,000 outlets. The casinos in Atlantic City are clamoring for Evian and Saratoga, said Ronald D. Wilson, the bottler's president. ''It's going to be a big winner,'' he said.
In Southern California, Evian replaced more than 70 small distributors in 1988 with 7-Up/RC Bottling Companies of Southern California, with more than 30,000 outlets. ''We're getting very positive vibes about Evian,'' said Roy Breneman, senior vice president for sales and marketing at the bottling company.
For its part, Perrier Group of America is holding on to much of its shelf space, said Jane Lazgin, a spokeswoman for the Greenwich, Conn., company, which imports Perrier from the Paris-based company, Source Perrier.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the Advertising column of Business Day on Friday about the increasing use of sophisticated market research in motion picture advertising misstated the role of Seiniger Advertising for ''The Hunt for Red October.'' The agency was responsible for the creative work for the print advertising; it did not do the research for the advertising.

HEADLINE: Dow Off Amid Worries About Rates and Tokyo

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices retreated again yesterday, pulled down by worries about interest rates and another exceptionally steep decline in the Tokyo stock market.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day at 2,564.19, a drop of 10.58 points. For the four-day holiday-shortened week, the Dow fell 71.40 points, or 2.7 percent. 
After a fairly stable opening yesterday, a spurt of futures-related selling pulled the Dow down by more than 20 points at about 11:30 A.M. A gradual recovery managed to bring the Dow to the plus side by about 3 P.M., but it fell again near the close.
 
Declines Lead Advances 2 to 1
The broader market was much weaker than the Dow. Declines on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1, with 987 issues down and 468 higher. About an hour into trading, losing stocks had exceeded advances by about 5 to 1.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.55 points, to 324.15, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped 0.93, to 179.35.
Rumors late in the afternoon that CS First Boston Inc. might be encountering serious financial difficulties -rumors that the company denied -had little impact on equities.
Volume on the Big Board dropped to 148.5 million shares, from 184.3 million on Thursday. In Tokyo yesterday, the Nikkei 225-stock index plunged 935.87 yen, or 2.6 percent, to 34,890.97, in thin trading. That plunge followed a drop of 1,161.19 yen, or 3.15 percent, on Wednesday. For the week, the Nikkei index lost 2,569.35 yen, or 6.9 percent.
 
Interest Rate Fears
''Fears of an increase in the Japanese discount rate raised similar worry on Wall Street of higher U.S. interest rates,'' said Alan Titunik, managing director of the Davis/Dinsmore Management Corporation, a New York-based investment advisory firm. ''The market was also adversely impacted by the reaction of the bond market to the plunge in Japanese stock prices.''
Mr. Titunik said, however, that interest rates over the longer term should stabilize to their levels of early January. By late in the day, the pivotal 30-year Treasury issue was unchanged, at a price to yield 8.56 percent.
''The short-term performance of the stock market will be affected by global events,'' he said. ''We eventually should see a gradual stability in the marketplace with steady interest rates and higher earnings, especially in the energy sector.''
 
Energy Stocks Mixed
Energy stocks were mixed yesterday, with Phillips Petroleum down 1/2, to 25 1/2; Chevron off 1 1/8, to 66 7/8; Mobil up 3/4, to 61 1/4, and Exxon unchanged at 47 1/8.
Pfizer was the most active issue, falling 3 points, to 56 1/4, on a volume of more than 3.9 million shares. The company has recently come under pressure because of problems with defects in a heart valve it makes. Pfizer said yesterday that it would restate its 1989 earnings, lowering them to reflect the reduced valuation of a pigments division it plans to sell.
Active blue chips included Philip Morris, off 5/8, to 37 1/2; A.T.&T., unchanged at 38 1/8; Merck, off 1 1/2, to 68; I.B.M., down 5/8, to 102 5/8, and Upjohn, off 1/4, to 34.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index fell 2.25 points, to 351.10, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index declined 3.23 points, to 419.52.

HEADLINE: U.S. Issues End Volatile Day Unchanged

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Treasury securities prices were essentially unchanged yesterday, but the closing quotes masked volatile price moves here and overseas. One Treasury securities dealer likened the day's action to ''a football being kicked between players in Japan and West Germany with us as spectators.''
The first test of the Treasury securities market occurred overnight in Tokyo, where a plunging stock market caused a flight to quality that lifted prices of Japanese and United States Treasury bonds. The benchmark United States long bonds, the 8.5 percent issue maturing in 2020, jumped 10/32 in Tokyo, to 99 24/32, which proved to be the universal high for the day. 
William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the long bond was subsequently hit overseas by a press report that West Germany was planning a one-for-one exchange for East German marks. Such a move, he said, would be ''sure to create a burst of inflation in West Germany that would quickly lead to much higher interest rates there.''
 
Influence of an Article
The report in The Washington Post yesterday, which was attributed to unidentified West German officials, sent the long bond tumbling in Japan to 98 28/32, the day's low. The long bond, which serves as a surrogate for the long-term Treasury securities market and is the preferred vehicle for speculators on Government debt, recovered somewhat in subsequent London trading.
Mr. Sullivan said that when the New York market opened, the long bond was at 99 16/32 and then traded in a range of 99 3/32 to 99 27/32 for most of the session. Late in the session, the long bond was being offered at 99 14/32, up 2/32 on the day. The yield was unchanged at 8.56 percent. A week ago, the long bond's yield was 8.46 percent.
Shortly after midday, the bond and stock markets were briefly focused on rumors of financial problems at the First Boston Corporation. The investment banking house denied the rumors and later released some financial information to reassure traders.
Jeffrey Bowman, a credit analyst at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said: ''In our opinion, there is nothing to the rumors about First Boston. We've affirmed CS First Boston's credit rating.''
He attributed yesterday's nervousness to traders passing along rumors. ''Traders like to stir things up,'' he said. ''It creates uncertainty and volatility, which they can make money on.''
 
Drop in Auto Sales
The bond market moved a bit higher toward the close as some investors responded to the decline in midmonth auto sales that was reported yesterday.
Among other representative Treasury issues traded in the secondary market, the 8.5 percent notes of the year 2000, which correspond to the Japanese 10-year long bonds, were unchanged at 99 25/32, with the yield at 8.53 percent.
The 8.5 percent two-year notes sold the day before at an average yield of 8.50, rose 1/32, at 100 6/32, but this did not change the 8.39 percent yield.
At the shorter end of the Treasury debt market, the discount rate on the 90-day bills dipped two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.68 percent. The six-month bills eased a basis point, to 7.69 percent, and the one-year bills lost three basis points, to 7.58 percent.
The Federal Reserve again refrained from intervening in the credit market. The key Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for temporary loans, traded a bit softer at 8.25 percent, the Fed's perceived target level at this time.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher, but Attention Is Focused on Tumbling Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against most major currencies but traders said the yen was again the center of attention.
Gold prices slipped. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $415 an ounce, down from $415.70 on Thursday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid of $415.50, down from $416.20 late Thursday. 
The yen continued to lose ground yesterday as prospects faded for higher Japanese interest rates. Dealers said they still expected the Bank of Japan to raise the nation's discount rate.
''The yen has been center stage,'' said Robert Hatcher, a vice president of foreign exchange at the New York office of Barclays Bank P.L.C. ''We're still waiting for a move on interest rates.''
High interest rates make a country's fixed-income securities attractive to investors, who need the nation's currency to make their investments.
The yen continued to slide against the dollar despite interventions by the Bank of Japan to bolster the yen. Dealers said the bank bought yen and sold dollars twice in the Tokyo market, once later in European trading and once in New York.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 146.47 yen, up 1.24 yen from Thursday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 146.95 yen. By the end of the day in New York, the dollar had jumped to 147.07 yen from 146.53 yen late Thursday.
Market watchers said the dollar also benefited somewhat from concern about German reunification, which hurt the West German mark.
The dollar finished in London at 1.6779 marks, up from 1.6695 marks late Thursday. It continued the advance in New York to end at 1.6785 marks, up from 1.6717.
In London, a British pound sold for $1.7090, down from $1.7145 late Thursday. In New York, one pound fetched $1.7095, less than $1.7133 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.4740 Swiss francs, down from 1.4755; 5.6825 French francs, up from 5.6620; 1,241.50 Italian lire, up from 1,236.00, and 1.1983 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1949.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $416.50 an ounce, from $417.45 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to $415.50, from $417.25 late Thursday. Gold in Hong Kong dropped $3.14 an ounce to close at $413.69.
Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.27 a troy ounce from Thursday's $5.28. On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery closed at $5.238 a troy ounce, down from $5.268 late Thursday.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC PULSE: The New York Region - A Special Report
NEW YORK REGION FACES SLOWDOWN OF THE ECONOMY

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
After their greatest boom since World War II, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut face the prospect of years of slower economic growth.
Wall Street, which fueled much of the region's resurgence, is two years into decline, having already shed tens of thousands of jobs. The national economy has slowed, further dampening local growth. And the prosperity of the 80's has itself left an unfortunate legacy for an already crowded region: overdevelopment, choking traffic, expensive housing and a scarcity of qualified labor, all of which are likely to limit the future.
At a time when governments are under pressure to address some of these ills, the economic slowdown has left all three states short hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, increasing the likelihood of tax increases, service cuts or both. 
 
Department Store Failures
Signs of distress abound, from a glut of unsold condominiums in Connecticut to unrentable office space in New Jersey to the failure and precarious condition of venerable New York City department stores and the bankruptcy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment firm that led Wall Street into the highly leveraged, fast-money era.
Some economists, many of whom were startled by the region's sudden rebound in the 80's, still speak hopefully, approaching the issue of a downturn with care, as if it were a puddle on a sidewalk. Having shifted from a more nuts-and-bolts economy to one built around the less tangible commodities of money and information, the region has a higher percentage of jobs than the nation as a whole in industries that are considered likely to grow. A downturn, if there is one, is not expected to be deep or long.
But there also seems to be a consensus that there will be relatively little or no job growth in the next year or two, and that a resurgence like that of the 80's will not soon be repeated.
The Regional Plan Association, a Manhattan-based research group, projects that New York City and the 26 surrounding counties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will add about 100,000 jobs a year in the next few decades. That is a healthy figure by the standards of the early 1970's, but it is less than half the growth over the last 10 years, when two million jobs were gained.
''It's a time of tremendous uncertainty,'' said Dr. James W. Hughes, professor of urban affairs at Rutgers University. ''Much to the surprise of everybody, the Northeast as a whole was a dynamo. Right now, it's a laggard again.''
 
Not 'Falling Apart'
If the region is once again an economic also-ran, it has not suffered as much as some feared it would after Wall Street's fall. The economy is not one ''that's falling apart,'' but one ''that isn't doing what it was doing,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, at a recent year-end briefing.
And there are those who believe that a slowdown, if short-lived, could be, as Stephen J. Kukan, general manager of area development for the Public Service Electric and Gas Company in New Jersey, put it, ''the pause that refreshes, because it's given us a chance to plan.''
But the needs are formidable, the resources scant and each day seems to bring more gloomy news. On Thursday, Standard & Poor's warned New York State that its credit rating might fall. On Friday, Sikorsky Aircraft laid off 300 white-collar workers, most of them in Connecticut.
''We have to provide the housing, we have to provide the transportation, we have to provide the labor force,'' Richard T. Anderson, the Regional Plan Association president, said of the task ahead.
''The region,'' he also said, ''is being challenged more than any time in recent memory.''
 
Fall, Rise and Fall
 
Economy Retooled After the 70's
New York City's revival had its roots in its despair. When government officials, municipal labor leaders and bankers pulled together in the 1970's to rescue the city from insolvency, they started an unexpectedly fruitful chain of events.
A balanced budget bolstered the city's image, helping it keep and lure businesses. Taxes were cut. More businesses relocated or expanded. Real-estate values rose. And as Wall Street prospered, the city and the region were well positioned to capitalize.
In the process, the economy was retooled. Early in the century New York was a center of maritime trade and commerce. In the 1940's it became the nation's dominant manufacturing center. But by the late 1960's it had begun a disastrous swoon; more than half a million jobs were lost between 1969 and 1976.
In the 1940's about a third of the region's employment was based in manufacturing; today only 13 percent is based in what Mr. Ehrenhalt has called ''the forgotten economy.''
But from 1977 to 1988, employment in finance, real estate and insurance increased by 44 percent. Other sectors flourished as well: Construction jobs rose 88 percent; services, 46 percent; self-employed businesses, 64 percent, and retailing, 26 percent. Manufacturing jobs dropped 15 percent.
 
Highly Paid Jobs Lost
Even a freshly rebuilt economy, however, could not withstand the shocks that lay ahead.
First came the stock-market collapse of October 1987, which led to the loss over the last two years of 25,000 financial-service jobs. Many, though not all, were highly paid traders and investment bankers: Wall Street's pay scales are two and a half times the city's average.
Then, last year, the national economy slowed, adding another damper on the region's growth. ''It's been like a balloon, deflating itself rather abruptly,'' said Allen Proctor, a former New York City deputy budget director who is executive director of the Financial Control Board, a state agency that monitors the city's fiscal health.
The effects of these developments have rippled through the region, from sector to sector and state to state. Among the main casualties is a real-estate market whose soaring values made many homeowners rich, at least on paper, while burdening recent buyers with heavy mortgages and shutting many families out of the market altogether.
The median selling price for a single-family home in the metropolitan area increased from $70,500 in 1982 to $194,000 six years later before sliding to $185,200 last spring, according to the National Association of Realtors.
After surveying three million housing sales in New Jersey from 1965 to 1988, Dr. Hughes and a Rutgers University colleague, Dr. George Sternlieb, said prices could drop by as much as 12 percent.
''Everyone expected the $800,000 co-op to be in trouble,'' Mr. Proctor said, ''but you're seeing an across-the-board decline.''
 
Stores in Trouble
Connecticut tops the list of states whose banks show the highest increase in bad real-estate loans during the first nine months of 1989, according to a survey based on bank reports to the Government. New Jersey is No. 11 and New York State No. 12.
The caution that pervades the real-estate market is also affecting other kinds of spending, and some well-known palaces of consumption have reflected the uncertainty and loss of confidence. Stores that have not survived range from B. Altman to Crazy Eddie. Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus and Stern's are caught up in the bankruptcy of their parents, Federated Department Stores Inc. and the Allied Stores Corporation, both part of the troubled Campeau empire. And Bonwit Teller, which lost $23 million in three years, is on the block and likely to close if no buyer steps forward.
Last year, as he kept watch over New York City's ever-more-disappointing revenues, Mr. Proctor said there was a ratcheting down of corporate profits ''worse than anyone had anticipated,'' a development that may continue to dampen hiring, wage increases and business investment.
''The economy is searching for its core,'' he said. ''It's looking for its feet.''
 
Where New Jobs Will Go
 
Faring the Best: North New Jersey
Wall Street accounted for more than a third of New York City's private-sector job growth in the 10 years before the 1987 stock-market plunge. But as prominent firms like Shearson Lehman Hutton, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers made plans to eliminate hundreds and sometimes thousands of jobs, Wall Street became a major source of weakness.
Few expect the financial industry's complete resurrection. In fact, more contraction seems likely, even after the bankruptcy filing on Feb. 13 by the parent company of Drexel Burnham Lambert, which cost more than 3,000 employees in New York City their jobs.
But predictions that the stock-market drop would cause severe job losses beyond the financial district have not come true, at least not yet. In a year-end report last month, Mr. Ehrenhalt of the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that New York City gained 14,000 jobs in the first 10 months of 1989.
 
Unemployment Rate Rises
The unemployment rate for New York State rose from 4.2 percent in 1988 to 5.1 percent in 1989 but is still below the national average of 5.3 percent. New Jersey's jobless rate is 4.1 percent and Connecticut's 3.8 percent.
The Regional Plan Association also notes that 57 percent of the region's jobs are in industries considered likely to keep growing, compared with 51 percent in the nation. But the association does not believe that the region will continue to capture the 8 percent of the nation's jobs that it gained in the 1980's, in part because of labor shortages, which will increase wages.
Still, the association concludes that the region's productivity and per-capita income will continue to grow. Thus it says that it is ''cautious about the region's economic prospects,'' but that the ''picture that emerges is favorable.''
The association expects New York City to continue to attract about a quarter of the region's new jobs. Among the possible sources of new business are increased trade with Eastern and Western Europe, although there is also the threat of increased competition from Chicago and Los Angeles, not to mention London and Tokyo.
The New York counties of Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Dutchess, Ulster and Sullivan will attract about 14 percent of the new jobs, the association projected, a slight increase over their share in the last decade.
The association predicts that the 14 northern New Jersey counties, from Ocean and Mercer to Sussex, Passaic and Bergen, which gained 35,000 new jobs in 1989 and may be the strongest part of the region now, will get an even greater share of the jobs in the coming years, nearly 40 percent.
 
Diversified Economy
Though New Jersey suffers from congestion and a glut of office space that has pushed vacancy rates to 25 percent in some areas, the state's diversified economy is less reliant than New York City's on financial services and has been cushioned by mainstays like research centers for the pharmaceutical industry.
Mr. Kukan, of the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, said that during the year-end holidays, usually a quiet time, the utility received a surprisingly large number of requests for information from businesses seeking more space.
Connecticut, with its defense contractors, could find any cutback in military spending costly. But while Sikorsky, the world's largest manufacturer of helicopters, is trimming its work force to make the company ''leaner'' in the face of such cuts, Electric Boat in Groton has several contracts for new submarines and Pratt & Whitney Aircraft has reduced its reliance on the military for sales of its jet engines.
 
'I'll Take My Chances'
As for Connecticut's huge inventory of unsold homes, a state plan to buy 500 condominiums at bargain prices for use as subsidized housing would help. And if lending institutions already worried about real-estate loans do not further tighten credit and if interest rates do not rise, more home buyers might materialize and construction, an important industry to Connecticut, could pick up.
''If I'm going to be in New England, I'll take my chances in Connecticut,'' said Donald L. Klepper-Smith, an economist in the business research department of Southern New England Telephone Company.
Still, he worries that high taxes, high wages and high housing prices will lead to ''a softening of comparative economic advantages'' that helped the state become the nation's leader in per-capita income.
The prospects for Long Island seem less certain. Employment dropped last year for the first time since 1975, and the Regional Plan Association, citing an over-reliance on defense industries, an abundance of traffic and a scarcity of vacant land, predicts that Nassau and Suffolk Counties' share of the region's new jobs will decline to about 12 percent.
Three years ago Grumman Aircraft of Bethpage, maker of the F-14, a jet fighter with a dwindling market, pared its work force from 25,000 to 18,400. Now, in what seems as good a sign of changing economic conditions as any, the company plans to turn some of its 800-acre headquarters into a corporate headquarters center, with stores and a hotel.
 
Who Will Fill the Jobs?
 
The Boom Depleted The Labor Pool
What topsoil is to the Farm Belt, labor is to the New York region - a natural resource.
''We had the skills here, the know-how, and took advantage of it,'' said Dr. Adam Broner, executive director of the New Jersey Economic Council, a state agency, explaining his state's gains.
The recent expansion might not have been possible if not for the reservoir of women ready for recruitment. Three decades ago, about 40 percent of working-age women in the 31 counties in and around New York City were in the labor force; now, almost 60 percent are.
''The tremendous growth and job creation that we've seen over the past 10 years was fueled by a tremendous increase in the female participation in the labor force,'' said Robert A. Dye, director of the New York service of the WEFA Group, a forecasting organization based in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.
A consequence of the boom has been the depletion of the labor pool, making further growth difficult. In some northern New Jersey counties, bounties are being paid for new workers.
Yet in Newark and other cities, people are unemployed because they lack a way to get to the jobs. #25% at Poverty Level In New York City, too, there is a mismatch between jobs increasingly based on the ability to communicate and work with ideas and the vast numbers of high school dropouts, immigrants and single parents. Many of these people are effectively barred from the more demanding jobs the economy is generating now, and sometimes from any jobs, because they lack the necessary skills or a mastery of English or child-care services.
Perhaps half a million people in the city are still not in the work force, and the percentage of those living at or below the poverty level has hovered near 25 percent despite years of peak economic growth.
''The division between those who are in the mainstream and those who are out of it grew more rigid,'' said Mr. Ehrenhalt of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, ''and the barriers to overcoming it became more formidable.
''A 38 percent dropout rate is just not compatible with the main direction of the New York economy,'' he said. ''A decade of growth didn't make a dent in these problems.''
But Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said ''the 90's should be different,'' at least for ''the next wave'' of workers.
 
Jobs for Every Student
The Port Authority anticipates that the low birthrate of the 1960's and 1970's will result in a labor force that will grow more slowly now. The population is becoming older as well. Even in a slower economy, the agency says, new jobs will outpace new workers by 120,000 over the decade. That will greatly increase the pressure on employers to get more working-age people into the work force.
Ms. Scanlon saw evidence of this trend nearly two years ago when she visited the Passaic County Vocational and Technical High School in Wayne. The school has students from New Jersey cities like Clifton, Paterson and Passaic and, she said, ''they had jobs for every single youngster.'' Some would be making $10 an hour.
Ms. Scanlon acknowledged, however, that demographic forces alone have their limits, and that better training was just one of the measures that will be needed if the vocational and social mismatch is to be broadly addressed.
And even so, she added, ''I'm not so sure that the most desperate people that we see under our feet are going to make it, no matter how strong the economy is.''
 
States' Empty Pockets
 
Unhappy Remedy: Higher Taxes
''The global economy wants to have a major share of its activities in and around New York City,'' said Mr. Anderson of the Regional Plan Association, explaining its projection of continued, if slower, economic growth.
But, he warned: ''Either we are going to provide the basis for those activities to come here and be nurtured here and serviced here, or it's not going to happen. There are limits to what people are going to endure.''
Although much money has been invested in the region's physical plant, it is standing-room-only on many rush-hour commuter and subway trains, and waits of a half-hour or more are common at tunnels and bridges leading to Manhattan.
Despite an oversupply of homes and offices, the area seems unlikely to lose its reputation as an expensive place in which to live and work. The surge in drug-related crime in New York City has only worsened its violent image.
But at a time when governments are under pressure to attend to these and other ills to attract new businesses, they seem least able to afford it.
 
Rainy-Day Fund Exhausted
In New Jersey, officials are projecting a 3 percent increase in revenues, compared with 11 percent a few years ago. A rainy-day fund of nearly $300 million to help tide the state over during times of budgetary stress has already been exhausted, and Gov. Jim Florio faces a $550 million deficit in the current fiscal year.
In Connecticut, sales-tax revenues will actually decline this year, and Gov. William A. O'Neill has proposed a spending plan that would eliminate 2,000 jobs.
Mayor David N. Dinkins has put forth a New York City budget that would delay hiring more police officers and raise taxes by $550 million.
New York State is in an even more precarious condition. Acknowledging that there is ''a huge gap between what we want to spend and what we can afford to spend,'' Gov. Mario M. Cuomo would cut dozens of programs, suspend a planned income-tax cut and raise $800 million in new taxes and fees.
But Standard & Poor's issued a ''credit watch'' last week, saying Mr. Cuomo's budget proposal would not put the state's finances on a firm enough footing to justify the current AA- bond rating.
 
A Rare Suggestion
Such are the fiscal troubles that last year the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry and its sister organization, the New York City Partnership, gave Albany recommendations for taxes that could be raised. Daniel Sandy Bayer, the vice president for economic and commercial development for the Partnership, said it was the first time in his memory that the business and civic organizations had done that.
This year the groups have gone further, Mr. Bayer said. Although they favor retaining the income-tax cut, they have suggested imposition of a two-year surcharge on both business and personal taxes to give the state time to assess its economic condition and find ways to improve productivity.
But it could be that the shifting demographics that might enable more people to find jobs in the 1990's could also yield unexpected dividends for Albany, Hartford and Trenton. Assuming that the region avoids a recession, Ms. Scanlon of the Port Authority said, the deepening labor shortage could push wages up, and tax revenues with them.
Most of the population growth, she said, will be among those 35 to 50 years old. Since there will be more people in these peak earning years, they will generate more taxes.
She also said an older population will be more willing to invest in the region, like those who, more than a generation before them, built the suburbs around New York City after World War II.
''What we're beginning to see is a change in behavior, a change in outlook,'' she said. ''I'm not sure if governments are aware of this yet.''

HEADLINE: 1990 Vote Will Test Power Of G.O.P. in the Sun Belt

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The 1990 election campaign, which has so far generated little excitement despite a number of races with considerable significance, is approaching its first major event, the March 13 primaries in Texas.
From now until early November, the politicians will be campaigning for 36 governorships, 34 Senate seats, 435 House seats and 6,257 state legislative positions. Television programs will again be stuffed with political commercials. And unless the experts are all wrong, most voters will be little stirred.
No one expects much of a change in the Democratic dominance in the House and Senate, though there are a half-dozen close races on the docket. If form were to be followed, the Republicans would suffer, because the party holding the White House usually loses seats in the election after Presidential voting. 
 
Bush Had Short Coattails
But President Bush carried so few legislators to victory with him in 1988 that he was the only President ever elected with such a small share of Congress held by his own party. So the Republicans have relatively little to lose, and should also benefit from his popularity, the nation's general prosperity and the lack of other issues to roil the political waters, analysts say.
The governors' races constitute this year's high-stakes action, especially those in California, Florida and Texas, the three Sun Belt states that are about to emerge as the new powerhouse of American electoral politics.
After this year's census, according to most informed estimates, they will have 24 percent of the membership of the House of Representatives and 20 percent of the strength in the electoral college, the same share that New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois had exactly a half-century ago, dominating national politics. In 1940, Texas, California and Florida counted for considerably less, casting only 11 percent of the votes in the House, about what Michigan, Ohio and New Jersey will cast after reapportionment.
 
Seismic Shift in Strength
This seismic shift in political strength, which reflects the drain in population from the old Democratic industrial midsection, presents the Republicans with great opportunities, but to capitalize on them they have to control at least part of the state governments in the big Sun Belt states.
If the Democrats win the governorships and majorities in the state legislatures, they will draw the new House district lines so as to minimize Republican gains, regardless of conservative sentiments in the South and the West.
At the moment, the Democrats' prospects appear good. They already control both houses in 29 state legislatures, as against 8 for the Republicans. And they say they have reasonable chances of taking the statehouses away from Republicans in Florida, where Gov. Bob Martinez is in trouble; in Texas, where Gov. Bill Clements is retiring, and in California, where Gov. George Deukmejian is also retiring.
 
Republicans Trying Hard
Still, the Republicans are trying hard. President Bush flew to California earlier this month and will be there again on Wednesday to raise money and stir up enthusiasm for Senator Pete Wilson, the Republican candidate for governor in the state that has become the supreme political prize. As the President noted in Los Angeles on Feb. 6, the census ''will give California up to seven new House seats, meaning that nearly one of every eight Congressmen in Washington will represent California.''
No state has had that kind of influence in this century.
In the longer term, the Republicans seem certain to benefit from the change, especially in Presidential terms. Carrying the same states in 1992 that they did in 1948 and 1960 respectively, Harry S. Truman and John F. Kennedy would have lost, because their victories were built on states whose influence has declined. Florida now seems safely Republican in Presidential contests, and Texas is heading in that direction.
Only in California, which some Democrats consider their great hope for the future, do the two parties seem likely to compete on fairly even terms.
One major consequence of the change appears probable: a tremendous increase in the importance of the Hispanic vote. All three of the biggest Sun Belt states have large, diverse and growing Hispanic populations. In California, according to one estimate, Hispanic immigrants accounted for 50 percent of the state's growth in the last deacde, with other minorities accounting for an additional 31 percent.
Thomas E. Mann, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, says Hispanic voters will form ''the dominant minority in American politics in the 21st century.'' Not surprisingly, the two parties are engaged in an intensive struggle this year for their loyalty and their votes.
 
What Democrats Need
If the Democrats are to rebuild their standing as the majority party, a crucial element in the equation will have to be the new immigrants - the Latins and the Asians - who are pouring into Texas, Florida and California. Fifty years ago, immigrants from southern and central Europe, settling in the industrial cities of the Middle Atlantic and Middle Western states, saw the Democrats as the best bet for economic growth and opportunity. But so far, a leading Florida Democrat says, ''we haven't convinced the new newcomers that we can deliver.''
Though they sometimes send a message to Washington like disgust with Democratic corruption in 1946 and resentment at a Republican recession in 1982, off-year elections more often lack broad national themes and are decided on local issues and personalities.
The cataclysmic changes in the world are unlikely to provide a focal point this year, in the view of Peter D. Hart, a leading poll taker who works mainly for Democratic candidates. Mr. Hart said he sees the Senate races and the few truly competitive House races being decided ''on small-bore considerations, with campaigns that are negative and not so inspiring.''
''I think the tone for the 90's will emerge more from the governors' races,'' Mr. Hart said. ''People are worried about things like drugs, education, the homeless, the environment -all adding up to a desire to look at our problems, to restore our own sense of community, our own well-being.''
In Florida, Representative Bill Nelson is the likely Democratic challenger. In Texas, the early favorite is Ann Richards, who made the memorable anti-Bush speech at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but she has several rivals in both parties. In California, former Mayor Dianne Feinstein of San Francisco has suddenly taken the lead in the polls as the Democratic nominee to oppose Senator Wilson, who is running for governor only two years after winning a second Senate term.
 
Key Gubernatorial Races
Other important gubernatorial races will take place in Ohio, where Richard F. Celeste, a Democratic incumbent, is retiring; in Illinois, where a long-serving Republican, James R. Thompson, is stepping down, and in Pennsylvania, where Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat who is opposed to abortion, will face Auditor General Barbara Hafer, a Republican who is running on an abortion rights platform.
The Republicans have fared better than the Democrats in recruiting candidates for the big Senate races. For instance, former Gov. James B. Hunt, a Democrat, declined to run against Senator Jesse Helms, a Republican, in North Carolina, and former Vice President Walter F. Mondale decided not to challenge Senator Rudy Boschwitz, a Republican, in Minnesota.
In addtion, the Republicans are fielding three popular House members in Colorado, New Hampshire and Idaho, states where Republican senators are retiring. All are beginning as favorites.
In four other states, liberal Democratic Senators, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Paul Simon of Illinois, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island and Carl Levin of Michigan, face House Republicans in what are likely to be close contests.
 
 
1990 ELECTIONS: THE BATTLEGROUNDS
 
RACES TO WATCH
 
TEXAS: Bill Clements, who's retiring, is the only Republican ever elected governor here. But Clayton Williams, a self-made millionaire who revels in his reputation as a brawler and a hard drinker, seems to have caught peoples' attention, and he's given a fair chance of upsetting the Democratic nominee who emerges from the primary on March 13 and the subsequent runoff.
 
CALIFORNIA: Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, who finished an exhausting (and successful) re-election campaign only 15 months ago, is now running for governor. His Democratic rival will be either Diane Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco, or John Van de Kamp, the state Attorney general. This is the one race that both parties would most like to win in November.
 
OHIO: A very good shot for a republican takeover. Democratic Gov. Dick Celeste, who has been involved in one scrape after another, is retiring, and the Republicans seem to be rallying behind Mayor George Voinovich of Cleveland, who could cut deeply into the usual massive Democratic margin in that city. The Democratic nominee is likely to be Attorney General Anthony Celebrezze.
 
FLORIDA: Almost from the moment he was elected, Republican Gov. Bob Martinez has struggled to establish his credibility. His anti-abortion stance has cost him dearly. Representative Bill Nelson, a smooth campaigner, seems the likely Democratic nominee, but he must face the seeminlgy irreversible trend to the Republicans in this state and plenty of help from Washington.
 
IOWA: No Democrat has ever been elected to two consecutive six-year terms in this plains state, but Tom Harkin seems to stand a good chance. His Republican opponent, Representative Thomas J. Tauke, who has been running for more than a year already, is a formidable politician with 12 years behind him in the House at the age of 40. But the Democratic trend here favors Harkin.
 
ILLINOIS: Sen. Paul Simon's 1988 Presidential campaign wasn't much of a success, except in one state: his own. He carried Illinois when he had already lost everywhere else, which showed great voter loyalty. His Republican rival, Representative Lynn Martin, is a tart-tongued campaigner who, though something of a moderate herself, is determined to paint him as a leftist.

HEADLINE: China Acts to Restrict Study Abroad

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 24

 BODY:
In the most tangible sign so far that China is retreating from its decade-long commitment to sending students abroad, new restrictions will make it virtually impossible for most university graduates to study in other countries unless they work first for five years.
The rules, which had been anticipated since early this month, took effect on Feb. 10. They have not yet been widely disseminated, although a copy was obtained here.
''If enforced as written, it's going to have a big impact,'' a Western diplomat in Beijing said. ''There have been competent Chinese graduate students going to the U.S. that won't be going there anymore.'' 
But many experts, noting that Chinese students have been adept at evading previous restrictions, said much would depend on how the new restrictions are put into force. End to an Academic Exodus? On their face, the regulations would considerably reduce the annual stream of about 12,000 students to the United States that had been one of the most remarkable aspects of China's former open-door policy.
The basic change in the new rules is a requirement that university graduates work for five years before they go abroad to study, although students with relatives overseas can pay for an exemption from the work requirement.
The regulations seem to be motivated by Government alarm over the large number of top students, educated essentially for no charge at China's best schools, who go overseas and fail to return to contribute to their country.
''It is a continuation of their concern over the brain drain,'' said Karen C. Stanton, consul at the United States Embassy in Beijing. ''They are losing their best and their brightest, and the reality is that past efforts have failed to control this flood.''
Although Chinese officials agree that the policy is aimed mostly at preventing an exodus of top minds, the new rules come at a time when China is again emphasizing ideological devotion over professional ability in hiring and promotion.
 
Socialism's 'Gravediggers'
Chinese and Western officials say the authorities are also concerned by the support lent by students abroad to the democracy movement at home.
''The Government does not want to help educate the gravediggers of socialism,''a Chinese teacher said.
The document describing the new rules was circulated by the state Education Commission. It states that only students who have not yet reached their final year in a university, or students with Chinese relatives overseas, can win exemptions from the work requirement.
Students seeking the latter exemption must apply for identification papers from a provincial Government office indicating that they related to a Chinese person overseas.
''I think there are going to a lot of fake relatives,'' a Chinese intellectual said. ''The authorities can't possibly check into everyone's background.''
Students eligible for the exemptions must pay for each of the years of university-level schooling they completed. Graduates must pay the equivalent of about $530 for each of their college years; students at the masters level, $850 per year, and students at the doctoral level, $1,275. If they return to China within eight years, their money will be refunded.
 
Few Can Afford Exemption Fees
Most students and their immediate families could not afford such fees, although some will be able to take advantage of loans from relatives abroad.
Several Western diplomats said the loopholes softened the impact of the rules. They noted that similar regulations were used in Eastern European and some Western countries. France, for example, has a work requirement for students educated at state universities.
''The pressure to go abroad is so strong, and it's on everyone's mind right now,'' a Western official said of China. ''If they just stonewall, then the rules would be called restrictive and coercive, like the old policies before. They open a small hole so people won't say they're not reasonable.''
Consular offiials say they will be unable to gauge the effect of the rules on visa applications before May or June.
The new regulations were announced to university officials earlier this month, less than two weeks after President Bush vetoed a bill that would have relaxed visa restrictions on Chinese students in the United States.
Beijing's new rules, which apply to students applying on their own as opposed to scholars sponsored by the Government, appear to be part of an overall tightening of control over university students.
Students sponsoring themselves have been receiving an increasing proportion of visas for study in the United States. Their applications are multiplying more rapidly than those of Government-sponsored students, who will not be affected by the new rules.

HEADLINE: Bush and Japan's Leader to Meet Next Month

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 24

 BODY:
President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan announced today that they would meet early next month amid signs that critical trade discussions between Japan and the United States are at a serious impasse.
A Japanese official said Mr. Bush telephoned Mr. Kaifu on Friday night to invite him to two days of talks in Palm Springs, Calif., on March 2 and 3, where he will seek to persuade Japan to take action in the trade area. Mr. Bush's call came shortly after the governing Liberal Democratic Party's election victory early this week.
The Prime Minister held back from agreeing to the date, but his aides said the meeting would occur soon if not at the time proposed by Mr. Bush.
Washington and Tokyo are engaged in a range of negotiations on a dozen different issues to bring down the American trade deficit with Japan, which has remained at about $50 billion since the mid-1980's and has become the focus of rising economic tensions. 
President Bush's telephone call came within hours of the conclusion of the latest round of ''structural impediment'' talks with Japan, in which Tokyo is being pressed to agree to several basic changes in the way business is done here in order to ease the way for more imports.
After the talks concluded on Friday, Japanese officials said the United States position was much stronger than they had expected. And Bush Administration officials made no secret of their disappointment with what seemed to be Japanese resistance to the American requests.
 
U.S. Happier About Arms Talks
By contrast, American officials said they were pleased with talks involving Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on security matters. He won approval in principle from Japan, South Korea and the Philippines for a roughly 10 percent cut in the American troop strength in East Asia and the Pacific.
Aides to Mr. Cheney say they were confident that Tokyo would be forthcoming in response to the request to increase its $2.8 billion contribution to the $7.5 billion cost of maintaining American forces in Japan. They say formal approval could come later this year.
In the more contentious trade area, however, Washington is pressing Japan to spend more for public works, weaken the influence of powerful Japanese business cartels and relax laws that allow small retail stores to block large stores from coming into their neighborhoods.
The Bush Administration thinks those and other steps would give American exporters more access to Japanese markets. But on Friday night, an American official said the steps proposed by Japan were ''not enough to be effective, lasting or credible.''
Japan is also pushing the United States to take its own steps, and Japanese officials say they too are less than impressed with what American negotiators have offered so far. Where Japan Faults U.S. Tokyo wants the Bush Administration to close the Federal deficit, increase savings in this country and change a range of corporate practices to place greater emphasis on long-term growth, education, and research and development so as to improve the ability of American business to compete.
In effect, Japan argues that the trade deficit is caused more by American shortcomings than by Japanese barriers, and the repetition of this theme in the trade talks has met with rising frustration among the American negotiators.
A United States official said tonight that Mr. Bush's telephone call to Mr. Kaifu was not prompted by the problems in the talks that concluded on Friday, but that a meeting between the two leaders was being sought to give fresh impetus generally to the stalled negotiations.
''With the election finished, Japan has a new Prime Minister and a new Cabinet, and there's plenty to talk about,'' the official said.
He added that several American negotiators agreed that ''we should have gotten much more'' out of the latest round of trade negotiations.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Kohl Arrives in U.S. for Talks on Europe's Future

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMP DAVID, Md., Feb. 24

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany arrived here today for intensive talks with President Bush on the future of Europe and the accelerating pace of German unification.
''I view this as a very important discussion,'' Mr. Bush said. ''There is a lot of keen interest not just in Europe but around the world in these discussions.''
Mr. Kohl, wearing a dark blue suit, got off a Marine helicopter and walked with his wife, Hannelore, down a small walkway at the Presidential retreat here. They were greeted by Mr. Bush, who was wearing a leather jacket with a fur collar, and Mrs. Bush, wearing a parka and slacks. 
The Chancellor thanked his hosts, praised the quality of the cold, crisp air here at the Presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains and exclaimed, ''Wunderbar!''
 
A Steady Snowfall
After walking past a small military honor guard, Mr. Bush and Mr. Kohl got into a golf cart. With the President behind the wheel, they drove off down a road that winds through the woods of Camp David. Within a few minutes, swirling flurries turned to a steady snowfall.
Mr. Kohl will be here for about 24 hours. Mr. Bush is expected to ask the West German leader to clarify his timetable for unification of the Germanys. In addition, Administration officials said, Mr. Bush will probably ask Mr. Kohl to reaffirm his commitment to German membership in NATO and to take steps to allay Polish concerns about the future of the Polish-German border.
But Mr. Bush declined to comment when reporters asked him about the unification of Germany in the minutes just before Mr. Kohl's arrival. Mr. Bush said he would discuss the substance of that issue at a news conference with Mr. Kohl on Sunday morning.
''Repeat after me: substance tomorrow,'' Mr. Bush told reporters, who kept asking questions about the momentous changes in Europe.
 
Conversations With Allies
Mr. Bush said he talked this morning, before Mr. Kohl's arrival, with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada. Mrs. Thatcher has repeatedly emphasized the need for caution in discussing arrangements for the reunification of Germany.
In an effort to consult closely with America's allies, Mr. Bush discussed the future of Germany in a meeting on Friday at the White House with Prime Minister Jan P. Syse of Norway. And Mr. Bush said he would talk by telephone on Sunday with President Francois Mitterrand of France.
For the meeting with Mr. Kohl, President Bush tried to create an intimate, relaxed atmosphere. The number of officials on each side was strictly limited. Mr. Bush was accompanied by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d; Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, and Robert Blackwill, an expert on German history and European affairs on the staff of the National Security Council.
 
Elections for Kohl
Mr. Kohl's visit comes three weeks before East Germany is scheduled to hold elections for a government that will presumably negotiate the terms of union with West Germany. Mr. Kohl himself faces elections in West Germany, now scheduled for Dec. 2.
In East Germany, the alliance of conservative parties supported by Mr. Kohl is trailing far behind the Social Democrats and is not expected to win the elections next month.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Kohl plan to discuss West Germany's plans for economic and political union with East Germany, as well as security issues like Germany's future relationship with NATO, the size of its army and its borders with Poland.
The Bush Administration has firmly supported German aspirations to unify their country, but maintains that Germany must be firmly anchored in NATO to allay the anxieties of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Britain, France and other countries that have been victims of German aggression in the past.
Already West German officials are drafting plans for a monetary union with East Germany, including use of a single currency. In addition, East and West German officials have talked separately about establishing a combined army for a united Germany. But there will be no formal talks on that subject until after the elections because Bonn will not discuss a merger with a Communist government.
Jewish groups have prodded Mr. Kohl and the Bush Administration to address the fears that German reunification stirs among survivors of the Holocaust. Some American officials say that West Germans should assume responsibility for educating East Germans about the Holocaust.
In a recent letter to Mr. Kohl, Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust studies in Los Angeles, said that such concerns were being neglected in the current discussions about the political, military and economic aspects of a united Germany. ''To the victims of the Holocaust,'' he wrote, ''it is not the potential weakness of the Deutsche mark that is critical, but the consequences that may lead to a weak 'Deutsche memory.' ''
 
 NEWS CONFERENCE ON TV
 A news conference by President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany is scheduled for 11 A.M. today. Last night, ABC News and CNN said they planned live coverage. CBS News said no such coverage was scheduled ''at this point,'' and NBC News said it would break into programming as needed.

HEADLINE: Nicaraguans Hope for Decisive Election

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Feb. 24

 BODY:
After a decade of revolution and war, Nicaraguans on all sides are counting on the national elections on Sunday to halt their country's long slide into fraternal strife.
At 4,391 voting places today, workers readied the registration lists, color-coded ballots and indelible ink that will give the country the first free, broadly contested election in its history. More than 2,000 international observers took up positions from the urban barrios of Managua to the rebellious hill towns of Jinotega. And 1.7 million voters buzzed with the excitement of a long-awaited, democratic showdown between the Sandinista Government and its opponents.
Yet for all the sense of an impending political battle, the greatest public anticipation has focused on a common, overriding hope of starting anew. Partisans on both sides are looking to Sunday's vote as a means of breaking the long communal conflict that has gripped Nicaragua from within and without. And amid the ruins of a shattered national economy, even the governing Sandinista National Liberation Front is ready to define itself in contrast to the country's current disarray. 
 
An Exhausted Population
''Everything will be better.'' reads the Sandinistas' forward-looking main slogan, now brushed in bright colors on buildings and walls throughout the country.
For an exhausted population, there is no question about the depth of the country's crisis, only about who should be held responsible. In the last 10 years, the Nicaraguan economy has lost half its value. Real wages have plunged to less than 10 percent of their former worth, and private consumption has fallen by more than 70 percent. An American embargo has helped put a virtual stranglehold on trade.
In the costly war against American-supported contra rebels, more than 30,000 Nicaraguans have been killed, leaving virtually no family untouched by violent tragedy. Another 10 percent of the population, fleeing everything from Government confiscations to contra predations to the military draft, has simply left the country altogether, creating a wrenching national drama of separated relatives, illegal emigration and abandoned livelihoods.
The decision that now awaits Nicaraguan voters is who should bear the blame for such misery. Is it a result of Sandinista policies, which even Government officials admit have polarized the public, creating a powerful and arbitrary government that even zealous Sandinistas say must be restrained?
Or is it a result of foreign aggression, the decision of the United States to finance a long and brutal war that has ravaged the Nicaraguan countryside, never seriously challenging the Sandinista's hold on power, yet arguably provoking their worst excesses?
After years of political conflict, most Nicaraguans remain deeply reluctant to discuss their personal views, and few experienced diplomats and foreign experts here have dared to predict how the public will express its answers to those questions at the voting booth.
Sandinista leaders have declared that there is not even ''a hypothetical chance'' that they could lose the election; opposition leaders are equally confident of their own strength.
 
Central Question
But the retrospective judgment is so central that it has overshadowed any other debate about future policies or even about the qualities of the two principal candidates, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of the Sandinista National Liberation Front and Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of the National Opposition Union.
Sandinista leaders believe the subject is so powerful, and the country's crisis so grave, that they have not tried to deny the public's discontent, but have used it as a springboard for their own nationalistic message. Addressing a vast crowd of 300,000 at the closing rally of his campaign here on Wednesday evening, Mr. Ortega abruptly became his Government's own critic.
''The situation of the workers, of the people,'' he shouted, seeming to float above the sea of his supporters on a narrow, extended stage that has become a trademark of his campaign, ''from the economic and material point of view, is it good or bad?''
''Bad,'' responded the crowd, timidly, as if uncertain how to respond.
''It's bad! It's bad! It's bad! Of course the situation is bad!'' Mr. Ortega prompted them. ''But are the people going to betray the revolution because of that?''
To 40-year-old Amelia Galo, who was standing deep among the crowd, the answer was a ringing ''No!'' and the question itself was proof of the candor and honesty of a leader that she has long admired and supported.
 
'Think Where We Could Be'
''The Sandinistas have accomplished a lot, and under the worst conditions,'' she said, wearing a Sandinista campaign T-shirt. ''If there was no aggression, no embargo, just think where we could be. Violeta is just a puppet of the United States. If she is elected, it would be like selling out.''
The mother of three girls and wife of an unskilled private sector worker, Mrs. Galo says her family does not depend on the Government for its living. But she said that she and her family would support the Sandinista Front ''100 percent'' because it had given Nicaragua a sense of national pride and unity that would have permitted it to progress if not for the war.
But just a few blocks from the broad plaza where Mr. Ortega spoke, Juanita Espinoza could hardly differ more with Mrs. Galo's views.
Originally from the north central province of Matagalpa, Mrs. Espinoza, who is 43 years old, came to Managua six years ago as part of the large influx of workers in the early part of Sandinista rule, when officials imposed a number of economic controls that favored urban over rural workers.
But for those six years, Mrs. Espinoza, her husband and their eight children have been unable afford a proper home and have lived in the ruins of an old cinema behind Managua's main square in the large urban wasteland that was left by a devastating earthquake here in 1972 and never repaired.
 
Barely Enough to Live
Mrs. Espinoza's husband does some construction, but is out of work, and her 13-year-old daughter sometimes finds work as a laundress. But it is all just barely enough to buy corn, beans and oil to live from day to day, and Mrs. Espinoza says she has placed her hopes on an opposition victory to repair Nicaragua's economy.
When the Sandinistas held their final rally on Wednesday, crowds of supporters swarmed past Mrs. Espinoza's home, in what used to be the upper lobby of the cinema, which has no roof or windows. But Mrs. Espinoza, who worries about the thin rain of stone chips that falls constantly from the cracked, fragile structure, says she was not impressed.
 
Longing for the Past
''All those people weren't there out of conviction,'' she said. ''It was just the thing to do. I haven't a Sandinista scarf, too. I use it for a pot holder.''
Mrs. Espinoza says she is particularly concerned for her two draft-age sons, who have evaded military conscription. But she says the economic crisis has told her all she wants to know about the Sandinista Government.
Before the revolution, Mrs. Espinoza recalls, she could afford to buy a bottle of cheap perfume for 40 cordobas, then about $5. ''Now things like that are in the clouds,'' she said. ''They are only to dream about, to call up from your memory. Oh, it was luxurious. Now it's all a lie.''
 
A NICARAGUAN ELECTION PRIMER
 
 The Candidates
 Sandinista National Liberation Front
 President: Daniel Ortega Saavedra, 44 years old, a member of the nine-member Sandinistia national directorate.
 
 National Opposition Union
 President: Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, 60, publisher of La Prensa, the country's major opposition newspaper.
Founded as an electoral alliance in 1989. Comprising 14 political parties and groups ranging from conservatives to Communists and supported by the Miskito Indian movement Yatama, it includes most of parties that boycotted the 1984 election. The presidential candidate is the widow of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Cardenal, an anti-Somoza newspaper editor who was assassinated in 1978, setting off an uprising that led to the Sandinista revolution.
 
 Other Parties
 
 There are eight smaller parties, ranging from the Social Christian Party to the Marxist-Leninist Popular Action Movement. But those parties combined are expected to receive less than 5 percent of vote.
 
 The Offices
 
 President and Vice President
 The two posts are elected as a ticket by direct popular ballot; there is no runoff vote.
 
 National Assembly
 It will include 90 deputies, and losing presidential candidates who receive a specified minimum vote. Each deputy will have an elected alternate. Ballots are cast for party slates, not individual candidates. Representation will be proportional.
 
 Municipal Councils
For Managua and large municipalities, the slate with the most votes will get at least half the seats. The remaining seats will be allocated according to the proportion of total votes received. Each council elects a mayor from its own members.
 
 Autonomous Regional Councils
 The two Atlantic-coast regions will elect 45-member regional councils, each based on proportional representation from 15 voting districts.
 
 The Voters
 
 Voting age: 16.
 
About 1,750,000 Nicaraguans, or more than 90 percent of the eligible population, registered to vote in October. More than 50 percent of voters are under the age of 30. More than 90 percent of the population is concentrated in the western third of country along the Pacific Coast.
 
 The Observers
 
 Nearly 2,000 official observers and invited guests from across the world will witness the election.
 
 United Nations Observers for Verification of Elections in Nicaragua
 
 A total of 239 trained officers from the United Nations staff will monitor polls by jeep, plane and helicopter. The group has been working in country since August, gradually building to full strength. It will conduct its own independent vote count on election night based on original tally sheets from all 4,391 polling stations.
 
 Organization of American States
 
 A total of 435 trained officers from the O.A.S. staff, which began working in the country in August, will also conduct an independent vote count on election night based on original tally sheets.
 
 Carter Center and Council of Free-Elected Heads of State
 
 Former President Jimmy Carter will lead a delegation of 39 distinguished observers. Delegation members have visited Nicaragua six times since August. They will coordinate election-day monitoring with the United Nations and the O.A.S. An official United States commission appointed by President Bush to monitor the election process was denied permission to enter the country by the Sandinista Government, which accused it of partiality.

HEADLINE: For Unions' Hierarchy, Good News Amid Grim

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Feb. 23

 BODY:
The American people are always down on someone, the pollster told the trade unionists here: big government, big business or big labor.
But big labor finally seems to be on the ascent again, he added, with one-third of the public saying it instinctively sides with the union when a strike erupts and only one-quarter rooting for the company.
''This is the highest level of support for unions, and the lowest for companies, we've ever recorded since we began asking the question a dozen years ago,'' said the pollster, Edward B. Keller of the Roper Organization. In 1977, for example, 28 percent of those polled said they would instinctively side with the union in a strike and 32 percent with management. 
For the 35 leaders of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations who convene here each February, Mr. Keller's announcement was just one of several heartwarming ones this week. The agreement to end the Pittston Coal Group strike in Appalachia was ratified by a near 2-to-1 vote, and the Supreme Court supported the United Steelworkers' plea to stop the White House budget office from blocking worker-safety regulations.
 
'Monies, Bodies, Resources'
The leaders say the solidarity they showed in the coal strike, with all the federation's unions providing support, was crucial in gaining a favorable settlement with a company that they said was out to break the mine workers' union. As a result, the union leaders decided to do the same if 10 unions of The Daily News in New York go on strike, a possibility at the end of March.
''Monies, bodies, resources, we'll give it all,'' said Richard L. Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers.
Veterans of this annual meeting say the leaders also more closely resemble the people whom Roper polls than they did a decade ago. The balding and ample-bellied stereotypes of union bosses have largely been replaced by trim-looking men who have been wearing bankerly suits throughout the meetings and who are departing with no more of a tan than they came with.
But behind the upbeat mood here remain some stark facts unsettling to organized labor.
Despite the abundant resources that the 97 affiliate unions of the federation have deployed in behalf of 8,500 striking airline machinists, the strike against Eastern Airlines will reach its first anniversary on March 4, and those jobs may be lost for good.
Further, organized labor's standing in the American economy continues to slip. Workers who belong to unions are only 16.4 percent of the labor force now, as against 18.8 percent in 1984 and 23 percent in 1977. Last year, for example, the number of union members dropped by 42,000, to 16,960,000.
 
Improvement in Relations
The political environment for labor remains uncertain as well. The Bush Administration has raised tempers for refusing to intervene in the Eastern strike and vetoing Congress's proposed creation of an emergency board last year to look into the strike.
Nevertheless, Labor Secretary Elizabeth H. Dole has taken some edge off the sharp hostility of the Reagan years. She intervened in the Pittston strike by appointing a mediator, and she has beefed up enforcement of the worker safety and child labor laws.
On a personal level, Mrs. Dole seems quite comfortable with the union leadership. During her visit to the convention here, she seemed to know all the leaders by nickname, as in Morty Bahr, of the Communications Workers of America, and Rich Trumka. The unionists seem disinclined to extend to her their anger at the President.
Some people here say the A.F.L.-C.I.O. leadership ought to spend less energy flogging an Administration it cannot change and more on organizing all those workers whom the Roper poll suggests are more predisposed to think favorably of a union.
But that counsel is useless for groups like the United Steelworkers of America, whose president, Lynn R. Williams, noted that as production capacity in the steel industry has declined in the last decade, employment has declined even more, to 120,000, from almost 300,000. Still, the advice certainly applies to some others. In the service industries that have accounted for most of the labor force's growth, organized labor's share of the jobs is only 6 percent.
In one sector of the economy, government, unions are highly represented, claiming membership of 37 percent of the work force, and they are still gaining ground. Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said his union had gained 189,000 members in the 1980's, ''and we're already 20,000 ahead in 1990.''
 
Tackling the Abortion Issue
Many of these new members are women, who Mr. McEntee said are proving easier to organize than men.
But women have not made great strides in the federation hierarchy. Only 3 of the 35 members of the executive council are women.
Still, the rapid increase of women in the labor force has forced the federation to take up the issue of abortion. To define a policy, Lane Kirkland, president of the federation, established an unusually large committee of 14 members. When three union presidents complained a day later that they had wanted to be on it, too, he added them.
''I think people want to know where we stand on this issue,'' Mr. McEntee said. But several Catholic organiations have threatened to advise union members to withhold membership dues if the federation supports a woman's right to choose abortion.
''It's a generally pro-choice committee,'' said an official of the National Association of Letter Carriers, ''but there's a faction that says the issue is too hot to handle and might endorse both sides.''
The committee could recommend a position as early as May.

HEADLINE: SENATORS SEEK CAP ON AIDES' INCOME

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
As the heat of ethics issues shifts from the House to the Senate, some members are seeking to tighten rules that permit Senate aides to augment their salaries unrestricted by limits that will soon apply to the rest of Congress.
Some Senate aides routinely accept fees for speeches and consulting work, sometimes from groups under their legislative purview, a review of their latest financial disclosure reports shows. Critics of the practice contend that it creates a potential conflict, as aides who wield power over legislation reap financial benefits from interested trade associations or other groups.
While the records show that the speaking fees for most aides are relatively small, generally under $10,000 a year, the absence of limits on outside income has permitted some of them to garner larger amounts, $20,000 to $25,000, for consulting work. 
 
Dodd Introduces Legislation
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, has introduced legislation to subject the Senate to the same rules the House adopted last year, which go into effect in January 1991 for members and staff. Starting next year, speaking fees for House members and aides will be banned and a limit imposed on outside earnings, excluding investments, of 15 percent of their salaries.
''Senators, like all employees, ought to be paid by the people they work for - the taxpayers,'' Senator Dodd said in a statement when he introduced the measure. ''The pay system that has evolved over the years, with the public paying the bulk of a senator's salary and a handful of interest groups picking up the rest, is untenable, and it must be changed.''
Congress, under strong pressure to curb the sometimes huge supplementary earnings of senators and representatives, passed legislation last year that in effect traded earnings from speechmaking for higher pay. But while the House banned speaking fees for members and staff and limited their outside income, the Senate only reduced the amount of permissible outside income for members, on a sliding scale over a period of years, and left staff members as unfettered as ever.
Speaking fees received by staff aides, the records show, generally range from $2,000 to $6,000 a year.
But a great deal more was earned by Kevin C. Gottlieb, a former staff director of the Senate Banking Committee, who resigned in January after news reports about his outside income and links to Charles H. Keating Jr., the owner of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, which the Government claimed was insolvent last year and took over.
In addition to speaking fees in 1989 that exceeded $35,800, Mr. Gottlieb received more than $700,000 in an 18-month break from Senate employment; most of it came in salary as head of the Outdoor Advertising Association of America.
 
Gottlieb Addressed Gatherings
As a Senate aide, Mr. Gottlieb addressed business executives or graduate students at a university consortium called the Washington Campus on scores of occasions last year, collecting $600 for each appearance. His total fees are not known because Mr. Gottlieb does not itemize his receipts and has not yet filed a disclosure form for 1989, which will be due in May. He did not return telephone calls about the matter.
Critics say that while speaking fees are legal for staff aides, they are nonetheless improper. ''It allows a relationship where private interests can put money directly into the pockets of a public official,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a lobbying group that specializes in issues of money and politics. ''That is a formula for disaster.''
An examination of disclosure forms shows that House and Senate staff members have commonly received payments and trips from those with whom they deal. The extent of the practice is unknown, since disclosure is required only of aides whose salary this year is at least $69,451.
Daryl H. Owen, majority staff director for the Senate Energy Committee, and D. Michael Harvey, the panel's chief counsel, each accepted $1,000 in 1988 for appearances before the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. Charles H. Riemenschneider, majority staff director of the Senate Agriculture Committee, was paid $2,000 for a speech to the Rice Millers Association.
Charles N. Kahn 3d, a health care specialist on the staff of the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax laws, received $5,000 from medical societies and Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceutical company, for speeches and writing.
 
Aide Calls Sessions Valuable
M. Lamar Smith, the Republican staff director and economist on the Senate Banking Committee, reported only two $500 speaking fees but took 15 trips in 1988 to meet mainly with bankers in places like Palm Springs, Calif.; Honolulu, Las Vegas, Nev., Miami and Key Largo, Fla.
In an interview, Mr. Smith said these are places ''where the trade associations choose to hold their conventions.'' He noted that legislative update sessions are helpful to him and almost obligatory.
Some say the acceptance of speaking fees and other payments is already on the wane because of increased attention to the issue.
In the new climate, said a 20-year Senate aide, ''Gottlieb stands out.'' A longtime staff aide in the House added, ''Nobody that I know speaks for money anymore.''

HEADLINE: EVICTION FIGHT FOCUSES ON CITY HALL PROMISES

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Gershon Mamlak, a slight intense man, talks about his past and present in impassioned bursts. He stabs the air with a finger to press a point and pulls letters out of manila folders to document others.
His is, in many ways, an uplifting tale. He arrived in the United States in 1951, having survived Nazi concentration camps. He built a small upholstery business on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, sent three children to college and graduate school, and even earned a Ph.D. in ancient history. 
Perhaps the only thing that has marred Mr. Mamlak's American passage have been his encounters with the bureaucracy. Three times in the last 30 years, urban-renewal plans have forced him to relocate his business.
Now he is resisting a fourth move, as New York City is trying to evict him, after reneging on a plan to help him buy a nearby building. If it succeeds, he says, he will be forced into an unwanted retirement. Victim or Beneficiary? Mr. Mamlak, who is 67 years old, says his situation illustrates the shortcomings of a cold-hearted city government that puts too little emphasis on the needs of individuals.
''They are taking away from me a source of making a living, a source of satisfaction,'' Mr. Mamlak said. ''All I want is to continue.''
But municipal officials view Mr. Mamlak as a beneficiary of progress, not its victim. They say he has paid extraordinarily low rents in city-owned buildings for years. The real problem, they say, is that like other tenants who have remained for years in apartments and stores at artificially low rents, Mr. Mamlak is now shocked at the high rents the market commands.
The case is in housing court, where a hearing is scheduled for March 8.
Mr. Mamlak contends that the city failed to keep a promise, made three years ago, to help him relocate. But city officials say he will not consider other sites because the rent would be far more than the $184 a month he pays for a store at 135 Delancey Street, and storage space a half-block away.
Since his last relocation in 1971, Mr. Mamlak has done business on the ground floor of the six-story apartment building on Delancey Street. He has been the city's sole tenant in the building for the last five or six years.
 
Dispute Goes Back 5 Years
The city says the building, at the corner of Norfolk Street, must come down, because it is unsafe and to make way for three apartment towers to be built by the developer Samuel J. LeFrak. Mr. Mamlak maintains the building poses no danger and notes that the LeFrak plan has not yet been approved.
The roots of the dispute extend to 1985, when municipal officials suggested Mr. Mamlak vacate his store and buy a city building on the next block, at 125 Delancey Street. Mr. Mamlak said he reluctantly agreed. He said he paid more than $5,500 for appraisals and surveys. Both the community board and the City Planning Commission approved the sale.
But the day before the contract was to be signed in April 1987, the city withdrew the offer. Paul A. Crotty, then the Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, said that officials had just formulated a new housing plan for a site that included both buildings. He conceded that the negotiations with Mr. Mamlak should have been halted sooner, and he promised to work with him to relocate the store.
Mr. Mamlak said last week that the city never made good on the pledge. ''I have letters,'' he said. ''They advised me to look for myself.''
 
City Says It Has Helped
City officials say they did try to help Mr. Mamlak. ''We have been following through,'' said Catie Marshall, a Housing Department spokeswoman. ''The problem here is that everything we have offered him has been basically at market-rate rents.''
In January 1989, Mr. Mamlak was given listings with private brokers for two storefronts on the Avenue of the Americas in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, said Roz Post, another department spokeswoman. Last month -after the first court hearing in his case - Mr. Mamlak was told of three more sites, two on 14th Street in Manhattan and another in Brooklyn, Ms. Post said. Landlords are asking as much as $1,500 a month, she said.
Mr. Mamlak contended that the city had offered him no real assistance until after the eviction proceedings began. He said he could not afford rents in prime Manhattan locations.
He also said the city owed him a chance to stay on the Lower East Side, partly because it had wasted his time and money on the proposal to buy 125 Delancey Street. City officials said there were no appropriate sites in the neighborhood.
The City Council President, Andrew J. Stein, who serves as a city ombudsman, has asked the Housing Department to reconsider Mr. Mamlak's eviction. His case, Mr. Stein said, ''shows how the city doesn't keep its word.''

Professors to Vote On Plan to Close A Department

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
Nearly a year after Washington University announced that it would close its sociology department, debate over the the move still divides faculty members, who are to vote on Friday on a resolution in support of the department.
Supporters of the resolution, which was submitted by an informal faculty group with 90 co-signers, say the real question is whether a university can offer a liberal arts education without sociology, which they see as a crucial discipline. Those who would let the department die argue that the school cannot afford to do everything.
The dean of the faculty, Martin Israel, who last April decided to close the department in June 1991, said the decision had little to do with the content of sociology itself. He pointed to cuts at other top universities because of financial constraints. Columbia University is closing its linguistics and geography departments; Princeton is closing its statistics department, and Johns Hopkins is losing classics in the midst of a 10 percent cut in the size of the Arts and Sciences faculty. 
 
'A Unique Vision'
''It isn't only Washington University saying you have to be making choices,'' Mr. Israel said. ''Some of the people who favored this resolution are looking narrowly at the question of 'Should there be sociology?' The question must be 'Should we be planning; should we be making choices?' ''
For many in the faculty, though, sociology is too important to be eliminated. ''Sociology has a unique vision and view within the social sciences,'' said Daniel Kohl, a biology professor and leader of the department's supporters. ''The decision weakens the social sciences because it removes a unique contributor.''
The chairman of the sociology department, Marvin Cummins, said he recognized that ''universities face resource constraints'' but argued that if the university cannot maintain sociology ''there is a truth-in-labeling issue as to whether they bill themselves as a liberal arts institution.''
Others suggest that such a broad liberal arts education may no longer be possible. Robert Salisbury, a political science professor who sits on the committee that advised Mr. Israel in his decision, said, ''The expansion of knowledge and explosion of what there is to study has meant that for any particular field to do an adequate job, it has to grow.'' And for most departments to grow, some must be cut back, or in the case of sociology, cut altogether, he said.
 
Significant Discipline
The decision to cut sociology, Mr. Salisbury said, stems from what he termed weaknesses in the department, not in the discipline. While internationally respected 20 years ago, sociology at Washington University has seen a slow decline since, with no one having received tenure since 1974.
''I believe sociology represents a significant intellectual discipline, one that ought ultimately and ideally to be represented on our campus,'' Mr. Salisbury said. To make Washington's department respectable, though, would take ''an investment of a very large amount of money.'' The administration has not said how much that would be.
Others who support the closing are less affectionate toward the field.
''It seems to be well meaning but insubstantial,'' said Peter Riesenberg, a history professor. ''The creative period in sociology was a long time ago. It has lost its ability to identify new questions and develop new techniques,'' he said in an interview.
Mr. Cummins, one of three tenured professors in sociology, said this perspective showed ''a clear lack of understanding of the nature of sociology.''
''Political science does a wonderful job on questions of poverty as a policy issue,'' he said. ''Economics does an equally wonderful job of looking at it from an income-distribution perspective. But sociology asks how people in poverty live and do they aspire to other things.''
A psychology professor who supports the department, Arthur Shulman, said the interaction between sociology and related disciplines makes the department necessary. He said the psychology department could not run its organizational-behavior doctoral program without sociologists as collaborators.
''We couldn't have on this campus a viable physics department if we didn't have a viable chemistry department,'' he said. ''The same holds for psychology, education, political science,'' in relation to sociology. The vote on Friday is nonbinding. According to a telephone survey by Student Life, the campus newspaper, 59 percent of faculty members support or tend to support the department, while almost 25 percent oppose it. A full 17 percent were still undecided last week when the survey, with a 7 percent margin of error, was conducted.

Volunteers Take To the Street For Safety Patrol

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
As freezing winds blew across Spruce Street, a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania, John Steele, was on patrol trying to protect fellow students from crime and his hands from the cold.
Shining a flashlight down alleys and into backyards, Mr. Steele and a junior economics major from Norristown, Gerry Cosgrove, walked past row houses, restaurants and the veterinary school on their one-hour shift. Last semester, at least four students in the area were the victims of armed robberies. 
The pair greeted friends and surprised two women taking a shortcut. By 1:30 A.M., they had turned their equipment over to the second shift and gone home.
As part of a program begun this month, Penn Watch, students with flashlights, two-way radios and bright yellow jackets patrol their western Philadelphia campus at high-crime hours. In their two months, the volunteers have not been involved in any incidents. But students and the police said their efforts were making the school a better place to live.
''Even though we don't see much, our presence is known,'' Mr. Steele, a public-policy major from Lehighton, Pa., said. ''When people walk by, they check us out, because wearing these yellow jackets we are very visible. People know that something is going on.''
 
Aiding the Police Force
About 250 students have been trained to describe suspects and use the radio. They patrol seven days a week, said the coordinator, Joel Nied, a senior history major from Jacksonville, Fla. Each person will patrol ''about three or four times a semester,'' he added.
To join the program, students must sign a form saying that they ''take entire responsibility for their actions'' and acknowledge that they are not employees of the university, said Jane Combrinck-Graham, a risk-control specialist.
The program began in three areas with fraternity and sorority members. The chairman of the Penn Undergraduate Assembly, Benjamin Karsch, has since begun recruiting other students. Mr. Karsch said he would like two new areas, covering dormitories, patrolled by May.
''Any student who we explain it to is able to see the benefit,'' said Mr. Karsch, a finance and marketing senior from Tucson, Ariz. ''In short we are directly helping Public Safety,'' the Penn police force.
Mr. Nied said he and the two other fraternity members who began Penn Watch had been inspired by a similar program at neighboring Drexel University. The president's office at Penn paid $1,500 for the jackets and flashlights. The university police provides other support, and the volunteers are trained to watch for criminal activities and to call police officers to catch suspects.
''We are really the eyes and ears of public safety,'' Mr. Nied said. ''We don't want to get involved in an incident.''
A spokeswoman for the university police, Sylvia Canada, said Penn Watch was a welcome supplement to the 50-member force and that she hoped it would help people feel safer.

Here, Doubtful Shoppers Are Advised to Pounce

 BODY:
On any given Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the U.S. No. 1 Flea Market and Antiques in New Brunswick, N.J., about 45 minutes down the turnpike from Manhattan, draws some 30,000 people. They push their way past sweatshirt vendors and bulletin boards announcing events like a Marvelettes concert at the local high school to get through the streaky glass doors.
Inside, 500 or so booths and tables are laid out more or less along a grid. The overflow of merchandise snakes around the floor, creating alleys and cul-de-sacs. 
Clothing lurks overhead along a profusion of racks, and the visitor who changes direction too quickly is likely to come nose-to-neckline with, say, an evening dress in an exuberant lame or black-and-silver beadwork. A bower of T-shirts and Nike pump high-tops forms a passageway into boutiques with bin upon bin of nylon stockings at discount prices.
 
Wrenches and Antiques
There is enough here for everyone: Down one aisle a tool stand sells, among other things, sprocket wrench and screwdriver sets at near-wholesale prices; down another, a baseball-card booth offers images of the boys of several summers under glass. There is a pet-products boutique, a car-stereo booth, an antiques salon. And at site after site, tables are weighed down with that populist commodity, the collectible. Where else can one still find eight-track tapes and Ferrante and Teicher albums?
With the building's expanse of 175,000 square feet and legions of bargain-hunters it is easy to get lost in the crowd. Among the shoppers, a young woman pondered a pastel continuum of bridal veils and solicited advice from her relatives. A Senegalese couple culled through the fresh produce in the farmer's market section of the building.
The international feel of the place is only five or six years old, said Barbara Witkowski, the market's advertising director. Some vendors, she said, use the flea market as the first step in an entrepreneurial career.
''It makes sense,'' she said. ''At malls, you pay for maintenance and electricity. We have low overhead costs. It's an easy way to get started in a business.''
But many vendors come only for the weekend and the fun. U.S. 1 encourages the rambunctious ambience by bringing in live entertainment on Sundays to play throughout the afternoon. Last weekend, Gabe Bay and the Country Crickets, a band from Milltown, N.J., ripped through a set of country-western and 50's songs, inspiring members of the audience to dance a modified Texas two-step. The bandstand's placement behind the Book Bazaar added a dimension to browsing through the better-than-average selection of current and remaindered books.
 
No Airs Here
U.S. 1 also encourages haggling, to keep the flea market from taking on the airs of its upscale cousin, the shopping mall. Some vendors set firm prices, but others let them float. Keep in mind that a flea market is not a department store with an infinite inventory. Pouncing may be the most appropriate economic behavior. A visitor last weekend who decided to ''come back later'' to buy a framed Miss Rheingold poster found that another consumer had made off with the prize.
Food is available inexpensively at several stations and ranges from pickles at the Pickle People booth to delis featuring the fare of Greece, Poland and the Middle East. An additional flea market blandishment is the game room, with pinball machines and video games, on the far side of the building.
To get to U.S. No. 1 Flea Market and Antiques, take Exit 9 (New Brunswick) off the New Jersey Turnpike and follow signs onto Route 18 North; take it to Route 1 North; take the first U-turn on Route 1 North, which will take you onto Route 1 South. U.S. 1 has its own exit on the right.
Admission to the market is free; there is a $1 parking fee on Sundays. Band sets, on Sundays only, begin at 1:15, 2:45 and 4:15 P.M. Hours on Friday are noon to 9 P.M.; Saturday, 10 A.M. to 9 P.M., and Sunday, 10 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. For information, call 201-846-0900.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
THE POSTHUMOUS ADVENTURES OF LOUIS KAHN

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
These are heady days for the memory of Louis I. Kahn. The architect died 16 years ago next month, perhaps the most respected presence in his profession. And the intervening years seem only to have enriched Kahn's reputation still more, to the point where it is now no exaggeration to call him the most venerated figure in 20th-century American architecture after Frank Lloyd Wright.
Tragic as Kahn's death from a sudden heart attack was - he left numerous projects unfinished, and at 74 years of age could have been expected to have had more creative years ahead of him - it spared him the experience of living through the 1980's, when architecture became ever more a matter of appearances, and less a matter of substance. To Kahn, substance was all; his buildings were quiet, profound presences, occasionally brooding, often uplifting, and never, ever, glib. Image did not matter to Kahn. The integrity of space, of light, of materials, did. His buildings are nearly mystical in their power, and every one of them is a testament to the ability of architecture to create a sense of both repose and awe. 
It is hard not to think that the growing adoration of Kahn comes, in part, as a reaction against so much of the architecture that has filled the landscape in the years since his death, the slick and facile decorated boxes of the opulent 80's. While Kahn's work was a critical influence on many of today's post-modern architects, who found in his determination to make his buildings sensual and emotional a kind of liberation from the coldness and austerity of modernism, Kahn would probably have had no patience with the last decade's fondness for ever lusher decoration. Indeed, he would probably have found the glitz of the last few years appalling. (Perhaps too much so, since I doubt that he was any more sympathetic to the more serious examples of post-modernism than he was to the sillier ones, but that is another matter.) Luxury to Louis Kahn emerged from the richness of materials and the discipline with which they were put together, not from the quantity of fancy doodads an architect could cram into a single project.
As we move into a decade in which architecture will be forced, by virtue of economic realities if not esthetic tastes, to be more rigorous and more disciplined, Kahn comes ever more to the fore. Not, to be sure, as an example of fiscal restraint - his buildings were in fact quite expensive - but as an example of a kind of intellectual rigor. He sets a tone for taking things seriously.
At his death Kahn left a relatively small oeuvre, and this too has served to enhance his reputation. A Louis Kahn building is a rare event: there are so few of them. There were little more than a dozen major Kahn buildings actually erected, as well as a handful of smaller ones. And of the important Kahn buildings, only three were museums, surely the most intensely examined building type of our time. These three museums, as well as a fourth that the architect had just begun designing at the time of his death, are now the subject of a thorough and unusually timely exhibition, ''The Art Museums of Louis I. Kahn.'' Organized by the Duke University Museum of Art, which published a lavish catalogue to accompany it, the show is now in New Haven at Kahn's first art museum, the Yale University Art Gallery, where it will remain on view through March 11. The exhibition will then move to Kahn's second museum, the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, and then to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
This show comes at the right moment, and not only because of the rising tide of interest in anything Kahn did. Art museums are the cathedrals of our age, and if Kahn is our most revered architect, it would follow that those few museums he designed would possess the allure of shrines. That is particularly so in Fort Worth, where - as if to make this exhibition more timely still - the Kimbell Art Museum is now at the center of an intense and increasingly bitter architectural controversy over its plans to build a major addition to its Kahn structure, changing it irreparably.
Of Kahn's three museum buildings, two are right here in New Haven: in addition to the Yale Art Gallery of 1951, Kahn's first significant public commission, there is his very last building, the Yale Center for British Art, set directly across the street and finished posthumously in 1977. The Kimbell in Fort Worth was completed in 1972, between the two New Haven structures that bracket his career. At the time of his death he had just begun designs for his fourth museum, the Menil Collection in Houston, a commission that was eventually turned over to Renzo Piano and completed in 1987.
It is no insult to ''The Art Museums of Louis I. Kahn,'' which was organized by Michael P. Mezzatesta of Duke, who served for six years as a curator at the Kimbell, to say that the best thing about seeing it in New Haven is the chance it offers to revisit two-thirds of Kahn's museums. I don't know what the show looked like at Duke, but at Yale, one is constantly pulled away from the drawings and models to look up at the art gallery's ceiling of concrete tetrahedrons, a ceiling that seems at once rough and refined, like the building itself celebratory of technology and yet immensely disciplined and serene. And then across the street at the Yale Center for British Art all this contained energy is resolved into a building that is vastly warmer, grander, more sumptuous and more subtle, but never more self-indulgent.
The exhibition seems almost anticlimactic: a long, long footnote to the buildings. This is how Kahn would have wanted it, surely, since he was never one to elevate drawings and models above the reality of architectural experience. To him the drawings were a way into the thing, they were not the thing itself. But as a footnote, this exhibition is excellent: it contains 108 drawings and six models (plus an extra section, to be shown only at Yale, tracing the history of the Yale University Art Gallery), and they show us, as clearly as we could want, the tortured, slow process by which Kahn worked. He was not an architect from whom perfect things sprang instantly, but one who labored long and hard to bring forth his art. His first ideas almost always needed editing, and he was his own best editor.
Both early and late drawings for all the museums are shown here, and we see all the schemes evolve. Particularly striking are the initial drawings and model for the Yale Center for British Art, a version that was much too big and too assertive to have been built, almost bombastic, but still a richly potent, powerful design, in some ways even stronger now than 20 years ago. And the final presentation drawings for the British art center, renderings of the interior court spaces and the facades that were built, are exquisite, haunting pieces, invoking the very same qualities of softness and great power, of formality and self-assuredness with grace, that the finished building has.
There is a certain paradox to this: the best thing about the Kahn drawings is how they show us the process, yet the best drawings are the finished ones at the end of the process. Perhaps the answer to this riddle is that, as with all great artists, the thrown-off pieces of the creative process are not, in the end, quite as interesting as the idea that there is an arduous creative process. Just as musicologists may want to study rejected versions of a Beethoven quartet but the rest of us are content to experience the one that Beethoven felt he actually wanted to bring to the world, so, too, with Louis Kahn's drawings: the most appealing are the ones that show ideas most fully realized.
A final point about the show at Yale. As installed by Tony Hershel, assistant to the director of the Yale Art Gallery, it makes full use of the system of movable panels Kahn designed for the gallery, a tremendous advance for the early 50's that made exhibit space fully flexible. Unfortunately, the system breaks the galleries up into a warren of small spaces, and it is not easy to follow the development of the various projects sequentially. The layout is confusing and disjointed, not because of Mr. Hershel but because of Kahn. How ironic it is that Kahn's very system has somewhat done in this attempt to pay him homage!
We do not come off liking the Yale Art Gallery any the less for this. It is not a case of architectural hubris, a museum building designed with indifference to art. Quite the contrary: these are wonderful spaces to be in, and Kahn's system does not fight art at all. It just makes it very difficult to create a coherent installation that depends, as this one does, on the careful juxtaposition of various drawings.
All this is relevant to the continuing dispute at the Kimbell, which has heated up considerably in recent months, since part of the issue there is whether the opponents of the scheme to expand the museum are elevating Kahn's architecture over the museum's art. The Kimbell is Kahn's most beloved museum, and surely his most subtle: the one in which light and texture play the greatest role, the one in which the architect's ability to be at once forthright and mystical seems most fully realized. The Kimbell is also a superb exhibition space, although not a perfect one, and so the architect Romaldo Giurgola's plan to extend the building by literally replicating Kahn's design at either end seems particularly puzzling. To make the Kimbell bigger by copying Kahn is an odd way indeed to pay him homage.
I don't question for a moment that homage is what was intended, but this design embalms the original building. Under the pretense of both respecting Kahn and serving the needs of the art collection, it will blur the distinction between what Kahn created and what was added by someone else, thus compromising what has turned out to be one of the Kimbell collection's greatest possessions, which is the Kahn building itself.
This does not mean the museum cannot or should not become larger. If there is a true need for expansion (which has been questioned, given the small size of the museum's exemplary collection), then of course the Kimbell should expand in some way. But if there is any lesson to be learned from the exhibition ''The Art Museums of Louis I. Kahn,'' it is that Kahn went through his long and difficult design process to end up with profound and special places, not buildings that could be expanded as if they were made of blocks. If the Kimbell as Kahn designed it were a car, it would become a stretch limousine, expanded beyond its natural proportions.
In a presentation in January before the Architectural League of New York to defend the Giurgola plan, Edmund T. Pillsbury, the director of the Kimbell, spoke of the brilliance of the original concept for the Kimbell, prepared by Richard Brown, its first director and the man who hired Louis I. Kahn. Brown envisioned a museum that would have been somewhat larger than the present Kimbell, and all on one floor, as the Kimbell is. Mr. Pillsbury made much of the fact that the original designs for the Kimbell called for a bigger building than what was built, and presented the Giurgola scheme as consistent with Brown's vision for the museum - and claimed that both Kahn and Brown would have wanted to give the institution of the Kimbell pre-eminence over the building itself.
Perhaps so. Everyone, both for and against this addition, is claiming the spirit of Kahn as an ally. That part of the debate does no one any good, since Kahn is dead. But to suggest that this particular expansion plan is a mistake is hardly to say that Kahn's building as a work of architecture is more deserving of respect than the institution that occupies it. Both things, the building and the institution, are critical, and if the 18 years since the Kimbell opened have done anything, they have made the destinies of this building and the art it houses increasingly interdependent. What Brown, who died in 1979, could not have known when he wrote his initial wish for the museum is that the Kahn building would succeed beyond his wildest dreams, and would become one of the icons of 20th-century American architecture. The experience of living with the Kimbell has made its building more important than anyone, even Louis Kahn, might have expected: the Kimbell has become only richer and deeper and more significant as a part of our culture as the years have gone on, to the point where it now deserves to be cherished as much as anything else in the museum's collection. That is not architectural idolatry but simple fact, and far from denying it, the museum should be celebrating it.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Tokyo Teeters, But New York Holds Firm

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
In October 1987 and again two years later, Wall Street started panics that spread around the world, only to be slowed and eventually halted in Tokyo. Each time, the Japanese stock market slipped a little but soon rallied, to the great relief of traders everywhere.
These days, however, Tokyo is doing its best to seem like the old New York. Amid amazing volatility, share quotes plunged last week, while the yen also came under pressure. And just like the bad old days in New York, there were those who were eager to pin the blame on program traders. (Story on page 15.) On this side of the Pacific, the Nikkei's plunge was viewed nervously, but with a steely determination not to follow it down. All things considered, the New York market turned in a remarkably good performance. The Dow Jones industrial average fell each day of the holiday-shortened week, but on both Wednesday and Friday it showed considerable resistance to follow Tokyo's plunges. It ended the week down 71.40 points, to 2,564.19, and is just 20.95 points above the six-month low it hit in late January. 
Tokyo's problems are not unique, of course. Interest rates have been marching up in almost every market. Charles Clough, the chief strategist at Merrill Lynch, sees in that rise a message that the bond markets of the world fear inflation, and a warning that the economies of many countries are in trouble.
''When interest rates go up in parabolic curves, as they are now,'' he said, ''it usually indicates that the business cycle is near a peak.'' He recommended traders sell some stocks to raise cash, and said that worries about corporate profits are likely to intensify. That's what happened to Digital Equipment Corporation, whose shares fell to a four-year low as the company said it might post a quarterly loss.
While Japan was watched nervously, Wall Street's attention also was on Washington, where Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave testimony that some took to mean he was worried about inflation, and others took to prove the opposite. ''It is the job of the Federal Reserve chairman to be Delphic,'' said Abby Joseph Cohen, the erstwhile chief investment strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. She thinks the hidden message is that he wants to be reassuring, but that he can't risk easing credit.
''He has the double-barreled problem of inflation and currency, which is quite wobbly on the foreign exchange markets,'' she said, adding that the current period of slow growth could yet turn into a recession.
Earnings, interest rates, currencies and the like are the things Wall Street likes to claim it watches. But the real focus last week continued to be the death throes of Drexel. Fred Joseph, who had kept his job as chief executive by persuading the Government he hadn't had the foggiest notion what Michael Milken was doing, seems to have preserved his reputation for obtuseness. Weeks before Drexel collapsed, it was learned, Mr. Joseph took his bonus from the firm in Drexel stock, while others more wisely opted for cash.

THE ECONOMY

 
The Greenspan Watch
 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is likely to leave interest rates just where they are. He spent last week delivering optimistic statements, with the usual hedging. Before a House panel on Tuesday, he predicted modest growth and said the danger of a recession probably has passed. Fed watchers concluded he would not lower interest rates. Bond prices plummeted. On Thursday, when he told Senators that inflation was easing, despite a recent surge, Fed watchers said he was unlikely to raise rates. Bond prices recovered.
 
'Troubling' Inflation
 
Consumer prices climbed 1.1 percent in January, the largest monthly gain in seven years. Drop energy and food prices, which were bound to soar after December's cold snap, and the core rate of inflation still reached six-tenths of 1 percent. ''A troubling number,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Georgia State University Economic Forecasting Center. He predicts inflation of 4.7 percent for the year, compared with 4.6 percent in 1989 - inflation rates the Federal Reserve has called unacceptable. 
 
F.D.I.C. Retreat
 
Imagine that every insurance company issued policies with a $100,000 limit, then covered all losses no matter how large. This has, in effect, been the practice of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in bailing out depositors at banks it considers too big to fail. But on Wednesday, William Seidman, the F.D.I.C.'s chairman, said this policy had become too costly to maintain. His possible solutions include paying back just 90 cents on the dollar for all deposits of more than $100,000 at a failing bank, or asking the banking industry itself to insure larger sums.
 
The Nikkei's Decline
 
Tokyo stock prices are tumbling. The Nikkei index fell 6.9 percent last week, to 34,890.97. Wednesday's 1,161.19-point, 3.2 percent decline was the third-largest ever. Traders blamed rising interest rates in Japan. Higher rates there and in Germany have raised American rates as well. American stocks also fell, but not as much as the Japanese market. For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 71.40 points, closing at 2,564.19.
 
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Tokyo: Charity Begins in the U.S.
The next American enterprise the Japanese seek to penetrate could well be the United Way. Japanese officials have told the nation's leading executives that their companies will be able to take heavy tax deductions for contributions to American charities. It is the latest effort by the Japanese to ease tensions over their growing presence in the United States. Japanese officials are also urging companies with United States operations to adopt the American ways of volunteerism. And then boast about it. As a new Japanese Chamber of Commerce handbook on corporate citizenship in the United States says, ''It is important in American society to take credit for good works accomplished.''

Japan's Liberal Democratic Party emerged from elections for the lower house of Parliament last week with renewed control and greater apparent ability to negotiate compromises on trade.
 
 
Volvo and Renault Swap
 
Volvo A.B. of Sweden and Renault S.A. of France said Friday they would swap much of their stock and combine many of the car and truck operations.
 
 
East Bloc Opportunies Knock
 
While President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia made the rounds in Washington last Wednesday, his top economic advisers courted the leaders of Wall Street. They want foreign companies to start operations and buy state-owned enterprises in Czechoslovakia. Several American companies, including the General Electric Company and the Chrysler Corporation, are already holding talks with manufacturers there. But first the Czechs need to do some housekeeping - like legalizing foreign business ownership.

American companies are looking to the East Bloc for bargains on brainpower. Monsanto, Perkin-Elmer and Du Pont are sponsoring research in the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. Scientific research centers in these countries have had few incentives until now to market their findings.
 
 
COMPANIES
 
 
Bonuses for the Drexel Few
 
Would you hire an investment banker who didn't know his own company was collapsing? Executives of Drexel Burhham Lambert Inc. say they shelled out $350 million in bonuses in the last few months without dreaming that their parent company would have to file for bankruptcy protection on Feb. 13. Last Wednesday, Frederick H. Joseph, the firm's chief executive, told some creditors that, to keep key employees, Drexel had promised in early 1989 to award huge bonuses for the year - raising further questions about giving payoffs before performance. Some of the bonuses are said to have topped $10 million. Several of Drexel's creditors are livid. They plan to scour the firm's books and ask the courts to help them recover some of the payouts.
 
Good Ship Trump, Rough Waters
 
Trump casinos, Trump hotels, Trump apartment towers and Trump shuttles could be losing their allure due to the Trump marital feud, some marketing experts say. But Donald J. Trump himself said last week, ''The business has never been better.'' Advertising executives say that the public's sympathies are with his wife, Ivana, making her an ideal celebrity endorser. Although she manages the Plaza, one leading ad man, Jerry Della Femina, suggests she promote Ramada Inns. ''She knows what makes a good hotel,'' he said. ''She certainly has everyone's attention.'' And since her husband owns the Trump Shuttle, why not sign up Ivana to represent his rival? ''I just love the thought of her getting on the Pan Am Shuttle,'' Mr. Della Femina said.
 
Fat's in the Marketing Fire
 
The Monsanto Corporation is counting on millions of Americans to abandon fat for heated, whipped, filtered globules of egg whites and milk proteins. On Thursday, this product, called Simplesse, became the first low-calorie substitute for fat to win the Food and Drug Administration's approval. Nutrasweet, a Monsanto subsidiary, plans to begin selling a frozen dessert made with Simplesse by late spring. Next could come Simplesse mayonnaise, sour cream, margarine, dips and cheese. Some nutritionists hail Simplesse as a sure way to lower dietary fat. Others say that just as sugar substitutes have failed to lower consumption of sugar, a fat substitute will leave Americans and their diets just as fat.
 
Exxon and Justice Reach a Plea
 
Alaskan officials fear the Justice Department will let the Exxon Corporation off too easily. They said Thursday that Exxon and the Government have drafted a plea bargain that would allow the company to avoid criminal prosecution for its Exxon Valdez oil spill last March. Exxon would have to pay as much as $500 million, but would be protected for four years from Government lawsuits to recover billions more for environmental damage. Exxon is bound to see a lot more of Alaska this spring in any event, since the company agreed last week to resume its cleanup of blackened beaches.
 
Another Big Eye in the Sky
 
There's network television, cable television - and now, satellite television. NBC, Rupert Mudoch, the Cablevision Systems Corporation and Hughes Communications Inc. announced a $1 billion venture last Wednesday to beam programs straight into homes once Hughes launches a powerful new satellite in 1993. Sky Cable subscribers will need dishes - in appearance, more like panels - that are only about the size, and cost, of color televisions. Sky Cable will compete with the networks, the cable operators and another satellite service announced just the week before. The rival, K Prime Partners, expects to begin delivering programs by late summer or early fall, using an existing satellite and requiring subscribers to buy larger dishes.
 
*
 
In planning Sky Cable, Mr. Murdoch can draw on his experience of providing television by satellite in Britain. His Sky Television service lost money and failed to meet its growth forecasts in its first year. But it picked up hundreds of thousands of new subscribers since last fall, when it began renting satellite dishes for about $7.50 a month, instead of just selling them for $450 a month. A competing service, British Satellite Broadcasting, appears ready to begin operating this spring.
 
Lorenzo on the Line
 
Frank Lorenzo is betting his aviation empire on rebuilding Eastern Airlines. Eastern reached agreement with its unsecured creditors Thursday on a plan to pay them about 50 cents on the dollar, or about $490 million, and pull the carrier from bankruptcy. The deal required Mr. Lorenzo to pledge assets of Continental Airlines and the Texas Air Corporation, a commitment he had long refused. Continental, like Eastern, is a subsidiary of Texas Air, which Mr. Lorenzo heads. Airline analysts fear for the health of Texas Air, which lost $885.6 million last year. Texas Air said last week it had raised more than $250 million by selling a half interest in its computer reservation system to a General Motors Corporation subsidiary.
 
Deep-Discount Retailing
 
The deepest discounts at Macy's these days might be on its ''junk bonds.'' Some analysts doubt the chain can survive if competitors like Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus keep cutting prices.
 
In Brief
 
The Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation agreed on Tuesday to accept the Georgia Pacific Corporation's $3.8 billion takeover offer. The deal creates the nation's largest forest-products company.

Federal regulators took control of the Imperial Savings Association, one of California's largest savings institutions, on Friday. Imperial, with $9.7 billion in assets, is the industry's second-largest ''junk bind'' investor.
 
Bad News on Oil Prices
 
Petroleum analysts say oil prices could rise 50 percent to $30 a barrel within five years, twice the increase they had expectd. They say that declining output in the Soviet Union and United States, growing demand in East Asia and production limits in the Persian Gulf could lead to much higher costs. In the United States, large oil price increases would increase the trade deficit and slow economic growth.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Mexico's Dismal Debt Deal

BYLINE: By JORGE C. CASTANEDA; Jorge C. Castaneda is a professor of international relations at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and co-author of ''Limits to Friendship: The United States and Mexico.''

 BODY:
The jury is now in on the 1989 debt restructuring agreement between Mexico and the international financial community. Unfortunately, the deal is a bad one for Mexico. The agreement, signed on Feb. 4, falls far short of the country's needs, has not and will not produce the desired effects, and leaves the nation in a woefully weak position for future negotiations.
Actual debt reduction will be virtually nil. Because 41 percent of Mexico's outstanding $48.5 billion in commercial bank debt was exchanged for new paper with a 35 percent discount, only $7 billion will be lopped off the country's total liabilities of about $95 billion. But to finance the $7 billion collateral fund that guarantees interest and principal payments on the discounted debt, Mexico was forced to take on $5.7 billion in new loans from Japan, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 
The deal also provides Mexico with $1.5 billion in new loans over four years. Net debt reduction in 1990 is less than half a billion dollars. The deal is also inadequate in terms of yearly cash flow. Considering the current rate Mexico pays on its debt, the annual savings resulting from principal and interest reductions amount to $1.3 billion. New lending of $350 million per year must also be added. But then one must subtract interest payments for the collateral fund that is dedicated to purchase the United States Treasury zero-coupon bonds. The purchase of these bonds is a condition of the deal and serves to guarantee Mexico's principal payments. Final yearly net flow: less than $1.5 billion, or 10 percent of Mexico's 1989 gross debt service.
Despite efforts by Mexican authorities to disguise or doctor the economy's numbers (for example, the most recent trade figures available date back to last September), the Administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has acknowledged that the deal's chief virtues lie in its hoped-for indirect effects: reduced interest rates in Mexico; capital reflows from abroad, and increased foreign investment. Unfortunately, these numbers are not much more encouraging. Much has been made of the fact that Mexican interest rates fell last year by 20 points. But the decline was only of such a magnitude if one compares the highest rate, in June, with the lowest rate, in late August. In fact, from January 1989 to January 1990, the real decrease in the Mexican Cete rate - equivalent in importance to the 30-year United States Treasury bill rate - was marginal. It went from from 50.78 percent to 45.97 percent. Capital reflows to Mexico from abroad show a similar situation. Mexican Finance Minister Pedro Aspe has said that approximately $2.5 billion returned to Mexico in 1989. But the Bank of Mexico reported at the end of last July that $2 billion had come back during the first seven months of 1989. Thus, only $500 million returned during the five months following the debt deal. Mexican holders of dollar assets preferred to see what options foreign banks and investors finally chose.
But foreign investors have also reserved judgment. Aggregate figures for 1989 show foreign investment dropping slightly with relation to 1988, from $2.7 billion to $2.4 billion. The net hard currency inflow is estimated at $1.5 billion, far below the country's needs or the authorities' expectations. As for foreign banks, it seems inevitable that the overwhelming majority's decision to reduce its Mexican exposure instead of increasing it will have a spillover effect into the investment community. Why should potential new investors go to Mexico in droves when all but a handful of 450 banks are moving out?
But the debt agreement's main drawbacks are of a more strategic nature. If Mexico's foreign accounts force it back to the negotiating table soon, it will find itself in a much weaker position. Mexico has lost one of its most important bargaining chips: the threat of a suspension of payments, alone or with other debtors. The 18-month rolling interest-guarantee fund means that even if Mexico were to unilaterally cease payments as a negotiating weapon, the banks would not even begin to feel the pinch for a year and a half.
Moreover, to the extent that the debt deal exchanges commercial bank debt for official or multilateral lending, it also weakens Mexico. In addition to demanding greater conditionality, the World Bank does not renegotiate outstanding loans but simply increases lending to maintain positive flows. But events in Eastern Europe will inevitably reduce the availability of multilateral funding to developing countries.
Most importantly, Mexico will have missed a unique chance to lighten its debt burden. With time, it is obvious that Mexico and other Latin American debtors will face a more difficult situation. For political, ethnic and even sound business reasons linked to events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, they will face greater competition for money and sympathy than they found in 1989.
Thanks to the Mexican deal and rapidly diminishing geopolitical risks in Latin America due to the end of the cold war, the United States and other industrialized nations can increasingly put the debt crisis behind them. But for Mexico, the agreement may well be more than a mistake. It could become the symbol of an irretrievably lost opportunity.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Will Rising Assets Lower Fees?

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
The mutual fund business recently rang in a record-breaking $1 trillion in assets, and that was good news for the industry. But it should also be good news for investors. Higher assets should translate into lower fees as costs are spread over a broader base.
But expenses at many funds are rising, too. And as a result, the average expense ratio - the funds' expenses as a percentage of average net assets - has been rising steadily since 1985, from 1.13 percent to last year's 1.26 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., a Chicago-based mutual fund research firm. 
While that change might seem small, ''If you expect a number to go down, any increase is large,'' said Joe Mansueto, president of Morningstar, adding: ''You should be concerned about rising expense ratios because they can be a potentially significant drain on your investment.''
To be sure, performance and how a fund fits into your overall investment strategy should be the most important factors when you consider buying a fund. But don't neglect expense ratios, because over time, a small difference in investment costs can make a big dent in investment returns.
Assume a person invests $10,000 in a mutual fund that returns 10 percent a year. A single percentage point difference in expense ratios would trim that compounded return by $719 over five years, Morningstar said. (A $10,000 investment yielding 10 percent would be worth $16,105 after five years; one yielding only 9 percent - losing 1 point for expenses - would be worth $15,386.) And the longer the money is invested, the greater the impact of differences in expense ratios.
What makes the rising expense ratios troubling is the fact that they shouldn't be rising. ''There have always been moderate drops in expense ratios as assets rise,'' said John C. Bogle, chairman of the Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa.
Why not now? ''It's a question of what the market will bear,'' said Mr. Mansueto. A fund's expense ratio is available to all investors, but, he said, ''it's buried in the prospectus and overlooked by many investors.''
If the funds have more money than ever, where is it going? It seems to be building profits for mutual fund companies, going to their public shareholders or staying with the investment adviser, Mr. Mansueto said.
''That's why this industry has been so profitable,'' said Vanguard's Mr. Bogle. The biggest chunk of a fund's expenses is the fund's investment adviser, and most of that is pure profit, said Mr. Bogle.
There's another factor at work. More funds are lobbying their directors to permit 12b-1 plans, named for the Securities and Exchange Commission rule that lets funds skim off part of shareholders' money to pay for sales and marketing expenses. Fund executives argue that by beefing up promotion, they can bring in new customers - and cut costs for everyone.
The Morningstar numbers show that is not happening. And, Mr. Mansueto said, 12b-1 plans are driving up ratios further, by .05 percent to 1.25 percent.
Other factors are driving up ratios, too. New funds keep sprouting, and these are generally smaller funds, which tend to have larger expense ratios and thus pull up the average. And sometimes the economies of scale do not appear. Many funds' administrative costs rise in tandem with the number of customers because more accounts have to be serviced, more prospectuses printed and mailed and more telephone lines set up.
At the Keystone Group in Boston, the expense ratio on the Keystone Custodian Fund, Series B-2, jumped from 1.68 percent to 1.84 percent last year, while assets rose from about $916 million to almost $1 billion. The savings created by a bigger asset base were only ''modest,'' said George S. Bissell, Keystone's chairman, and went into extra customer services, such as new phone lines to help customers with I.R.A.s and taxes. ''That's O.K., if it's justified,'' said Kathryn B. McGrath, director of the division of investment management for the Securities and Exchange Commission. But, she added, she would like to compare the cost of the services to the extra money generated by the higher expenses.
At the Dreyfus Corporation, the expense ratio for the Growth Opportunity Fund rose from .91 to 1.04 during 1989 while assets rose from $567 million to $579 million. Dan Maclean, vice president and general counsel for Dreyfus, said the fund has an above-average advisory fee, which contributes to the expense ratio, and that's because ''you pay someone more because they do a better job.'' But lawsuits brought by fund shareholders in the last five years are prompting changes in fee structures. Shareholders insisted that funds rework their investment contracts to recognize economies of scale and the solution was to put in a series of breakpoints that lower fees as assets rise. Some funds now pay advisers a set percentage of assets for the first $10 million of assets, for example, and a smaller percentage for the next $50 million and so on.
 
POOLED MONEY
During the 1980's, mutual fund investors shied away from the stock market by shifting their money into high-yeild money-market and bond funds.
The runup in interest rates in the early 1980's brought spectacular yields of as much as 16 percent in the safe money-market funds. Government bond funds also did well, and the two hot sectors in the last several years - ''junk bond'' funds and Ginnie Mae'' funds, government bond funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities - pulled in even more investors.
Looking ahead, experts predict a complete flip-flop in how fund investors allocate their money. ''Stock market investments should pick up as interest rates decline over the decade,'' said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytic Services. And because more people will need bigger returns on their money to finance retirement, stocks - which have a higher return over time than bonds - are expected to be the investment of choice.

HEADLINE: Managing;
Revising Pay Packages, Again

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
During the 1980's, when inflation came under control and companies could get away with giving mediocre raises, they started tinkering with compensation packages. Instead of double-digit raises, they offered valuable employees stock grants, deferred bonuses and other potentially lucrative incentives if they attained higher profits, stock-price growth or other goals.
But now companies are finding that while those plans work just fine for keeping a stable company humming along, they are virtually useless when that company goes through massive divestitures, falls into debt or even introduces a new product.
Now, searching for pay policies that will help them cope with such critical situations, companies are tinkering with compensation plans again. Thomas L. Doorley, a senior partner at Braxton Associates, the strategic consulting division of Deloitte & Touche, says that 20 percent of his clients tailor compensation plans to different stages of development, up from 5 percent just a few years ago. Diane Posnak, managing director of Pearl Meyer & Partners Inc., a compensation consulting firm in New York, says the growth is even greater than that. ''Companies with special situation plans are becoming the rule rather than the exception,'' she said. 
Restructurings linked to takeover attempts are among the most common triggers for special pay plans. Until October 1986, for example, the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation based bonuses on return on equity, stock price gains and profits. Then, the company restructured to ward off a hostile takeover bid from the Wickes Companies.
''Suddenly we were highly leveraged,'' said Guy O. Mabry, executive vice president. ''We needed to persuade managers to stay with the company and return it to stability.''
Owens-Corning put in an all-stock bonus plan for 150 top people that would not pay out for seven years. The payout was not tied to specific goals. But managers knew that Wall Street would not recommend the stock unless they got debt down and profits up.
The scheme paid off: the management team stayed, Owens-Corning is ahead of schedule on paying its debt, and its stock, which was at $12 when the plan was instituted, is trading in the $20's.
Different plans are needed to retain managers during divestitures. In 1987 the Penn Central Corporation spun off Sprague Technologies, its Stamford, Conn., electronic components subsidiary. To persuade a handful of executives to go with Sprague, Penn Central offered a ''retention transition bonus.'' If they stayed with Sprague for a year, their Penn Central stock options, which normally expire 90 days after an employee's departure, would stay in effect, and they would receive an extra year's salary and bonus. The executives went with Sprague, and are still with the company.
Now things have changed at Sprague again. It is liquidating one of its divisions, and it has put in a one-shot bonus plan for the division's three key people, payable after the liquidation is over - and their jobs have been eliminated.
Although most special-situation incentive plans kick in when a company is shrinking, a few are aimed at encouraging growth spurts. In 1987 the Williams Companies, a gas pipeline company in Tulsa, Okla., set up a fiber-optics subsidiary, Williams Telecommunications, and charged it with grabbing market share - fast. Most managers in Williams's operating companies get bonuses based on cash flow and operating profit; the new subsidiary's managers bonuses are based on how well they use earnings to grow the new product line.
''We wanted them to reinvest money to grow, not just try to get profits out,'' said John Fischer, vice president of human resources.
Top managers are generally the beneficiaries of special-situation compensation plans. But some companies - particularly those making pharmaceuticals and consumer products - are starting to extend bonus plans to researchers, package designers and other mid-level people involved in product development. The plans, which usually involve cash bonuses, pay in stages - when a product is developed, when it is introduced, and when it grabs market share. After that, the profits the product generates all count toward the general bonus pool.
''These plans don't get much visibility because they are not reported in proxies,'' said Louis J. Brindisi Jr., a senior partner at Strategic Compensation Associates, a New York consulting firm. ''But they are a lot more common that most people realize.''

HEADLINE: NAGGING FEARS;
German Questions No One Wants to Ask

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
EVER since the possibility of German reunification arose, the Bush Administration has chosen to talk about it in the most delicate and positive terms, almost as if Germany's division had been an act of nature and not war. This has been intentional, an effort not to antagonize the Germans and lose their cooperation at a moment when it is most needed to insure that Europe makes a peaceful transition to a post-Cold War order.
But in recent days some American officials have conceded privately that something has been missing from Washington's public declarations. Thus far that something has only been whispered in the halls of the State Department and Pentagon.
It goes like this, an American official said: '' 'Well, you see, there was this thing called World War II, and the Germans started it. That's why their country got split in two.' Now how do we reassure everyone that a reunited Germany isn't going to do it all over again?'' 
With German unification now an immediate prospect, and an international framework for discussing it agreed upon Feb. 13 in Ottawa, the Bush Administration's ability to finesse this fundamental question is rapidly diminishing. And officials know it: They are hearing too many Polish, British and French concerns that a reunited Germany will, sooner or later, dominate the continent, as it has in the past.
Last week it fell to Mikhail S. Gorbachev to express the concerns publicly. ''No one has a right to ignore the negative potential formed in Germany's past,'' he said, adding that the Soviet Union ''has an inalienable right to expect, and the possibility to exert efforts to insure, that our country should not sustain either moral or political or economic damage from German unification.''
For now, senior Administration officials say they are inclined not to force the issue, and to devote their energies to getting the Germans themselves to reassure their European and American allies by being more explicit in their pronouncements. This is a primary reason why President Bush is meeting this weekend at Camp David with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Some Americans inside and outside the Government believe that what is needed now is a diplomacy more public than private. Michael Mandelbaum, an expert on East-West relations at the Council on Foreign Relations, says the United States is not doing Germany or its neighbors any favor by pretending in public that it is not concerned about the potential for a reunified Germany to destabilize Europe - or for a nervous Europe to destabilize a reunified Germany.
''There is no use pretending that Germany is just another country,'' Mr. Mandelbaum said. ''It is not that we have to be afraid that the Germans are going to come roaring back and invade the East. But there is a certain historical legacy here, and unless we are clearly on record regarding certain principles - principles such as what a united Germany's borders might be, the fact that it must not be able to build nuclear weapons, the notion that its army must remain of limited size and deployment - we are going to increasingly see a situation in which many Europeans will be afraid of the Germans and the Germans themselves will begin to grow afraid for their own security.''
Bush Administration officials say that they have hardly been deaf to these issues and that they have been the motivating force behind the Americans' private diplomacy. The so-called two-plus-four framework that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d helped arrange in Ottawa with the wartime Allies and the two Germanys was precisely intended to address the concerns. Under the arrangement, once the two German Governments agree on a path to unification, the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union will sit down with them and negotiate border and security issues.
The problem, said a European diplomat, is this: ''Two-plus-four is just a framework. What about the content?'' Here, the Bush Administration finds itself running up against some of its own best instincts. Since the fall of the Berlin wall last November, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker have deliberately adopted the position that a low profile is the best profile - no dancing on the wall, no poking a stick in Mr. Gorbachev's eye, just quietly allowing the Soviets to keep backpedaling out of Europe and reaping the rewards later.
But the German question is another matter, one in which a more high-profile American approach may be called for. Historically, the United States has been trusted by all the parties, in large part because it is seen as the disinterested outsider.
 
A Plea From Poland
Without more explicit language from Washington, it seems that European and Soviet officials will continue to express concern that their interests are being ignored. That is what Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland did last week when he said the two Germanys should agree to a preunification peace treaty guaranteeing the Polish-German border. So great is the Polish worry that a united Germany might someday try to reclaim German territories ceded to Poland after the war that Mr. Mazowiecki said Soviet troops should remain in Poland as insurance until these ''ambiguities'' are cleared up.
Robert Gerald Livingston, an expert on Germany at Johns Hopkins University, makes the point that the United States has to remember that it ''is not just allied with Germany.''
''We don't have to say that we don't trust the Germans, but we can say that we understand why others don't,'' he said. ''I don't see any problem with our saying it out loud, since many Germans have themselves.''
Indeed, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has repeatedly affirmed his country's intention to remain in NATO and to respect its postwar boundaries, though Mr. Kohl has been less explicit on the border question. Bush Administration officials say that they are losing patience with Mr. Kohl's lack of clarity on the issue and are also concerned about his ability to resist Soviet demands and domestic political pressures that a united Germany be neutral.
Mr. Bush, said one official, expects some straight talk from Mr. Kohl.
In the view of Stephen Szabo, an expert on Germany at the National War College, ''It is really a job for the Germans, more than anyone else, to persuade those elements in our country and in Europe that past German patterns of behavior won't reassert themselves.''
The West Germans, Mr. Szabo said, have ''a very good record to build on'' - 40 years of a multiparty democracy, a record of unwavering loyalty to NATO and integration into the European Community.
Nevertheless, he said, the German leadership, West and East, has to make clear that a reunified Germany will continue along the same path, and also accept limitations on its military might.
Why? For all the talk about a two-plus-four framework of negotiation and new pan-European organizations to replace NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and for all the talk that in the post-industrial age, economic interdependence makes a war in Europe virtually unthinkable, these are little more than constructs in the minds of diplomats. At the end of the day, what will reassure Germany's neighbors is what always reassures neighbors: a stable balance of power. In this case, what is needed is a stable balance of power undergirded by a military structure that insures that Germany's potential to dominate will be held in check and at the same time will not make the Germans themselves feel vulnerable.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Western Europe Is Edgy Over the U. S. and Much Else

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
AFTER 40 years in an alliance held together by the Soviet military threat, the United States and Western Europe have suddenly realized that things may never again be the same between them. When Cold War issues dominated, Western Europe never questioned Washington's leadership. Today, trans-Atlantic ties are being pulled in all directions.
The result has been a strange mood of irritability among the allies. There is frustration that their relations are being determined more by unexpected developments in Moscow, Warsaw, Berlin and Bonn than by cool-headed decisions in Washington, Paris and London. But they have also recognized that they no longer have the same interests in common. 
Perhaps most fundamentally, several Western European Governments are alarmed that Washington, consumed by its victory over Communism and its new friendship with Moscow, has underestimated the anxiety being stirred here by the prospect of a rich and powerful single German state dominating the heart of Europe.
Poor communications between the two sides have caused misunderstandings, aggravated by the perception that Washington now views Bonn as its main European interlocutor. New competition over business opportunities opening up in Eastern Europe has also not helped, with the United States saying that some allies are ignoring security considerations in their rush for profits.
But if the central challenge for the alliance is to define the future role of the United States in Europe, it is here that the enormous complexity of dealing with Western Europe has become apparent.
Western Europe seems agreed in wanting the United States to remain a European power, with American troops stationed indefinitely on the continent. But on almost every other issue, Washington hears a chorus of different opinions.
There is no agreement, for example, over whether the new map of Europe should be drawn by the new two-plus-four forum comprising the two Germanys and the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France; by the 12-nation Economic Community; the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
At the same time, West Germany, Britain, France and Italy are defending their particular interests, with London at loggerheads with Bonn over the pace of German reunification and with Paris over the pace of European integration. Smaller nations feel that they are being kept out of the debate and, while the European Community has tried to take a lead, a half-dozen other Western European countries are not members.
Western Europe's feelings toward Washington are no less ambivalent. It wants the United States to provide a security shield against both the Soviet Union and a united Germany as well as to contribute generously to the reconstruction of Eastern Europe. Yet Western Europe is also eager to take charge of its destiny and reduce Washington's political role.
Before the Malta summit conference between President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev in December, Western Europe was annoyed by the idea that its affairs could be decided by the United States and Soviet Union. President Bush flew home through Brussels to reassure his NATO allies that Europe was not being carved up behind their backs. Nonetheless, President Francois Mitterrand of France does not believe that a United States-dominated NATO should manage change in Europe. He argues that the best way to anchor Germany to the West and to aid Eastern Europe is for the European Community to accelerate its own economic integration.
 
A List of Complaints
In contrast, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain long emphasized her ties with the United States over those with Europe. Since President Reagan left the White House, she has lost her special relationship; she makes little secret of her disapproval of the Bush Administration's wooing of Bonn.
The two-plus-four talks on German reunification will at least give France and Britain a privileged voice, although both grumbled that the Bush Administration took full credit for an idea that they claim to have originated. Italy, on the other hand, is upset that it has been left out. Complaints about inadequate consultation, then, are rife. Out of the spotlight, economic disagreements are brewing. Ten days ago at a meeting in Paris of a committee set up to limit the export of advanced technology to Communist countries, the United States blocked efforts to have most controls lifted, a move that would have benefited West German, French and Italian companies.
Yet the absence of a Western European consensus has enabled the United States to continue playing the role of final arbiter. This weekend the West German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, met with Mr. Bush. In coming days, the leaders of Ireland, Norway, Austria and Italy will follow. ''Quite suddenly,'' The Economist, the London weekly, noted Friday, ''the new European politics has spilled across the Atlantic.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Asia's Needs and America's Grow Harder to Synchronize

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
IN the four and a half decades since World War II ended, aboard the battleship Missouri, an overwhelming American military presence in the Pacific has been an accepted fact of the postwar order. The United States, after all, was the country that rebuilt and protected a demilitarized Japan, contained Communism at the 38th parallel and offset Soviet power.
Now, as the Warsaw Pact unwinds and Congressional enthusiasm for Pentagon budget cuts begins to spill over into Asia, the reasons for the presence no longer seem so obvious. The paradox is that with the connections between the United States and northeast Asia more complex than ever, especially in trade and technology, the American stake in maintaining its influence and assuring stability may never have been greater. And more than once in recent times, American power has been called upon to bolster democracy in places where it is still precarious, most notably in the Philippines. 
That set of interests - a mix of trade politics and military strategy - kept Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on a precipice during a two-week tour of Asia that ended yesterday. Everywhere he went, the affable Mr. Cheney left troop cuts in his wake. In the next three years the United States will be cutting back about 10 percent, maybe more, of the 120,000 troops scattered from Manila to Seoul. But Mr. Cheney also found himself arguing that Asia is hardly Europe, and that it is vital for the United States to remain the dominant military power in the area.
''If containing Soviet expansion was all we cared about, we might be tempted to withdraw,'' he said. ''But that is not what we intend to do.'' If the United States folded its tents, ''a vacuum would quickly develop,'' he said. ''There almost surely would be a series of destabilizing regional arms races, an increase in regional tensions and possibly conflict.''
 
Reasons to Stay
Moreover, he said, with aging leaders and unpredictable Governments in North Korea, China and Burma, and the specter of new upheavals in Cambodia, ''it should be clear that the United States could not ever think of a withdrawal from Asia.''
Perhaps not, but from both Washington and Tokyo it is clear that the United States role in Asia is about to change, and, as in Europe, it may happen faster than the Bush Administration is prepared to handle.
Mr. Cheney's easiest stop was probably South Korea. With the Government of Kim Il Sung, the North's leader, as firmly in control as ever, no one needed reminders that the 43,000 American troops in South Korea are a deterrent to any expansionist moves. Nonetheless, American and Korean experts admit that in the Reagan years, as South Korea's own forces grew more powerful, America's grew fatter and inefficient; Mr. Cheney talked about bringing American troop levels down by 5,000 to 6,000, to where they were before the Reagan Administration's buildup. He also pressed South Korea to double its $300 million contribution to the cost of keeping American troops there.
Far more complex for Mr. Cheney was the Philippines. Before he arrived Congress had cut back military and other aid to Manila by $96 million, from $360 million, arousing such outrage that President Corazon C. Aquino refused to meet with him.
The subtext of the visit was the future of Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station, where leases expire in September 1991. More than half of the Philippine Senate opposes renewal, while the others want to raise the cost phenomenally. Mrs. Aquino is caught in between. She cannot appear to give in to the United States, but she knows that American intervention saved her from being toppled in a coup attempt last December. At the same time, Washington is showing interest in alternative sites if the United States is thrown out. ''They are not here to stay forever,'' Mrs. Aquino told Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese newspaper.
In Japan, forever is the time frame both sides have in mind. At a time when Japan's annual defense spending equals that of Britain or West Germany, the United States presence here, which will drop about 10 percent from the current 50,000 troops, reassures Asian countries, which remember the horror of a militarized Japan. It also reassures the Japanese, who were happy to hear Mr. Cheney tell them not to take seriously a recent Congressional resolution urging Japan to triple its defense spending.
But the relationship is quickly taking a different tone. Until a year or two ago, Americans here said that the military alliance came first, and that trade and technological competition was a sideshow. Now, as Mr. Cheney himself said, commerce is becoming the main event. ''As Secretary of Defense, I seldom speak about economic affairs,'' he said, ''but the growing friction between our countries on trade issues contributed to the trade imbalances and may, if unchecked, spill over into other areas.''
Since Congress tried to block the transfer of aircraft technology for Japan's FSX fighter last year, out of fear of helping Japan's aerospace industry, the Japanese have realized that they will not be treated like Britain or Germany. Increasingly, there is pressure here for Japan to go its own way and develop its own weapons. And more than ever, as Mr. Cheney noted, the American military needs a flow of Japanese technology even beyond the memory chips and other electronic components that the United States no longer manufacturers itself.
Over time, Americans in the Pacific think, the military alignment in Asia will be somewhat as it was before the Korean War: a big American presence in Japan, a small one elsewhere. But that vision depends on managing a relationship with Japan that, with a $49 billion trade deficit and rising tempers on both sides, may be slipping from control.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Cambodia Will Talk Again, But Listeners Are Scarce

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia

 BODY:
THE last time the warring factions in Cambodia sat down together at an international peace conference, in Paris last August, they seemed incapable even of holding a civil conversation. The world's diplomats concluded that the conference had been premature and that flexibility toward a solution, let alone its shape, would have to come after the warring sides had done some more fighting in the absence of Vietnamese troops. This process was rather callously but nearly universally termed ''the test on the battlefield.''
Now, after the killing and wounding of yet more Cambodians, new talks are beginning on Monday in Indonesia. Some answers are available about the balance of forces in a conflict that most of the world regards with fatigue and exasperation. Almost inevitably, though, the answers are incomplete. 
The Jakarta talks are part of the process begun in Paris, and are an effort to see whether a full-scale conference can be resumed. The main issues are how the United Nations might run or supervise an interim administration to oversee new elections and what parts will be played by the four warring factions; the Phnom Penh Government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, the Khmer Rouge, the followers of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front. Last August, what so frustrated everyone was the obstinacy of the Cambodians themselves, who were clearly not ready to deal. The implications of the Vietnamese troop withdrawal, completed in September, could not be divined in advance.
Could Mr. Hun Sen and his Government, installed by the Vietnamese after they expelled the murderous Khmer Rouge in 1979, survive on their own?
Just how strong were the Khmer Rouge, who during their period in power in the 1970's were responsible for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians? They had been revived as an anti-Vietnamese instrument by China, with the acquiescence of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the United States itself.
Washington, in fact, preferred the two non-Communist factions allied to the Khmer Rouge, but led by an irritatingly changeable Prince Sihanouk and by a weak and aged conservative, Son Sann. But could these factions finally demonstrate any battlefield prowess or credibility to repay Washington's diplomatic support and $24 million a year in secret aid?
Now, six months later, the worst has not happened. Mr. Hun Sen's Government and army have not disintegrated, allowing the Khmer Rouge to return to power.
The initial performance of Mr. Hun Sen's army was ragged, with ill-trained troops and officers fleeing positions along the Thai border and allowing the combined resistance to take about 10 percent of the country. The offensive then bogged down, but it now appears that was not all Mr. Hun Sen's doing.
 
Help From Hanoi
It turns out that after his troops abandoned the gem-mining town of Pailin on Oct. 24, a shaken Mr. Hun Sen asked Hanoi to send some troops back to Cambodia. Senior East European diplomats here say the Vietnamese were not happy, but agreed to send several thousand elite special forces to help defend two Cambodian provincial capitals, Battambang and Sisophon.
The Vietnamese strengthened the defenses of the two capitals, and while they are said to have done relatively little fighting, ''the important thing,'' a diplomat said, ''is that the Khmer Rouge knew that between them and Battambang, there were Vietnamese.'' A result is that Mr. Hun Sen can still claim to have lost no big population center. The Vietnamese also sent military advisers to Phnom Penh as trainers, strategic planners and repairmen. While two senior East European diplomats say Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia, another believes they may have returned home this month because Vietnam wanted to be ''clean'' for the Jakarta talks.
In any event, the Vietnamese provided Mr. Hun Sen some breathing room. The Cambodian Army has been reorganized and is battle-tested; last week, it began a counteroffensive in the northwest that had been long delayed and retook a key crossroads town, Svay Chek.
But the Khmer Rouge have hardly been idle. Having apparently suspended any frontal assault on Battambang, the Khmer Rouge have dispersed their gathered troops, re-infiltrating fighters deep inside the country, where they have been active for many years. Their guerrilla strategy of economic and moral destabilization continues at a higher level than before.
Yet however costly and debilitating to Phnom Penh, the fighting has not proved sufficient to bring down the Government, and as a result Mr. Hun Sen's status has been reinforced. Still, there are some ways in which the exhaustion engendered by six months of struggle may be bringing a solution nearer.
It has made Mr. Hun Sen considerably more flexible, given at least a small amount of credibility back to the non-Communist factions, and made even indirect support for the Khmer Rouge more obnoxious to Western public opinion, and hence to their governments. France and Britain have issued strong statements opposing the Khmer Rouge and the United States has dropped its support for a role for the Khmer Rouge in a coalition government. China's support for that proposal also seems to be weakening.
This shift in international opinion, in turn, has driven Prince Sihanouk to break, yet again, with the Khmer Rouge, even if his troops sometimes fight in coordination with them.
Last week, meeting in Bangkok, Mr. Hun Sen and the Prince signed their first joint statement; they agreed to press for an enhanced role for the United Nations in a transitional administration in Cambodia, elections supervised by the United Nations and the reposing of Cambodian sovereignty in a supreme council, which would by agreement contain representatives of the warring factions, until the elections can be held.
The Khmer Rouge, however, remain China's chosen instrument and continue to reject every idea that might lead to a settlement, apparently preferring to continue the guerrilla war.
But every other faction is being flexible, China is unlikely to enjoy its isolation, and the rest of the world is running out of patience.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Beyond Artificial Intelligence, the Search for Artificial Life

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M.

 BODY:
COMPUTER viruses devised by high-technology vandals have crippled computer networks, damaged data and occasionally left personal computer users in a state of near hysteria. But some scientists are considering the possibility that these self-replicating programs might have constructive uses as well.
In the view of these researchers, the virus programs are the most visible example of a strange new field called artificial life. To better understand the mechanisms of biological life, computer scientists, biologists, mathematicians and chemists are using computers to simulate living organisms and to fabricate computerized environments in which these creatures can fight for survival in an electronic version of the Darwinian struggle. 
At the Second Artificial Life Conference, held here earlier this month, several scientists insisted that the term virus is more than a nice metaphor.
In a recent paper, J. Doyne Farmer, an artificial-life researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, wrote, ''Although computer viruses are not fully alive, they embody many of the characteristics of life, and it is not hard to imagine computer viruses of the future that will be just as alive as biological viruses.''
By studying these and other artificial creatures, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of many of the deepest mysteries of biology, like how a single cell can divide and develop into a complex organism. But they also warn that breakthroughs in the field could be used illicitly to create more virulent computer viruses, perhaps with their own immune systems and other techniques of eluding capture.
Viruses are secret programs, written by technologically adept mischief makers and unleashed to spread through computer networks by attaching themselves to other programs. Once they have infected a new machine they can lie dormant for weeks, suddenly springing forth to surprise the user by doing something as benign as displaying a funny message or as vindictive as destroying valuable data.
But these viruses are primitive compared with what the future might bring. As they speculate about a time when the line between the real and the artificial has grown vanishingly thin, some scientists envision horrors reminiscent of the worst nightmares about genetic engineering.
 
Digital Demons
Perhaps, they say, scientists using supercomputers to develop complex new artificial life forms could accidentally release an inextinguishable data-eating monster into a network, causing the country's scaffolding of data highways to collapse.
Russell Brand, a computer scientist at Reasoning Inc., a software company in Palo Alto, Calif., said that it was important to consider the consequences of artificial-life research early. ''Once things get out they are very hard to control,'' he said. ''This is the only before we get.''
Mr. Brand, who has worked as a computer security expert for the Government, said several agencies are fighting over which one should manage a center for disease control for computer viruses. In two to three years, he said, it is possible that computer users whose machines are infected will have to report the incident to a Government agency.
But the future of artificial life does not have to be drawn from the pages of ''Frankenstein'' or ''The Andromeda Strain.'' Conceivably, researchers say, the same kind of programming concepts that led to software invaders like the one Robert Tappan Morris set loose in a national computer network in 1988 could be used to make programs that learn and develop on their own.
So far, artificial organisms exist only as relatively simple programs that are in little danger of being confused with the real thing. But a number of scientists have begun to experiment with lifelike programs they call genetic algorithms.
For example, researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles have designed simulated ''ants'' - small programs that are selected according to their ability to follow trails on a computerized grid. Those that are most adept at this task survive and reproduce, passing on the skill to succeeding generations in the form of digitally inherited DNA strands - a simple 32-bit binary number that acts like a gene. Rapidly evolving through thousands of generations on a supercomputer, the ants' navigation skills steadily improve.
Other scientists believe that the best defenses against computer viruses may also come from biological ideas. Some researchers have suggested that personal computers are particularly vulnerable to viruses because software standards are becoming so homogeneous. Making software that can run on any number of computers has obvious economic advantages, they say, but only at a price. More diverse software, they argue, would make it more difficult for computer viruses to spread widely, just as the diversity of biological life keeps a single invader from wiping out entire populations.
Computer software might ultimately be more secure if it was developed using a high-speed version of natural evolution, said Danny Hillis, a computer scientist and co-founder of Thinking Machines Inc., a supercomputer maker in Cambridge, Mass. Competing programs could be exposed to swarms of viruses in the laboratory; only the fittest would survive.
As computer scientists continue to close the gap between simulation and reality, artificial-life researchers are likely to share ethical problems with more advanced sciences like molecular engineering.
''We should have a big concern over how we experiment with artificial life,'' said Eugene Spafford, a Purdue University scientist involved in the study of computer viruses. He said that the trial of Mr. Morris, who was convicted last month of a felony violation of the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, had raised ethical questions that will become more pressing in the future, both for computer scientists and biologists.
Mr. Spafford posed the question of whether it would be ethical to release a virus (the real kind) that would provide immunity against a disease like leukemia but without public knowledge and consent. In a way, this is already done with the Sabin vaccine, a weakened polio virus that can confer ''contact immunity'' on unimmunized people who catch the generally harmless infection from someone else.
''When you conduct experiments with live subjects you must have control over the spread of your 'program' and have informed consent,'' Mr. Spafford said. And so it should be with computers, he says. ''There is too much experimentation being done just to throw things together and see what happens,'' he warns. ''That's not good science.''

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Exit Interview: Gunn Stands Clear Of the Closing Door

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY

 BODY:
SIX years ago, David L. Gunn took charge of New York City's crumbling public transportation system, embarking on what he called a ''suicide mission'' to turn it around. On Wednesday, Mr. Gunn will step down as president of the Transit Authority, turning the job over to Alan F. Kiepper, a former general manager of Houston's transit system. In an interview last week with Suzanne Daley, a reporter on the metropolitan staff of The New York Times, Mr. Gunn talked of what has - and has not - been accomplished. Here are excerpts from the interview.
 
Question. What do you consider your successes and your failures? 
Answer. We've put the subway system back on its feet. It still has a lot of problems. The stations are not finished. The track work is still interfering with service, although if you look at our on-time performance, it's not that bad.
But in terms of what I'm sort of proudest of, I look at the organization stuff. We have production runs now for rebuilding cars that are, in terms certainly of man-hours and probably of total cost, competitive with the private sector. And that's not bad when you're dealing with a place that used to be held up as an example of where people were goldbricking all the time.
Q. How about disappointments?
A. I guess if I had to talk about disappointments I think it would be the failure to resolve the merger issue of the cops and to really build up a head of steam with the Transit Authority police. I was against a merger of the New York City Police Department and the Transit Authority police. We hire our cops now off the same list. People take a test. They think they're going to be N.Y.P.D. cops. These people don't know that they're going to be put in the subways. They feel they've been tricked. So you build in a sense of real frustration. It just is very bad human relations.
Q. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority set a goal of a 15 percent increase in subway ridership by 1991. But ridership is now up only 7 percent on the subways and down slightly on the buses. What happened?
A. My own sense is that some factors we're facing are a little bit beyond our control. I mean, the economy of the city, we can't control that. I also think we're being severely impacted by the homeless problem and the quality-of-life issues. A lot of your bus ridership is other than Manhattan-oriented and that's where you get hurt the most, by people who start shopping in suburban malls and going away from the city instead of into the city. Instead of coming to downtown Brooklyn to shop, they'll get in the car and go out to Nassau County.
Q. Last fall you launched a campaign to enforce a code of behavior and to purge the subways of unruly homeless people. Was it successful?
A. We probably should have focused on individual areas and stations, and then when we got those under control, move on to another station. But that won't solve the problem of that poor fellow that is the drug addict and a panhandler in the subway. What it will do is move that person to another location -hopefully out of the subway, living somewhere else.
 
'A Big Machine'
Q. Do you think that's the biggest problem your successor faces?
A. No, I think the biggest problem in this place will be to insure along with the M.T.A. that there is a third capital program. Even if times are tough and you want to save money, you don't eliminate all capital funding for the Transit Authority. This place requires a steady infusion of replacement capital. It's a big machine and things wear out.
Q. There have been various promises over the last decade that an automated fare collection system would be in place in just a few years. The projection now is for 1998. What has taken so long?
A. The desire to install it got ahead of the physical reality of putting it in. There was an awful lot of action that was not based on either an understanding of the physical reality or of the economic reality. Now, the average age of our turnstiles is 30 years old. Does it make sense to you to say that you are going retrofit those turnstiles with space-age readers? It flies in the face of logic. You have to put in your power, your communication lines and you have to rebuild your fare-control area. The detail workaday planning had to be done.
Q. Critics say that you concentrated on the mechanical aspects of the system at the expense of the consumer side, such as drawing more riders and dealing with local communities. Do you think that is fair?
A. Let's go back to 1984, when I came in. What were the demands in 1984? The demands were, ''Give us a car with lights, a map, a sign and a door that works. That's all we want.'' I gave it to them. And it's clean to boot; they didn't ask for that. They didn't ask for a car that works. The car works. They didn't ask for it to stay on the rails. It stays on the rails. It is patently ridiculous to say that you should have worried about anything other than the physical reality of the system in the last few years.
Q. Why are you leaving now?
A. You go through a cycle in a job like mine, assuming that you are able to be somewhat successful at it and not get dismissed or thrown off the ship. You have 20 million things you want to do. And assuming you're successful you have an impact and that impact grows with time. But there is a point when that impact begins to plateau. Your ability to be fresh and to approach the thing with a fresh perspective diminishes.
I'll give you a classic example: I'm taking Alan Kiepper around and I'm showing him some stuff in a station. We had stripped all the old signage out, we had completely painted the station, put the tile back on the wall, removed an abandoned newsstand. I'm saying to myself, ''Good job.'' He says, ''This station is pretty depressing, isn't it?''
I knew what it had been. But he was right because it still had a long way to go.

HEADLINE: The Nicaragua Obsession

 BODY:
Today's election in Nicaragua may finally break the fever. For 10 years, successive Republican Administrations in Washington have relentlessly distorted diplomacy and even traduced the law, all in fear of a small and impoverished neighbor in Central America. This has been so consuming a preoccupation of the U.S. Government that, in retrospect, it seems right to call the 1980's the Nicaragua Decade.
Now, if today's vote is judged fair by outside monitors, President Bush will have no reasonable alternative to accepting the outcome, no matter who wins. And that could, finally, end the obsession. 
To look back is to recognize how badly America has bent itself out of shape over Nicaragua. The story started in 1979 when Nicaraguans rose in revolt against the tyrannical and corrupt Somoza dynasty. Most Americans welcomed the change, as did the Carter Administration, which helped bring it about. A new junta took over, a coalition dominated by the Sandinistas.
They were Marxists but insisted they favored pluralism, free elections, nonalignment and a mixed economy. Their claims proved misleading. Elections were postponed. A democratic opposition was harassed, its leaders forced into exile. Nicaragua turned to the Soviet bloc for arms and advisers and the Sandinistas openly applauded and covertly aided leftist rebels in El Salvador.
To the incoming Reagan Administration, Nicaragua was not just a regional headache; it offered a new target of opportunity for a then-aggressive Soviet Union. In his first months, President Reagan approved the covert training of anti-Sandinista rebels. Leaders were recruited from the old Somoza National Guard, and Argentina's military dictatorship lent some officers to help out.
In practice, Mr. Reagan had committed his Administration to a single-track strategy aimed at ousting the Sandinistas. But the President was never willing to concede as much, often to the confusion of his own team. The result was the forced resignation, one after another, of four senior officials who tried seriously to open a diplomatic track to Nicaragua. Thus from the outset, both Governments talked one way but acted another, feeding mistrust.
As the contra army grew, so did Congressional concern over waging an illegal war from hit-and-run camps in Honduras. And Mr. Reagan was never able to persuade a majority of Americans that the contras could form a viable government, nor that the Sandinistas threatened vital U.S. interests.
His case was further weakened by C.I.A. blunders. The agency zealously mined Nicaragua's harbors without adequately warning an outraged Senate Intelligence Committee. State Department lawyers were soon searching for loopholes in maritime law as Nicaragua sought justice at the World Court. A C.I.A. manual was discovered - and hastily disavowed - that offered tips on assassinating Sandinistas. All this contributed to a fateful vote by Congress in 1984 ordering an end to all covert aid to the contras.
Mr. Reagan then put his Presidency at risk by circumventing Congress. His aides solicited contributions for the contras from foreign governments eager for U.S. favor. Recklessly, the President permitted the secret sale of arms to Iran, with profits diverted to the contras. The ensuing Iran-contra scandal also uncovered the Administration's clumsy bullying of President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica for daring to close an illegal contra airstrip in his country.
The monumental scandal forced the flustered Administration to shift its stance on Nicaragua. It now insisted that it truly favored a two-track strategy: diplomacy combined with aid to the contras. President Arias shrewdly took advantage of the opening in 1987 to propose a regional peace plan. When this was approved by the region's presidents, including Daniel Ortega, the tongue-tied White House went along. But even then it ignored the provisions for disbanding the contras.
The Nicaragua compromise was achieved by Central Americans - a fitting outcome. The contra war is over, the global Soviet threat has ebbed and Sandinistas have lost much of their arrogance. If today's election is fair, and its results honored, Mr. Bush should relax and let Washington finally end its Nicaragua fixation. A decade of obsession is enough.

HEADLINE: The Editorial Notebook;
Young Lions, and Old

BYLINE: By DIANE CAMPER

 BODY:
When Nelson Mandela emerged from a South African prison, clenched fist raised in triumph, he saluted friends, comrades and fellow South Africans. He also paid tribute to ''the endless heroes of youth . . . You, the young lions have energized our entire struggle.'' Mr. Mandela has become the living symbol of the struggle for black liberation. At 71, he is like the village elder, full of wisdom, from whom the young lions can learn by example. 
Even as that example reverberates around the world, black Americans recall another example, that of Malcolm X, who was assassinated 25 years ago this month. Though often identified with violent protest, Malcolm offers the young lions the same lessons.
Here is how Nelson Mandela describes the ''treason'' for which he was imprisoned, while Malcolm was still alive, for 27 years: He fought for ''the idea of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.''
During all those 27 years in prison, he never allowed his jailers to triumph. Others had to speak for him, and he could not stop the ravages of advancing age. But he continued to study whenever possible. A practicing lawyer when convicted, he earned an advanced law degree in prison.
Since his release, he has assumed the role of master teacher, urging his followers not to do anything that will make other people ''say that we can't control our own people.'' He is now a potent symbol of the freedom and dignity he seeks for his people. So, too, is Malcolm X, another former prisoner. For young blacks in particular, he is re-emerging as a symbol of black liberation in America.
But it's not enough for these young lions simply to wear T-shirts and buttons, put up Malcolm posters or recite passages from his speeches that suggest violent resistance, if necessary, to white devils and the destructive forces of racism. A. Peter Bailey, a disciple of Malcolm X, reminds us that the message of this master teacher was more textured. ''The main revolution we need as a people, he told us many times, is a revolution of the mind,'' Mr. Bailey writes in the February issue of Emerge, a new magazine aimed at blacks.
Malcolm X knew about transformation and redemption. A street hustler, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for burglary at age 20. In prison, he found the Nation of Islam, and also the joy of acquiring knowledge. ''Without education,'' he said, ''you are not going anywhere in this world.''
A quarter-century later, there is one black man in prison for every two in college. Homicide is the leading cause of death for young black men. Three of every five black women, it is estimated, will get pregnant by age 20. Such behavior by young lions makes it more difficult for blacks as a people to wage a struggle for the political and economic power that Malcolm rightly called ''the only real power that is respected in this society.''
Malcolm X lives on in spirit. Nelson Mandela lives on. So does the need for the young lions to heed their messages of self-respect, self-improvement and self-determination.

HEADLINE: Men's Style;
A New Work Ethic

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
THey are honest, romantic, sincere. Theyhave integrity. And they are sexy. Terms usually invoked to decribe friends, lovers, and sometimes, politicians, are the ones that crop up most when the topic turns to work clothes. Mention any one of those familiar and functional items, ranging from T-shirts to overalls to fishermen's caps, and the conversation takes on a high tone with a sentimental edge. Trend watchers are quick to point out that a resurgent interest in mechanics' coveralls, sanitation workers' slickers, cooks' shirts and ever-so-humble blue jeans expresses a yearning to return to a simpler way of life. ''Our focus is shifting from competing in the city to minding the house in the country,'' says Harold Koda, curator of the costume collection at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Gerald C. Celente, the director of the Socio-Economic Research Institute of America, a consumer trend-analysis service, maintains that people want more control over their lives. ''Since the October crash on Wall Street,'' Celente says, ''people have increasingly refused to give their lives to the company.'' Work clothes become equalizers. Yet, though they rarely express protest or defiance, as they did in the 1960's, their very plainness tends to assert the wearer's personality. Clothing worn by policemen, construction workers or short-order cooks also boasts the virtue of making men feel virile. This may be a matter of fit. In a ruminative essay on blue jeans, Umberto Eco noted that because they held the hips, jeans put a man more in touch with his body. Eco observed that wearing a particularly snug-fitting pair of denims made him think about ''the relationship between me and my pants . . . I had achieved heteroconsciousness,'' he said, ''that is to say an epidermic self-awareness.''
In purely practical terms, work clothes are affordable. ''People buy them as a reaction to similarly styled, but far more expensive, designer clothes,'' says Gene Chace, a part owner of Camouflage, a Manhattan men's clothier that has carried work wear on and off since the mid-1970's. And tight jeans apart, these rugged garments generally accommodate middle-aged spread. It isn't by chance that they, together with their high-ticket knockoffs, are often cut generously at the waist and hips, notes Harold Koda. ''The yuppies are getting old,'' he says.

HEADLINE: On Language;
Unify or Reunify?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
An agreed, managed process of German unification,'' wrote Henry Kissinger, ''would ease an otherwise festering crisis.''
''Reunification means many different things,'' Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana told Europe magazine. ''Stopping unification is like trying to hold back a wall of water,'' editorialized The New York Times.
''A senior State Department official [that's how James A. Baker 3d is identified when he is trying to act like Henry Kissinger] . . . today endorsed a West German plan for German reunification,'' reported Al Kamen in The Washington Post, who quoted the unidentified former White House chief of staff from Texas as saying that ''unification is taking place on the ground right now.'' 
Well, which is it - unification or reunification? Are the terms interchangeable, or do they contain a subtle difference known only to diplomatic nuancists?
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany blithely used Wiedervereinigung - ''reunification'' - in his 10-point plan for getting together again, but he has been avoiding the wieder (''re'') ever since. ''Now the politicians are making discriminations in their use of unification and reunification,'' says Thomas Mouillard, a correspondent in Washington for the German Press Agency. ''Some people say that reunification would implicate the borders of 1937.''
Aha. That is why these two words were called to my attention by David Binder, roving correspondent of The New York Times, who speaks fluent East European.
This big little difference is illustrated in this interchange between Michael Lucas of World Policy Journal and Karsten Voigt, a spokesman for the West German socialists: ''How do you assess the prospects for German reunification?'' ''I don't like to speak about re-unification, because we are not talking about going back to an old state of affairs.''
That old state can be construed to contain a slice of Pomerania, Silesia (from which we get the derogation sleaze), East Prussia and even Czechoslovakia's German-speaking Sudetenland, all once called by the Nazis ''Grossdeutschland.'' (''Greater New York City'' spreads over Connecticut and a Brooklyn-accented portion of New Jersey.) As might be expected, Germans are highly sensitive to reactions to the re- because it contains a reminder of expansionism, Lebensraum, and reopens ''the German Question.'' The American economist Pierre Rinfret, irritated at what he considered the arrogance of German politicians who insist that the merger is a matter for Germans alone to decide, dubbed the coming amalgam ''the Fourth Reich''; he knew this would annoy them.
The very thought of the prewar borders incenses many Europeans, who are thinking only in terms of a combination of the present East and West Germany that stops at the Oder-Neisse line drawn at the end of World War II. ''In France, most of the press and the politicians use the word reunification,'' reports Daniel Labrosse, press secretary of the French Embassy in Washington. ''Certainly it points to the problems that came when Germany was previously united.''
To skirt the controversy over the re-, French and German officials have begun to drop the -cation, talking instead about German ''unity'' - unite or Einheit.
President Bush's aides are apparently unaware of the fuss. In a written statement presumably cleared with, or run by, the State Department, the White House announced that this weekend's visit of Chancellor Kohl will provide a chance ''to exchange views about prospects for German reunification. . . .''
 
Mail Pull
 
The astute reader will note the unexplained phrase German Question, in the above item. I am told it came into use in the mid-1930's, but none of the usual suspects have a printed citation to nail it down. Last Resort time: the help of Lexicographic Irregulars is thus solicited. Etymological immortality awaits; forget the amorphous German issue and German problem and get right down to die deutsche Frage, the German Question. And while you're at it, shoot along a pre-1969 citation of peace dividend to me at The New York Times, 1627 Eye Street, Washington, D.C. 20006.
The even more astute reader will find fault with Dr. Kissinger's phrase ''festering crisis.'' My erstwhile colleague's syndicated column has grown more purposeful and forceful of late (unification of subject has been a boon), and his audience now extends beyond members of the Conceptual Frameworkers Union.
However, even those of us who can take instruction from him on the cultural contradictions in German history know that festering crisis is an oxymoron. The nature of crisis is the state of having come to a head, not the contrary state of festering (from fistula, a pus-filled sore that has not come to a head and burst in its moment of crisis). A crisis can be said to continue, but only a chronic problem, issue or question can lay claim to fester.
 
Done Deal
 
''There were words,'' writes the former speech writer Peggy Noonan, in her deliciously irreverent ''What I Saw at the Revolution: A Political Life in the Reagan Era.''
Using a run-on device, she then surveys the cliches of only yesteryear: ''You had a notion instead of a thought and a dust-up instead of a fight, you had a can-do attitude and you were in touch with the Zeitgeist. No one had intentions they had an agenda and no one was wrong they were fundamentally wrong and you didn't work on something you broke your pick on it and it wasn't an agreement it was a done deal.''
By the time done deal reached print in 1979, its place in the lingo of business and political bargaining was a fait accompli.
That's because we have had no expressive word or phrase for ''an irreversible agreement,'' an accord or understanding that had the connotation of ''sorry, it's too late now to make a change, you missed the boat, that train left the station.''
Three centuries ago, in a Charles Cotton poem, the phrase was nearly found: ''She thought 't would be a done Thing Soon.'' That locution percolated in the language, appearing in Charles Dickens's ''Christmas Carol'' in 1843: ''It was a done thing between him and Scrooge's nephew.''
Finally, somebody in the 1970's - nobody knows who - used alliteration to transform a tired done thing into a lively done deal.
Overnight, the partly alliterative but not as punchy signed, sealed and delivered was undone; same with wrapped up, buttoned up, all set, fini, in the bag, nailed down and yesterday's news.
Having dissolved all these cliches, done deal lasted more than a decade, placing it beyond nonce-word status. Soon to be in all the dictionaries, the Americanism that unraveled fait accompli stands as a triumph of alliterative phrasemaking; it's all over but the shouting.

INNOCENCE AND EXPERIENCE
By Stuart Hampshire.
195 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $20.
 
Folly is an endless maze,
Tangled roots perplex her ways,
How many have fallen there!
They stumble all night over bones of the dead;
And feel they know not what but care;
And wish to lead others when they should be led.William Blake, ''Songs of Innocence and of Experience.''
In his recent book ''Quiddities'' the Harvard philosopher W. V. Quine wrote that he knows ''gratuitous killing'' is wrong but beyond ''that salient marker'' there are only ''uncharted moral wastes.'' Mr. Quine is celebrated for the preciseness of his thought. His statement reads like a declaration of bankruptcy on the part of British and American academic philosophers, who seem to talk mostly to one another. But most people who are not academic philosophers assume that moral principles do exist, and they often act on that assumption. There being such a gap between Mr. Quine's bleak assessment of the profession and common practice, one turns to what Sir Stuart Hampshire, a veteran moralist and now the Bonsall Professor of Philosophy at Stanford University, has to say in ''Innocence and Experience,'' a book expressly directed to defending and exemplifying moral reasoning. 
To take up first the virtues of the book: It teaches that the experience of the philosopher determines his themes, that it is his own points of stress and conflict that are reflected in them. Also, the collective experience that is history must have a major role in shaping any moral philosophy; the mere rationalist abstract of humanity is not enough. The imagination, broadly understood as the faculty that permits human beings to imitate, to intuit, to empathize and to create, is as important as reason in moral thought.
Sir Stuart says, further, that when we describe our moral decision making we possess only metaphors to indicate our mental operations and that the oldest and best of these metaphors is the council of a ruler determining a public policy, in which argument and consideration of alternatives precede decision. (I also like his metaphor for the imagination as a compost heap, enriched by each new load of material intermingling with the pile.) In forming moral philosophy today, he says, we can and should draw on the work of great predecessors such as Aristotle, whose account of the ways in which ''good'' is predicated is fundamental. We should not accept the distinction made by the 18th-century British philosopher David Hume between fact and value, nor be bemused by ''Hume's trick'' of making a statement doubtful by examining it abstractly, removed from the conditions that are normally assumed when the statement is made.
Finally, Sir Stuart says there is evil done by human beings that no moral philosopher can relativize or rationalize and no moral philosophy should ignore.
These are contributions to the charting of the moral landscape, even though none of these points lead to specific moral prescriptions. There are further beauties - not least of them the author's tone of civilized conversation - to be acknowledged, if my list were to be exhaustive; and I must concede that I have picked what pleases me.
With the same subjectivity I shall enumerate what in a work of moral philosophy may be called vices, aware though I am that the author is not vicious and that only the moral duty of candor requires such stern evaluation:
He gives almost no biographical information. We are told at the start that at the age of 16 or 17 he was distressed by the sight of the unemployed in England. At the University of Oxford he was attracted by Communism as preferable to a conservatism toadying to the Nazis and Fascists, but he underwent an intellectual conversion to the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle and won a fellowship at All Souls' College. As an intelligence officer during World War II he studied the central command of the German SS, including the Gestapo. Later he worked for the Labor Government and was involved in the European response to the Marshall Plan before returning to university life in 1947. He has always been a socialist; he has always been attracted by the deception and intrigue of wartime secret intelligence; and he is now 75 years old. These biographical notes, or most of them, would fit many English academics who were undergraduates in the 1930's. They tell us almost nothing about the social or sexual or spiritual life of the man, none of those intimate facts that beyond doubt have a great deal to do with how a moral philosopher has framed his questions and his answers. It is no accident that the most influential of all moralists of the West, St. Augustine, was the most generous provider of such information, and no accident that Rousseau, seeing the connection, imitated St. Augustine's ''Confessions.'' In comparison with these masters of self-revelation, Sir Stuart Hampshire remains a reticent Englishman.
His bow to history does not lead him to engage in any steady contemplation of how moral ideas have developed, historically. I do not know how one can engage in moral philosophy without a close examination of the growth or decline of particular moral concepts. He speaks of history without entering on the historical enterprise.
Another vice is that his persuasive celebration of imagination carries him on to a position that seems essentially and hopelessly Romantic: through imagination one can achieve transcendence of time, and this transcendence consists in the uncovering of one's ''primordial self.'' Why should anyone glory in this recovery of one's own emotional patterns, abstracted from time? Why is the recovered pattern any better than the emotions of the moment? How thin the notion of transcendence has become.
Also, Sir Stuart takes no notice of the wide range of images that have been used to portray the workings of the human mind. Charles Hampden-Turner's ''Maps of the Mind'' (1981) provides 60 charts from classic concepts like the machine of Descartes to such innovative approaches as ''the sigmoid curves of Jonas Salk.'' The inventory in ''Innocence and Experience'' is impoverished. In drawing on the ancients like Aristotle, Sir Stuart repeats the old claim that we stand on the shoulders of our predecessors and so have better vision. The image does not match his procedure. It is more as though he had borrowed a hand or foot - a process not likely to have improved vision.
And it must be said that, while he demolishes Hume, he does not dare to find moral necessities in human nature. Even the natural need of the human intellect for truth goes unacknowledged. He admits a single universal moral necessity - the need for due process in reaching peaceful coexistence among those who have conflicting concepts of the good; the need, in other words, for what British writers call ''natural justice,'' the obligation of a judge to hear both sides.
But then he undermines even this minimalist notion. Purporting to answer Machiavelli, he accepts Machiavelli's basic postulate that morality for a state and those who rule the state is different from ordinary morality. He accepts as a given that rulers cannot be innocent, that rulers will normally have to choose between two evils, that rulers will be in fact unjust. He then attempts to salvage his minimal natural justice by contending that there must be a limit to a ruler's injustice: the ruler goes too far if he denies due process before committing his unjust act.
He does not dispute Machiavelli's claim that without a bag of wicked tricks the ruler will not stay in power, the state itself will not last. But an individual's desire to stay in office is no excuse for skulduggery and may, as in Richard Nixon's case, be reason for terminating the office. Democracies seem none the worse for the relatively short terms they give their rulers or for the multiple means they use to hold them publicly accountable. People in power rationalize that ''I'm doing it for someone else,'' but so do heads of nonprofit organizations, lawyers, taxi drivers and parents. If vicarious responsibility does not excuse injustice by these agents, neither does it excuse injustice by people who hold governmental posts.
Lastly, Sir Stuart accepts the absoluteness of evil, independent of contexts and conventions. But on inspection, the only absolute evil for him is the denial of due process. Why is that an unredeemable evil? According to him, it is because such denial expresses disrespect for the uniqueness of human individuals or, alternatively, it prevents the peaceful settling of public conflicts, within a nation or among nations. Both propositions are true, but murder, enslavement and falsehood are equally disrespectful to individual humanity and disruptive of conflict resolution. Sir Stuart is able to affirm an absolute objection only to denial of process. Because he refuses to affirm that there are substantive goods to which every human being is entitled, he cannot go far in charting the moral wastes. Mr. Quine's gloomy assessment of academic moral philosophy is scarcely answered by Sir Stuart's earnest effort.

''Fired with the knowledge that his own immune system was compromised, Mr. Monette has etched a magnificent monument to his lover's bravery, their commitment to each other and the plague of hatred and ignorance they had to endure,'' William M. Hoffman said here in 1988. ''The memoir has the leanness and urgency of war reporting, sparing the reader none of the details of the illness or of the emotional state of the principals.'' 
 
THE WATCH, by Rick Bass. (Washington Square/ Pocket Books, $6.95.) The title piece of this collection of short stories takes place in a mosquito-ridden swamp where an old man has fled his insufferably boring son to hide among a band of naked fugitive laundresses. ''The tale is told so candidly that nothing within it seems even improbable,'' our reviewer, Susan Lowell, said lastJU year. Throughout the book, the author ''shows an impressive command of the devices of contemporary fiction. . . . When Mr. Bass gets to what he's looking for, he goes past technical excellence to his best work, which is fresh and strange.'' Norton has published paperback editions of two collections of wilderness essays by the author, a petroleum geologist who now lives on a ranch in Montana. THE DEER PASTURE is about hunting in the Texas hill country. In WILD TO THE HEART, he describes a time when he commuted regularly from Jackson, Miss., where he was trapped by a job, to the liberation of New Mexico's Pecos Wilderness. Both books cost $7.95.
 
THE AGE OF WONDERS, by Aharon Appelfeld. Translated by Dalya Bilu. (Godine, $11.95.) As a Jewish intellectual tries to rationalize away the anti-Semitism eroding Austria, he and his family are forced to rethink the very question of what it means to be a Jew. In 1981 our reviewer, Joel Agee, said, ''It is a mark of Mr. Appelfeld's artistic integrity that he never proffers a didactic or dogmatic answer, but allows the question a wide range of emotional and philosophical inflections; and that is a major source, as well, of the novel's power.'' Godine has also published Mr. Appelfeld's BADENHEIM 1939 ($9.95), which takes place at a resort for middle-class Jews, where an accumulation of incidents, each seemingly trivial in itself, foreshadows the Holocaust. ''Some margin of mystery, some ungraspable personal strain or sighting, must always remain in a work of art,'' Irving Howe said here in 1980. ''I have read 'Badenheim 1939' several times, hoping to 'ambush' the writer's skills or strategies, and I still puzzle over his shaped indirections of terror. More important, I marvel at them too.''
 
ASK SIR JAMES: Sir James Reid, Personal Physician to Queen Victoria and Physician-in-Ordinary to Three Monarchs, by Michaela Reid. (Penguin, $12.95.) Drawing on a cache of personal papers, the wife of Sir James's grandson tells what Queen Victoria looked like through her doctor's eyes. ''We see how the Queen came to trust the doctor and how her whims ruled his life,'' Caryn James said in The Times last year. ''The not-quite-upstairs, not-quite-downstairs view offered in his biography preserves much of the imperious spirit of those last Victorian days.''
 
THE TWENTY-SEVENTH CITY, by Jonathan Franzen. (Avon, $8.95.) A deceptively placid woman named S. Jammu moves from Bombay to St. Louis to take over the police department and, ultimately, the whole city. In 1988 our reviewer, Peter Andrews, called this thriller ''an impressive debut by a gifted young writer. . . . As well as anyone I can recall, Mr. Franzen has managed to - horrible phrase - 'transcend the genre' and put together a suspense story with the elements of a complex, multilayered psychological novel.''
 
ANCIENT LIVES: Daily Life in Egypt of the Pharaohs, by John Romer. (Owl/Holt, $16.95.) An archeologist describes what life might have been like 3,500 years ago for the village of artisans who built the tombs of the pharaohs. He ''re-creates in rich, sensory detail the rhythms and textures of ordinary life in an extraordinary time and place,'' Brett Harvey said here in 1985.
 
THE LETTER LEFT TO ME, by Joseph McElroy. (Carroll & Graf, $6.95.) Three years before his death, a father bequeaths a letter to his son, and it haunts the boy for the rest of his life. In 1988 our reviewer, Sheila Ballantyne, said, ''Mr. McElroy's particular skill is to convey, by repetition, the confusions of one particular boy in a time of crisis, and in so doing to illuminate the universal issues that radiate from this singular event: the way the written word can obscure the very truth it seems to serve - yet, in that obfuscation, trigger memories that indirectly reveal its heart.''
 
EQUATOR: A Journey, by Thurston Clarke. (Avon, $9.95.) A travel writer tells of the more than two years he spent circumnavigating the earth, beginning at the mouth of the Amazon. In 1988 our reviewer, Helen Winternitz, said, ''Mr. Clarke has done much to enlighten us about the increasingly intertwined world, one cinched by the equator and one in which parochial and global politics, the potential of nuclear holocaust, the realities of economic and climatic disaster affect everybody, every reader and every nonreader, whether they know it or not, whether they like it or not.''
 
RED ARMY, by Ralph Peters. (Pocket, $5.50.) In this suddenly anachronistic novel, the Soviet Army and the Warsaw Pact fight a conventional war with the NATO allies along the border between East and West Germany. ''What comes out of this very readable novel is a feeling that while the wars change, the soldiers remain the same,'' David Murray said here last year.

BETWEEN TWO FIRESEurope's Path in the 1930s.
By David Clay Large.
Illustrated. 425 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $22.50.
In his radio talks in the late 1930's, Col. Robert Rutherford McCormick, the powerful, eccentric publisher of The Chicago Tribune, often called for the strengthening of the nation's coast artillery. 
While coast artillery hadn't been too successful since Fort Sumter, Colonel McCormick's tactical naivete was less important than his conviction - shared by many of his fellow Americans - that Europe and its problems could be held at bay, if not by diplomacy then by long-range guns.
Except in the minds of some artists, rich expatriates and a handful of prescient correspondents, Europe was an afterthought to Americans between the world wars. In the 1920's, nativism, a special strain of xenophobia, produced the Ku Klux Klan and all but padlocked the Golden Door to immigrants. In the 1930's, because of the trauma of economic disaster and social upheaval, getting and holding a job took precedence over everything - certainly over foreign affairs.
Recently there has been a resurgence of interest in the 1930's, the period that W. H. Auden called the ''low, dishonest decade,'' the grim years when Europe prepared - knowingly, cynically, often helplessly - for yet another war. David Clay Large's ''Between Two Fires: Europe's Path in the 1930s'' is one of the first popular histories of the period prompted by a new interest in what Mr. Large, a professor of history at Montana State University, calls ''an era of parliamentary impotence and corruption, civil war, colonial war, purges and putsches.'' He bypasses traditional historical narrative and instead presents eight episodes that he believes shed light on what was happening in Europe during that decade.
Beginning with the Stavisky affair in France, he moves on to the almost forgotten Austrian civil war of 1934; Hitler's ''Blood Purge'' of the same year, when the black-shirted SS wiped out the leadership of the brown-shirted SA; the Italian invasion of Ethiopia; Britain's ''Jarrow Crusade'' of 1936, when 200 unemployed shipyard workers marched on London; the destruction of Guernica in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War; and finally, the Stalinist purges in the Soviet Union, which continued into the early days of World War II.
Serge-Alexander Stavisky was an ambitious swindler who operated with the connivance of French Government officials who profited from his schemes. In 1934, when his criminal empire went awry, Stavisky either committed suicide or was killed by police agents. The involvement of high-level politicians in the affair infuriated a French public already disillusioned by the venality of its leaders. The ensuing riots, mostly brawls between gangs of right-wing toughs and Communists, almost destroyed the shaky Third Republic and hardened the political divisions that helped bring down France in 1940.
The Austrian civil war of 1934, too, was a clash between extremists, the left-wing workers of ''red'' Vienna and the ''black'' rightists from the mountain provinces, aided and abetted by Hitler and his agents, the Austrian Nazis. Engelbert Dollfuss, the pint-sized chancellor who was mocked by his subjects as a ''Millimetternich,'' sided with the right wing, only to be gunned down in his office in July 1934 by SS Nazis, helping pave the way for the Anschluss four years later.
Both the Stavisky affair and the Austrian civil war were examples of the bankruptcy of parliamentary government in Europe, what Mr. Large calls ''the disintegration of the moderate center,'' prophesied, in his view, by William Butler Yeats in 1920: ''Things fall apart; the center cannot hold.''
To Mr. Large, the ''Night of the Long Knives,'' in 1934, the eradication of the leaders of the SA - Sturmabteilung or storm troopers - by Himmler's SS - Schutzstaffel or security staff - was summed up by the historian Joachim Fest, who saw ''a direct connection between the killings of June 30 and subsequent practice of mass murder in the camps of the East.''
The weakest section of ''Between Two Fires'' is the story of the unemployed shipyard workers from Jarrow in the industrial northeast of England and of ''Red Ellen'' Wilkinson, who led them on a peaceful march to London in 1936 to protest the bleak poverty of the old shipbuilding towns on the Tyneside. They were cheered along the route, treated politely in London and sent home, having accomplished virtually nothing. To Mr. Large they symbolized the ''British workers' willingness to seek solutions to their difficulties within their country's constitutional framework.'' Heartwarming, compared to the turmoil across the channel; but in this context, not overly illuminating.
To the amateur historian, much of the value of Mr. Large's book is his recounting of events that everyone has heard of but knows little about - such as the destruction of the old Basque capital of Guernica by aircraft of the Condor Legion on April 26, 1937. Even over a distance in time of more than half a century, the horror of that day comes through in these pages.
So, too, does the nightmare of Stalin's senseless purges and the sterile futility of British appeasement at Munich. David Clay Large knows how to write: he recognizes a good quotation or anecdote. He has a sense of drama equal to that of another popular historian, William Manchester, but he has, one suspects, fewer heroes.

HEADLINE: A CHILD'S GARDEN OF SUBVERSION

BYLINE: By ALISON LURIE; Alison Lurie's most recent novel is ''The Truth About Lauren Jones.'' This essay is adapted from her forthcoming collection ''Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: Subversive Children's Literature.''

 BODY:
There exists in our world an unusual, partly savage tribe, ancient and widely distributed, yet until recently little studied by anthropologists or historians. All of us were at one time members of this tribe: we knew its customs, manners and rituals, its folklore and sacred texts. I refer, of course, to childhood.
The sacred texts of childhood, however, are not always the ones adults recommend, as I discovered very early. Soon after I began going to the library, I realized that there were two sorts of books on its shelves. The first kind, the great majority, told me what grown-ups had decided I ought to know or believe about the world. Many of these books were practical: they wanted me to understand how the automobile worked, or who George Washington was. Also, and not just incidentally, they wanted me to admire both automobiles and the Father of Our Country; you didn't hear much about the mothers of our country in those days. 
Along with these improving books there were also some that hoped to teach me manners or morals or both. These books had no Dewey decimal numbers on their spines, and their lessons came disguised as stories. They were about children or bunny rabbits or little engines who had problems or faults and got into difficult situations, sometimes comic and sometimes serious. But in the end they were always saved by some wise, helpful older person or rabbit or engine. The protagonists of these books, that is, learned to depend on authority for help and advice. They also learned to be hardworking, responsible and practical; to stay on the track and be content with their lot in life. They learned, in other words, to be more like respectable grown-ups. It was the same message I and my friends heard every day: Sit up straight, dear. Don't go too far into the woods. Say thank you to Aunt Etta. Come along, stop daydreaming and fill in your workbook. Now, darling, you mustn't make up stories.
But there was another sort of children's literature, I discovered. Some of these books, like ''Tom Sawyer,'' ''Little Women,'' ''Peter Pan'' and ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,'' were on the shelves of the library; others, like ''The Wizard of Oz'' and the Nancy Drew series, had been judged unworthy and had to be bought in shops or borrowed from friends. These were the sacred texts of childhood, whose authors had not forgotten what it was like to be a child. To read them was to feel a shock of recognition, a rush of liberating energy.
These books, and others like them, recommended - even celebrated - daydreaming, disobedience, answering back, running away from home and concealing one's private thoughts and feelings from unsympathetic grown-ups. They overturned adult pretensions and made fun of adult institutions, including school and family. In a word, they were subversive, just like many of the rhymes and jokes and games I learned on the school playground.
It is a long while since I was a child, but I don't think the situation has changed very much. In every era, including the present one, run-of-the-mill children's literature tends to support the status quo. The books that win prizes for stylistic or artistic excellence often - though not always - belong to this category; and when they do, they are at best only politely tolerated by children.
I am sometimes asked why anyone who is not a teacher or a librarian or the parent of little children should concern herself with children's books and folklore. I know the standard answers: that many famous writers have written for children and that the great children's books are also great literature; that these books and tales are an important source of archetype and symbol and that they can help us to understand the structure and functions of the novel.
All this is true. But I think we should also take children's literature seriously because it is sometimes subversive: because its values are not always those of the conventional adult world. Of course in a sense much great literature is subversive, since its very existence implies that what matters is art, imagination and truth. In what we call the real world, on the other hand, what usually counts is money, power and fame.
The great subversive works of children's literature suggest that there are other views of human life besides those of the shopping mall and the corporation. They mock current assumptions and express the imaginative, unconventional, noncommercial view of the world in its simplest and purest form. They appeal to the imaginative, questioning, rebellious child within all of us, renew our instinctive energy and act as a force for change. This is why such literature is worthy of our attention and will endure long after more conventional tales have been forgotten.
An interesting question I sometimes hear is: what - besides intention - makes a particular story a ''children's book''? With the exception of picture books for toddlers, juvenile classics are not necessarily shorter or simpler than so-called adult fiction, and they are surely not less well written. The heroes and heroines of these tales, it is true, are often children: but then so are the protagonists of ''What Maisie Knew'' by Henry James and ''The Bluest Eye'' by Toni Morrison. Yet the barrier between children's books and adult fiction remains; editors, critics and readers seem to have little trouble in assigning a given work to one category or the other.
In classic children's fiction a pastoral convention is maintained. It is assumed that the world of childhood is simpler and more natural than that of adults, and that children, though they may have faults, are essentially good or at least capable of becoming so. The transformation of selfish, whiny, disagreeable Mary and hysterical, demanding Colin in Frances Hodgson Burnett's ''Secret Garden'' is a paradigm. Of course, there are often unpleasant minor juvenile characters who give the protagonist a lot of trouble and are defeated or evaded rather than re-educated. But on occasion even the angry bully and the lying sneak can be reformed and forgiven. Richard Hughes's ''High Wind in Jamaica,'' though most of its characters are children, never appears on lists of recommended juvenile fiction; not so much because of the elaborations of its diction (which is no more complex than that of, say, ''Treasure Island''), but because in it children are irretrievably damaged and corrupted.
Adults in most children's books, on the other hand, are usually stuck with their characters and incapable of alteration or growth. If they are really unpleasant, the only thing that can rescue them is the natural goodness of a child. Here again Mrs. Burnett provides the classic example, in ''Little Lord Fauntleroy.'' (Scrooge's somewhat similar change of heart in ''A Christmas Carol,'' however, is due mainly to regret for his past and terror of the future. This is one of the things that make the book a family rather than a juvenile romance; another is the helpless passivity of the principal child character, Tiny Tim.) Of the three principal preoccupations of adult fiction - sex, money and death - the first is absent from classic children's literature and the other two either absent or much muted. Love in these stories may be intense, but it is romantic rather than sensual, at least overtly. Peter Pan passionately desires Wendy, but what he wants is for her to be his mother.
Money is a motive in children's literature, in the sense that many stories deal with a search for treasure of some sort. These quests, unlike real-life ones, are almost always successful, though occasionally what is found in the end is some form of family happiness, which is declared by the author and the characters to be a ''real treasure.'' Simple economic survival, however, is almost never the problem; what is sought, rather, is a magical (sometimes literally) surplus of wealth.
Death, which was a common theme in 19th-century fiction for children, was almost banished during the first half of this century. Since then it has begun to reappear; the breakthrough book was E. B. White's ''Charlotte's Web.'' Today not only animals but people die, notably in the sort of books that get awards and are recommended by librarians and psychologists for children who have lost a relative. But even today the characters who die tend to be of another generation; the protagonist and his or her friends survive.
Though there are some interesting exceptions, even the most subversive of contemporary children's books usually follow these conventions. They portray an ideal world of perfectible beings, free of the necessity for survival and reproduction: not only a pastoral but a paradisal universe - for without sex and death, humans may become as angels. The romantic child, trailing clouds of glory, is not as far off as we might think.

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON

 BODY:
It seemed like a nightmare. Willie O'Ree, unable to see with his jersey pulled over his head, could only throw punches at the voices screaming around him.
''People were grabbing at me, yelling at me, using all the old, ugly words,'' O'Ree said. ''I was punching, kicking. I wasn't going to let them pull me into the stands.''
The scene was Madison Square Garden. The year was 1961. O'Ree, a forward with the Boston Bruins, had gone hard into the endboards in the defensive zone of the Rangers. The wire mesh, which protected the fans from the puck and the players from the fans, had given way. And O'Ree, the first black to play in the National Hockey League, was being yanked into an angry mob. 
The racial epithets burned in O'Ree's ears. Beer ran down his neck. And a lot flashed through his mind before his teammates and opponents finally hauled him back through the fallen barrier.
''I don't even like to think now what might have happened had they got me up there,'' recalled O'Ree, now 54 years old. ''I just came to the conclusion at the time that the only safe place was on the ice.''
But that assessment, however good it may have looked then to a man in desperation, looks rather naive in hindsight. The fights never really ended. They just got a little less lopsided.
O'Ree ultimately played just 45 games in the N.H.L., and 13 years would go by before anyone followed in his faint but courageous footsteps.
Only 13 blacks have played in the N.H.L. in its 73 years of existence, including four on current rosters: Grant Fuhr and Eldon Reddick, goaltenders for the Edmonton Oilers; Tony McKegney of the Quebec Nordiques, and Dirk Graham of the Chicago Blackhawks. Graeme Townshend, who was recently involved in a fight after an opponent made what Townshend said was a racial slur, was with the Boston Bruins briefly but has been returned to the minors.
The careers of most of the black players have generally been short, their achievements by and large marginal, their experiences by most accounts mixed.
The environment they played in has throughout been a charged one, for hockey games are played overwhelmingly and attended almost exclusively by whites. And the N.H.L., as well as its minor league affiliates, plays a brand of the game that tolerates and arguably promotes violence.
For blacks trying to make a career in the game, this can make for a lonely and difficult life. Organists in minor league towns can still strike up their warped versions of ''jungle'' music to accompany a black's appearance on the ice. The verbal sparring that takes place in the rink's corners and during the game's more heated moments can still include racial slurs. A tactless joke among teammates, a joke born of ignorance and not hate, can still leave a locker room silent with embarrassment and hurt.
''I believe there is no place for racial or ethnic slurs in the game,'' said John Ziegler, the president of the National Hockey League. ''It's pretty intense out on that ice, pretty emotional, and a lot of words are used that I wouldn't permit in my office or my home.
''But when it comes to something like a racist remark, that's different. If one uses a racial or ethnic remark on the ice, they'll hear from me.''
Kris King has been wondering more than three weeks about whether he will hear from Ziegler. King, a young left wing for the Rangers, is the player who was involved in the fight Feb. 3 with Townshend at Boston Garden, and he has been accused by the Boston coach, Mike Milbury, of having used a racist remark in the fight. Milbury said the slur had provoked Townshend, a 24-year-old black rookie forward, into attacking King at center ice. Townshend was penalized and wound up costing the Bruins a goal in a 2-1 loss.
The N.H.L. promptly announced that it would investigate the incident involving King, who has emphatically denied ever using a racial slur. And Brian O'Neill, the N.H.L. executive vice president who handles discipline matters, said 10 days ago that the investigation had been completed.
But Ziegler has made no ruling, and has maintained that he is working against no deadline in making one.
''I see no real resolution,'' Milbury said. ''No one will ever know what was said besides the two players involved.''
Though the incident may remain unresolved, it nonetheless illustrates the tough choices blacks have faced since O'Ree, who was raised in New Brunswick, was signed to a minor league contract by Punch Imlach late one night at the home of O'Ree's sister home in Bridgetown, Nova Scotia.
Take offense and take a swing? Or just play on? Are the remarks merely a tactical weapon designed to infuriate and therefore distract, or do they reflect a widespread prejudice that could affect a black player and his career more dramatically?
''I used to fight a lot, in the N.H.L., in the minors,'' O'Ree said in a telephone interview from San Diego, where he works for a security company. ''Sometimes every game, sometimes to the point where I felt like I had my gloves off more than I had them on. It wasn't, understand, that I wanted to fight. But I was determined to play, and if I had to fight to prove it, I would.''
Bill Riley played for the Washington Capitals and the Winnipeg Jets from 1976 to 1980, and was the third black to play in the N.H.L. He said he heard remarks or taunting ''100, maybe 1,000 times in my career, and if I'd fought every time I heard it, I'd have spent my whole career fighting.''
''But I'd envisioned being Gordie Howe, just like every other kid in Canada,'' Riley said. ''And hey, I could play the game. I wanted to play the game.''
Riley, born in a small town in Nova Scotia, spent most of his career in the minor leagues. He was 23 when he loaded his car and crossed the border into the United States for the first time, headed to play for the Dayton Gems in Ohio.
''The guard at the border gave me a real hard time,'' Riley recalled. ''And it wasn't real hard to see that it had to do with the color of my skin. It was scary.
''The speed limit was 55, but I didn't drive above 40 all the way to Dayton. Maybe, I thought, I was a little innocent about how things were going to be.''
Things, as he suspected, did not turn out to be ideal. He often played in overcrowded buildings with no shortage of people who got a kick out of taunting him. The fans had a large vocabulary of derogatory nicknames, and there were songbooks full of inflammatory numbers to play on the organ.
''It was never-ending, a joke,'' Riley said. ''And I guess it helped that I had a sense of humor.''
Mike Marson, Riley said, didn't. Marson, the second black in the N.H.L., had played for the Capitals for a couple of seasons before Riley arrived in 1976 to become Marson's teammate and fellow pioneer.
''Now, there was a kid who couldn't handle the racial thing,'' Riley said of Marson, who is now a bus driver in Toronto. ''There wasn't a guy who could skate like him, and pound for pound he might have been the strongest guy in the N.H.L. So much skill he had. He could have played 10, 12 years.'' He played, instead, just 196 games. ''We'd talk about it all a lot,'' Riley said. ''I'd even get him to laugh once in a while. I used to kid him about not sitting together on the bus. I told him that if somebody was going to get us, we ought not to let them get us with one bullet.
''I don't know if management could have done anything to ease the pressure on Mike. But in all honesty, management never had a clue what it must have been like to be a black man in a white man's sport.''
McKegney undoubtedly has as good a feel as anyone for what it's like, and as good a sense as anyone of how management approaches the issue. McKegney, 32, is playing in his 12th N.H.L. season and with his sixth team, and has scored nearly 300 goals.
McKegney, who like other current black players maintains that he has generally been welcomed and accepted by his teammates, is frank about the reality of prejudice, but dismissive of its impact.
''Look, it's a fact of life, and obviously it's still depressing to realize that,'' said McKegney, who two years ago was involved in an incident that resulted in Ziegler's reprimanding Joe Kocur of the Red Wings for using a racial epithet.
''People who tell you that racist feelings don't exist and aren't expressed are living in a fantasy world,'' McKegney said. ''It's suppressed more than it's policed. And sure, it results in a small bit of loneliness. But you can't dwell on it. It's tough enough to survive in the game as a player.
''Besides, it's a cakewalk compared to what Jackie Robinson went through with the Dodgers in baseball. There's nothing to sensationalize, no ABC miniseries in it all. I will, though, go so far as to say that I often think about how it is that I've got traded six times in my career.''
Reggie Savage is just beginning what he hopes will be his final push to a career in the N.H.L. Savage, the first-round selection of the Capitals in the 1988 draft, is completing his last year of junior hockey with the Victoriaville Tigres. Like several other blacks who played in the N.H.L., Savage is the adopted son of a white couple from Canada.
''Hockey was a natural for me, growing up in Montreal,'' Savage said. ''Every kid played, and so did I. I won't say it's been difficult, although it has been different. There's no getting around that you are the only black guy in the locker room.
''But people have respected me for what I've done, not for the color of my skin. As for the names, I've been called them and I've heard them. It may not be acceptable. But that may not be the point.''
David Poile, the general manager of the Capitals, makes the comment repeated by players, coaches, and other general managers in the league when asked about the experience of blacks in the N.H.L., past, present and future.
Poile, the person who drafted Savage, likened the blacks' predicament to that of the European players who began populating N.H.L. rosters in the late 1970's.
Poile said, and others agree, that the Europeans were subjected to a fairly brutal period of initiation and trial, abused physically and verbally. Pat Hickey played alongside several of them as a member of the Rangers a decade ago.
''Now, there was a real confrontation between cultures, a real economic clash,'' said Hickey, now the general manager of the New Haven Nighthawks of the American Hockey League. ''The Europeans were perceived as taking jobs away from Canadian players, and it brought to a head a certain prejudice. But it was dealt with, lived through.''
The Bruins' Milbury said: ''As more black players - indeed if more black players - enter the N.H.L., the on-ice stuff will all come down to how the individual players cope with it. And the fact is none of them will be in the N.H.L. long if they deal with it like Graeme Townshend did. At least, they won't be on my team.''
Willie O'Ree, then, would probably not have played for Mike Milbury.
''My heart goes out to the kid Townshend,'' said O'Ree, who lives in San Diego, where he finished out his minor league career in 1980. ''I'd tell him, if I could, to pick his spots.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Sports Section on Feb. 25 about the experiences of black players in the National Hockey League incorrectly described the professional level at which an incident involving Willie O'Ree, the first black player in the N.H.L., took place. The incident, in which O'Ree said he became entangled with a group of fans who made racial remarks and grabbed at his jersey, occurred when O'Ree was playing for the Quebec Aces in the minor leagues, not in the N.H.L. or at Madison Square Garden.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL NOTEBOOK;
Millionaires Won't Miss a Defector

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Cross Greg Gagne off the list.
Gagne, the Minnesota Twins' shortstop, signed a one-year contract last month for an even $1 million, boosting himself onto the ever-more-crowded plateau of players who will earn $1 million or more this season (yes, there will be a this season).
But then the other day Gagne and the Twins negotiated a three-year contract worth $4.5 million. The first-year salary ($700,000) and a pro-rated share of the $400,000 signing bonus ($133,333) now leaves Gagne short of the 1990 Millionaires Circle.
The circle, however, will not turn square over Gagne's defection. The membership remains healthy and hefty. 
According to a survey of salaries by The New York Times, based on contract information from management and player sources, 152 players - virtually 25 percent of all the major league players - are guaranteed $1 million or more in salary (and, where applicable, pro-rated share of signing bonus) for this year. Of that number, one player - Robin Yount of Milwaukee - will earn more than $3 million and 26 other players are in the $2 million-or-more class.
The numbers have risen dramatically year by year. Only three years ago, in 1987, 60 players - or 10 percent - were at the $1 million mark, including six at $2 million. The next year the total was 74, including 12 at $2 million. Last year the circle ballooned to 106, with 20 at the more stratospheric $2 million, though none yet at $3 million.
This year's total at both levels would be higher except for the lockout. Many players negotiated their contracts in a way that meant smaller salaries for 1990, thus risking the loss of less money during an in-season lockout.
Gagne did exactly that in negotiating his multiyear contract. Instead of possibly losing part of a $1 million salary, he took $400,000 up front as a signing bonus and now stands to lose a part of only $700,000 if the lockout extends into the season.
Two notable examples of those missing the $2 million level because of their lockout bargaining are Orel Hershiser of Los Angeles and Frank Viola of the Mets. Each had a 1989 salary of $2,766,667, but this year each is listed at $1,966,667.
Because both the Player Relations Committee and the Players Association compute yearly salaries by pro-rating signing bonuses, Will Clark of San Francisco emerges from his four-year, $15 million contract with a 1990 salary of $2.25 million - $1.75 million in actual salary and a $500,000, or one-fourth, share of his $2 million signing bonus. If his entire signing bonus, paid up front, were added to this year's salary, Clark would lead the list at $3.75 million.
As it is, Clark is just another player in the $2 million circle.
The Brewers have the highest number of $2 million players - Yount, Paul Molitor and Ted Higuera. Seven other teams, including the Yankees with Don Mattingly and Dave Winfield, have two players each in that group.
The Mets, who have no $2 million players this year, have the most earning $1 million or more. Their economically elevated 11 are two more than the next highest total in the National League, the Dodgers' nine, and one more than the Kansas City Royals' 10.
The million-dollar Mets, who no longer include Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez, are: Viola, Dwight Gooden, Darryl Strawberry, Howard Johnson, Sid Fernandez, John Franco, Ron Darling, David Cone, Kevin McReynolds, Bob Ojeda and Mike Marshall.
The rich Royals are: Mark Davis, Mark Gubicza, Bob Boone, George Brett, Danny Tartabull, Bret Saberhagen, Storm Davis, Frank White, Kevin Seitzer and Bo Jackson.
Two other players could join the Millionaires Circle if they make their teams' opening-day roster, which they most likely will. Bill Gullickson of Houston and Charlie Leibrandt of Atlanta have contracts that guarantee them less than $1 million, but their income will rise to or beyond that level come opening day.
 
Feeling Like a Millionaire
 Joe Johnson isn't on the list, but the salary the Boston Red Sox have given him should make him feel like a millionaire.
Johnson, 28 years old, hasn't pitched in the major leagues since June 1987, before Toronto sent him to Syracuse of the International League. The Blue Jays removed him from their winter roster, and California drafted him. He pitched for Edmonton of the Pacific Coast League in 1988, then was invited to spring training with the Angels a year ago.
Johnson, however, had ruptured his Achilles tendon during the off season and tore it again the second day of camp (camps were open last spring). Released by the Angels at his request, the right-hander did his next pitching in the Mexican League this winter and caught the attention of several teams.
A resident of Plainville, Mass., Johnson worked out for the Red Sox and they offered him a contract. If he plays in the minor leagues, his salary will be $38,000. If he wins a job with the Red Sox, his salary will be $275,000 and he would be able to earn an additional $220,000 in bonuses based on points - 2 points for a start, 1 for a relief appearance.
That means that Johnson, who has a 20-18 career major league record, could make $495,000, a remarkable possibility for a player who has had a hiatus of nearly three years from the majors and has only two years and 10 days of major league service. David Cone, by contrast, had two years and 58 days of service and was coming off a 20-3 performance when the Mets signed him last winter for $332,500.
 
Mattingly Record Stands
 A Don Mattingly record has withstood another assault, and the season hasn't even started (it will start). For the third successive salary arbitration period, no one has cracked the $2 million barrier in a hearing and eclipsed the record $1,975,000 award Mattingly won in 1987.
Eleven players submitted figures of $2 million or more this year, but only one, Lonnie Smith, reached the hearing stage, and he lost. The other 10 players negotiated contracts. In the previous two years, a total of six players filed at $2 million or more, but only Andre Dawson went before an arbitrator and, like Smith, he lost.
The irony of the $2 million arbitration barrier is that Mattingly could have broken it in 1987, but eschewing the competitiveness he displays on the field, he chose to be conservative and settled for $25,000 less.
Despite the absence of a record-breaker this year, nine players gained awards of $1 million or more in hearings, raising to 23 the number at that level in the 15 years of arbitration.
Joe Hesketh of Montreal was the only player to have an arbitrator cut his salary this year. The pitcher dropped from $417,000 to $375,000, becoming the ninth player to suffer a pay cut in a hearing. Six other players agreed to cuts in negotiations - Rich Gedman of Boston, Mike Witt of California, Gary Ward of Detroit, Juan Nieves of Milwaukee, Jose Guzman of Texas and Don Carman of Philadelphia. Nieves and Guzman were injured last season.
Over all, players eligible for arbitration did not lose. They raised their economic standing from an average 1989 salary of $422,135 to $852,074.
The Pittsburgh Pirates had the most players go to hearings since 1974, the first year of arbitration, when the Oakland Athletics had nine players reach that stage.
One of those Oakland players was Jack Heidemann. He lost his case, so instead of getting what he wanted, the same salary he had made in 1973, $15,750, he had to take the Athletics' figure, a maximum 20 percent cut to $12,600.
 
Lockout History Revisited
 Seventeen years ago today, labor representatives of the owners and the players completed negotiations on a new agreement that ended the owners' first lockout of players from spring training camps. Players began arriving in their camps the next day, Feb. 26, and the season began as scheduled, on April 5.
That gave the players five weeks or more to get into in-season shape. The 1990 season is scheduled to open five weeks from tomorrow.
The 1973 agreement was the one that created salary arbitration, which is the thorniest issue in this year's negotiations. In debating the arbitration procedure, the owners at one point proposed that the maximum 20 percent salary cut not apply to players eligible for arbitration. That's the same proposal the owners made last Wednesday, only to snatch it off the table 24 hours later.
 
Some Labor Questions
 Two labor-related questions:
 First, why is Ron Darling of the Mets, a member of the players' negotiating committee and a New York resident, playing basketball and golf in Florida while other committee members, such as Paul Molitor, Phil Bradley, Scott Sanderson, Orel Hershiser, Tim Belcher and Matt Young, fly back and forth across the country to attend bargaining sessions in New York? David Cone, who neither is on the negotiating committee nor is the Mets' player representative, as Darling is, attended more meetings last week than his teammate has all month.
Second, how can the owners talk at the bargaining table about restoring players' trust in them when Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and chairman of the Player Relations Committee, withholds details of Robin Yount's new $9.6 million contract until every other arbitration case is either settled or heard? Molitor, Yount's teammate, who could have benefited from the terms, has declined to discuss the matter, but the Brewers apparently told him Yount's contract did not have an option year when, in fact, it does, at Yount's option.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES: Apartments as Investments;
Buyers Seek Bargains in Co-op Buildings

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
A GRADUAL realignment is under way in New York City in the ownership of renter-occupied apartments in co-op buildings.
Well-financed real estate investment firms that have converted many buildings from rental to co-op status are picking up the packages of apartments that banks have taken back from weakened sponsors. Or they are buying packages from sponsors themselves at steep discounts from the value of the apartments when vacant.
From the point of view of the resident co-op owners, the sales are a favorable development. With shares in stronger hands, there is less fear of default on maintenance payments. 
But they also show that despite a slower housing market generally, the investment appeal of apartments whose value cannot be realized until some uncertain time in the future still endures.
''You have to view the unsold apartments as a pack of zero coupon bonds that are being sold at a deep discount and have an unsure maturity date,'' said Charles Hack, president of Parkview Associates, a development and investment firm that has financed the conversion of 30 buildings with 5,000 apartments in New York City over 10 years.
''If the package is large enough you will have a certain number of 'bonds' maturing each year at an average rate.'' In addition, there is the prospect with inflation of a longterm appreciation in value of property generally.
The office of State Attorney General Robert Abrams says it is investigating 62 complaints of delinquencies in payments to co-ops, up from 40 a month ago. ''Some payments are being made,'' said Frederick K. Mehlman, assistant attorney general in charge of the Real Estate Financing Bureau. ''In some cases we will bring litigation. In other cases, we are trying to work things out with banks.''
A recent purchase by Parkview Associates illustrates why occupied apartments - at the right price - still look like an attractive investment to deep-pocket investors when the management capability is present. In January a group organized by Parkview bought a package of 10 renter-occupied apartments in a 35-unit East Side building, paying about $1 million. The apartments have a present vacanct value of about $5.2 million, Mr. Hack said.
The average rent for the occupied apartments is about $1,000 a month. The maintenance expense averages $1,500 a month. Mr. Hack and his associates intend to make up this deficit, running at a rate of $60,000 a year for the maintenance plus an additional $10,000 in management, insurance and upkeep and repair costs, in expectation of future gains.
Assuming a 5 percent turnover rate, apartments will become vacant on average once every two years. The investor looks forward to profits from resale averaging $180,000 a unit, even before figuring in the reduced fixed costs over time as the inventory shrinks and appreciation in market value. If there had been no deficit between the rent and maintenance cost, Parkview figures it would have had to pay $1.3 million for the 10 apartments, or 25 percent of vacancy value, instead of $1 million.
DEALING with institutions that have taken back unsold shares from a defaulting sponsor, Coronet Properties, one of the city's largest converters, has acquired a package of 134 occupied apartments at Glen Oaks Village in Queens and is negotiating for other packages. Coronet already owns and manages 3,000 occupied apartments in 40 New York City buildings.
The Stern Organization, a Manhattan brokerage, sold four packages of occupied garden apartments in Queens, with a total of 1,000 units, to investors from London last year, Erwin Stern, its principal, reported. The seller was Arthur G. Cohen Properties. And a national real estate company that has not previously invested in the city is understood to be examining the Time Equities portfolio of occupied apartments, estimated at 3,500. Time Equities is the conversion company that sent waves through the co-op marketplace when it reported a ''material change'' in its financial condition to the Attorney General.
The importance of all this for thousands of New Yorkers in co-op buildings still occupied by large numbers of renters is that it suggests that delinquencies in maintenance payments to co-ops may well be temporary. In some cases, co-ops with delinquency problems may attempt to seize the rents, or the shares themselves, from delinquent owners.
But eventually new investor buyers are likely to pick up the shares for occupied apartments that other investor-owners, or their lenders, are trying to sell.
''People like me are out there cherry-picking,'' said Mr. Hack.
AT the same time, the very presence of the cherry pickers in the marketplace is evidence of distress selling. In some case co-ops have mortgages that require debt payments that put maintenance costs too far beyond the rent income. And renters may constitute 50 to 75 percent of the occupancy in recent conversions.
The number of buildings affected are only a fraction of the 3,800 that have been converted either to co-ops or condominiums over the last 10 years. These buildings contain 270,900 apartments, of which about 131,400, or 48 percent, appear to be still renter occupied. Nearly all the rest - or 139,500 apartments - have been sold for owner-occupancy.
These owners, about half of whom live in Manhattan and a third in Queens, have a considerable stake in sustaining the health of the resale market for vacant apartments. And they will benefit if more renters in occupancy can be induced to buy. When the ownership of occupied apartments goes into new and stronger hands, a newly vigorous sales effort can be expected.
Over time, whether the current renters buy or not, most of the units will be vacated and sold for occupancy. Purchasers of large packages of apartments normally calculate that the overall turnover rate will be about 6 percent. If they own a large enough group of apartments purchased at a sufficient discount from market value, they expect ultimately to profit from resales.
Meanwhile, they hope that the combination of rising rents and favorable sales prices will induce more renter-occupants to buy.
Robert Cicchillo, president of Alexander Brett, formed two years ago to supervise sales and management of investor-owned apartments, gave the example of a one-bedroom renter-occupied apartment in the co-op at 14 Horatio Street, in Greenwich Village. It was offered to the tenant at an insider price of $76,500 six years ago, but not purchased. The outsider price at the time was $125,000.
Now the insider price will be $99,000 as part of a new offering to rent-stabilized tenants next month. The outsider value is estimated at $170,000, based on recent sales of comparable vacant units.
The rent has risen for the occupant by $128 to the present $561 a month since the conversion. The maintenance has risen only $30, to $619. For the tenant, the increase in housing costs would have been $156 if she had bought in 1984. If she buys this year it will be $58. She will still, of course, have to be willing to make the cash investment and take out a loan.
According to Mr. Cicchillo, sales to renters continue, if slowly. The company took over the management of 132 occupied apartments in the 350-unit Bell apartments on 218th Street near Corporal Kennedy Boulevard in Bayside, Queens, six months ago. It has made 14 sales since then, 12 of them to insiders. The shares are owned by one of the syndicates put together by Parkview Associates, for whom Alexander Brett manages 1,500 apartments in 30 buildings.
MEANWHILE, conversion sponsors with management capability still find it possible to put together investment groups for unsold apartments. The Ziegelman Organization, for example, packages renter-occupied apartments, after its initial sales in buildings it converts. In a typical situation a group of 40 with a vacancy value of about $4 million will be sold to an investor group for about $1 million.
Herbert L. Mendelson, a real estate lawyer with the firm of Herrick Feinstein in Manhattan, told of purchases he made of apartments in moderate-income neighborhoods with other lawyers in his firm and clients of the firm. The rent and maintenance expenses are roughly equivalent, he said.
When a renter vacates the apartment and it is sold, the investor gets his cash back, the Ziegelman Organization takes an equivalent amount, and the remainder is split 50-50, Mr. Mendelson said. While the renter is still in occupancy, the investor earns an 8 percent tax-deferred return and also accrues an additional 2 percent, which is paid after the sale. Vacancy prices typically range between $60,000 and $100,000.

HEADLINE: As Co-ops Spread, Discrimination Concerns Grow

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
AS more and more rental buildings in Brooklyn and Queens are converted into cooperatives, New York City's Commission on Human Rights is gearing up to tackle one of the stickiest of housing discrimination issues - the broad powers of co-op boards to reject would-be buyers without explanation.
Agency officials say they expect complaints of discrimination by co-op boards to increase as the conversions move increasingly into the middle-class reaches of Brooklyn and Queens, producing thousands of new affordable ownership opportunities for the city's large population of civil servants, teachers and middle managers, many of whom are minorities.
At the same time, officials said, the evidence of racial intolerance in predominantly white neighborhoods of Brooklyn and Queens has underscored the presence of racism in the city in recent years, as well as the need for city action to curtail it.
Craig Gurian, chief of the commission's enforcement division, cited the racially motivated firebombing of a black couple's new home in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn on Feb. 8, the racial killing of a black youth in that borough's Bensonhurst neighborhood last August and the white vigilante attack that led to the death of a black man in Howard Beach, Queens, in December 1986 as evidence that ''we still don't live in a city that is open to everyone.'' 
City officials have determined that racism motivated the firebombing of the two-family house at 1254 East 91st Street in Canarsie that Wilfred Phillips and his wife Agnis recently bought for $200,000. Neighborhood groups and city agencies are raising money to help the Phillipses repair the house.
The Bensonhurst killing prompted the Human Rights Commission to ''shake up'' the office and direct more energy to open-housing efforts, Mr. Gurian said. And one way to open the door to peaceful integration, he went on, is to counter the widely held belief that co-op boards are omnipotent and unchallengeable in their decisions to admit or deny would-be buyers.
''As you get more and more people who haven't been in the co-op management business before, I think you have an additional risk, and that is one of the reasons we are prepared to go out and meet with co-op industry people and provide training sessions for new co-ops,'' Mr. Gurian said. ''We are saying to people, 'Look, you may not know this and you may not like it, but here are some things you're just not allowed to do.' ''
Just last month, the Human Rights Commission levied its heaviest housing discrimination fine ever, $52,000, against the board of a Jackson Heights, Queens, co-op that, the commission ruled, had rejected a woman because her two children were black. The board was also ordered to approve the sale to the woman, Mary Smith Shoyinka.
While aggrieved co-op seekers have won discrimination cases against co-op boards in state and Federal courts before, the Shoyinka case against the co-op at 35-45 82d street was the first one handed down by the Human Rights Commission's internal judicial system of administrative law judges. The co-op is appealing the award.
The award money will be divided between Ms. Shoyinka and the seller of the $70,000 apartment, Pat Gavin, and was based in part on the amount Ms. Gavin lost because of the delay in selling the unit and Ms. Shoyinka's continued rental costs while waiting to move into the co-op.
Most complaints of discrimination by co-op boards are settled before they reach the administrative law level, Mr. Fisher said. That the Shoyinka case was the first simply reflects that, as the number of charges of co-op discrimination increase as co-ops become affordable to more people, the number that go all the way to trial is also likely to mount.
Discrimination complaints from middle-class co-op seekers in Brooklyn and Queens are a far cry from those involving expensive apartments and often prominent people - both buyers and board members -in some of Manhattan's leading co-ops.
Aside from persistent and widely credited reports of some buildings keeping Jewish owners to a quota, board acceptances and rejections at the upper reaches of both price and social status are often based on personal friendships and club or church memberships.
IN any case, officials of the Human Rights Commission said, rich and important people do not tend to sue when they believe they are being discriminated against, but look elsewhere for housing. Middle class families, with less money and fewer choices, seem to be less inclined to swallow a rejection.
''Think of buildings built in the 1920's, whether in Brooklyn or Queens, which are essentially segregated parts of the city, where there is a high percentage of tenants who are elderly and, in many cases, an all-white building,'' said Mr. Gurian.
''Then the co-op comes along and one of the things it produces is a lot more movement in an area. A tenant sees he can buy an apartment for $25,000 as an insider and flip it for $60,000 and suddenly that little corner of the world meets the rest of the city.''
A similar scenario can be played out in already integrated rental areas, said Harvey Fisher, director of fair housing at the commission.
''It's not that these neighborhoods were closed to renters,'' he said, ''but as they turn co-op it becomes easier to insulate yourself because boards and board members in co-ops can hide behind the shared values system of one another. Where the values are racist or homophobic or whatever, they can buffer themselves.''
The officials worry that many new co-op owners who thought nothing of living with blacks or homosexuals as renters may take a different attitude toward having them as fellow-owners.
Sponsors of co-ops struggling for sales and higher prices may believe that the way to ''upgrade'' a building economically is to discourage minorities, Mr. Gurian said. He said there was some evidence of this trend in Prospect Heights and lower Park Slope, in Brooklyn.
''People who have just bought their apartment may say, 'Wow, I bought it, I own it, and if a black person comes into the building, how can I be sure that the value will hold its own?' '' Mr. Fisher said.
Under current law, the commission is forbidden to impose punitive damages on landlords or co-op boards that have been found guilty of discrimination, but it may recover out-of-pocket expenses for plaintiffs and impose awards for pain and suffering. It may also mandate a sale or rental.
People who believe they have been discriminated against may also sue in Federal Court under the Federal Fair Housing Act and with the state's Division of Human Rights, which has its offices in New York City.
The state and Federal laws are less inclusive than city's antidiscrimination laws, however, because they have a shorter list of protected groups.
All three governments guard against housing discrimination based on race, color, creed, sex, national origin or handicap. The state and city antidiscrimination laws also cover marital status and age, while the Federal law was recently amended to ban discrimination on the basis of ''familial status,'' meaning the presence of children, in housing. Only the city also protects homosexuals and people who are infected with HIV, the virus that is the precursor to AIDS.
One or more of these categories must be alleged when bringing a housing discrimination complaint against a co-op board because the boards can be compelled to discuss their reasons for rejecting someone only if the turned-down buyer is in a protected class.
Armando Martinez, special assistant to the state Human Rights Commissioner for Fair Housing, said that what the city is finding in Brooklyn and Queens his division sees in the rest of Long Island.
''There's no question about it,'' he said. ''We have done several studies on this, and it appears clear that as the co-ops move out to Long Island, the housing becomes more expensive and that leaves a lot of minorities out and a certain group can be turned down by the co-op board because of discrimination.''
The Federal Fair Housing Act has been the favorite venue for settling charges of race or sex discrimination in housing, officials say, because since it was amended in 1988 there have been no limits on punitive or compensatory damages that may be awarded.
Last Monday, the largest housing discrimination settlement ever was announced when a Los Angeles apartment house landlord agreed to pay $450,000 to Allan Lopez, Rob Beaumont and the West Side Fair Housing Council in a settlement of a charge of discrimination brought by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
In 1984, the Federal Court in Manhattan handed down a landmark racial discrimination case in favor of Bertha Rogers, a black city school teacher and real estate investor, and against the co-op board at 66-36 Yellowstone Avenue in Forest Hills, Queens.
The court awarded Ms. Rogers $26,000 for expenses after it found that the board had violated her rights in turning down her application for ownership when it refused to believe she had accumulated $250,000 in savings lawfully. Since that ruling, co-op boards have been warned by their lawyers not to inquire too closely into the source of would-be buyers' resources.
THE New York State Attorney General's figures on conversions tell the story of the spread of cooperatives into the outer boroughs. In 1984, there were more co-op conversions in Manhattan, 10,200, than in Brooklyn and Queens combined, with 9,600. In 1988, the last year for which complete figures are available, Brooklyn saw 10,500 apartments turned into co-ops, Queens had 9,000, and Manhattan trailed both with 8,300.
The Bronx has seen a similar increase, from 700 units in 1984 to 3,200 in 1988, while the numer of conversions on Staten Island, where home ownership has been the tradition, the figure has been fairly constant at under 200 units a year converted.
The city's evolving housing market has introduced another arena for the Human Rights Commission, Mr. Gurian noted. That is the rapid increase in the number of investor-owned condominium and co-op apartments - there are about 100,000 scattered around the city at present - that are being privately rented and sold on an unadvertised, word-of-mouth basis by ''mini-landlords.''
The more apartment ownership is fragmented among many owners, some owning only one or two units, Mr. Gurian said, the less open the market for these properties is likely to be to groups facing prejudice and discrimination.
Although most of the commission's open-housing work still focuses on rental housing, its investigators have in recent months received a number of complaints from rejected co-op buyers complaining of discrimination.
Jan Edler and his wife, Janet Simmons, won a decision by one of the commission's five law judges, Cynthia W. Rountree, on Jan. 3 against Concord Village, in downtown Brooklyn on the ground that the co-op had rejected them because they were not married at the time.
Under the commission's system, the administrative law judge's decision is a recommendation to the full 15-member commission for a final order. The loser can then appeal to the state courts. The commission often orders a board to put a ''hold'' on a disputed apartment, pending the outcome of appeals, when it finds in favor of a rejected plaintiff.
''We applied for this apartment because we had the money, and the last thing we expected was to have a financial problem with the board,'' Mr. Edler said. ''But they they turned us down and they just stonewalled us,'' he continued. ''They said, 'We don't have to give you a reason, you can ask until you're blue in the face and we don't feel like giving you a second chance.' We thought about it and decided that they had no legitimate reason, and that it must have been because we weren't married at the time.''
The Edlers, who have since married, eventually paid $50,000 for a co-op in the former Ex-Lax building on Atlantic Avenue in downtown Brooklyn, more than the $43,000 price of the Concord Village unit and, to them, further proof that they had the money to be reliable members of the first building.
''I think it's clear that we had the funding to close on the apartment at Concord Village, and that that was just an excuse,'' Mr. Edler, a research scientist at New York University, said. ''It's obvious that that was just an excuse. It's also conceivable that they just made a bad call, but they're not allowed to do that. Marital status is protected like anything else, and you just can't make a mistake on something like that and get away it with it.''
But Adrienne Baker, president of the board of Concord Village, said in an interview that a co-op board must look beyond whether a buyer can assemble enough money to close on a purchase, It also must determine whether the would-be buyer's income is sufficient for a long-term ownership in a building whose future costs are hard to predict.
''IT looked like they were depending on future salary to make the closing costs, and everything else was borrowed,'' she said. ''We have to ask ourselves if there is an assessment or the maintenance goes up 5 percent, what do they do? They may say they'll be making more two years from now, but can they be sure? A co-op board has to consider such things.''
As to the charge of marital discrimination, Ms. Baker had a straightforward response: She is also unmarried, and she shares apartment ownership with her male companion.
''This whole thing is honestly upsetting to all of us, because we know we think of ourselves to be nondiscriminatory and committed to human rights.''
In another case, commission investigators on Feb. 8 held their first hearing in a complaint by Sharon Planer and her husband, Clint Bowie, that the co-op at 85-10 34th Avenue, Jackson Heights, Queens, had rejected them as purchasers because Mr. Bowie is black. The Planer-Bowie case points up the difficulty of establishing bias under a system that gives co-op boards broad powers to pick and choose buyers without offering any explanation for rejections.
Co-ops have successfully resisted several attempts to legislate accountability into the purchaser-approval system with the argument that cooperatives are essentially partnerships that depend on social cohesiveness and cooperation to work.
Clifford Chew, a Great Neck, L.I., lawyer who represents the board at 85-10 34th Avenue, maintained in an interview that the biracial couple had alienated the board by being ''pushy'' and ''obnoxious'' and that racism had played no part in the decision to reject them.
''I don't want to wave the flag, because an accusation of bigotry cuts to the quick,'' Mr. Chew said. ''But this board has to ask, can a co-op board ever turn down a minority without facing a charge of racial bias? If you say you're looking for people who will blend in or fit in, you run into the discrimination trap, but that is really what you are looking for - people with whom you will be comfortable in running a large housing operation.''
Mr. Chew argued that one of the first tests of a co-op is whether the people in it can cooperate with one another. ''Most of the problems co-ops run into will have a social element,'' he said. ''If you're talking about raising the maintenance, you need someone who will be cooperative, if you're talking about a noise problem, you need someone who will see your point of view.''
Ms. Planer rejected the assertion that she had been uncooperative at the board hearings on the couple's application to buy.
''I swear to you, I really felt like they were doing everything they could to destroy me,'' Ms. Planer said. ''They even said they didn't like the way I dressed and that I looked like an unmade bed.''
Mr. Gurian said his department faces a widespread public view that co-op boards are unassailable, while in fact, he said, the boards may be required to explain their decisions if the commission suspects the kind of discrimination proscribed by law.
''The biggest problem we have is getting people to come forward in co-op cases,'' he said.
''If you ask people in the street, they'll tell you a co-op board can accept or reject for any reason, and that's not true. They can only accept or reject for any legal reason, and discrimination is not legal.''
 
FILING A DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT
To file a housing discrimination complaint with the New York City Commission on Human Rights, a person may make an allegation in person or over the telephone based on the ''information and belief'' that an offense was committed by a landlord or co-op board. Following an investigation, commission officials will either decide that there is probable cause for prosecution before an administrative law judge, or reject the complaint as lacking probable cause.
There is an emphasis on mediation during the investigation, and many cases are settled at this stage. Those that go before the judge are tried by normal court procedure; the judge can dismiss the complaint or recommend a finding and an order to the full commission, which rarely rejects the recommendations and often goes beyond them. No fees are involved.
Besides ordering a sale or rental and damages for pain and suffering and out-of-pocket expenses for a successful complainant, the judge will normally require the board or landlord to take special steps to rectify the discrimination that led to the complaint.
The commission's offices are at 52 Duane Street in lower Manhattan. Call 964-7000 to make fair-housing or public- accommodation complaints.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: A Film Warning;
Perilous Play on Elevators

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
One fad that appears to be gaining momentum among the young in urban areas is climbing atop elevators and riding them up and down the shafts in high-rise buildings.
Once regarded as little more than a prank, this practice is now regarded as extremely dangerous; last year three youths were killed and 42 were injured on these joyrides just in public housing in New York City.
In the last five years, 10 children have been killed and 122 injured in the city's public housing despite the formation of an Elevator Vandalism Squad by the Housing Police of the New York City Housing Authority. Even the installation in many apartment buildings of closed-circuit television monitors and electric eyes that are intended to alert resident managers has been unable to stop the practice. 
In a further effort intended to call attention to the dangers of playing atop or even in elevators, the Housing Authority has just released a 20-minute film called ''Children Are Too Young To Die'' which graphically depicts the harm that this type of play can cause.
''We hope the film will show youngsters in no uncertain terms that playing with these elevators is often playing with injury and death,'' said Emanuel P. Popolizio, chairman of the authority. ''We also hope the film will alert parents to the fact that children are in real danger when they use elevators for purposes other than those for which they are intended.''
Copies of the film, which was written by Val Coleman, director of public information for the authority, and produced by Marc Cerutti, an independent filmmaker, are being made available to the city's Board of Education, as well as to civic and community groups in the five boroughs. Copies of the film may be ordered by telephoning the Housing Authority at 306-3322.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Columbus Avenue;
'Mom-and-Pops' Are Yielding to a New Makeover

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
COLUMBUS AVENUE, which remakes itself every few years, is in the middle of another transformation, marked by a high number of vacancies, lower rents, frequent turnover and the loss of the very stores and restaurants that once epitomized the avenue.
Three neighboring establishments that have done about a century's worth of business among them - the Cherry Restaurant, Grossinger's Home Bakery and Putumayo clothing store - face a shaky future in their present quarters. The Cherry will lose its lease in three days and may be out of business in four months. Grossinger's and Putumayo have other shops, but may disappear from their longtime location at 76th Street.
All three commercial tenants in the Aylsmere apartment house believe they are being squeezed out to accommodate a single business, perhaps a Gap clothing store. 
''To eliminate this section of the block is to destroy the backbone of the neighborhood,'' said Herb Grossinger, who runs the bakery that was founded in 1935 by his parents, Ernest and Isabella. ''To make a go of it, I would have to raise prices tremendously. It's difficult to raise prices on cakes. They're not like Gucci shoes.''
Richard Nishikawa, who took over the Cherry Restaurant in 1966, said he would probably stay open on a month-to-month basis through June, when summer vacations begin to cut into business anyway. ''Maybe that's a good time to quit,'' he said. ''I'm not too well myself. I want to take it easy.''
Both Mr. Nishikawa and Mr. Grossinger were around long before the quiche-fueled gentrification of Columbus Avenue that began in the mid-70's. Putumayo, which has apparel and accessories inspired by folk art, arrived 10 years ago. Its president and founder, Dan Storper, said, ''The implication is that we're all going to be booted out, one way or other, if the Gap signs a deal.''
The issue is not strictly about rent. ''My landlord has been very fair with me over the years,'' Mr. Grossinger said. That sentiment was echoed by Mr. Storper, who added: ''The fair market value appears to be $100 a square foot. We're prepared to pay that.'' But no such choice exists. ''They are not going to renew the lease,'' Mr. Nishikawa said, ''because they are negotiating with people who are going to take over the whole space.''
It is hard to find out what is going on behind the scenes. The Aylsmere is managed by Janoff & Olshan. A man at that office, who refused to give his name, said that ''at the moment, nothing is happening.'' He would not elaborate, saying that the person who could was out of town for 10 days. Before he could be asked much else, the man hung up.
A spokesman at Gap headquarters in San Francisco said the company did not discuss store openings until construction started.
Last year, a Gap was being built in the large space on the north side of 76th Street that was once Dobson's restaurant, another neighborhood institution that has vanished. One of the owners of that building, Dennis Shachnow, said he still has a lease with the Gap and that ''they've been paying their rent nice and promptly.'' He said the work was only ''temporarily stopped.''
Temporary or not, the effect is depressing. The large deserted storefront is covered with plywood boards and a crazy quilt of posters, contributing to the rather forsaken atmosphere that seems to characterize the whole avenue, particularly at night, when darkened shop windows stand out dismally.
Of 239 storefronts in the mile between 66th and 86th Streets, 13 percent - 31 spaces - are vacant, at least for the moment. In a similar count made in July 1987, 18 storefronts stood empty.
The situation is not as simple as what the passer-by sees. Leases have been signed for a number of these empty spots and they may be back in business soon. For example, what was once Miss Grimble's restaurant and cheesecake shop, near 74th Street, now appears vacant but will be a Chase Manhattan Bank annex by mid-year.
The actual vacancy rate may be closer to 5 or 6 percent, said Robert C. Quinlan, a major owner and developer on the avenue who is also president of Walker Malloy, a management and brokerage concern.
ON the other hand, vacancies or potential vacancies may be closer to 18 percent, says Steven B. Greenberg of the Greenberg Group of Hewlett, L.I., which advises retail chains on site selection. He said the citywide rate was less than 10 percent.
''Columbus Avenue has been overrated from the start,'' Mr. Greenberg said. ''It survived through an image. Columbus Avenue, more than any other retailing street in New York, has an enormous rollover of tenants. The volume of business does not support the rents that are being quoted.''
The chairman of Community Board 7, Robert Kupferman, said Columbus had once been compared to Madison Avenue, as the commercial thoroughfare closest to Central Park. ''A lot of fancy boutiques were being told that Columbus was the hot, new Madison Avenue,'' he said. ''But Broadway, midtown and department stores were more typically where West Siders would shop.''
''Broadway has remained more healthy and more fully tenanted,'' said Alan Victor, director of retail leasing at the Lansco Corporation, a commercial brokerage. ''What they tried to create on Columbus was more fashionable and more chic, but it's not Madison Avenue and they couldn't support it.''
Borrowing from Mark Twain, however, Mr. Quinlan insisted that any report of Columbus Avenue's death would be greatly exaggerated. ''Stores aren't doing so well anywhere in Manhattan,'' he said. ''To single out Columbus Avenue isn't accurate.''
''There's a great tendency to get more discouraged than the situation warrants,'' Mr. Shachnow said.
Nonetheless, Mr. Quinlan said, rents were down to about $100 a square foot from $125 two years ago. He said a store that might once have paid $10,000 a year rent for every foot of frontage on the avenue would now be paying closer to $5,000. Even if the vacancy rate is only 5 or 6 percent, as Mr. Quinlan said, that would be a considerable increase from the 1 or 2 percent of recent years.
Mr. Quinlan sees the future of Columbus Avenue more in ''simple, unflamboyant'' clothing stores than in the ''trendy, experimental'' boutiques of years past. ''I think the high-style aspect of Columbus will fade a bit,'' Mr. Quinlan said, ''and there will be more normal, conventional clothes, in a price range where you can spend $50 to $100 for something off the rack.''
''There are some national retailers coming,'' Mr. Greenberg said, ''and that will be helpful because they have staying power. If the revolving-door syndrome of tenants continues, then the problem is going to heighten and the vacancy factor will increase.''
The prospect of big national retailers is not one that cheers Mr. Storper, however. ''It's almost becoming mall-ification,'' he said. ''You can go the Stamford mall and see the same kinds of stores that will appear on Columbus. The Gap and the Limited don't have the soul of community stores that have grown over time.''
Grossinger's, for instance, specializes in a praline ice-cream cake that has been served as bombe glace in fine French restaurants. The Cherry, which has been around more than 40 years, offers eclectic and reasonably priced fare, with teriyaki, chow mein, veal cutlet parmigiana or chopped sirloin steak (for $6.50) on the menu.
And it offers something else. ''I'm from a small town in the South and this was the last small-town thing I had to cling to,'' said the illustrator Mel Odom, who lives nearby. ''Columbus Avenue has gotten so art-directed. This was the last holdout against that, the last place where you didn't have to worry that you weren't dressed right.''
The Cherry, he said ''was like my kitchen,'' a place so comfortable and accommodating that he could - and did - spend hours there, sketching or reading or joining his college friends for a weekly Thursday-night reunion.
Mr. Odom's decade-long patronage is not unusual. ''Most of the weekday evening customers are steady customers who have been coming for years and years,'' Mr. Nishikawa said. But as his neighbor, Mr. Grossinger said: ''It doesn't matter how long you're in business. When they decide they don't want you any more, that's it. The end.''

HEADLINE: Valuations

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The fact that property tax assessments on major office buildings have not increased as sharply this year as in the recent past, as reported in ''A Slower Climb in Valuations for Office Buildings'' on Jan. 28, may be slight comfort to the owners of these properties as well as their tenants.
Commercial tenants, most of whom bear the burden of tax escalations, will continue to pay heavily for the privilege of doing business in New York City while small homeowners pay increasingly less of the city's tax levy and far less than their suburban neighbors.
From the writer's vantage point as an attorney specializing in property tax review, our concern continues to be the fundamental inequity of a system that blatantly favors homeowners at the expense of multifamily residential landlords as well as all commercial property owners. 
State law bars annual assessment increases of more than 6 percent for one- to three-family homes and limits annual increases on four- to 10-family dwellings to no more than 8 percent. Increases in assessment for all other property are unlimited. The law allows for assessment at whatever fraction of full value the city chooses, requiring only the same fraction to be used within each of four classes of property.
As a result, multifamily residential and commercial property is assessed on average at a level nearly five times higher than homes. Though the law was intended to preserve relative class shares as they existed in 1981, subsequent amendments have destroyed this concept thereby reducing the homeowner share of taxes by more than 15 percent between 1981 and 1989.
Moreover, as documented in a recent report by New York State's Deputy Comptroller for New York City there are gross disparities in assessment within the same classes of property, and properties in poorer neighborhoods often are assessed at higher proportions of market value than their counterparts in more affluent areas.
As the new city administration unveils its plans for higher taxes it might first re-examine the present assessment system and its increasingly negative effect on the city's economy, the unfairness of which could easily be corrected by assessment of all real property on the single standard of full market value.

HEADLINE: Teachers Say Yesterday's Texts Can't Keep Pace in Today's World

BYLINE: By CHARLOTTE LIBOV

 BODY:
LAST September, when students returned to Granby High School, they were greeted with brand-new social studies textbooks. ''If only we had waited a year,'' said Jeanette W. Wiggin, the school system's director of curriculum and instruction. Within months, the textbooks, which cost $16,000, became outdated by the sweeping changes in the world, especially in Eastern Europe.
School districts throughout Connecticut were caught with suddenly outdated books.
''Even before all this was happening, textbooks were out of date before they were printed,'' said Edward Bourque, Fairfield's Assistant Superintendent. ''But now, you're looking at a 40- or 45-year history which was completely destroyed in a very short period, and it's going to continue.'' 
Because of the sweep of world events - including the growing democratization of the Soviet bloc, the changing role of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union itself and the crumbling of the Berlin wall -social studies teachers are scrambling to update their curriculums.
The social studies consultant for the State Department of Education, Daniel W. Gregg, said he has long believed that textbooks should not be relied upon as the main source of material, and the recent changes have proved the point.
 
Overnight Change
''When events like these happen, it shows how much we rely on textbooks,'' he said. ''It points out a real problem - that in an area like social studies, the changes are very, very rapid. It can change overnight.''
Although some changes always occur between the time a textbook is written and distributed, the rapid pace of today's events has gone far beyond that, Mr. Gregg said. ''In this case, we're talking about a change in perspective,'' he said. ''Probably most teachers grew up with the cold war. It's just an accepted fact. And it's difficult for all of us to believe, right at this moment, that it's over.''
Like other educators interviewed, Mr. Gregg said he does not believe schools will discard their textbooks. Instead, he said, the books will be supplemented by newspapers and magazines. How are texbook publishers coping with the rush of history? ''We're furiously editing,'' said Sharon Barton, executive editor of the social studies division of Scott, Foresman & Company in Evanston, Ill. The company publishes ''History and Life: The World and Its People,'' the high school history textbook used in Granby.
The 1990 edition of the book had just been published when news came that the Communist Party would relinquish its monopoly role in the Soviet Union. ''We had to go into a reprint,'' Ms. Barton said. ''We wouldn't normally update unless it's cataclysmic. And this is really cataclysmic.''
The textbook company generally does a thorough revision of its textbook every three years. It has rushed updates into print only upon events like the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the resignation of President Richard Nixon, she said.
Addison-Wesley Publishing is distributing a newsletter that focuses on the changes in Eastern European to supplement its textbook ''World History Traditions and New Directions,'' which is used in Norwalk. The company had made newsletters to accompany its economics text, ''but we've never had to do one for history before,'' said Thomas Prehn, executive editor of the publisher's social studies division in Menlo Park, Calif.
Another textbook used in Norwalk, ''Links Across Time and Place,'' is published by McDougal, Littel in Evanston, Ill. The book, published in 1988, was due for a revision, said Mercedes Bailey, product manager for social studies. ''We took out a picture of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and substituted a picture Lech Walesa addressing the U.S. Congress,'' she said. The new edition also expands coverage of Nelson and Winnie Mandela, although news of Mr. Mandela's release from prison in South Africa came too late to be included, she said.
Despite the publishers' efforts to stay current, the speed of changes in the world portends the end of the textbook as a classroom fixture, said Lee Hay, the 1983 National Teacher of the Year, who is now the Assistant Superintendant in East Lyme.
 
Images Replace Words
''The written word is being replaced by the image,'' Mr. Hay said. ''I think this will lead to radical changes in teaching. But many teachers are very uncomfortable with that. There's almost a guilty feeling if you show a film.''
Edward Welsh, who teaches world and American history at Norwalk High School, does not believe the textbook will become extinct.
''You can't eliminate the textbook,'' he said. ''If you teach history, you need to teach the sequence of events.''
 
'Throw the Textbooks Away'
But he acknowledged, ''as for world politics, there isn't a single textbook on the market today that can do it.''
''If you're talking about the Soviet Union, my God! You can throw the textbook away,'' Mr. Welsh said.
With the help of newspapers, he said, he has become accustomed to devoting up to half of his class periods to events that happened the night before.
''It's an unbelievable time,'' he said. ''I really can't describe it. If you study history, one of the things that you stay with is that the really dominant people, the Alexander the Greats and the Napoleons, shape the world. There is no question that 200 or 300 years from now, Gorbachev will be considered one of those. The students can see that, and it opens their eyes.''
Frank Gawle, the 1988 Connecticut Teacher of the Year and the chairman of the social studies department at Enfield High School, said the recent events took him by surprise.
 
Using Other Sources
''Last September, no one in our wildest dreams could have predicted what would happen,'' he said.
Next year, his school will offer a new course, ''The World in Crisis,'' which will deal with the changes, he said. It will use textbooks ''only as background.'' he said.
''I've always believed that if you operate with a single textbook, you're in trouble,'' he said. ''There isn't one with a decent history that deals with Vietnam.''
Carolyn Rosenfield, Norwalk's Assistant Superintendent for curriculum and instruction, said: ''Keeping textbooks up to date is becoming more frightening budget-wise, given the astronomical cost of them. We have to use other sources to fill in between the cracks.''
''Teachers are very creative, so they will be able to supplement these materials,'' Mrs. Rosenfield said.
Francis Lynch, a social studies teacher at Granby High School, said one of the school's textbooks talks about the hard-line approach of the Soviet Union.
''There is chapter entitled 'The Communist World Fragmented,' '' he said. ''But what they're talking about is the fragmentation between the Soviet Union and China. Nothing is said about the Soviet Union and its satellites.''
 
Good Guys and Bad Guys
Dennis Lobo, another Granby High School social studies teacher, who is also the curriculum coordinator, said, ''The approach these textbooks take between the United States and the Soviet Union is they're the bad guys and we're the good guys.''
Mr. Lynch, who also teaches American history at Central Connecticut State University, said he is encountering the same problem with his college textbooks. ''There's a time lag on whatever level you're functioning,'' he said.
''In my advanced high school class, I'm using a college textbook which talks about the thaw between American and Soviet relations but simply didn't anticipate the speed of the change,'' he said. ''So what's happened in the last year or so simply isn't there.''
At Field Publications, the Middletown company that produces My Weekly Reader and other national news publications for students, the recent events ''certainly created chaos around here, because we've had to pull a lot of things apart,'' said Patricia Sears, a company spokeswoman.
Louise Butts, My Weekly Reader's managing editor, said: ''It's been frustrating. The news happens so quickly, and its almost immediately seen on television. There's no way in our printed schedule we can do that.''
The articles, she said, try to anticipate news events by ''raising the question of what might happen.'' For example, a January article on the Berlin wall asked, ''Could there be a united Germany?''
For Mr. Gregg, at the State Education Department, the fact that textbooks are now at least partially outdated is ''a lesson in itself.''
''There is no question in my mind that, 5 or 10 years from now, when you pick up the history textbooks, the last half of 1989 and the first part of 1990 will be very well covered,'' he said.

GRAPHIC: Photo; Sweeping changes in world events have left many school texts outdated, especially in references to Eastern Europe and South Africa. The pace of events has brought into question the role of textbooks as a main source of material in the classroom.

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT OPINION;
Parents Must Demand Better Principals

BYLINE: By Herbert F. Pandiscio; Herbert. F. Pandiscio has been Superintendent of Schools in Avon for 22 years.

 BODY:
MOST recent education reform has been a ''top down'' effort. The governors of several states and a handful of education commissioners have taken the lead in addressing problems in the schools. In Connecticut, both the Governor and the Commissioner of Education are acknowledged leaders in this area.
Most of the reform efforts address four areas: improvement in teacher salaries, tougher certification requirements, closer adherence to existing education laws and retraining for senior teachers. All these are vitally important to school improvement. These reforms have done much to attract and keep the most qualified teachers and have helped to build public confidence in our schools. 
But the inner workings of the schools, like those of private industry, are often not known to the clients. While information about the schools is more readily available, experience tells me that much of what parents anf the public learn about the schools is not very accurate.
For example, few parents understand the importance of the principal in the development of teachers. Most of the educational research in the 1980's indicates that the building principal has more influence in shaping reform than any other person or group in a school district. But parents usually know far less about the principal's qualifications than they do about their children's teachers.
Why should parents be concerned about the quality of school administrators when many local boards and state education departments are concerned only with the teachers? It's difficult to imagine a major corporation being careless in hiring a manager for an important profit center. Yet many school boards have an inadequate system for insuring that they hire the best candidates for administrative jobs.
I am not suggesting that governing boards have hired incompetent administrators. But they often hire people who are marginally competent because there are so few outstanding administrators available.
Why? The recent enhancement of teachers' salaries and benefits, without a corresponding improvement for administrators, has dramatically closed the economic gap between the two groups. A teacher employed for 185 a year days generally earns more for each day than an administrator. Consequently, many teachers who once aspired to administration no longer do. Coupled with the aging administrative population, this poses a threat to our schools' success.
Local boards and state officials have been remiss in not improving the relative economic status of administrators. Parents tend to believe that administrators have been given the same enhancements as teachers, when this is often not so. Unless action is taken to deal with the shrinking pool of qualified school administrators, public education will face a leadership crisis by the time the present kindergarten classes enter the upper elementary grades.
Once that pool of qualified school administrators has been expanded, administrators must be trained to lead effectively in the new millennium. Teachers are beginning to be treated as professionals. Accordingly, they demand an improved administrative climate in which to work.
Today's teachers want a principal who provides the opportunity for them to be part of a collaborative setting. Gone are the days of dominant, arbitrary leadership, when the principal viewed himself as the school's only visionary.
Creativity, vision, leadership, and brilliance reside in all educators, teacher and administrator alike. Therefore, each person must play a role. Principals, to be effective, must master the skills of collaboration and facilitation. They must demonstrate brilliance, not at pronouncing answers to questions only they have created, but in creating a climate in which all professionals are nurtured.
Where are these principals? Some manage our schools now. Most are yet to be trained, and they will be difficult to hire because the demand for their talents will far exceed the supply.
Parents, particularly those with preschool children or those with youngsters in the early grades, must demand better qualified administrators for their schools. Parents must work with their school boards, urging them to establish administrators' salaries that attract only superior candidates.
Whenever there is an administrative vacancy, parents must ask their board of education to define the criteria for hiring, to establish an attractive economic package, and to give assurances that assessment tools are in place to check candidates' credentials. Parents must know that funds are available to assure that the new administrator continues to receive training while working in the community. And parents should require that an effective and fair assessment process is in place to measure the principal's work.
Boards must place emphasis on hiring administrators who have mastered the skills of collaboration and who demonstrate the ability to work effectively with others. And like businesses, schools must underwrite new administrators' moving expenses.
Unless parents take the initiative in working for these improvements, their children will not be able to derive the maximum benefits from their teachers. Without outstanding leadership, there can be no outstanding schools.

HEADLINE: No One Wants Affordable Housing

 BODY:
I think it is very humorous when pro-development speakers invoke affordable housing to justify the latest development action. Who is kidding whom? 
Affordable housing, by its very nature, implies high-density development. Can any rational developer hope to get approvals for a high density subdivision in an area that is already recognized as environmentally sensitive? Developers don't want affordable housing, adjacent landowners don't want affordable housing, potential buyers (neighbors) don't want affordable housing, Long Islanders don't want affordable housing. I wish everyone would stop using the specter of ''affordable housing'' to justify their own motives. When will someone actually do anything?
I am one of the statistics. I am a single white male, 28, with a master's degree. I have a good job, yet I make less than $30,000. Mandatory dual income (no longer an option, not even during child-rearing years) seems to be my only hope for housing.
I'm not whining. My future and direction seem very clear. If politicians, developers, contractors, banks, and all others involved take concrete action toward addressing the affordable housing issue, why should young educated professionals stay? The lure of beautiful New York beaches, becoming more polluted, more crowded, less accessible, can only stretch so far.

HEADLINE: Port Authority's Incinerator Role Questioned

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
A $300 MILLION solid-waste incinerator being built in Essex County with fund provided by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is drawing criticism on environmental and financial grounds as the massive waste-to-energy plant nears completion.
Citizens' groups and environmental organizations say that use of the incinerator will discourage recycling and that its emissions will have a serious impact on the area's already poor air quality.
The Department of the Public Advocate has criticized the project on technical and financial grounds, and a coalition of community and labor organizations from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut is questioning the role of the Port Authority as the developer and principal source of financing.
In addition, a Newark-based citizens' group has raised questions about licensing for the corporation that will operate the incinerator.
Supporters of the project, however, maintain that the state-of-the-art resource recovery plant will have minimal impact on the environment, will lower solid-waste disposal costs for Essex County residents and will, once fully operational in late 1990, generate valuable electrical energy along with a handsome return on the Port Authority's $300 million investment. 
The debate surrounding the project underscores the delicate balance that must be reached between public and private interests in dealing with the problem of solid-waste disposal in New Jersey, officials say. That problem, which by legislative mandate rests squarely on the shoulders of county officials, is now approaching crisis proportions, as landfills close and disposal costs soar.
The Essex County Resource Recovery Facility, in the Ironbound section of Newark just north of Exit 15W of the New Jersey Turnpike, is expected to process up to 2,300 tons of refuse a day, generating 60,000 kilowatts of electrical energy - enough to serve about 37,500 homes - when operating at peak capacity.
That, county officials say, along with the fact that only a fraction of the original volume of refuse will have to be placed in a landfill, will substantially lower the cost of solid-waste disposal for Essex County residents. The current cost to dispose of one ton of refuse is more than $100; once the plant is fully operational and all Essex County trash is processed there, the cost is expected to drop to $65 a ton.
Although critics question the reliability of those estimates, local officials believe that they are accurate.
''These are real solid numbers,'' said Nicholas R. Amato, the Essex County Executive. ''These numbers are not make-believe.''
The involvement of the Port Authority as developer and sponsor, Mr. Amato said, is a benefit to the residents of Essex County. The management expertise provided by the authority will ''bring the project in on time and within budget,'' he said, and the financing that the authority has provided will preserve Essex County's bonding capacity.
''We would have had to come up with $15 million in cash up front,'' Mr. Amato said, ''and then another $285 million in bonds.'' That, he said, would have diminished the county's ability to float bonds for other projects in the future.
''The Port Authority is performing a public service,'' Mr. Amato said. ''They're not going into this for a profit motive.''
But the authority's financing of the project through its general revenue bonds may, some officials say, be a problem.
''We here in Bergen County pay a lot of tolls at the bridges and tunnels,'' said Larry McClure, director of the Bergen County Utilities Authority, the agency responsible for disposing of Bergen County's solid waste. ''I have a little difficulty with their using those funds to finance an Essex County facility.''
Port Authority officials, however, say that toll revenues are not being used to support the project and that, in fact, the investment will ultimately help subsidize tolls in the same way that profits generated by the World Trade Center and local airports do now.
''Are we going to make money?'' said Stephen Berger, executive director of the Port Authority. ''I sure hope so. It's not part of our basic and fundamental business, but this is clearly a public need that has to be dealt with if you're going to have an economic base that survives.''
The authority became involved in solid-waste disposal, he said, at the request of officials of New York and New Jersey who urged the authority to ''take the lead in the economic development of the region.''
Critics of the authority's role, however, take issue with that explanation.
''To invest $300 million in a project that will generate 60 permanent jobs is not economic development,'' said Stephen Strahs, director of the Tri-State Economic Justice Network, a coalition of community organizations and labor unions from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Mr. Strahs said his organization was planning to protest the authority's involvement in the project by holding a demonstration at the Newark office of the Port Authority chairman, Philip D. Kaltenbacher, on Tuesday.
''We're taking our message to the steps of his office in Newark and we plan on being heard,'' Mr. Strahs said. ''Instead of building incinerators, the Port Authority could just as easily be involved in sponsoring an effective and environmentally sound recycling operation.''
Rather, he said, ''They're acting like a private company whose only interest is to simply maximize their financial concerns.''
And if the Port Authority is to make money on the project, other critics say, then the corporation operating the incinerator, American Ref-Fuel of Essex County, will be making even more.
''This was a sweetheart deal for the operator and a rip-off for county residents,'' said Rob Stuart, program director for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit environmental and consumer organization in Trenton. The contract between Essex County and American Ref-Fuel, he said, includes a provision that requires the county to pay for a fixed amount of solid waste, in this case 680,000 tons a year, whether the county actually provides that amount of trash or not.
The provision also eliminates any incentive county officials might have to reduce waste through recycling because ''they're still obligated to pay for the cost of delivering that trash to the facility,'' Mr. Stuart said.
Indeed, officials already expect that Essex County will deliver less than the 680,000 tons of waste it is required to pay for.
''Right now, we are falling something a little over 100,000 tons short,'' Mr. Amato said. ''But I think that the situation will, over time, cure itself.''
But if it does not, experts say, Essex County could eventually be partly ''shut out'' from the incinerator it pays to support.
''If the county doesn't deliver its guaranteed tonnage during the first several years of the contract,'' said Joseph Bowring, a spokesman for the Department of the Public Advocate, Division of Rate Counsel, ''it loses its right to that capacity.''
If that happens, he said, American Ref-Fuel, which is based in Newark, can then sign long-term contracts with out-of-county and out-of-state providers to make up for the county's shortfall and any excess capacity that the plant may have.
But, according to the terms of the contract, Mr. Bowring said, county ratepayers will still be obligated to pay for the minimum 680,000 tons.
That payment, called the tipping fee when calculated on a per-ton basis, is designed to cover all the operating expenses of the plant.
Since the tipping fee from the county would cover all operating expenses, and since the company can derive additional profits from additional waste by selling energy, Ref-Fuel might then have an incentive to charge lower rates to outside providers to attract additional trash, he said.
As a result, Mr. Bowring said, Essex County ratepayers could end up subsidizing out-of-county and even out-of-state waste disposal.
And to make matters worse, he said, regardless of the amount of trash supplied by Essex County residents, the contract provides that the county is responsible for transporting and disposing of 100 percent of the ash generated by the incinerator, even ash that results from outside providers.
If a portion of the ash turns out to be classified as ''hazardous waste,'' as was the case recently with the Warren County incinerator, then the cost to dispose of that ash may reach ''astronomical proportions,'' Mr. Bowring said. ''The county,'' he said, ''bought into a bad deal.'' But officials of American Ref-Fuel said that all of the Public Advocate's concerns were addressed by state and local agencies before approval of the contracts between the company and the county.
''We've already dealt with all these issues,'' said William Glover, vice president of American Ref-Fuel. ''The Board of Public Utilities ratified the contracts as an acceptable approach to waste disposal and a fair deal to the county.''
Indeed, these and more than a dozen other concerns were outlined in a 33-page report prepared by the Public Advocate's office in May 1987, before approval of the contract by the Board of Public Utilities. The board subsequently approved the contract without specifically addressing the changes urged by the Public Advocate's Division of Rate Counsel.
''The board is not required to rule on whether the contract is just or reasonable,'' said George Dawson, a spokesman for the Board of Public Utilities in Newark. ''It is only required to make a finding as to the public interest. The advocate's report was a part of the review process.''
Mr. Bowring said that notwithstanding the board's decision to ratify the contracts, the ratepayers of Essex County have been placed at a disadvantage.
''Our opinion hasn't changed,'' he said. ''It's still a terrible contract.''
But although construction of the incinerator is almost complete and test-burning is scheduled to begin in early summer, there are still legal issues that must be resolved before the plant can begin operating.
The Ironbound Committee Against Toxic Waste, a citizens' group based in the Newark neighborhood that is home to the plant, has filed a lawsuit to force the State Department of Environmental Protection to decide whether American Ref-Fuel can do business in the state. Under current state law, a solid-waste contractor must be licensed by the department before it can begin operations in New Jersey. The company has received a temporary permit.
Michael Gordon, a lawyer representing the Ironbound group, said that if the lawsuit was successful, the Department of Environmental Protection would have to make an immediate decision on American Ref-Fuel's license application. The department, Mr. Gordon said, would have to take into consideration the fact that subsidiaries of American Ref-Fuel's parent company, Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., based in Houston, have pleaded guilty to antitrust violations in other states.
If the license is denied, he said, ''then construction would have to stop and American Ref-Fuel would have to find someone to purchase the project.''
Mr. Glover said the company supported the state's licensing procedures and was ''confident that the Department of Environmental Protection will find American Ref-Fuel to be a totally suitable operator.''
The suit, which was recently argued in the Appellate Division before a three-judge panel, is still pending.
In the meantime, and while waiting for the court's decision, the Ironbound group has joined forces with the Tri-State Coalition to protest the Port Authority's involvement in the project on Tuesday.
''There's nothing that can be done about their current involvement,'' said Arnold Cohen, spokesman for the Ironbound group, ''but we can really raise the roof if they try to expand the thing. The Port Authority should not be building incinerators. They should be about the business of transportation.''

Where Did This Name Come From?

BYLINE: By Abraham Resnick; Abraham Resnick is a professor of social studies education at Jersey City State College and a textbook author whose works include ''New Jersey: Its People and Culture.''

 BODY:
A TRIP over New Jersey's highways and byways could become much more interesting if the automobile passengers - especially families with young children - engage in a hypothesizing exercise about how certain places got their names.
Since the state is so highly urbanized, there are more than 10,000 names that can be used for research or conjecturing - ranging from familiar ones like Bergen and Weehawken to lesser known ones like Ongs Hat and Penny Pot.
A list of 920 New Jersey place-name origins was compiled when the State Library Commission, in 1938, sponsored a research project that was carried out by the Federal Writers Program of the Work Projects Administration. The researchers delved into state and local histories and folklore and conducted interviews, and the study resulted in a publication, ''The Origin of New Jersey Place Names.'' 
There appears to be a renewed interest in the state's toponymy, the study of the origin of place names, with the intent of learning about the history and geography of an area. County historical societies have published studies about their areas. Their researchers were confronted with the same problem encountered by the W.P.A. writers: some of the information uncovered was speculative and contradictory.
Legendary accounts had to be closely checked for validity whenever possible. Names with Indian origins often proved to be unclear. Nevertheless, most of the place-name authenticity has been reasonably established.
It is not essential to refer to a gazetteer to become a toponymy enthusiast, although the New Jersey Gazetteer is a treasure trove of information. The State Department of Transportation has also produced an extensive list of places. Suppositions about names can readily be made by examining the names on a map: then the assumptions can often be verified when one is traveling about. Welcome signs sometimes explain the origins of a town's name, and historical markers and libraries are other excellent sources.
Names give a place an identity and an image, but most of all, they tell about its site, and topographical features and something about its past. Collectively, they are like characters in a regional folk story.
Unlike states of the Southwest, where many names are Spanish in origin, or Louisiana, where the French left their mark, New Jersey has predominantly English names. The state is named for the island of Jersey in the English Channel, birthplace of Sir George Carteret, one of the grantees receiving the Jersey land tract from James, Duke of York.
But Newark was apparently not named after England's Newark, as many people have thought. A number of scholars have returned to an earlier theory that the New Jersey city was originally named New Ark, or New Work, by the Puritan Congregational Church.
The Dutch presence in the state is indicated by such names as Bergen, Barnegat and Cape May, named for the Dutch explorer Cornelius Mey. In South Jersey, two names can be traced back to the Swedish and Finnish settlements along the Delaware - Finn's Point and Swedesboro.
During the later settlement periods, settlers chose to honor their native cities or countries. Such names as Vienna, Cologne, Stockholm, Bayonne, Berlin, Hamburg, Hibernia, Interlaken, Lodi, New Lisbon and New Russia are examples.
There is also a New Egypt, but its origin has no connection with Egyptian immigrants. The name first appeared in 1793 as Egypt; the New was added eight years later. There are two theories about the name's origin, both revolving about the supply of corn in the area; people said they were ''going to Egypt for corn.''
More than 190 New Jersey place names are said to be of Indian origin. Matawan, Secaucus, Weehawken, Paramus, Manasquan, Totowa, Mahwah, Metuchen and Rahway stem from Indian terminology. Perth Amboy combines an Indian term, ''ambo,'' which has various meanings, with the prefix Perth, honoring the Earl of Perth.
A broad array of men are honored by having places named for them. Audubon was a naturalist, Hudson an explorer, Kearny a general, Edison an inventor, Caldwell a parson and Emerson a poet. Paterson was named for a governor, Trenton for a landowner and Blairstown for a financier. Clark honored a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and Woodbridge's name was a tribute to a leader of settlers. New Brunswick's name was derived from King George II, Duke of Brunswick. In addition, scores of towns are named after the family names of their founders. Some pay tribute to founders' wives and daughters; Elizabeth, for example, was the wife of Carteret. Dorothy and Florence are found on a New Jersey map as well.
A few place names recall a special event - for instance, Washington Crossing, the site on the New Jersey side of the Delaware where George Washington and his troop-laden boats landed before the surprise attack on Trenton. At Double Trouble, a dam was washed away twice within a week, and Ship Bottom is a name linked to an 1817 disaster in which, after a storm, a ship was washed ashore with its hull bottom up.
In the western part of the state, Califon is believed to have been named during the California gold rush, because an enterprising mill operator sold a special cattle feed that resembled gold.
Early religious influences are evident throughout New Jersey in such names as Bethlehem, Tabernacle, Jericho, Zion and Zarepath.
Conclusions can be drawn about economic activities that were once significant for specific areas. Such names as Glassboro, Tansboro, Farmingdale and Stafford Forge tend to be quite explicit, as do Lumberton, Copper Hill, Milltown (a name that seven communities share), Mine Hill, Quarryville and Keyport.
Names of places that take on some aspect of the local geography are common, ranging from High Point to Short Hills. There are Stillwater, Deepwater and Changewater; Oakhurst, Maple Shade and Cedar Grove.
Not all of New Jersey's place names are so easy to explain. Some are hard to locate on a map. There may be formidable challenges in the search for the true origins of such interest-arousing names as Buckshutem, Treasure Island, Apple Pie Hill, Tranquility, Foul Rift and Mount Miser. Finding out how Penny Pot, Retreat, Helmetta and Cheesequake got their designations could be fun.
Ongs Hat, for example, is believed to have been named for an 18th-century tavernkeeper, Jacob Ong, who, it is said, painted a hat on his tavern sign, or was slighted by a young woman who flung his hat into a tree.
Then there is the community of Pole Tavern, which is said to have taken its name from the first liberty pole erected in New Jersey. The pole stood in the center of the village in front of the tavern, a scene of much activity during the outbreak of the Revolutionary War.
It would take a special effort to uncover why there is a Timbuctoo in New Jersey. After all, the ''real'' Timbuktu, the ancient caravan city, lies on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert in Africa.

HEADLINE: Continuing the Fight Against Illiteracy

 BODY:
The magnitude and urgency of the problem of functionally illiterate adults in New Jersey was well documented in the article ''Programs Combating Increase in Illiteracy'' (Jan. 14). But the generally upbeat tone of the report was somewhat belied by the statistics cited in its concluding paragraph. 
Particularly of note is the statement that current tutoring programs ''are reaching only about 5 percent of those who need them,'' according to the State Department of Education.
Because so much still needs to be accomplished in combating this problem, heightened public awareness of the economic and social consequences of the state's high rate of adult illiteracy should be a priority of the media. It was this belief that prompted New Jersey Press Women to convene the conference at Drew University to which the article referred.
It is obvious from the data that far greater resources will have to be expended, by government, industry and private groups.
While it is only fair to report, and gratifying to focus on its positive aspects, the battle against illiteracy, particularly of adults, is not a ''success story.'' It is up to the media to keep the spotlight on this deepening crisis.

IN the asphalt potluck called Hoboken, people like Angela Servello say that when the wind blows down from the river carrying the musky smell of coffee from the Maxwell House plant, it's going to rain for sure.
Sixty-five miles away in Camden - poor, weary Camden - Mangaliso Davis and others who grew up in the shadow of Campbell Soup's Market Street plant say that whenever they stick their heads out the window for some night air, they know what's cooking down at Campbell's.
Such shared experiences, say planners and policy makers, are what make cities communities and tie people to them. City people say it simply is the way things have always been.
But probably not the way they always will be. Campbell's, now going through internal reorganization as it fights off a corporate takeover, is moving its last jars of Prego spaghetti sauce off the line of its old brick plant in Camden. At the end of next month, it will close. More than 900 workers will be laid off. For the first time in almost 100 years, Campbell's will not make any food in Camden. 
Things are almost as bleak in Hoboken. Rumors that the Maxwell House plant on the city's waterfront is shutting down float through Hoboken every couple of years. But last month the General Foods Corporation, which owns Maxwell House, scared the heck out of its 640 workers there when it confirmed that because coffee consumption had dropped sharply, it was reviewing its operations and would decide by the end of this year to close either the Hoboken plant or the other Maxwell House production site, in Jacksonville, Fla.
New Jersey is no stranger to factory closings, but these two will stand apart from the others. For one thing, the fact that they could come so early in the new decade of the 1990's is viewed by some economists as a signal that New Jersey has not yet stanched the hemorrhaging of factory jobs. The state lost about 90,000 blue-collar jobs in the 1970's and thought the worst was over. Then in the 1980's more than 133,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared.
''In the 80's, the impact of these losses was masked because the substanial growth in office jobs offset the declines,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of labor statistics for the United States Department of Labor. ''Now this hemorrhaging becomes a more serious focus of concern in New Jersey because there isn't the other growth we had before in the office sector.''
Mr. Ehrenhalt said he was worried that the loss of Campbell's, and perhaps of Maxwell House, could mean that the 90's would not be kind to New Jersey's industries, which still represent 650,000 jobs, about 20 percent of all jobs.
Of course, both Camden and Hoboken will survive the closing of one more factory, even if, as is the case in both communities, it is the last major blue-collar employer in town. But again these two represent significant social shifts because of what they mean to the cities in which they have operated for so long.
Campbell Soup was not just another company in Camden. For many people it was Camden, its red and white label a symbol of how much this city by the river could do if it had a mind to.
Until the late 70's, the city's rhythm was determined by the plant's production schedule. Workers were not allowed to take vacations in August or September because that was tomato harvest season. Hundreds of trucks from the southern New Jersey flatlands snaked through city streets, spilling tomatoes near potholes until the streets ran red.
Youngsters, Mr. Davis says, would grab some of those loose tomatoes, keep the good ones and use the rest as ammunition for fights with the truck drivers. The drivers, who were weary of waiting to get into the plant, would try to splat a ripe one on the head of a streetwise kid.
In Hoboken, Maxwell House once employed whole families, many of whom lived in the city and walked to work. Traffic used to come to a standstill on Hudson Street when Maxwell House changed shifts. Most walked home, stopping at stores or bars on the way.
A tavern on 11th Street, a block down from the plant, is still called Maxwell's, although rock bands now play there. The ''Good to the Last Drop'' sign on top of the factory is what many New Yorkers think of when they think of Hoboken.
Officials in both cities try to make the best of the situation whenever they talk about the threat of a plant closing. Mayor Aaron A. Thompson says that Camden ''is not going to roll over and play dead'' when Campbell shuts the plant. He points out that the company will still keep its headquarters and 1,800 office workers in the city, although there are rumors about those jobs leaving too.
Patrick Pasculli, the Mayor of Hoboken, thinks Maxwell House can be persuaded to stay, and he wants it to because the company diversifies the city's shaky tax base. But if General Foods does decide to ride with Jacksonville and shut down Hoboken, it will probably be because it believes that the 24 acres of waterfront property will be worth more for real-estate development than for making coffee.
As it is, the Maxwell House plant is about the only part of Hoboken's once brawny waterfront that still works with its hands. It reminds everyone that gentrified Hoboken was once a working-class town. But the Port Authority piers shut down in the 1970's, the shipyard in the 80's. Most of the waterfront now is either vacant or being cleared to make way for new office buildings and apartment complexes that could be built as soon as the real-estate market gets stronger.
In that sense, Hoboken is in better shape to absorb the loss than is Camden. But both cities will forfeit some intangible part of what makes them communities, just as they did when the local theater went dark and the neighborhood soda fountain junked its red leather stools.
''It's another thread in the fabric of our community that we could lose,'' said Peggy E. Thomas, director of Hoboken's Department of Planning and Community Development. ''It cannot be replaced.''
Data processing doesn't smell like anything. You can't take a whiff outside an office building and figure out what is going on inside. The smells of old factories like these, and like Colgate-Palmolive in Jersey City or the Pabst brewery in Newark, tended to connect the neighborhoods of a city, pulling them together in a way that years later can exert a strong pull over people who have long since moved away.
Eventually, it could be that all such operations are removed from New Jersey cities and that when they're replaced by office buildings the neighborhoods will look and smell more and more like suburbs.
''It's hard to add up all the little individual losses, but collectively the effect of such things on a community is very great,'' said Lawrence O. Houstoun Jr., a planner in Cranbury who admits to having a soft spot for the past and its symbols. Though his profession involves laying out new communities - be they an office park, a downtown shopping district or a whole new town - he says that such strong community totems as Campbell's or Maxwell House are almost impossible to replicate and that their absence ''subtracts something from people's lives.''
''I look at my daughter, who's 10,'' Mr. Houstoun said, ''and I just don't know what her identifications with community will be when she's my age. I really don't.''

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
IT still asks homeowners if they have indoor plumbing, and there are 232 communities in Mississippi that currently do not. It asks if the kitchen has a sink, range and refrigerator, and there are thousands of illegal apartments, including hundreds in Westchester, that do not.
Next month, the 21st United States Census form will be mailed to 250,000 Westchester addresses in a $2.2 billion national effort - and a $3 million county effort - that will determine voter representation in Congress, redraw local political boundries and allocate Federal, regional and local financing into the next century.
This year's count is the largest and most complex survey yet undertaken by the Census Bureau, as it sets about describing the education, training and domestic life of 250 million people. Each of the nation's estimated 106 million housing units will receive a questionnaire, mostly by mail. Census staff members will personally visit residents of remote villages from Alaska to upstate New York, elderly residents of nursing homes, college students in dormitories and the homeless in shelters and on street corners. 
 
The Challenge in the County
Each region of the country offers its own set of challenges, but census officials covering Westchester are particularly concerned about recruiting the estimated 1,700 full- and part-time workers needed to complete the mammoth survey in a county where unemployment last month stood at 3.3 percent.
''Unemployment is so low, we are concentrating on full-time employees who may want to earn extra income in the evening,'' said Donald R. Byrnes, manager of the Census office in White Plains. High school and college students and the elderly are also being targeted for the survey work, which pays an average $7.50 per hour.
Counting Westchester households will provide a different kind of challenge because so many residences are ''hidden'' and want to remain that way, Mr. Byrnes said. Homeowners with illegal apartments may decide to omit mention of their tenants when filling out the census forms, Mr. Byrne said, fearing that the tenants will be evicted or that their property will be reassessed.
 
Confidential for 72 Years
The information is confidential, protected by Federal laws that prohibit any institution, including welfare agencies, immigration, military and tax authorities from gaining access to census material. Information from the 1990 Census will be kept confidential for 72 years, Mr. Byrnes said, until the year 2062.
Census Bureau officials estimate that each respondent represents $200 worth of services in a given community, funds that will be lost if the individual fails to respond.
''A lot of people think it is just a head count, but the census is far more than that,'' Mr. Byrnes said. ''A small shortfall can really afect a community. Just missing 10 people in a small town can equal $2,000 in one year, money that could help pay for an additional police cruiser, for example.''
 
The Effect in Yonkers
In Yonkers, where ''lots of people don't want to be counted,'' Mr. Byrnes said, ''the effect can be pretty harsh.'' Yonkers, like most urban centers in the county, has significant numbers of people living illegally in public housing, Mr. Byrne said, a population that depends on Federal help.
Census facts have helped communities address a number of specific problems, said the Department of Commerce, which administers the Census Bureau. The high number of working mothers the census identified in one community helped speed approval for a day-care center; the large number of older people in another helped that community gain approval for a community center.
Census officials are also concerned about the growing cynicism with which a society flooded with ''junk mail'' may greet another piece of mail addressed to ''occupant.''
The envelope is marked ''official business'' and has ''U.S. Census'' clearly marked on the outside. But ''lots of junk mail looks official these days,'' Mr. Byrnes said. ''Besides, the return address says Jefferson Valley, Ind.''
 
'A Law With No Teeth'
Responding to the census is required by Federal law, but Mr. Byrnes said: ''It's a law with no teeth. There are no penalties other than to yourself and to your community.''
Between March 23, when the long and short forms are mailed out in Westchester, and April 1, the deadline for mailing them back, one member of every household is expected to answer 14 basic questions about the race, ethnic origin, age and marital status of each member of the household.
One out of every six households will receive the ''long form,' which asks 45 additional questions about ancestry, employment, education, income, type of housing and utilities. From April 23 to June 6, hundreds of field workers will be deployed to follow up on those who don't respond.
Although census officials in the county expect close to a 75 percent response by the end of April, ''that still leaves 75,000 households to visit,'' Mr. Byrnes said.
 
Counting the Homeless
On March 20, a few days before the census forms are mailed, Westchester census workers will conduct a special 12-hour count of the county's homeless population. Beginning at 6 P.M., they will visit shelters and certain street locations that the police have identified as popular spots for the homeless to gather.
A number of other steps have been taken to assure an accurate census count in the county. Fliers with the slogan ''If you're not counted, you don't count'' have been mailed to schools, churches and community centers. In early January, a special municipal review was completed, identifying 17,700 of an estimated l9,000 housing units that local officials said census planners did not know existed.
A Westchester County 1990 Census Complete Count Committee has been formed to promote public awareness of the census and to encourage public cooperation with it. The committee's co-chairmen are Peter Q. Eschweiler, the county's Commissioner of Planning, and Mayor Richard E. Jackson Jr. of Peekskill.
Those interested in working for the Census Bureau must be 18 and pass a simple comprehension and math test. For more information, call 694-1932.

HEADLINE: WESTCHESTER OPINION;
Why Was Sharpton Marching in Yonkers?

BYLINE: By Jennifer Green; Jennifer Green, a native of Yonkers, recently returned to the city after graduating from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

 BODY:
WHY would Al Sharpton come to Yonkers? That's the first thought that came to my mind when I read that the black activist, who lives in Brooklyn, was coming here to protest the city's long opposition to building equally dispersed low-income housing to spur integration.
Yonkers has always been a community of contrasts. Back in the late 1930's and 40's, it was known as an ideal commuter's neighborhood for people who worked in New York City. The emigrations of black people from southern states, from 1945 to 1960, and of Hispanic people from Puerto Rico, changed the complexion of Yonkers. The city still kept minority residents in the southwestern sections while keeping the northeastern part of Yonkers predominantly white. Black and Hispanic people who tried to move into northeast Yonkers were discriminated against. After the turbulence of the civil rights movement and the affirmative-action policies following it became history, minority Yonkers residents began, slowly, melting into the northeastern part of Yonkers. There were still problems. Some who bought houses on the northeastern side reported attempted bombings, as well as racial slurs written on their houses. 
In all this, the voices of the Yonkers minority community have been muted. As a black woman, I have a lot of trouble empathizing with the radicals on either side of this fight. On the one hand, you have people who feel a large number of minority people in low-income housing would mean crime, drugs and low property values. They fear their new neighbors will bring the slums with them.
Unfortunately, these people are so afraid of losing the neighborhoods they worked so hard for that they don't see that the residents for the projected low-income housing sites are working people, just like them. The problem is, if their children stay in the slums, the slums will be in them for life.
On the other hand, you have the radicals, who want to force any housing plan down the throats of people who worked hard to give their kids a better life, a better school, a better chance. They think all middle-class people are imperialistic bourgeois capitalist pigs, Uncle Toms, Aunt Jemimas, assimilationist wimps who have no respect for non-Eurocentric civil rights imperatives. Black people who offer even a mild criticism are ostracized as traitors to the ''cause'' of black people.
Black people in Yonkers aren't radicals. They do, however, resent the implications that they are morally incapable of living in decent neighborhoods because of the twin ''disabilities'' of their color and socio-economic status. The black middle-class community in Yonkers, although small, is very close-knit. It has ties with black organizations that have worked for years to remedy discrimination, like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. They know racism does exist, not because of good intentions to protect one's own property or children, but because of fear of losing these things.
I honestly don't know if Mr. Sharpton and his associates are radicals. Undeniably, however, they have a different perspective on minority relations than the one that exists here. New York City's advancements are clear in the election of Mayor David Dinkins. There is racism in New York City also, but there is more opportunity now for genuine change.
Yonkers needs a more moderate perspective: someone who will genuinely listen to concerned but good-hearted people who want to see segregated housing end in Yonkers, but who don't want their neighborhoods to become slums. If I owned a house, I would be afraid of something like that happening to where I lived. What I am afraid of is that Mr. Sharpton's presence will cause the situation in Yonkers to be viewed in a false light. I think we have to start understanding the whole picture. We have to ask ourselves why segregation dehumanizes people and why a radical perspective reinforces the segregation it claims to remedy. The hard-liners on either side don't seem to get it: there is nothing dignified about being called a black woman, a Hispanic man or an Asian man instead of being called a good neighbor.
Yonkers has to own up to its growing interracial heritage. Yonkers has to start dealing with the reality that segregating people on one side of a city will eventually worsen the slum problems middle-class people fear so much. Trying to keep problems insulated in one area is like keeping a volatile gas, under pressure, in a balloon. Just like the bubble, which bursts under pressure, scapegoating the residents here and not dealing with the problems afflicting southeast Yonkers will make those problems strong enough to spread outward on their own.
I would feel more comfortable if Mr. Sharpton had a history of working with Yonkers, promoting a progressive perspective that didn't rely on color so much as on a desire for justifiable change in the way things are done. At one time he criticized an N.A.A.C.P. leader as an ''Aunt Jemima,'' which makes me feel hurt and disappointed.
Getting such outside help, from New York City, may be a mixed blessing. It may bring Yonkers more exposure, but it won't facilitate the attitude change that must occur about why desegregation is necessary. This must be understood by Yonkers residents themselves. Being tough may be good for show, but it won't address the problems on a humane level. It won't stop the stalemating of desegregation initiatives.
Why shouldn't Mr. Sharpton have marched in Yonkers? No reason, but I would have liked it if he had unified the white and minority communities who genuinely want change, not just appealed to or inflamed the radical elements on both sides. Yonkers resident must still deal with this themselves. We should stop fighting the integration plan and move forward, together.

And Bear in Mind
 (Editor's choices of other recent books of particular interest.)
DIVORCING THE DICTATOR: America's Bungled Affir With Noriega, by Frederick Kempe. (Putnam, $24.95.) OUR NAM IN PANAMA: How General Noriega Used the United States - and Made Millions in Drugs and Arms, by John Dinges. (Random House, $21.95.) Much in these two accounts by professional journalists (Mr. Kempe of the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dinges of National Public Radio) has been known to our Government all along but kept secret. Both books are excellent guides through the undergrowth of America's affair with the Panamanian dictator.
ADULT ENTERTAINMENT, by John Metcalf (St. Martin's, $15.95.) Two novellas and three short stories whose heroes long for lust but instead get wives, children, bills and crushed hopes; the truth, according to this Canadian writer, is simply no fun.
C.S. Lewis: A Biography, by A. N. Wilson. (Norton, $22.50.) A skilled novelist and biographer (of Tolstoy) brilliantly and sympathetically demythologizes one of the most tendentiously written-about British authors of the 20th century.

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: MICHAEL LEVIN;
Private Analyst Tracks Public Spending

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
SHIFTING the spending categories in the state budget will cost more in the long run, says Michael Levin, the vice president of the Connecticut Public Expenditure Council, which monitors government spending.
The council, a private research organization that was started in 1942 and is financed largely by corporate contributions, is entering its busiest time of year, as it begins analyzing the Governor's annual budget proposal and prepares to study the budgets that will be presented by the state's 169 municipalities over the next few months.
Mr. Levin came to the council nine years ago as director of research after more than 10 years as a budget analyst with the Massachusetts House Ways and Means Committee.
In an interview at the council's offices in Hartford, Mr. Levin talked about the budget process. Here are some excerpts from the conversation:
Q. Why are there so many interpretations of the Governor's budget this year? 
A. That has to do with what's gone on in the last three years with the budget process in Connecticut. We have debased it in a certain way, in the same way the Federal budget process has been debased. In 1989, we started to see a downturn in revenues, but we still had a lot of money squirreled away that we had built up during the good times in the 1980's.
We were able to keep spending high by relying on these surplus pots of money, which was a bad philosophy, not because of what we were spending the money on, but because we really didn't have the money.
We violated a rule of budgeting, whether it's private or public, in that we used nonrecurring revenues to fund recurring, or operating, expenses, which began our decline.
So we have relied increasingly on putting some money ''off budget'' - putting it into bond funds, taking money out of the transportation fund. With all these shifts and gimmicks, it's very hard for an outside party to say how much the budget is actually increasing. It depends on what you're counting. Also, it's hard to say what's being achieved or not achieved in a given budget. The net result is confusion. If everything were kept in one fund, and you said, ''I paid for this last year, and I'm paying for the same thing this year,'' you'd be able to compare.
Q. What kinds of shifts are in this year's budget?
A. The Governor proposes to take about $291 million that last year was funded in the general fund and put it off budget. A lot of it is going to the bond fund. Some of it's going to the revenue of the Connecticut Housing Finance Administration. If you put it back and left things the way they were last year, spending would be going up about 8.7 percent, which you could call the real spending increase.
Another $76 million is simply not being paid this year - that's one-quarter of the payments to the teachers' retirement fund. The state is only going to make three quarterly payments next year, and the last one the following year. Then a big part of it is coming from another fund we had established when the times were good, the local property tax relief fund. It was supposed to give out $42 million per year for 10 years, but now they're going to use maybe $140 million this next year, and it's going to pretty much wipe out this fund.
Q. All that sounds like complicated bookkeeping. What does it mean to the taxpayer?
A. There hasn't been much outrage over the use of gimmicks. I don't know why, but I have some speculations. People are so cynical about the way budgeting occurs at the state level and government level that they don't really care, unless they get a tax increase. And some of the money being taken out of the budget is not going to come back, according to the Governor's claim. So there is a certain constituency that supports what the Governor is doing.
I don't know if you could say it's a ''so what'' for the average person, but it's not going to affect them a lot in terms of everyday living right now. I think it's important, though, for a couple of reasons. This kind of practice can lead to a tax increase the following year.
While not all of it's coming back to the budget, between $100 million and $200 million, depending on how you count it, could come back. The second reason is we're going to pay these costs no matter where they're put. And in some cases the bill will be higher.
If you shift something to the bond budget, you have to pay twice as much for it because of the interest costs. For school building projects, we're really paying four times, because the towns finance the projects, and the state reimburses them. But now the state is going to pay that reimbursement out of bond money. We're borrowing money to pay off their borrowed money. It's costing us a lot more.
Q. What difference does it make if the state or towns run a deficit?
A. When you run a big deficit, it means you can't do your job, and it forces you to borrow money to pay for things. All the interest you pay, that's money you can't have for something else, like highways or housing or social programs.
On the state level, the state has a balanced budget amendment. In this state, we have kind of a weak amendment that allows us to carry it into the next year, but we have to wipe it out the next year. It's the same with local budgets.
To the extent you run a deficit, you have to restrict your program growth or increase your revenues. For a town, that means you raise the property tax or cut programs.
Q. Why are expenses increasing so much quicker than revenues?
A. At the state level, there are two points of view. One group says the state has a lot of unmet needs. Another group, which I would put myself in, says, ''Yes, we have needs, but your needs will always exceed your revenue.'' It's the nature of life.
Our group would say we take on a lot more than we have to take on. For example, we took on a teacher salary program that raised salaries by huge amounts. We didn't have to do that. We could have done a smaller program and had the same effect. You have to live within your means.
So there's always a tension between those two groups, and in this state, in the last 10 years, that first group has been in power.
Q. Has the Connecticut tax burden gone up in recent years?
A. You have to answer that question in two ways. If you look at taxes as a percent of personal income, that burden has not gone up substantially in the last 10 or 15 years. We have a lot of personal income, so you could argue we have the ability to pay. But if you look at per capita tax, we've skyrocketed. A lot of people say that isn't the best measure, but it's one measure.
We're fortunate that our income has been growing, but if our income growth slows down, the tax burden relative to income could grow quickly, because slow income growth won't automatically trigger slower spending. The problem is, has the increase been in needed spending? Just because you have a lot of income, you don't have to spend it.
Q. What kind of things should people be on their guard for in municipal budgets this year?
A. Municipal budgets are going to be very troublesome this year. State aid is being constricted. And on the other side, the spending, is still going to be quite high because of mandates put on cities and towns, like binding arbitration for contracts.
A big issue for state government is to give towns the tools to constrict their own spending growth. They can do certain things now that they might not want to do, such as laying off teachers. They probably would prefer to give a smaller salary increase and keep the teachers on.
Q. Support seems to be building for an income tax. What are the council's views on an overhaul of Connecticut's tax system?
A. I think there have been more people come over to this camp in the last few years. There always was a lot of support for an income tax in the corporate community. It's probably still a minority, but a larger minority. Our position is it remains a viable option, but Connecticut has shown an inability to get its fiscal house in order, which would be a sign to taxpayers and to groups like ours that we could support a balanced tax system.
For instance, there's been opposition to a constitutional spending limit. Some of the states that have one don't have an income tax. The argument in Connecticut is, we don't have an income tax, so we don't need a constitutional spending limit. But we're still spending the money.
I'm not sure we have the best tax structure to go into the 1990's with, but I'm not sure the elements are there to do real reform. The biggest supporters of an income tax just want to raise more revenues, which undercuts their effort to change and reform the system.
Q. If the towns and the state government were businesses, how long would they be around?
A. I think they'd be around. We've seen a lot of businesses badly managed, it's not just the public sector that mismanages. And I think the cities and towns generally have a good management record, much better than the state's. One of the things about the property tax is it's very close to the citizenry, so they keep a watch on their own budgets.
I think the state has had problems in the last few years and has to do more to create a better structure for its own budget. Ultimately, though, legislators are responsible, and they do try to address the problems of the state.
You can't compare state spending to inflation. In some areas, like salaries, you could. But in some areas, if the populace decides it wants to do something, like prison spending, you could spend 20 times as much as inflation because the people want it. But you have to strike a balance between the revenues you have the ability to raise and the spending needs you want to fund.
To the extent the state does that, it's doing its job. But in the last few years, it's tilted toward funding those spending commitments all the time, to the detriment of the tax and revenue side. When those get balanced again, the state will be back on the right course.

HEADLINE: Legislators Consider State Limits on Atlantic City's Powers

BYLINE: By JAMES RUTHERFORD

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
NO one is talking anymore about a miracle in Atlantic City, about a phoenix by the sea rising from the rust of urban decay. The way some prominent state lawmakers assess the resort's flagging fortunes, what is needed now is a salvage operation.
Recently, a legislative movement has been building to strip Atlantic City of many, if not all, of its significant governmental powers.
The movement comes 12 years after the first bet was placed in a Boardwalk casino, 5 years after former Mayor Michael J. Matthews went to jail for taking a bribe from organized-crime figures, 1 year since a casino went bankrupt and shut down, 6 months since a second casino sought Federal protection from its bondholders, 8 months after the arrest of Mayor James L. Usry and three city councilmen on corruption charges and 2 months after the indictment of Mr. Usry and 14 others in connection with those charges.
Many legislators say they feel that the special status given to Atlantic City as a casino resort has been squandered on corruption instead of invested in redevelopment, and that a crackdown is overdue. 
''It's the one item left from the original Casino Control Act - the last piece of unfinished business,'' said Assemblyman William P. Schuber, Republican of Bogota.
Mr. Schuber is sponsoring the first of at least two bills that would subject the resort's budget and its zoning and planning prerogative to state oversight. Specifically, it would vest that oversight in a seven-member commission appointed by the governor.
The Schuber bill is closely modeled on a more publicized proposal that Richard J. Codey, Democrat of West Orange, plans to submit in the State Senate this spring.
To Mr. Codey and Mr. Schuber, their proposals simply enforce an unwritten compact between the state and Atlantic City that was sealed with the passage of the Casino Control Act 14 years ago, the enabling legislation that granted the city the state's sole franchise on casinos. Mr. Codey was the author of the act.
In return for a sure-fire formula for prosperity, Atlantic City promised to prosper: specifically, Mr. Codey said, to remake itself into the national tourist destination it was in its heyday. This, he said, the city has not done.
''Atlantic City is not doing the job for itself or the rest of the state when we allowed them to have casino gaming,'' he said. ''Atlantic City got what no other urban area in this state ever got or probably ever will get: the greatest urban renewal tool the world has ever seen. And they have not used that to redevelop the rest of the city. ''There is absolutely, positively no excuse for it. It's a disgrace to walk on the Boardwalk today, with all those casinos surrounding it, and all you see are those same rundown, rotten shops that you saw before. The Boardwalk should be a promenade with some of the nicest stores in the state. The business district should be nice, and it isn't.
''Why would a couple from Camden want to spend a weekend in Atlantic City, other than if they were gambling addicts? No reason. They don't have the amenities you need to make Atlantic City a first-class resort destination. I want to see it become that. And it will not as long as what is going on continues to go on.''
Mr. Codey's bill, as yet unwritten, has nevertheless drawn the hottest fire from officials in Atlantic City and the surrounding Shore communities.
Assemblywoman Dolores G. Cooper, Republican of Atlantic City, called the bill an ''outrage'' in a letter sent to Mr. Codey in January. Mrs. Cooper, a candidate for mayor in Atlantic City in a May 8 election, added: ''I intend to lead the fight against this undeniable attack on home rule.''
From the other side of the aisle, Assemblyman Alfred D. Scerni, Democrat of Smithville, has dismissed all talk of state intervention as ''extreme'' and ''premature.''
''I don't think it's necessary or a viable way to manage municipal government,'' he said.
Rosalind Norrell-Nance, an aide to Mayor Usry, said the Mayor and his administration were totally opposed to the kind of takeover proposed by Mr. Codey.
''The only instance where that kind of action is warranted,'' she said, ''is where there have been significant financial problems, and in Atlantic City that has not been the case. The city has an excellent bond rating, and the city budget has consistently operated in the black. There is simply no reason for it.''
Mr. Usry and the other defendants in his case have denied the charges, and he is a candidate in the May election.
Mr. Codey has already retreated several steps from his original initiative, which was to give a state commission powers over land use and transportation within Atlantic City's burgeoning suburbs as well. The plan ran afoul of Senator William L. Gormley, Republican of Margate, who by virtue of his strong showing in the 1989 gubernatorial primary has emerged as one of the most powerful politicians south of Trenton.
Mr. Gormley has indicated that he wants no interference with his own bill to create a regional authority to manage and develop Atlantic City International Airport, 10 miles west of the city in suburban Egg Harbor Township. Plans to expand the airport, seen as a key to the resort's progress, have been mired for years in a political tussle between the city and the county.
''Senator Codey and I have areas of common agreement,'' Mr. Gormley said, ''such as the need for a regional airport and to not have Atlantic City control the airport facility. I feel that in matters of regional concern, Atlantic City should have a diluted level of control.''
Mr. Codey compromised, agreeing to hold back his bill until an airport agreement could be hammered out on the state level.
Further, by early February, when Mr. Codey went to Cherry Hill to address the Chamber of Commerce of Southern New Jersey, he outlined a revised plan under which state intervention in Atlantic City would stop at the city's borders.
Mr. Codey says he intends to press ahead with the more limited - and apparently more politically palatable - alternative, and says there are sufficient votes in both the Senate and Assembly to make it law.
Senator Daniel J. Dalton, Democrat of Laurel Springs and the majority leader, who acted as a mediator between Mr. Codey and Mr. Gormley, has thrown his considerable influence behind the idea that ''something has to be done in Atlantic City.''
 
'Losing of Edge' Is Seen
''Generally, the thought of intervention I am not repulsed by in any way,'' Mr. Dalton said. ''I think if we don't move forward in a positive fashion with regard to intervention in some part of the jurisdiction of the city, then the state and, more specifically, the people of the region will be the losers. Because if things aren't improved, and improved significantly, the city will lose its edge to other governmental jurisdictions that are considering casino gambling.''
Casino proposals have been under consideration in Florida, Indiana and West Virginia, among other states.
Mr. Codey's sentiments have the ardent support of the gambling industry, which submitted a host of complaints of its own to the Governor's office in January in a detailed position paper written by the Casino Association of New Jersey, an industry trade group.
The paper came on the heels of a report by the Atlantic City Expressway Authority that tourism was falling off for the first time since the casinos opened in 1978. The casinos' combined win - the money retained after bets are paid but before other expenses are paid - declined 2.7 percent in January compared with the amount for the same month in 1989, according to figures supplied by the State Casino Control Commission.
Only four properties reported increases from the previous year, despite the fact that there was one less competitor, the Atlantis having shut down in May as a result of a prolonged bankruptcy. Another casino, Resorts International, filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code in September.
 
Criticism From the Casinos
The Casino Association paper, in addition to a repetition of its calls for a loosening of state regulations, was highly critical of local officials and requested state intervention in municipal budget and land-use policies.
Nor is it only Atlantic City's future at risk, Mr. Codey said. Sinking fast, or so he fears, is the assurance that the millions of dollars in revenue generated by the industry, and the services they buy statewide, will continue to grow as they have in the past.
''I think legislators, hopefully, will understand that the senior citizens who live in our districts throughout the state have a big stake in Atlantic City because of what Atlantic City casinos provide'' in money to back such programs as low-cost prescriptions for the elderly and the Lifeline utility bill abatement program,'' Mr. Codey said. ''This is not parochial, this is a statewide thing, and people should look at it as that.''
Even Mr. Gormley, acknowledging a growing impatience on the state level, is co-sponsoring a separate bill of Mr. Codey's, which would remove the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority from the city's political influence by making its members serve at the pleasure of the governor.
The bill would allow Gov. Jim Florio to replace the current membership of the agency, which is empowered to invest a 1.25 percent tax on casino gross revenue in redevelopment projects in Atlantic City and throughout the state, and whose leaders have been closely aligned with the Usry administration. The change is among those advocated in the Casino Association's position paper.
One consequence could be to divert the authority's investments from low-income housing, a priority of Mr. Usry's, to the construction of a new Atlantic City convention complex, which the Governor, Mr. Gormley and others have characterized as vital to the city's progress.
 
'A Trustee in Limited Areas'
Mr. Gormley, in the meantime, has outlined his general conditions, which he guardedly describes as ''strictly hypothetical,'' for support of state intervention.
''What I would support would be something in a limited area, a trustee in limited areas to monitor and protect the rights of the citizens of Atlantic City,'' he said. ''But I wouldn't want to see an entity that strips them of their franchise, their prerogative to vote by effectively making Atlantic City the District of Columbia.''
Ms. Norrell-Nance said the city has had to shoulder a disproportionate responsibility to care for the region's homeless and to provide affordable housing for the poor.
''We would welcome state assistance with regard to the social problems that have been dumped on Atlantic City,'' she said. ''We would appreciate some indication that other cities will be made to assume their fair share.''
Mr. Gormley said: ''I can understand there are certain state interests in Atlantic City, but at the same time the citizens of that city should not be limited in their ability to elect officials to make those normal decisions affecting the health, safety and welfare of the community, whether they be good or bad decisions. That's the nature of a democracy.''
The Governor's office has obtained Mr. Codey's promise that it will get to review the bill before it reaches the Senate floor.
Steven Perskie, Mr. Florio's chief of staff, said: ''We're looking at all the issues related to Atlantic City. The position of the administration is that the state has an obligation to take a participatory approach on a partnership basis for the benefit of both the citizens of the region and the state. The form and extent of state involvement is still an open question.
''You can look at it, depending on your perspective, as state interference or state assistance. What we're looking for is the easiest, most efficient and most effective form.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: A DISQUIET ON GERMANY;
Bush and Kohl Struggle for Notes of Calm As the Headlong Rush to Unity Gives Pause

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany spoke at length today about their ''similar views'' and ''common dreams,'' but on the difficult aspects of German reunification, they spoke with distinctly different voices while avoiding outright discord.
Reaching for a word to describe the two countries' views on the sanctity of the German-Polish border, for example, Mr. Bush came up with ''alignment,'' rather than ''agreement,'' as if he and Mr. Kohl found themselves, after two days of meetings at Camp David, on the same road, heading the same way, but with one ahead of the other.
The headlong dash of the two Germanys toward unity - toward what Mr. Bush called ''a golden moment'' in German history - has begun to worry people. This weekend's conference, for all its emollient words, is not likely to calm them, chiefly because the Chancellor, a most artful dodger, spoke much more equivocally than the President. 
 
Worry in Warsaw
Poles are worried that Germany might claim bits of modern Poland like East Prussia and Silesia, where some ethnic Germans still live although their numbers are not known. Poland is so worried, in fact, that it has demanded, so far unsuccessfully, a place at the table where the terms of reunification are to be decided. Czechoslovaks have similar concerns about the Sudetenland. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, ever the Churchillian, seems haunted by memories of World War II. Even President Francois Mitterrand said recently that ''Germans should bear in mind the obligations that link us to each other, as well as European stability.''
Two men in their 70's, both longtime Atlanticists, used the same metaphor on different sides of the ocean this weekend to express the disquiet that many people feel - and that Mr. Kohl and Mr. Bush were struggling to contain.
''The train of German unity is rolling along the tracks,'' said Willy Brandt, 76, the Social Democrat who won the Nobel Prize for improving relations between the two Germanys two decades ago. ''Now we must make certain that nobody falls under its wheels.''
''The West German Government of Helmut Kohl is rushing to achieve its goal of reunification, regardless of the concerns of its allies and neighbors,'' Richard M. Helms, also 76, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency from 1965 to 1973, said in an article in The Washington Post today. ''German reunification has become a kind of runaway freight train that nobody - East or West - seems able to contain. And that doesn't bode well for the future.''
 
Kohl's Phrasing
Though he rejected a central role for Poland in German reunification talks, the President stated crisply, ''The United States formally recognizes the current German-Polish border.'' But Mr. Kohl, for all his talk about the feelings of ''our Polish neighbors,'' for all his protestations that West Germany had no desire to change borders, resorted again to the kind of phrasing that sends shivers up spines in Warsaw and elsewhere in Europe.
''The border question will be settled definitely,'' he said, ''by a freely elected, all-German government and a freely elected, all-German parliament'' - without pre-unification pledges from East Germany or West Germany, in other words, and without the participation of other nations in the decision.
The best Mr. Kohl offered the Polish Government was the bland comment that ''there is a particular interest on the part of the Poles, and I'm sure that in the course of this process, we will find ways and means of adopting solutions satisfactory to everybody.''
Mr. Bush and Mr. Kohl also seemed to have different focuses on the question of American troops in Germany.
The President, emphasizing the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and full German membership in it, swept aside recent suggestions that Germany might follow the French pattern, belonging to the organization but not integrating its troops into the NATO command structure. And he insisted that American troops could remain in Germany even if all Soviet troops left.
The Chancellor, on the other hand, emphasized that ''a united Germany has a sovereignty of its own,'' and characterized proposed Soviet and United States troop levels in Central Europe as part of a ''transitional period.''
 
Domestic Political Reality
That did not sound very different from comments last week by Czechoslovak leaders, including the Foreign Minister, Jiri Dienstbier, who said on American television that ''in the long run there is no reason to keep foreign troops on foreign territory if there is no enemy,'' and President Vaclav Havel, who told Congress that ''for another hundred years, American soldiers shouldn't have to be separated from their mothers just because Europe isn't capable of being a guarantor of world peace.''
Each of the leaders was reacting, as politicians almost always do when discussing foreign policy, to the dictates of domestic political reality.
Mr. Kohl feels pressure to move reunification along; he is in a race to get the building blocks of the new Germany in place before the old East Germany collapses. He feels pressure as well because his best chance for victory in the West German elections in December is to identify himself with the great nationalist issue, reunification.
With the end of the long, painful split in sight, furthermore, the nationalist candidate cannot afford to seem to sanction the indefinite presence of foreign troops in Germany.
Finally, competent politician that he is, Mr. Kohl wants to delay as long as possible offending the 8 million to 10 million West Germans with family roots in places like East Prussia and the Sudetenland. If he can avoid making any ironclad commitment to present borders until after the election, so much the better.
 
A New Enemy
Mr. Bush's perspectives, not surprisingly, are different. First of all, he is determined not to run down American military strength too rapidly. With the Soviet Union no longer a credible threat, some American officials have been describing the mission of United States troops in Europe as keeping an eye on Germany, but the President could hardly say that today, so he had a new formulation: the enemy now, he said, ''is instability and unpredictability.''
Remembering the fate of the Weimar Republic, the isolated, disarmed and effectively neutral German state after World War I that set the stage for the rise of Nazism, he is reluctant to permit any distance at all to creep between NATO and a unified Germany. He is also sensitive to the concerns of Poles and of Polish-Americans - a group with considerable ballot-box clout.
But at the same time the President feels compelled to maintain the best possible relations with the Germany that is being born, which may soon be an economic, political and diplomatic power on a par with the United States.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: THE GERMANYS;
Bush and Kohl Try to Allay Fears Of a Reunified Germany's Powers

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMP DAVID, Md., Feb. 25

 BODY:
Ending two days of talks, President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany declared today that there was no reason for anyone to fear the economic, political or military power of a united Germany.
Mr. Bush said they agreed that the nation being reborn in the middle of Europe should be a full member of NATO and take part in the alliance's military structure.
The two leaders played down fears of reunification expressed by some of the two Germanys' neighbors.
''I think we have learned lessons and we do not want to repeat the errors of history,'' Mr. Kohl said at a news conference with Mr. Bush.
''This is not 1945; this is 1990,'' Mr. Kohl said at another point. [Excerpts on page A9.] The Chancellor declined again to say explicitly that he accepted the permanence of the existing Polish-German border. But he offered Poles somewhat more assurance than he has in the past, saying, ''Nobody wants to link the question of national unity with changes in existing borders.'' 
During World War II, Poland was occupied by both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. As a result of postwar negotiations, the Soviet Union kept most of the Polish territory it had occupied, compensating Poland by giving it control over eastern Germany.
Various agreements signed by European countries in recent years have confirmed the postwar boundaries. But Poland has been uneasy about sentiment voiced by right-wing parties in West Germany critical of the realignment of territory.
 
Border Question Delayed
Mr. Kohl said at the news conference that ''the border question will be settled definitely by a freely elected all-German government and a freely elected all-German parliament,'' neither of which has yet been constituted. Many Polish officials want the current border to be confirmed before reunification by the separate Governments of East Germany and West Germany.
Mr. Kohl's critics say he is keeping the border question alive to satisfy rightist politicians who want the border to be an issue in the campaign leading up to the West German national elections in December.
On the border question, Mr. Bush was more categorical. He did not allow Mr. Kohl's comments to stand alone, but jumped in to say: ''The U.S. respects the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act regarding the inviolability of current borders in Europe. And the U.S. formally recognizes the current German-Polish border.'' The Helsinki accords were signed in 1975.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Kohl discussed the future of Europe and the pace of German reunification, which has been faster than either leader had expected. Mr. Bush said nothing that would suggest he seeks to brake the rush toward reunification, which he described as ''a golden moment in the history'' of Germany.
 
On NATO Membership
In an opening statement, Mr. Bush said he and Mr. Kohl agreed that ''a unified Germany should remain a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, including participation in its military structure.'' Mr. Bush thus seemed to rule out the possibility that a united Germany might have a special status in NATO like that of France.
France pulled out of NATO's integrated military commands in 1966, but otherwise remains a full member of the alliance.
Mr. Bush said he and Mr. Kohl also agreed that ''U.S. military forces should remain stationed in a united Germany and elsewhere in Europe, as a continuing guarantor of stability.'' But the President said they also agreed that the land now constituting East Germany should have ''a special military status that would take into account the legitimate security interests'' of the Soviet Union and other countries.
Neither leader defined that special status. They were presumably referring to an arrangement that would exclude NATO troops from what is now East Germany. The Soviet Union has stated that it wants a unified Germany to be neutral.
 
The American Attitude
Mr. Bush said the American position was ''not to be afraid of German reunification,'' but to welcome it. He said he looked forward to the day when the four major World War II Allies would not have to look ''over the shoulders of a democratic unified Germany.''
Similarly, Mr. Kohl said that ''nobody needs to be afraid'' of a united Germany. He said the new German state would have close ties to the United States and be embedded in a European Community moving toward economic union and closer political cooperation.
American and West German journalists posed more questions to Mr. Kohl than to Mr. Bush, who nevertheless volunteered his comments at several points. The West German leader smiled with apparent satisfaction while Mr. Bush spoke at the news conference. Mr. Bush often scowled and squinted while the Chancellor spoke.
The news conference was held in a recreation hall at Camp Greentop in the Catoctin Mountain park, just outside the gates of Camp David.
 
Timetable Not Discussed
Mr. Kohl and Mr. Bush said that the precise details and timetable for German reunification were not decided over the weekend.
Mr. Bush was asked to explain the ''two-plus-four'' formula, under which the two Germanys are supposed to negotiate the economic and political aspects of unification as a prelude to discussions with the four Allies on security issues.
''Those details have not been fully worked out in terms of timing of meetings and things of this nature,'' Mr Bush said. He said the formula was approved by the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the two Germanys on Feb. 13 in Ottawa, ''and we simply have not tried to sit here in Camp David and fine-tune the procedures.''
Mr. Kohl said that swift unification was needed to stem the flow of East Germans to the West. Since Jan. 1, he said, some 110,000 people have left East Germany for West Germany. Their exodus has accelerated the move toward reunification, he said.
 
Expects Separate Elections
Some West Germans have said that the union might be consummated in time for East Germans to vote in West German elections scheduled for Dec. 2.
But Mr. Kohl said he believed those elections would be held in West Germany alone. East Germans vote March 18 for a new government that will presumably negotiate the terms of union with Bonn.
The Chancellor sounded testy when a journalist suggested that other countries should receive assurances on ''borders and security'' before the two Germanys merge. ''The question of German unity is a question of the right of self-determination, and all peoples of this earth have the right of self-determination,'' he said. He made no mention of the legal powers that the World War II Allies technically retain in Berlin and in Germany as a whole.
Mr. Kohl also bristled at the suggestion that a united Germany might drift away from NATO toward neutrality. ''In 1983,'' he said, ''I put my political existence at stake by agreeing'' to the deployment of American missiles on West German soil, ''so nobody has to tell me what a reliable partner is.''
 
Dismisses 'Neutralism'
''Neutralism would be a very false solution for us,'' Mr. Kohl said. ''I can't see that there would ever be any majority in the Federal Republic nor in a united Germany for a neutralized Germany.''
Without mentioning the Nazis, Mr. Kohl acknowledged, ''We have a certain history,'' and said, ''We must understand that there are certain fears on the part of our neighbors,'' particularly Poland.
He said he was confident that in melding the two Germanys, ''we will find ways and means of adopting solutions satisfactory to everybody.''
Mr. Kohl was asked if a united Germany could have any ties to the Warsaw Pact or if it would allow the stationing of Soviet troops within its borders. ''One thing is clear,'' he said. ''A united Germany cannot belong to two different pact systems.''

HEADLINE: ELECTION IN NICARAGUA;
NICARAGUA IS CALM IN HEAVY TURNOUT FOR CRITICAL VOTE

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Under intense international scrutiny, this war-battered country voted today in the first free and broadly contested elections in its history. There were few reports of violence and strong signs of an overwhelming voter turnout.
Exit polls and unofficial projections were prohibited by the election authorities, underscoring the uncertainty that has surrounded the contest, which pits President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of the governing Sandinista National Liberation Front against Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, leader of the 14-party National Opposition Union.
Anticipation was heightened further late tonight when election officials failed to make a scheduled announcement of official returns amid signs of a close race. They offered no explanation for the slowness of the count. 
 
'It's Very Solemn'
Hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans streamed to the polls in what all sides view as a decisive referendum on 10 years of Sandinista rule. In contrast to the festive air of the recent election in neighboring Costa Rica, the mood at most voting tables was one of purpose and privacy.
''It's very solemn, like a Mass,'' said former President Jimmy Carter, who is leading one of the major delegations of observers here.
Asked for his impression of the balloting. Mr. Carter said, ''So far, very good.'' But in at least one rebel stronghold in the mountainous countryside, the voting went forward under a cloud of fear. [Page A6.] The election, in which Nicaraguans are voting for President and Vice President, a National Assembly and municipal councils, comes after more than 10 years of turbulence and war in Nicaragua. Since 1979, the country has seen the fall and assassination of a dictator, the rise of a revolutionary Government, a civil war in which Washington armed and trained a rebel army, and an economy staggered by a United States-imposed trade embargo and mismanagement. #30,000 Dead in War The opposition of the Reagan Administration to the Sandinista Government, which it accused of aiding leftist rebels in El Salvador, led it to arm and train the contra rebels. The civil war left an estimated 30,000 Nicaraguans dead. President Ortega said on Friday that if he won re-election, he would end support to the Salvadoran rebels and seek better ties with Washington. [In Washington, the Bush Administration indicated that it would look to improve relations with Managua if Mr. Ortega won a fair vote and the Sandinistas abided by the promise not to arm the Salvadoran rebels.
 
Page A6.]
As early as three hours before the scheduled 7 A.M. start of the balloting, long lines formed at the 4,391 voting stations set up in schools, banks and public offices across the country. Officials from the Government and the opposition parties said they expected the final turnout to reach as high as 90 percent of the country's 1.7 million registered voters. The voting age is 16 in this nation of 3.5 million.
 
Some Stations Fail to Open
The care put into the elections was evident in the balloting. Nicaraguan voters moved through a set of special procedures intended to prevent fraud or repeat voting. In interviews, many refused to comment on their views, pointedly repeating official assurances that their vote was secret.
''The people know how important this moment is,'' said Mario Jose Gonzalez Lopez, a 23-year-old Managua repair-shop worker who would not reveal his preference as he waited to vote. ''They're taking it very seriously.''
Electoral officials announced that a total of 9 voting stations did not open and 12 others were relocated for security reasons because of the threat of contra rebel activity. But the changes, affecting only a fraction of the electorate, were not expected to have a serious effect on the vote.
 
Teams Find Compliance
Throughout the rugged Nicaraguan countryside, coordinated teams of 700 trained foreign observers from the United Nations, the Organization of American States and a delegation led by Mr. Carter carefully monitored voting stations, traveling by jeep, boat, horseback, helicopter and plane.
An additional 1,300 foreign observers and invited delegations from places as diverse as Gdansk, Poland, and McFarland, Wis., also fanned out across the country to guarantee the integrity of the vote. And as many as 1,000 journalists received credentials to report on the election process.
There were no immediate reports of serious violence or irregularities, and the security forces remained well away from most voting areas.
President Carter and other observers said this evening that a problem had developed with a lack of permanence in the ink used to stain voters' thumbs to prevent them from voting more than once. But he said that it would not affect the overall vote.
Instead of finding disruptions or fraud, observers in most places said they found almost universal compliance with the smallest details of the electoral law.
The country has been filled in the last few weeks with campaign clothing, headbands, hats and other giveaways, particularly from the Sandinista Front, and thousands of Nicaraguans have become accustomed to wearing campaign T-shirts. But such clothing is forbidden near polling areas by rules that ban partisan publicity, and throughout Managua today the items vanished in a striking display of obedience.
''I think it shows a maturity and democratic spirit,'' said Oscar Melendez, who presided over the electoral preparations for the region.
 
The Critical Issues
In voting lines around the country, those willing to express their views provided a portrait of an election that has revolved around the critical issues of the long contra war and the country's deep economic decline.
In Masaya, a city 15 miles southeast of Managua that was the object of intense campaigning by Sandinista leaders and their opponents, Ivan Cordoba Zuniga, a 23-year-old law student, said he had voted for the Sandinistas to protect Nicaragua's sovereignty.
''We have to determine the dignity of our people,'' said Mr. Cordoba, who said he served in the army for two years at the height of the contra war. ''We won't be like Panama, Grenada, or the Dominican Republic.''
But Marlon Blanco Jimenez, a 17-year-old student, emerged from the voting booth to say that he and other draft-age friends had put their faith in the main opposition coalition, known by its Spanish acronym as UNO.
''I am very conscious of what I just did,'' he said. ''The vote is secret but it's easy to know who I want because I'm young. We don't want the military service, we want to go to school.''
 
For and Against
Voters in Monsenor Lezcano, an older working-class neighborhood on the west side of Managua, predicted that their block, which includes large numbers of military families, would vote almost unanimously for the Sandinistas. ''This neighborhood is completely revolutionary,'' said Maritza Pena, who is 40 years old.
The Sandinista platform has centered on promises to end the eight-year contra war and to begin rebuilding the economy through new foreign aid and a lifting of American trade restrictions imposed at the height of the contra conflict, in 1985. United States officials have acknowledged that the contra war and the restrictions would lose much if not all their rationale if the Sandinistas were to win fairly.
The opposition coalition, headed by Mrs. Chamorro, the 60-year-old widow of a crusading newspaper editor whose assassination in 1978 helped set off the Sandinista revolution, has built its campaign around popular unhappiness over years of inflation, deteriorating wages and shortages of basic goods.
It has gained important support for its promise to end the military draft. It has also capitalized on the discontent of the private business sector, whose confidence, it asserts, will never be regained by the Sandinista Government.

HEADLINE: MARKET IN TOKYO NORMALLY STABLE, SLIPS INTO TURMOIL

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The usually stable Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged Monday in a day of wild gyrations that Japanese officials always thought only took place in other markets. The Nikkei index was off nearly 7 percent at one point, then rebounded near the close to finish down 4.5 percent for the day.
It was the worst decline here since the global stock market crash in October 1987, and was regarded as a harbinger of tough times ahead in Tokyo and perhaps New York and European markets.
The slide continued last week's rout of stock prices here and was caused by many of the same factors, analysts said - sharply rising interest rates resulting from the value of the yen and a growing loss of confidence by investors that the Japanese Government will be able to react decisively to halt the severe decline. 
 
Influence From Abroad
Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of the violent decline in stock prices for the Japanese is that to a great extent the slide reflects events outside Japan - particularly the signs of increasing inflation in West Germany and a subsequent climb in interest rates there and in the United States.
The rapid move toward a united Germany is unsettling financial markets and is pushing the West German central bank to the center of the world economic stage. [Page D1.] Japan, which had seemed immune to such external influences by keeping its economic house in order, is finding itself in the unfamiliar and unhappy position of being buffeted even more than markets overseas, as interest rates here soar, the yen tumbles and stock prices skid. Japan is finding that maintaining a vigorous domestic economy is not enough in this new era of economic interdependence; Japan is discovering its vulnerabilities.
 
A Lucid Analysis
It was telling that when Ariyoshi Okumura, the thoughtful president of the Industrial Bank of Japan's money management arm, was asked what was behind the frighteningly steep plunge on the troubled Tokyo stock market, he delivered a lucid analysis not of Japan's markets, now the world's largest, but of West Germany's, which are tiny by comparison.
The closely watched Nikkei stock index fell 1,569.10 points Monday, to 33321.87. That was an improvement from its low point of the day, when it had fallen nearly 2,500 points.
Last week, the Nikkei index tumbled by nearly 7 percent, and it is off more than 15 percent from its record high, set in December.
Both worrying and reassuring signs were in the market, with traders and analysts saying that severe as the decline was, it did not seem at this stage to be heralding the kind of crash that struck markets on Oct. 13, 1987.
Trading volume has been running at about half its normal level and was light this morning, meaning that investors are not panicking, analysts said. But in a troubling sign, many shares could not even open this morning, since selling was so heavy that prices had hit their pre-set limits before the bell was even truck.
Japanese authorities began to mobilize this morning, another sign of how seriously the decline is being taken here. Last week, the Finance Ministry warned major securities houses to limit their program trading, which has been blamed for contributing to the tumble.
Volume was an unusually light 400 million shares on Monday, suggesting that as was the case last week, large financial institutions were not active participants in the selloff.
Monday morning, the Bank of Japan was actively intervening in the foreign exchange market, selling dollars and buying hundreds of millions of dollars in yen in a so-far-futile effort to stem the dollar's rise. The higher the dollar goes against the yen, the more pressure there is to increase Japanese interest rates, which could well send stock prices spinning even lower.
In addition, the Bank of Japan was reportedly calling large financial institutions this morning, offering loans in an effort to reassure them that cash would be available if necessary to meet any unusual demand.
In addition, the Japanese Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, issued a statement today saying he was very much concerned by the market's drop and the weakening yen. He attributed the decline not to economic problems - Japan's economy is booming - but to lingering uncertainties raised by the recent elections in Japan and growing stresses in Japan's relationship with the United States.
Other analysts added that there were some domestic factors behind the problems in the market. A senior executive at the Nomura Securities Company, Japan's and the world's largest brokerage house, said computerized program trading was a factor Monday morning and last week.
 
Higher Interest Rates
Lawrence Prager, a senior analyst at the Nikko Securities Company, said that the jump in interest rates here - an increase of nearly 30 percent in certain key rates since the beginning of the year - was hammering the bond market and that stock prices were simply reflecting those factors.
But all those concerns eventually reflect the value of the yen and interest rates, which are being heavily influenced by the developments in Europe and the United States. That is the unfamiliar reality to which Tokyo is just now adapting with such difficulty.
Five years after the major industrialized nations met to chart a new era in economic cooperation and interdependence, in the form of the so-called Plaza Agreement, none of the nations has accepted easily the notion that keeping one's own domestic economic house in order is not good enough any longer.
The output of goods and services in Japan is still booming at a growth rate of more than 4 percent, with inflation actually expected to decline this year - to below 3 percent. Corporate profits will set a record, yet again, for the fiscal year that ends March 31, and are expected to grow a robust 10 percent in the coming year.
 
Increasing Pressure
All the same, the Bank of Japan is under pressure to raise interest rates - for the fourth time since last May - to bolster the sagging yen. Fear of inflation are also lingering, due to a severe shortage of labor, soaring land prices and rapid growth in the nation's money supply.
The adjustment to higher short-term interest rates in Tokyo last week took place in the American financial markets a few weeks ago, as United States rates bobbed upward and stock prices slid under similar pressures.
''Tokyo's markets rode the Shinkansen to catch up with Amtrak,'' said Mr. Okumura, referring to Japan's famous bullet train and the well-known American railroad. ''Tokyo has only caught up with movements that took place in New York several weeks ago, and now everyone is watching the situation in Germany.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Excerpts From the News Conference Held by Bush and Kohl

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference today by President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, provided by Federal News Service, a transcription company, and the White House. Questions and answers in German were translated by an interpreter.
 
President's Statement
BUSH. . . . The Chancellor and I had an opportunity to talk at length about recent political developments in Europe and about East-West relations. And I am pleased to say that we share similar views on the most fundamental issues. We both welcome the prospect of further movement toward German unification, beginning with the steps toward economic and monetary union that are proposed for the period immediately following the elections in the G.D.R. on March 18th.
If events are moving faster than we expected, it just means that our common goal for all these years of German unity will be realized even sooner than had been hoped. We share a common belief that a unified Germany should remain a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, including participation in its military structure. Now we agreed that U.S. military forces should remain stationed in a united Germany and elsewhere in Europe, as a continuing guarantor of stability. 
The Chancellor and I are also in agreement that in a united, in a unified state, the former territory of the G.D.R. should have a special military status that would take into account the legitimate security interests of all interested countries, including those of the Soviet Union.
At the same time, the Chancellor and I agree that we must continue to press hard for arms control efforts which would sharply reduce military forces in Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals. We want to work together to have a C.F.E. agreement ready for signature this year at a summit meeting of all 35 C.S.C.E. member states. The summit could also endorse our proposal for C.S.C.E. guidelines on free elections to help show the way and protect the emerging democratic institutions of Eastern Europe. ...
Mr. Chancellor, it was a pleasure to have you with us and now for your statement, sir.
 
Chancellor's Statement
KOHL. . . . In the spirit of this friendship, the two of us, Mr. President, in the course of these hours in Camp David, we have discussed a vast list of political issues. In the center of our conversations was the future of the trans-Atlantic relations and, embedded therein, the path of the Germans toward national unity. Against the background of historic changes on the European Continent, we have reconfirmed our common beliefs.
First, the alliance of the free democracies in Europe and North America, and included therein the German-American partnership, are of fundamental importance for peace and security. This is true now; this will be true in future.
Second, the security link between North America and Europe is and continues to be, and in the future, for us Germans - that is to say, also for a united Germany - of vital importance. That is why we need the presence of our American friends in Europe, in Germany, and that includes the presence of American forces.
Also, for a united Germany in the future, maintaining the friendship with the United States of America and the expansion of relations with them will be an important task. We are happy about the ever closer economic cooperation and economic exchange, exchange in the fields of science and culture, and about the ever more meaningful meetings between people, in particular of the young generation. We are convinced that trans-Atlantic relations must systematically be expanded in all fields.
It is the common security in the alliance which is part of this, of the ever closer contacts between the European Community, including political cooperation, and the United States. And this includes also our joint efforts to make our way toward a European peace order within the framework of the C.S.C.E.
Seeing the major changes in Central Europe, East Europe, Southeast Europe, the European Community continues to be an indispensable anchor of European civility. That is why we, the Federal Republic of Germany, in particular myself, do not only want to expand European integration but we want to accelerate this process wherever possible. Beyond the big internal market which is to be achieved on the 31st of December 1992, beyond the economic and monetary union, our primordial aim continues to be political union in Europe. That was the objective of the treaties of Rome and nothing has changed in that area.
It is our joint interest that the reform policy in Central, East and Southeast Europe and, in particular, the policy led by Secretary General Gorbachev and the Soviet Union will be successful. ...
On the path toward German unity, ladies and gentlemen, what we need in particular now is reason and good judgment. We Germans walk along this path with a particular responsibility in the center of Europe. And we're doing so, if you like, along two tracks which are of equal importance. On the one hand, we are leading intensive talks with the G.D.R., and at present we will, in particular, have to concentrate on the customs union and the Economic Community. On the other hand, we do have to consider that the link with our trans-Atlantic partners, that European unity and comprehensive cooperation between East and West are being linked up with the development.
We do respect the legitimate security interests of all states and we respect people's feelings, especially the feelings of our neighbors. And I am saying this particularly addressing our Polish neighbors. The border question will be settled definitely by a freely elected, all-German Government, and a freely elected all-German Parliament. But let me repeat here what I have recently said in Paris already - it was in January of this year - nobody has any intention of linking the question of national unity with changes of existing borders. ...
 
Questions and Answers
BUSH. Helmut, if it's agreeable to you, might I suggest to the press that we alternate the questions between us? Is that agreeable with you, sir?
Q. You have declared, Chancellor, that you do not want a change of borders. Does this mean that you consider the Polish border as final? . . .
KOHL. My answer is very clear. . . . According to the legal situation in our country, it is a freely elected parliament, the sovereign of the people, which has to decide this question. And this is laid down also in the treaties of 1970 and has been mentioned in the conversations which took place in those years again and again.
Beyond this point, I've again and again declared during the past months that - and I do want to repeat - nobody wants to link the question of national unity with changes in existing borders, and nobody is permitted to doubt my attitude there.
Q. Do you consider it excluded that before German unity a treaty be concluded with the Poles, about the Polish border? Do you consider this excluded?
KOHL. If I interpret the wish of the Polish Government correctly, and I think I do, then the Polish Government does have a very national wish that the competent sovereign, the legally competent sovereign, take that decision. In Poland, there are certain circles who wish that, before such a decision to be adopted by an all-German Parliament, decisions be taken in the two German states. In the Federal German, West German Parliament, we have already pronounced ourselves and confirmed our line about the non-changing of borders.
BUSH. Might I just add the U.S. permission, U.S. position, with your permission, Mr. Chancellor. The U.S. respects the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act regarding the inviolability of current borders in Europe. And the U.S. formally recognizes the current German-Polish border. I just wanted to get that in.
Q. Do you think there is some difference between what you have just said and what the Chancellor said? There seems to be some lack, a bit of equivocation on his part. Do you think there is any difference in the U.S. view and what the Chancellor is saying today?
BUSH. I think we're in alignment. I did not, I would not interpret what he said as equivocating at all. And I have just given you the U.S. position. ...
 
Two-Plus-Four Talks
Q. Can you explain for us at this stage precisely how the two-plus-four works? What the sequencing is, whether they are consecutive and (inaudible). There's been so much confusion about that. Who's got what rights?
BUSH. No, that, those details have not been fully worked out in terms of timings of meetings and things of this nature. They have not been worked out. This formula was approved by the foreign ministers in Ottawa, and we simply have not tried to sit here in Camp David and fine tune the procedures for the two-plus-four. ...
KOHL. . . . I'm very happy with the decision adopted in Ottawa, two-plus-four. It is only natural that the two states in Germany, in particular after the 18th of March elections in the G.D.R., will be discussing the subject in a particular way. This is a subject which concerns the Germans in particular. ...
Q. Mr. President, (inaudible) how do the Poles come into this so that, are they just one of the 35 at the end of it?
BUSH. Well, there was, I know of Poland's feeling to want to make two-plus-four into two-plus-five. Is that what you're asking about?
The two-plus-four has been agreed upon. Clearly, no agreement would ever be reached that affects the Polish borders without Polish involvements, but there is no change, we don't sit up here and try to change an agreement that was taken by several countries at Ottawa.
But there will be a lot of consultative mechanisms. KOHL. Yes. BUSH. (inaudible) to deal with the interests, not just of Poland but of our allies and everyone else. And the Chancellor is very good about that, and I hope we've been good about it, and it is essential that we stay on the same wavelength with our allies and friends.
KOHL. Let me underpin what the President just said. I do realize that there is a particular interest on the part of the Poles. And I'm certain that in the course of this process, we will find ways and means of adopting solutions satisfactory to everybody. I think everyone of us has a feeling that there is a particular situation there, but I don't consider it useful that the two of us, while nobody else from among our partners is here, try and decide about things and make declarations today.
 
German Reunification
Q. (inaudible) Europe, from Poland to Britain, and our own former Director of Intelligence, Mr. Helms, has called the German unification march a runaway freight train. Given the history that, the role that Germany played in the two wars in this century, shouldn't there be some assurances before this marriage takes place on borders and security?
BUSH. I think all those matters will be discussed in the various consultative mechanisms that we brought up. But I prefer to look at Germany's 45 years of contribution to democracy and to the security of the West, and that's what we are focusing on. I have stated the U.S. position, which is not to be afraid of German reunification, but to understand when peoples - brother on one side, brother on another - want to get together as one country, as they were before this artificial division that was, that was, resulted as, out of World War II.
So, we've already crossed that bridge. We welcome reunification. But it's not for the United States to set a timetable. It's not for us to say how fast. It is for us to guarantee as best we can in consultation with our allies that whatever evolves will be stable, and that peace will be the result. So, I, I've already given you the view in my statement about the U.S. toward unification. And we are not in a process of trying to speed it up or slow it down. It's a matter for the German people, matter for the discussions that, that will be taking place in multilateral fora.
KOHL. Just a second, let me say something about this, because this is a very central question, I am grateful that was put. The question of German unity is a question of self-, right of self-determination, and all peoples of this earth have the right of self-determination. It's part of the charge of the United Nations, it corresponds to the principles of C.S.C.E., it corresponds to the major democratic traditions of our world. ...
The second point is that the people in the two parts of Germany do want to unify -want to overcome the articles of division. The people in the G.D.R., in a peaceful revolution, I think the most peaceful revolution of history, have made it clear that they want it by shouting: ''We are the people. We are one people.''
Now if I have a particular feeling, seeing and hearing this, and I believe that we do have a responsibility to be conscious of the fact that we are situated, geographically speaking, in the center of Europe. We have a certain history. We must understand that there are certain fears on the part of our neighbors, and I'm talking about serious fears and not only the pretended fears because there are people who pretend they have fears, but what they mean is that they fear the economic power of a Federal Republic plus the G.D.R..
The President very rightly said last year that the Federal Republic was 40 years of age. In the course of 40 years, it was a loyal and reliable partner in human rights and the defense of freedom. ...
But I do take all the other data into consideration. And I've also made it clear . . . that I am among those who want to pursue political union of Europe. The Federal Government is a Government which is ready to delegate further competences to the European Parliament. In other words, we want this united Germany to be ever more embedded in an integration process with its neighbors.
So nobody needs to be afraid. ...
 
Military Resurgence
Q. Mr. President, I'd like to know perhaps the core question: Do you trust that Germany will never become an aggressive, resurgent military power? And if I might ask Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kohl, do you foresake such a posture?
BUSH. I have stated that the U.S. position is that we welcome unification. And clearly, that would not be the position if we held the fears that your question alluded to. I do think that one way to help with stability, not in relation to this question, but European peace and stability is to have a strong NATO and to have U.S. troops, if wanted, stationed in Europe. ...
Q. . . . To Chancellor Kohl, how durable can we see the commitment to NATO and the continued presence of U.S. troops on German soil given the broad support in the Federal Republic right now for a neutral unified Germany, given the probable outcome of the East German elections and given some of the political pressures that you may come under later this year with elections in December?
KOHL. It's my affair, these elections in the Federal Republic of Germany in December, and I'm looking forward to them very calmly. A moment ago I gave you the example, had I been standing here in the autumn, in the fall of 1982 or in January 1982, most of your colleagues would have doubted that the Germans would deploy. We did deploy American missiles, and that is why I really don't think we need to be told what reliability means.
Neutralism would be a very false solution for us. I can't see that there would ever be any majority in the Federal Republic or in a united Germany for a neutralized Germany. I think we have learned lessons and we do not want to repeat the errors of history. But one mistake in the times of the Weimar Republic, of course, was that Germany was isolated in Europe. One must make Germany a part of the whole. ...
 
Instability as Enemy
Q. Mr. President, if I could follow up on a question you were actually asked a week or two ago about who, about who the enemy is these days, it seems that less and less it is the Soviets. So, would one purpose of having, keeping NATO intact and keeping U.S. troops within NATO in Germany be to - as some analysts have said - to keep the Germans down?
BUSH. No. The enemy is unpredictability, the enemy is instability, and it is for that reason that we, there are agreed security provisions, and that's the answer to it. ...
KOHL. I would like to join up with this term, instability. I think this is one of the major tasks of all those responsible in East and West, and it's particularly true for us in Germany. We must do everything possible in order to avoid destabilization in Europe, in particular in Eastern Europe. I will do whatever I can to respond to that aim. As a matter of fact, I do not only agree with the President on this, but also with General Secretary Gorbachev. ...
Q. Mr. President, do you think that at the end of a two-plus-four process there will be a peace treaty, and that a peace treaty will then no longer be necessary?
KOHL. I can give a very simple answer to the first part of your question: Yes.
BUSH. And we agree with that. And eventually the four powers that were set up right at the end of the war, that'll have to be resolved. Whether it requires a formal treaty or something of that nature, I'm not sure. But there will be a resolution, so there will not be a continued need for this four-power arrangement, looking over the shoulders of a democratic unified Germany. ...
 
Security Guarantees
Q. Mr. Chancellor, the desire on both of your parts to have a unified Germany remain in NATO, you also said that there should be some kind of special arrangements to guarantee, provide certain guarantees, security guarantees for Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Does that preclude any participation at all with a unified Germany vis-a-vis the Warsaw Pact? And would it be conceiveable that there could actually be Soviet troops in a unified Germany?
KOHL. One thing is clear: a united Germany cannot belong to two different pact systems. The other point is a question of sovereignty. We will have transition situations, and that is the subject about which one has to negotiate. At present, there are 380,000 soldiers of the Soviet Army. Seeing the reductions one has agreed upon, half of that number will be remaining there for the time being. Many things will have to be looked into, and I cannot and will not give any final position here. ...
Q. Mr. President, can you envisage a situation where U.S. troops are still deployed in Germany while the Soviet Union has withdrawn all its troops from German soil?
BUSH. Yes, I can. And the reason I can envisage such a situation is that, if that's what the Germans want, that's what ought to happen. ...

HEADLINE: Governors and White House Plan Vast Schooling Reform

BYLINE: By EDWARD B. FISKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Declaring that ''sweeping, fundamental changes'' must be made in education, the nation's governors committed themselves today to work with the White House on a 10-year program of reforming primary and secondary schools.
''America's educational performance must be second to none in the 21st century,'' they said in a statement. ''A new standard for an educated citizenry is required.''
Roger Porter, the chief White House domestic policy adviser, said that the ''historic'' action culminated a process that began in September, when President Bush met with the governors in Charlottesville, Va. 
''I am unaware of any time in the previous history of this country that the nation's governors have developed a set of national goals for anything -much less for education - and then agreed to work collectively with the President to accomplish them,'' he said.
 
Bipartisan Panel Pledged
The members of the National Governors Association agreed unanimously at their midwinter meeting on six national goals in education that reflected the cooperation of the White House.
They also pledged to establish a bipartisan panel to monitor progress and urged Mr. Bush to direct some of the savings from reduced military spending to education.
''We urge the President to dedicate the peace dividend in a balanced manner between the Federal budget deficit, education and productivity investments,'' the governors' statement said.
The goals include bolstering preschool programs so that every child will ''start school ready to learn'' and strengthening of mathematics and science achievement to make American students ''first in the world'' in those areas by 2000.
Since the meeting on the University of Virginia campus at Charlottesville, a 14-member study group of the association has been working with Mr. Porter and other White House officials to frame the goals. They were touched upon in summary form in the President's State of the Union Message on Jan. 29.
 
Looking Ahead to 2000
These goals for the year 2000 were adopted here today:
* All children will start school ready to learn.
* The high school graduation rate will increase to at least 90 percent.
* Students will demonstrate in the fourth, eigth and 12th grades that they can handle such subject matter as English, mathematics, science, history, and geography; every school will make sure its students learn to use their minds well so they will be ready for responsible citizenship, further learning, and productive employment.
* American students will rank first in math and science.
* Every adult American will be literate, with the knowledge and skills to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.
* Every school will be free of drugs and violence and offer a disciplined environment conducive to learning.
 
Excellence in Teachers
Making American students the best in the world in math and science, the governors said in their statement, will require a 50 percent increase in the number of teachers with a ''substantive background.''
Prominent educators at today's session hailed the action. Others present had questions. ''You've got to be pleased,'' said Gordon Ambach, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers. ''For the first time in our history, the governors and President have gone together and help set up an ambitious set of goals for education.''
But Keith Geiger, executive director of the National Education Association, the teachers' union, said: ''It's hard to disagree with anything they did. They still have not told us how they are going to pay for it.''
The governors pledged to hold one another accountable for progress through a ''bipartisan group'' to monitor and report regularly on the progress. This group, the governors said, ''should stay in existence until at least the year 2000.''
It was not immediately clear what form that group might take. ''We just haven't had time to think it through,'' Mr. Porter said. Some Democratic governors sought an ''independent bipartisan blue-ribbon group'' of political, business and educational leaders to be named by the President, the governors and Congress. Others argued that, since the governors and the White House had set the goals, they should be responsible for monitoring.
Much of the debate over the last five months revolved around the Federal Government's role in promoting educational reform, especially in preschool programs. Democratic governors urged specific commitments like enough money for Head Start to serve all eligible children; Republicans echoed the Administration's caution about budgetary restraints.

HEADLINE: Canada's Health Care Succeeds Where Ours Doesn't;
Rationalized Services

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Don't Look to Canada's Health System'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 3), Henry M. Lerner argues that Canadian health insurance rations services. Might not rationalization of services be a more accurate description? Unnecessary duplication of services is one cause of high costs. Health insurance in Canada consumes a lower fraction of the gross national product than health care does in the United States, yet Canadians live longer and have lower perinatal mortality.
Having practiced in the United States, I know that the quality of medical care is often proportional to the medical insurance. In Ontario, I can consider whether in vitro fertilization will benefit a couple, knowing that if beneficial, Ontario has allocated the resources. The United States would be a more civilized place to live in if health care were more equitably available.

HEADLINE: Statehood For Puerto Ricans

BYLINE: By Rafael Hernandez Colon; Rafael Hernandez Colon is Governor of Puerto Rico.

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R.

 BODY:
Next year, the people of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico may have a chance to vote themselves into the Union as America's 51st state. I am firmly convinced that statehood is not in the best interest of Puerto Rico or the United States. I believe that the present commonwealth relationship should be continued and enhanced.
But others, including President Bush, want statehood for Puerto Rico. They have endorsed a bill, now before Congress, that contains three options: commonwealth, statehood or independence. Puerto Ricans would vote on these options in 1991; as soon as 51 percent of the voters made their choice, their decision would be implemented automatically. 
But the bill as it now stands does not strike a fair balance among the three options. For example, under statehood, the Federal safety net -food stamps, Medicaid, Social Security and welfare benefits - would be extended to all Puerto Ricans. Yet, under the commonwealth option identical protections would be denied to the same U.S. citizens.
The present bill does not create an even playing field for free determination. To be fair, the bill should make clear that the sovereignty of the commonwealth government would be unequivocal. It should also make clear that such self-government measures as negotiating air routes, setting shipping rates, etc., would be granted.
As little as 5 percent of the population of Puerto Rico has expressed a preference for independence. But if Puerto Ricans were to vote for statehood, there would be many adverse consequences.
Under statehood, our economic development could not continue. Why? Because under the existing arrangement with the U.S., no Federal taxes are levied on the island. This has enabled Puerto Rico to undertake a highly successful economic development program, which has raised its per capita income from $342 in 1950 to $5,574 in 1989. Still, that is less than half of that of Mississippi, the poorest state. Our unemployment rate is now about 14 percent.
Our economic growth is sustained mainly by investments in manufacturing, which accounts for 40 percent of our gross domestic product. Such investment has been promoted since the 1950's through tax incentives offered to industry under commonwealth arrangements. It is the only proven policy to reduce the gap with the mainland in jobs and income.
Our industrial development program could not exist under statehood. The U.S. Constitution demands that Federal taxes throughout the nation must be uniform, thus making our Federal-tax incentive impossible. Taxes in Puerto Rico, except for exempted industries, are already higher than the combined Federal, state and local taxes of most states. Federal taxes on top of these would sink our developing economy into stagnation.
Puerto Rico would be the first state to come into the Union as a dependent of the Federal Treasury. After our transition to statehood, our economy almost certainly would decline. The Federal Government would have to spend $2 billion to $3 billion annually in excess of revenue generated in Federal taxes paid by Puerto Ricans to provide the safety net necessary to make up for a devastated economy.
Another set of problems with statehood are cultural and linguistic. Puerto Rico's language is Spanish; 60 percent of the people do not speak English at all. If Puerto Rico became a state, bilingualism would, in effect, become official U.S. policy.
Culturally, making Puerto Rico a state is the same as making Costa Rica, Honduras or the Dominican Republic a state. Puerto Ricans, including those advocating statehood, consider themselves a people with a strong national identity. A recent poll showed that 91 percent of the people think of themselves as Puerto Ricans first and Americans second.
The U.S. was founded on the premise of e pluribus unum - from many, one. Advocates of statehood would change that into e pluribus duo to accommodate, as a state, a nationality living on its own territory - something quite different from an ethnic minority scattered on the mainland. So far, this potentially emotional issue has merited no debate in the Congress. It deserves serious attention.
The Congress thus faces some tough political, economic, fiscal and cultural decisions in order to go ahead with the referendum bill. The task calls for fairness and statecraft of the highest order.
Otherwise, the people of Puerto Rico might choose to become the 51st state simply because this prospect offers some quick revenues through the Federal system. Yet statehood would destroy our economic achievements and the possibilities of commonwealth - a noble experiment in flexible political relationships for people with different cultures.

HEADLINE: Portrait of a Leading Family Enduring the Hurt of Drugs

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Feb. 23

 BODY:
At a grade school here during a celebration of Black History Month the other day, Mayor John C. Daniels warned the children ''to stay out of trouble and stay away from drugs.''
Sadly, the Mayor knows the alternative. His brother Robert has had a drug problem for years, the Mayor said in an interview.
Early this month a warrant was issued for the arrest of Robert Daniels, a 48-year-old unemployed boutique clerk, on a charge of selling $200 worth of cocaine to an undercover police officer. After staying out of sight for several days, Mr. Daniels surrendered to his youngest brother, Melvin, a police detective, and was jailed on Feb. 6. He has since been released on bond. 
The five Daniels siblings, who range from the Mayor to the detective to a librarian, reflect an increasingly common reality of American life today. Despite evidences of success and forthrightness in a family, almost anyone, it sometimes seems, can fall victim to drugs.
 
An Embarrassing Pain
''It happens to bankers, it happens to preachers,'' Mayor Daniels said. ''I can hold my head up high.'' But the arrest has embarrassed and pained the Mayor and his family. Mr. Daniels, 53, campaigned hard as a Democrat on an anti-drug platform in this city of 127,000 people where narcotics and violence are rampant.
Last year there were 34 homicides in New Haven, a city record. More than 20 of the killings were drug-related.
''I love my brother,'' Mayor Daniels said recently. ''And I hurt very, very much. Not because of the embarrassment, but because of the agony and pain my parents have gone through.''
The arrest has also generated a good deal of sympathy and some fear that ''this scourge will attack every family sooner or later,'' said the Rev. Edwin R. Edmonds, pastor of the Dixwell Avenue United Church of Christ, which the Mayor attends.
''It's also made John more human to a lot of people,'' Mr. Edmonds said. ''It's the I'm-in-the-same-boat syndrome.''
 
Not Guilty Plea Entered
Last Tuesday Robert Daniels pleaded not guilty to a series of charges, including operating a drug factory.
The police had raided his apartment in a shabby two-story frame house on Feb. 1 and had said they found three ounces of cocaine and some small plastic bags for packaging the drug.
''It's a story that is very, very sad,'' said a local Republican businessman, Henry C. Campbell. ''Here's a good family, a strong family and something goes wrong. Instead of people condemning, we should all be talking about a cure.''
It was Mr. Daniels's first arrest, but not his first experience with narcotics, family members and friends said. He has been haunted by a drug habit, and six years ago received treatment at a drug-abuse center.
 
'We All Tried to Help Him'
''I knew he was involved, but I thought he had cleaned up his act,'' said a cousin and businessman, Eugene Huckaby Jr. ''We all tried to help him. But he's a grown man. What can you do?''
By most accounts, Robert Daniels is a decent, likable man, with a charming personality that served him well as a salesman in his cousin's boutique. He worked there until about a year ago, when he left because he wanted a higher-paying job.
''I would have hired him back until this happened,'' Mr. Huckaby said. ''He was a retail genius.''
Along Dixwell Avenue here, Robert Daniels is known as Dan, short for Daniels. People smile when they talk about him.
''Dan could convince you to buy anything in the store,'' said Virginia Wells, owner of the Monterey Cafe, a popular night spot. ''Of all the hats, gloves and scarfs that I own,'' she said, ''I didn't go in there to buy them originally. But Dan talked me into it.''
 
Proud of Two Daughters
Robert Daniels has two daughters, who are equally accomplished sales people. They worked side by side with their father. ''He was very proud of them,'' Ms. Wells said. ''They, too, have a flair for dress and style like their dad.''
In the last few years, Ms. Wells said, she began hearing rumors that ''Dan was doing too much coke.''
''You hear that about a lot of people,'' she said. ''It's sad, because most of them think they have complete control. Dan didn't. But he could make you smile, and I think that's a gift. I pray for him. ''
At Hillhouse High School - which the three Daniels brothers and their two sisters, Joyce, 48, an office worker, and Agnes, 50, a librarian, attended - Robert Daniels was the life of the schoolyard. A dapper ladies' man , he listed his hobbies in the 1960 yearbook as dancing and sports.
An asthma condition, however, kept him on the athletic sidelines.
 
Effort Pays Off for Brothers
But his older brother, John, a serious, studious type, was a star on and off the field. In 1954 he was named New Haven's Boy of the Year and sat in the mayor's chair during a visit to City Hall. He was on the track and football teams in high school, being named All-State as a running back.
He did well in the classroom, too, attending Villanova University on an athletic scholarship. ''Without it,'' he said recently, ''I'd probably be on the corner.''
Before becoming Mayor, John Daniels served as a City Alderman and later a State Senator in this southern Connecticut city.
''I've known John for 30 years and he's always wanted to be a politician,'' said Joseph Grate, a businessman in the Dixwell Avenue section of the city. ''But he's always been kind of quiet. He's never been one of the guys you would see out every Saturday night.''
Mr. Grate laughed. ''Yeah, that's pretty unusual for a politician.''
 
The Quiet, Efficient Officer
The youngest of the Daniels brothers, Melvin, 45, was quiet and shy in high school, Ms. Wells said, and showed little interest in sports.
''I never thought he'd become a policeman,'' she said. ''He wasn't as aggressive as some of the guys who said they wanted to be a fireman or a cop. He was and is a gentlemen. If there's one word to describe him, that's it.''
Mr. Grate, who owns a gasoline service station, said he had watched Detective Daniels patrol the Dixwell Avenue area for years.
''He's tough, but he's the kind of guy who you wouldn't know was a cop if he didn't have a uniform on,'' Mr. Grate said. ''He's soft-spoken. He's not big in stature either. But I've seen him in operation, and he can handle himself.''
Mayor Daniels said there was nothing specific he could point to to tell why his brother Robert had stumbled into trouble.
''My dad is doing a lot better than his dad, and I'm doing a lot better than mine,'' he said. ''Somewhere along the line some people get sidetracked and it doesn't work out that way. I don't know why. I wish I did.''
 
Father a Church Deacon
The Mayor's father, John Sr., 75, is a devout, strict man. He has been a deacon at St. Matthew's Unison Free Will Baptist Church for more than 50 years, and Sunday school was mandatory for the Daniels children.
He worked on a dairy farm in Macon, Ga., and never finished school. But he taught himself to read by studying newspapers and the Bible.
In 1936 he brought his wife, Ludelia, and his newborn son, John, to New Haven in search of a better job. The Daniels were one of the first families to move into the Elm Haven public housing development in 1942, then a series of low-rise buildings with well-maintained small yards. There the family lived, at 70 Webster Street, and the Mayor said it was like paradise compared with the cold-water flat that the family had moved from.
 
Paradise Lost
But paradise was lost a long time ago in Elm Haven. Today 11-year-old Travis Smith lives at 70 Webster with his family, and the lawn is more dirt than grass. The night often crackles with drug-related gunfire.
''Every night,'' Travis said, ''all you hear is pow, pow, pow.''
Asked what he thought about the Mayor's brother being arrested for drugs, Travis shrugged his slight shoulders.
''The Mayor has other things to do than sit around and baby-sit his grown brother,'' the boy said. ''He has a city to run.''

HEADLINE: Plan Is Offered to Stabilize the World Birth Rate

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
In a country-by-country report made public today, the Population Crisis Committee estimates that the world population can be stabilized in the 21st century only if countries make birth control universally available by 2000 at a cost of about $10.5 billion a year.
The world's population is now estimated by the United Nations to be 5.3 billion people. The report by the population committee, a nonprofit research group based in Washington, estimates that the population will reach 14 billion if birth control is not used much more widely.
''Action taken over the critical decade of the 1990's will largely determine whether the world's population will merely double before stabilizing, or will at least triple,'' said the report, ''1990 Report on Progress Towards Population Stabilization.'' 
 
'A Preventable Disaster'
A doubling or tripling of the population over the next century ''is a preventable disaster,'' said Dr. Sharon L. Camp, vice president of the Population Crisis Committee, a senior writer who worked on the report.
''We have what it would take, the financial resources and the know-how, to solve the problem, and to do so in our children's lifetime,'' Dr. Camp said.
Population experts have said it would be difficult to sustain the world economy and political order with twice as many people, and impossible to sustain it at three times the current world population.
Dr. Malcolm Potts, president of Family Health International, a nonprofit organization in Research Triangle Park, N.C., which deals with family planning and health, said that wars and disease, which could result from growth, would still not slow the population rise.
''We may kill as many as died in Hiroshima every day, day in and day out over the century, and you would not slow population growth,'' Dr. Potts said.
 
Report 'Lays Out a Choice'
He said the report is important ''because it lays out a choice we really face in the 1990's.''
''This is the last decade we will have freedom of choice on this matter; after that, the state will just tell us what to do, as has happened in China,'' he said. In China, it is generally illegal to have more than one child per famly.
Despite the gloomy predictions, Dr. Potts said the problem is soluble. ''This report gives people a businesslike plan to work on, instead of just throwing up our hands and saying this is too hard a problem,'' he said. ''People will take the reasonable course if given the choices.''
For instance, the report noted that three-quarters of all birth control pills sold in Latin American are bought at full price, as opposed to some countries in which contraceptives are supplied largely from donors. In addition, the report said that $2.5 billion of the $3.2 billion being spent each year on family planning worldwide is spent by developing countries.
Still, other experts were skeptical of the report.
''The goals in the report are not impossible, but they are highly optimistic,'' said Dr. John Bongaarts, chief of research at the Population Council, a nonprofit group based in New York that does population research. ''You can't just throw money at the problem. It will take political will and desire of families in developing countries to have fewer children.''
 
Report Sets a Goal
The report sets a goal of making birth control universally available by the year 2000, and achieving a world rate of contraceptive use at 75 percent, in which 75 percent of couples use birth control in their fertile years.
Contraceptive use currently ranges from an average of 68 percent in developing countries like Thailand to less than 6 percent in Cameroon. Twenty-nine countries already have contraceptive use at 75 percent with an average of no more than two children a family, the rate at which population growth stops.
The report calls for increased spending by developing and industrialized nations to a maximum of $10.5 billion by the year 2000, after which spending levels would remain fairly constant for some years, and then start declining.
Dr. Potts said the money needed is ''trivial - if we had a penny a day from each taxpayer in industrialized countries, that would be more than enough.''
Dr. Kenneth Hill, a professor of population dynamics at Johns Hopkins University, said the report was largely ''hypothetical, and unlikely to happen.''
Dr. Hill said that based on estimates by him as well as the World Bank, a lesser effort might produce the same effect, stabilization of the world population at 11 billion people in 2100.
 
Experience Bodes Well
The report said that recent experience has reinforced the organization's belief that 75 percent contraceptive use can be attained. For instance, contraceptive use in Zimbabwe has risen steadily, to 43 percent in 1987 from 5 percent in 1976, and the upward trend is continuing. That is in sharp contrast to other African nations in similar economic difficulties, where contraceptive use is below 15 percent and has remained unchanged for some time.
In Mexico, contraceptive use rose from 13 percent in 1973 to 53 percent in 1987; in Indonesia, from 19 percent in 1976 to 48 percent in 1987.
Other developing nations that are making rapid progress in the use of contraceptives include Malaysia, North Korea, Peru, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Botswana, the report said.
The report also cited surveys in Asia and Latin America that showed that 75 percent of the women in those regions want modern contraceptives, though they are not always available.

HEADLINE: Poland's Rush for Modern Banks

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
Marian Kanton, the president of Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A., readily admits that Poland's banking system is far behind the West's.
It often takes a month for a check to clear, and customers frequently wait in line for an hour to make a deposit. The 22 branches of Mr. Kanton's bank, one of Poland's largest, cannot be linked to a single computer network because Poland's telephone system is so outmoded. What is more, his hopes of setting up a credit card operation seem doomed for the time being because most merchants do not understand or trust these foreign plastic objects.
All these problems hurt Poland's economy because a rickety banking system undermines investment and trade. Although it will mean more competition, Mr. Kanton says Western banks must set up shop in Warsaw to prod Polish banks into becoming more modern and efficient. 
''They will bring innovations and banking techniques that are generally unknown here,'' he said, mentioning automated teller machines and money-management techniques.
Nonetheless, Mr. Kanton, who is 44 years old and has the dignity, ease and fluent English of an internatonal banker, scoffs at Westerners who suggest that Poland's banking system remains frozen in the Dark Ages.
''Our banking system is not so bad, although there are, of course, some inefficiencies,'' Mr. Kanton said in his pre-World War II office with 20-foot ceilings and antique cherry wood furniture. ''The system is going through very rapid changes to adapt for the future.''
Throughout Eastern Europe, banks are being transformed. Just a few years ago, they did little more than follow orders, shoveling money to whatever enterprises, even hopelessly inefficient ones, that were deemed in need by Communist central planners.
''Centrally planned economies just didn't need banks,'' said Marian Krzak, a former finance minister who heads the Polish State Savings Bank. ''Banks were there just to take deposits, tally up figures and dole out money. Now we're seeing that banks are vital for a market economy.''
As Poland and its neighbors move toward capitalism, the once-inconsequential banks are being transformed into crucial tools for fostering efficiency. Poland's Solidarity-led Government is demanding that most banks become independent and self-supporting, and as the banks seek to make profits, they will play an essential role in restructuring the economy, by steering investment money to promising enterprises and denying loans to inefficient ones, helping to nudge them into oblivion.
 
New Era in Banking
Every morning, Mr. Kanton and his top managers map out steps preparing for a brave new banking era. His bank has beefed up its training program to teach loan officers more about assessing credit risks and analyzing balance sheets. He is sending 150 middle managers to banks in the United States, Britain and West Germany to study money-management techniques and the organizational structure of Western banks.
He has also started an investment banking arm to work on the planned privatizations of state industries. And his bank has more than 20 branches under construction. For decades, it was difficult to obtain the land or approval for new branches.
''Everything is possible for us now, but it all takes time,'' Mr. Kanton said.
For his customers, the changes are coming none too soon. In his bank's pillared halls, lines of 30 and 40 customers snake out the door.
 
Maddening Lines
''The lines here are maddening,'' said Marek Kowalczyk, manager of a trading firm and the 15th in line to make a deposit. ''This bank needs more branches. This city needs more banks.''
In Western parlance, Eastern Europe is underbanked. Just 30 bank branches serve Warsaw's 1.8 million people, while 350 branches serve Vienna's 1.5 million people. Some bank branches in Warsaw handle 100,000 accounts, more than 20 times the number in many Western banks. Making it easier for Poles to deposit and withdraw money was never high on the agenda of central planners.
''In the West, when you want to open an account, you are welcomed,'' said Wladyslaw Czulno, assistant to the president of Poland's central bank. ''In Poland, when you want to open account, you sometimes need protection from the huge crowds.''
The way customers are treated is also changing. In a sector where competition was, until recently, nonexistent, there are now American-style interest-rate wars and blaring television ads to attract deposits.
To increase the number of banks and upgrade services, the National Bank of Poland, the central bank, is wooing foreign bankers. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank of West Germany, Societe Generale of France and Banca Commerciale Italiana are among the banks that have obtained licenses to set up representative offices. Citicorp has expressed interest. What is more, the International Finance Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank, is working to set up a joint venture between four large international banks and a Polish bank.
''Foreign banks are important because they can help channel foreign capital to Poland,'' Mr. Czulno said. ''Banking skills will be spread if we have foreign banks, especially when Polish banks are involved in joint ventures with them.''
But some foreign bankers are daunted by the difficulties of doing business in Poland, like the 1,000 percent inflation, the difficulties of finding office space and the near-impossibility of telephoning from Warsaw to many towns. Before planting the flag, many foreign bankers are waiting for the economy to stabilize and for telecommunications to improve.
Nonetheless, there is far more competition than before. Some 30 Polish entrepeneurs have applied to start banks.
 
New Banking Companies
One banker who has done the same is Witold Sulimirski, a former senior vice president of the Irving Trust Company. He has received a license to open the American Bank in Poland, which will have starting capital of $7.5 million. It is opening with 25 employees and hopes to be a commercial bank serving foreign joint ventures and an investment bank for the stock and bond markets that are planned for Poland. ''This country is moving toward a market-driven economy,'' said Mr. Sulimirski, who is chairman of the supervisory board of the new bank, ''and we know that change produces opportunity.''
''Poland has a good idea of how a commercial banking system should be organized, but there is a real shortage of banking skills,'' said a banking adviser from one international organization. Polish bankers need to learn more about establishing internal controls, pricing loans and managing bad loans, the adviser said.
Many Poles are eager for foreign banks to arrive, because they believe that their holdings of hard currency will be safer with them. Poles keep an estimated $4 billion in hard currency at home, much of it gifts from relatives abroad. Many of these people had worried that if they put this ''mattress money'' in Polish banks, the former Communist Government might freeze, restrict, or even expropriate their money. In 1981, the Government froze hard-currency accounts when martial law was declared.
Mr. Kanton's bank has $3 billion in hard-currency deposits, having been designated the principal bank for Poles willing to entrust their United States dollars and German marks to domestic banks. Because inflation has been so high, many Poles have refused to deposit their zlotys, knowing the value would rapidly erode. But now that inflation has started to slow and the zloty has been made partly convertible, there is expected to be less reluctance to deposit zlotys.
 
Domestic Competition
Mr. Kanton said he was not worried about foreign competitors. In his view, the toughest competition will come from former regional branches of Poland's central bank that were spun off last February.
Already, Warsaw-based banks and the new regional banks are advertising interest rates in newspapers and on television. Lending officers are starting to knock on the doors of potential clients.
''The game is on,'' said Jan Cesarz, chairman of the year-old Bank of Gdansk on the northern coast. ''We have to become self-sufficient, and that means we have to work hard to attract deposits.''
Mr. Cesarz is proud that his bank is offering depositors an interest rate of 22 percent a month in February, while Lodz's regional bank is offering 21 percent, and the new bank in Cracow is advertising 18 percent.
Although 22 percent a month may sound high, it is half the rate Poland's banks paid in January.

HEADLINE: Trade Talks Seem to Be at Impasse;
U.S. Stepping Up Pressure on Japan

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
The Bush Administration and an increasingly impatient Congress are intensifying pressure on Japan to slash import barriers and work down the nearly $400 billion of surpluses that Japan enjoyed in its trade with the United States over the last decade.
After a respite during last week's elections, which gave Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's Liberal Democratic Party a new mandate, the United States and Japan have resumed talks on an unusually broad range of bilateral trade issues against the backdrop of what many here consider a dangerous erosion of tolerance.
The White House announced on Saturday that to try to improve the atmosphere, Prime Minister Kaifu and President Bush had agreed to meet this Friday and Saturday in Palm Springs, Calif.
''It's clear that the trade relationship will be front and center,'' said the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, after the announcement. 
 
Strident Rhetoric
While the two countries have made little progress in easing tensions, the calls for action within the United States, echoing the bilateral differences, have become more strident.
''For the first time in at least two decades, you have open hostility between those on either side of the trade debate,'' said Alan W. Wolff, a former deputy United States trade representative now representing chiefly domestic trade clients in Washington.
Some hostility is seen in the derogatory shorthand terms used to denote the opposing groups. Anyone critical of Japanese protectionism is a ''Japan basher.'' Apologists become members of the ''Chrysanthemum Club,'' after Japan's national flower.
The abrasiveness touches the policy debate in Washington.
''What troubles me is that markets are not open so that we don't have a growth potential,'' Mrs. Hills said, referring to Japan. ''It creates a very bad public policy background.''
David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, noted that while Americans admire Japan's economic success, ''We have been frustrated by a system that seems to operate contrary to many of our basic principles of fairness and openness.''
The Bush Administration is talking with Japan on everything from prohibitively high Japanese tariffs on wood products and ''Buy Japan'' practices in digital telecommunications to ''dango,'' a Japanese term for the collusion among Japanese companies in determining bid levels and even contract winners in the construction market.
In what for the United States is also an election year, with Japanese trade issues being linked to jobs and economic competitiveness, Congress is closely monitoring the negotiations.
 
Explosive Situation
Making the situation potentially more explosive than in prior years are legislatively mandated deadlines that reduce Presidential discretion in judgments about imposing sanctions on Japan if there is no market-opening progress.
To keep the pressure on, lawmakers are preparing additional bills that would affect Japanese interests.
On Thursday, for instance, the Senate Finance Committee expects to draft legislation initiated by its trade subcommittee chairman, Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, mandating retaliation if negotiations do not succeed by June in opening Japanese markets in wood products, supercomputers and satellites.
June 16 is the target date for opening these sectors under the so-called Super 301 section of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act.
 
Three Choices Now
She now has three choices. She can drop the cases if she finds the barriers have been removed, extend negotiations for six months on the ground that progress warrants continuation of the talks, or retaliate.
The Baucus bill, as now being shaped, would greatly reduce discretion by removing the option of extending the negotiations.
As a Montanan up for re-election this year, Senator Baucus has his eyes chiefly on forest products, a big export of his state. He said at a news conference on Thursday that in wood products alone Japanese trade barriers are costing the United States $1 billion to $2 billion of lost exports and 10,000 jobs each year.
Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, is sponsoring two proposals touching the Japanese.
One would require lobbyists of the American subsidiaries of Japanese and other foreign companies to register with the Justice Department as ''foreign agents'' under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
 
Registration Net
Such registration, which involves publicly identifying clients, payments and services rendered, is now required only for the lobbyists of the parent companies. The registration requirement would also apply to lawyers who handle legal matters for foreign companies.
The second Heinz bill is backed by the lobby for American chip makers, the Semiconductor Industry Association, and would mandate an annual review of all trade agreements.
Should the bill become law, the President could impose sanctions, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, to cover lost American chip exports in the Japanese market.
 
Mandated Timetables
Still another proposal, this one also from Senator Baucus, would mandate Super 301 timetables and retaliation to cover the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative, which is focused on eliminating broader structural problems that swell the trade deficit and hurt two-way investment.
Japan's restrictive land-use policy, antiquated distribution system, methods of setting prices and anticompetitive business practices are among the American targets.

HEADLINE: New Role For Bank In Germany

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The rapid move toward the unification of the two Germanys is pushing the West German Government and the country's renowned central bank, the Bundesbank, to the center of the world's economic stage alongside the United States and Japan.
And the change, which is coming much faster than anticipated, has led to more volatility in the financial markets. In the last few weeks the rising interest rates in West Germany have precipitated falls in the world's bond and stock markets or have helped feed declines started by other forces.
The addition of West Germany as a third lever in moving markets up or down had generally been expected to happen as part of the European Community's move in 1992 to drop internal trade barriers and create a single market. While the country's economic presence has been felt more and more because of its dominant role in the European Monetary System, the Bundesbank has played a purposefully muted role in the last several years, some economists say. 
 
Faster Timetable
But the reunification of Germany - and the naturally larger role that its larger economy would play in Eastern and Western Europe - has brought the timetable forward.
''These developments certainly accelerate this process,'' said John Lipsky, director of international bond trading for Salomon Brothers in London. ''And it is likely to keep volatility relatively high.''
Giles Keating, the chief economist at Financiere Credit Suisse First Boston in London, said: ''For several years Germany has been in a position to do this. But now Germany has been catapulted into the open by these events.''
This emergence of West Germany means there is likely to be even more pressure on the Bundesbank to prove that it will sustain its role as a staunch fighter of inflation. That might prove difficult if economists are right in expecting a burst in price increases as a result of the economic merger of the two Germanys.
 
Inflationary Pressures
''There is a perception - but it is very difficult to quantify - that the rebuilding of Eastern Europe will be inflationary,'' said Peter Rona, president of IBJ Schroder Bank and Trust Company in New York. ''Therefore, Germany will have to cope with the inflationary effect of that.''
The Bundesbank will be watched closely. Its president, Karl Otto Pohl, recently had to do a sudden about-face: he had called the idea of a quick union of the two Germanys ''a very fantastic idea,'' but once the Government made a commitment to proceed quickly, he was obligated to support that position.
To assert itself, the Bundesbank could raise interest rates, which would show that it is committed to holding down inflation, said Jonathan Hoffman, the European economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. But the Bundesbank may be more likely to wait until there is some more specific economic data to react to, especially since wholesale inflation in West Germany dropped two-tenths of 1 percent in January.
 
Difficult Period
Yet without some move by the Bundesbank, the period between now and the March 18 elections in East Germany could be especially difficult for the bond and stock markets. One issue that is stirring the markets is the rate of exchange for the East German mark, the ostmark, into West German marks. In the last week, German officials said they might set several different rates for converting ostmarks in an effort to balance social and economic needs.
The fear that inflation will rise sharply as a result of reunification of the two Germanys intensified last week with some new estimates that prices could rise by as much as 6 percent in West Germany this year. Some economists dismiss the estimates. Salomon Brothers, for instance, predicts the increase will be 4 percent. But the higher estimates are still affecting the market.
In addition, estimates of the immediate cost to the West German Government of reunification have risen sharply, pushing estimates of its budget deficit from seven billion marks to as high as 50 billion marks.
Mr. Rona of IBJ Schroder also said the threat of large bankruptcies in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany was pushing interest rates higher.
 
Since Comecom Collapsed
He said those bankruptcies would reflect the collapse of the East bloc trading system, known as Comecom. Because of that, many companies have not been paid for their goods. In addition, the conditions for loans from the International Monetary Fund are also putting a strain on these economies.
In Japan, interest rates were rising as well. That reflected investors' expectations that the Bank of Japan would again raise the important discount rate soon to fight inflation and help a sagging yen. This expectation was heightened when the country's money supply rose sharply in January and the yen continued to decline.
These developments helped push the West German bond yields to 9 percent on Tuesday, the highest in more than seven years, and to more than 7 percent in Japan.
With the uncertainty on reunifification underpinning interest rates in West Germany, a rise in rates in Japan or the United States could send the bond and stock markets tumbling again. The Bank of Japan is still expected to push interest rates higher to fight inflation and support the sagging yen. In the United States, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said last week that interest rates would not decline soon because the weakest point in the economic slowdown may have passed.

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Declined 4.2% In January

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Reflecting the continued downturn in the automotive industry, orders for American-made machine tools slipped 4.2 percent in January from December's level, according to a monthly report to be released today.
Analysts said the suspension of certain capital-spending programs among automobile makers helped to push down the level of new machine tool orders. They also said the decline in new orders in January reflected the surge in new orders that typically occurs in December.
The Association for Manufacturing Technology, the trade association for the machine tool industry, said new orders dropped to $197.6 million in January, from December's level of $206.3 million. New orders last month were down 14.4 percent from $230.8 million in January 1989. 
As a result of weaker orders over the last year, machine tool builders have increasingly been turning to business outside the automobile industry, as well as seeking orders from overseas. New orders from foreign customers increased 44.8 percent in January from December's level, while domestic orders were down 12.2 percent. Compared with January of last year, orders from foreign customers increased 45 percent.
''We are pleased to see some positive numbers on the export side,'' said Albert W. Moore, president of the association, based in McLean, Va. ''But with Europe and Japan retooling and East Europe gearing up, United States manufacturers must move even more aggressively in these very competitive markets.''
Machine tools are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts used in a variety of products, from appliances and vehicles to aircraft and construction materials. The strength of machine tool orders generally reflects the strength in industrial production, and economists consider their sales patterns to be important indicators of capital spending patterns by manufacturers.
 
Some Optimism
Mr. Moore expressed optimism for conditions in the industry for the rest of this year, despite predictions by many economists of a slowdown or recession in the economy.
''There are several trends independent of the business cycle pointing to potential demand for machine tools,'' he said, adding that demand would be stimulated by high backlogs among aerospace companies, as well as by ''the need to replace farm machinery and the increasingly urgent need to rebuild much of the nation's aging infrastructure.''
Officials of machine tool companies expressed similar optimism on the prospects for this year. ''From discussions we've had with our customers, it seems that capital spending programs are going ahead uninterrupted,'' said John F. Townsend, vice president of planning business development for Giddings & Lewis Inc., a machine tool producer based in Fond du Lac, Wis.
''We are seeing greater strength in the area of general industrial equipment like pumps, valves and compressors,'' Mr. Townsend said. ''We've also seen strength in the farm equipment sector and in aerospace, particularly commercial aircraft. Whatever downturn there has been seems to be pretty much confined to the automobile industry.''
 
Looking to Europe
Still, a declining level of new orders from automobile makers, who account for about a third of the demand for machine tools, can depress the machine tool industry. Consequently, many machine tool manufactuers have turned to Europe, where demand is growing at a steady pace.
At the same time, analysts say, sales by American machine tool manufacturers are being affected by a growing number of Japanese machine tool companies that have establshed a presence in the United States. Figures from the Japan Economic Institute indicate that the number of such companies has grown to 36, from 17 three years ago. The Association for Manufacturing Technology said it had no data on the market penetration of Japanese tool makers in the United States.
The association report shows that new orders for metal-cutting tools, which include boring mills and lathes, were down 11.1 percent in January, to $140.9 million. That segment of the industry typically accounts for about three-fourths of the industry's orders. New orders for metal-forming tools increased 18.7 percent, to $56.7 million. Compared with January 1989, new orders for metal-cutting tools were down 15.6 percent while new orders for metal-forming tools declined 11.2 percent.
Shipments of machine tools plunged 40.9 percent in January, to $224.1 million, from $379.3 million in December. Compared with January 1989, shipments increased 47.2 percent, the association said.
The order backlog for January was $1.77 billion, down from December's $1.80 billion. The January 1989 backlog level was $2.28 billion.

Retailing Trouble Is Fundamental

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
AS everyone knows, retailers are in trouble.
 
Bankruptcies have put Bloomingdale's, Saks
Fifth Avenue and other big-name department stores on the auction block. And in a weak economy, consumers are being extra careful about spending. But once the bankruptcies are history and the economy is robust again, America's retailers will still be in trouble. The problem is that the public is rattling around in too many stores - with too much shopping space. 
This space glut is widely acknowledged among retailers. Ira Silver, chief economist of J. C. Penney Company, holds a typical view. ''To be successful in this situation, you have to be a really good merchant,'' he said. ''But if everyone somehow got to be a really good merchant, there would still be a shakeout because we are a nation with too much store space for the number of buyers.''
That is hard on retailers, but a bonanza for consumers in two respects. With so much space in which to offer all sorts of merchandise, the price discounting that became widespread last year, particularly in clothing, is likely to continue. Secondly, to make themselves immune to the oversupply of store space, some big retailers are trying to be more sensitive to the needs of shoppers.
Thus, Penney found itself selling general merchandise - refrigerators, auto parts, consumer electronics, gardening equipment, clothing - in big shopping malls that in the 1980's developed an overabundance of this type of store. ''We switched to high-quality apparel, a market segment that was not over-stored in our shopping centers,'' Mr. Silver said.
Similarly, Nordstrom Inc., the big West Coast clothing store chain that is expanding in the East, has drawn customers by smothering them with smiling sales people. ''You have to focus on something, and our focus is customer service,'' said John Goesling, Nordstrom's chief financial officer.
But the overcapacity produces plenty of stress. There are constant store closings and job losses, mostly among smaller operations. ''It does terrible things to people's careers,'' said Alice McCord of the National Retail Merchants Association.
Even retail workers who keep their jobs feel the strain. Nordstrom, for instance, has been accused by the State of Washington of systematically failing to pay sales people for some work. The company is said to have required employees to work some hours without punching in their time cards. Mr. Goesling did not comment on the charges. But he says that Nordstrom ''expects a lot from our people and is not a place for everyone to work.''
If overcapacity is disruptive, measuring the extent of it is complicated. Commerce Department data indicate that retail sales space has been increasing at a faster rate than sales revenue and that space in the nation's shopping malls - the main area of expansion - has grown by 20 percent since 1986. But shopper traffic through the malls has risen by less than 10 percent, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.
The glut is, however, uneven. The Sun Belt states are very over-stored, while those around the Great Lakes have escaped the problem. What is more, store construction rises in tandem with housing construction rather than higher sales revenue, according to George Christie, chief economist at the F. W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill, which compiles construction data. If people buy more, that simply allows nearby retailers to make greater use of existing space.
Mr. Christie says that from 1970 until 1985, retail floor space grew invariably by 200 million square feet for every one million new single-family houses. And then in 1985, store construction jumped to 250 million square feet for every million new houses and stayed at this ratio through last year, although construction has slowed in recent months. ''We might get back to a normal ratio this year or next,'' Mr. Christie said.
Why the overbuilding? Two factors were cash-rich pension funds seeking profitable investments and savings and loan associations no longer required to lend only for housing. They decided that shopping malls would pay off, and many of the bigger ones have. But the thousands of ''strip centers'' of half-a-dozen small stores are suffering from high turnover and vacancy rates.
The overbuilding coincided with other trends that reduced the supply of shoppers. The baby boomers do not shop as much as they did when they were mostly under 30. Working women are not big shoppers either. And many families buy from catalogues rather than stores.
Clearly, this is a hard period for retailers, and it seems likely to last until floor space gets back into line with demand - perhaps by 1993, Mr. Christie said. Retailers, in effect, are now paying the price for the exuberant building boom of the 1980's.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
The Business Scene column yesterday misstated the reason Saks Fifth Avenue was put up for sale. The action is part of a strategy by Saks's owner, B.A.T. Industries P.L.C., to defend itself from a takeover. It is not because of any bankruptcy filing.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Pepsi Is Open for Business in India

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Feb. 25

 BODY:
A company called Pepsi Foods made its debut in India last week, selling cumin-flavored potato chips and an Indian version of Cheetos seasoned with fenugreek.
Pepsi-Cola itself - or Pepsi Era, as it will be known here - will come later, probably in April when the weather turns oppressive. By then, the controversy promises to be as hot as the weather because the company has to pay as much attention to politics as to the competition and its market share. 
It has been more than a decade since Coca-Cola was forced out of India by a strongly nationalist Industry Minister, George Fernandes. Mr. Fernandes is back in the Government again, although not as Industry Minister, and is leading a crusade against Pepsico Inc. The American company owns 39.9 percent of Pepsi Foods Private Ltd.
The Indian-registered company, whose other shareholders are Voltas, a subsidiary of the giant Tatas group, and the Punjab Agro Industries Corporation, a state government company, has set up food-processing and drink-making operations in Punjab state, an area where jobs are needed to help curtail the growth of a Sikh separatist movement that draws on unemployed young men.
 
Potato Chip Factory
More than 300 people are already at work for Pepsi Foods, many in a potato chip plant at Channo, in Patiala district. The company calls the factory ''the most advanced snack-food plant in Asia.''
Pepsi Foods says that by the end of the year 20,000 people will have benefited indirectly from the company's operations, most of them in farming communities.
As part of the agreement that allowed Pepsico to enter India, even as a minority partner, the company agreed to set up agricultural research and training centers to improve crop yields and introduce new varieties of fruits and vegetables. Punjabis, who brought about India's Green Revolution in wheat and rice, are considered the country's most able farmers.
The company announced last week that it had just secured a huge export order for four metric tons of tomato paste, to be produced by a new fruit and vegetable processing plant in the Hoshiarpur district. Pepsi foods also hopes to process chilis, mushrooms, pears, guava and citrus fruits.
With an eye on local politics, Pepsi Foods somewhat defensively introduced the managing directors of Pepsi's Chinese and Soviet operations at a news conference last week. Those executives showed films about the high level of cooperation between Pepsico and those countries.
 
Objection to Luxuries
Mr. Fernandes's objections to American soft drinks, which he regards as unacceptable luxuries in a land without clean drinking water, find acceptance among many Indians brought up on a creed of self-reliance and a deep-seated fear of Americanization.
An assortment of other left-of-center politicians and a large Indian soft-drink manufacturer, Parle - which controls 70 percent of the annual sales of 6.52 million bottles - have joined in Mr. Fernandes's drive against Pepsico.
The first television advertisement, to be broadcast today, is clearly aimed at Westernized Indians, with its rock music and skyscraper graphics. The Pepsi snack foods are selling under the English-language brand name Hostess. Pepsi Era, the soft drink, will have labels in Hindi and English.
Ramesh Vangal, the managing director of Pepsi Foods, said he was not entirely surprised that controversy should arise as Pepsi Era prepares to enter the soft-drink market. He said that from the day the company first expressed interest in entering the Indian market, there have been campaigns of misinformation at crucial stages of negotiations.

Chase Official to Head Global Securities Unit

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Bank, believing that institutional investors are taking a global approach, has combined its domestic pension trust and global custody business and put Marshall N. Carter in charge.
Mr. Carter, 50 years old, who has headed up the global side of the Chase operation, said that the business of acting as custodian for the assets of pension funds is changing rapidly.
With the new setup, ''We expect significant growth,'' Mr. Carter said. ''This has been a U.S.- and U.K.-based business that is now expanding into Europe and Asia as European investment firms and pension funds in many cases are allowed to invest outside their own countries.'' 
Historically, the custodial business has offered services for settling securities trades and for safekeeping the securities. Now, Mr. Carter said, speed in servicing the account and increased information about the account are increasingly important. The institutional client can also get analytical information about the account, allowing it, for example, to play ''what if'' games to test investment ideas. But the bank does not provide investment management advice.
The newly combined unit, which has $250 billion in assets under custody, is called the Chase Global Securities Services.
Mr. Carter came to banking by way of West Point, Vietnam and a program known as the White House Fellowships. After West Point, he served two years, 1966 and 1967, leading a Marine infantry company in heavy combat in South Vietnam. He did a second tour in 1970 and 1971 as an adviser to South Vietnamese Marines.
Before he joined Chase in 1976, Mr. Carter was a White House Fellow serving at the State Department and the Agency for International Development. The State Department service included membership on the department's 1975 Sinai peacekeeping surveillance mission.
At Chase, Mr. Carter was sent to Rochester, to help merge a newly purchased bank, Lincoln First, with Chase, before he got into the trust and custodial business.
Mr. Carter, whose title is senior vice president at Chase, is a colonel in the Marine reserves and is a commercially licensed airplane pilot. He spends about a week a month in Europe on the Chase job. Mr. Carter and his wife, Missy, live in Greenwich, Conn., where she has her own business as a career counselor. They have two children.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Further Rises in Rates Expected

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Upward pressure on interest rates in Japan and West Germany is expected to continue to influence the domestic credit rate structure this week and in the near future.
The rise in domestic interest rates last week would have been higher had it not been for plunging Japanese stock prices and mounting fears of inflation in West Germany. Both developments strengthened the dollar and placed a lid on the rate increases.
The Bank of Japan did not make an expected increase in its discount rate from the current level of 4.25 percent. The delay was seen as an effort to arrest a further weakening of Tokyo stock prices, which lost 7 percent of their value last week. As it was, the Bank of Japan reportedly bought large amounts of bonds to keep interest rates from rising further. 
West Germany's moves to hasten political and monetary integration with East Germany heightened fears of inflation, which was reflected in rising interest rates throughout Western Europe.
 
'Japanese Taking a Big Risk'
''If Japan behaved like West Germany and ignored the upward pressure on interest rates, we in North America would be in even worse trouble,'' said Francis A. Scotland, managing editor of the International Bank Credit Analyst in Montreal. ''By trying to hold the line on interest rates and letting the yen fall against the dollar, the Japanese were taking a big risk of inflation. But supporting their stock market appears to be their main concern.
''The decline in Japanese stocks partly spilled over into the United States equities market and caused a flight to quality, which helped prevent yields from rising further.''
Nevertheless, interest rates continued to rise. The yield on the Japanese Government's 10-year bond, its longest maturity, rose to 6.90 percent at last Friday's close, up from 6.86 percent the week before and 5.72 percent at the start of the year. The yield on West Germany's 10-year bond soared to 8.72 percent from 8.55 percent a week earlier and 7.26 percent at the start of 1990. By comparison, the yield on the United States 10-year Treasury notes climbed to 8.53 percent last week, from 8.41 percent the week before and 7.91 percent on Dec. 31. Yields on longer Treasury maturities showed similar increases.
Leif H. Olsen, who heads an investment management consulting firm bearing his name in New Canaan, Conn., said that the fixed-income market's expectations of further easing by the Federal Reserve ''have been clouded, to say the least, largely by developments overseas.''
 
Fed Committee Takes Action
Mr. Olsen said the Federal Open Market Committee had acted in December to reduce the key Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to roughly 8.25 percent, from 8.50 percent. The reason was that most members of the committee believed that the sagging economy needed help.
''This help was promptly eliminated by a surge in bond yields,'' he said. ''Now, two months later, market interest rates across the board are higher than they were the day after the funds rate was reduced. The bond market behaves as if it believes the economy will grow vigorously without additional rate cuts and, in fact, with rate increases as we have just had. These are contradictions. Somebody must be wrong.''
Mr. Olsen, who spent many years at the Federal Reserve and as a bank economist, thinks long-term rates have risen largely because of fears that bond investors would move money abroad and not because the domestic economy will soon improve. ''If anything, the flow of economic data will continue to underscore the fact that the domestic gross national product will grow at a weak 1 to 2 percent this year,'' he said, ''and this should convince the bond market that Fed easing is justified.''
As for the fears of a flight of capital to overeas markets, Mr. Olsen said they were groundless. Foreign exchange markets are so termed because this is the place where financial assets change ownership, he went on.
''If liquidity actually moved abroad one would have expected to see bond rates in Japan actually decline. But that has not happened,'' he said. ''Indeed, even the yen has moved down against the dollar, indicating weakened demand by foreigners seeking to buy Japanese securities.''
But William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc., the domestic arm of the large Japanese financial house, laid much of the outward confusion in the credit market to the difficult position faced by the Fed as well as overseas pressures that the central bank cannot control. ''On one hand, the Fed faces mounting pressures to cut interest rates as a means of stimulating the economy,'' he said on Friday. ''But it also fears that by cutting rates it will inhibit foreign investors from buying the ever-increasing volume of debt created by our budget and trade deficits.''
The Fed is also concerned about the financial health of a number of Wall Street houses, Mr. Brachfeld said, adding: ''Hardly a day has passed since the bankruptcy of Drexel Burnham Lambert on Feb. 13 that rumors of the impending failure of this or that house hasn't swept the marketplace. All this at a time when once prominent thrift institutions are indeed going under almost every day. Small wonder investors in fixed-income securities are demanding protection from more than just rising inflation.''

HEADLINE: Turnover in Nicaragua;
Washington set to End Embargo And Aid Chamorro Government

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Elated by the election results in Nicaragua, the Bush Administration said today that it expected to lift a trade embargo imposed in 1985, provide economic aid and send an ambassador to Managua if Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the President-elect, takes office as scheduled on April 25.
But the Administration's satisfaction was tinged with doubts about whether President Daniel Ortega Saavedra would peacefully surrender power, and especially his control over the Nicaraguan Army and security agencies.
Mr. Ortega said today that he would ''respect and obey the popular mandate.'' But in the election campaign, Sandinista officials like Interior Minister Tomas Borge Martinez suggested that members of the military and security forces would resist orders from a Chamorro government. 
 
Debate Rekindled
The defeat of Mr. Ortega gave all sides in Washington an opportunity to rekindle one of the most divisive foreign policy debates of the last decade. Conservatives praised the results as a vindication of the Reagan Administration's support for the contra rebels. Opponents of the contras said the election proved the merits of negotiation rather than military action. [Page A14.] White House and State Department officials and members of Congress from both parties said they were delighted with the results, which President Bush described as ''another victory'' for democracy in a remarkable year of political change.''
''Given a clear mandate for peace and democracy, there is no reason at all for further military activity from any quarter,'' Mr. Bush said in a comment widely read as a message to the Nicaraguan rebels, the focus of United States policy throughout the Reagan Administration.
Ronald Reagan's ardent support for the contras caused countless fights with Congress and led indirectly to the worst scandal of his Administration, as White House officials sold arms to Iran and diverted the proceeds to the Nicaraguan guerrillas.
At the State Department, an official said today that ''people here are ecstatic about the outcome'' of the Nicaraguan elections.
 
Promise of Support
When Mrs. Chamorro visited Mr. Bush at the White House on Nov. 8, he told her that ''the United States would be ready to lift the trade embargo and assist in Nicaragua's reconstruction'' if she won the election.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said today that the Administration would follow through on that commitment. Lifting economic sanctions ''will be a matter of first consideration,'' Mr. Fitzwater said.
The sanctions, imposed by President Reagan in 1985, prohibit the import of Nicaraguan goods to the United States and the export of most products from this country to Nicaragua. Nicaraguan aircraft are barred from the United States, and Nicaraguan ships are excluded from American ports.
Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said the United States would ''do any and everything we can'' to help Mrs. Chamorro and her government rebuild the economy of Nicaragua, which has been battered by war, high inflation, high unemployment and the United States embargo. She said Washington would urge other countries to help Managua.
 
Source of Aid Unclear
Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, said Managua would need ''big bucks'' from the United States because ''the Nicaraguan economy is flat on its back.'' No one seems to know where the extra money can be found at a time when Congress and the Administration also want to provide new aid to Panama, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
Liberals and conservatives agreed today that the contras should return to Nicaraguan society. About 10,000 are in camps in Honduras, subsisting on aid from the United States.
''The purpose of the contras was to bring democracy to Central America, particularly Nicaragua,'' said Representative Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee. ''When Mrs. Chamorro is sworn into office, there will be no reason for the contras to continue to exist.''
 
Aid Through Feb. 28
The inauguration day is April 25. American aid to the contras for food, clothing and medical supplies runs through Feb. 28. Goods bought before that date may be delivered in March or early April.
Mr. Fitzwater said the Administration had not decided whether to seek additional aid. The Speaker of the House, Representative Thomas S. Foley, said he did not ''see any reason for further aid to the contras,'' except for some funds to help them return to Nicaragua.
Miss Tutwiler dropped a heavy hint to the rebels. The Bush Administration has always favored ''the voluntary repatriation of the contras back into Nicaragua under safe and democratic conditions,'' she said. ''This election obviously goes a long way toward safe and democratic conditions.''
The United States Agency for International Development gave slightly more than $2 million to Mrs. Chamorro's coalition, the National Opposition Union. The agency gave an equal amount to Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council, as required by Nicaraguan law. The United States also gave $800,000 to the Institute for Electoral Promotion and Training, supposedly for nonpartisan voter education.
An Administration official said the aid was ''very helpful in persuading people that their votes would make a difference and would remain secret.'' The ''civic education messages encouraged voter turnout, which was good for the opposition, and also allowed people to vote their consciences,'' he said.
 
Spreading the Credit
Administration officials and some members of Congress said the election proved the wisdom of a bipartisan accord on Central America signed by Mr. Bush and Congressional leaders in March 1989. The accord ended the bitter, divisive debates on Nicaragua that had characterized the Reagan years.
Parceling out credit for Mrs. Chamorro's victory, Administration officials praised Nicaraguan voters. Mr. Bush congratulated Mr. Ortega on ''the conduct of the election.'' Some officials said Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet President, had played a constructive role by encouraging elections.
Some Administration officials seemed reluctant to give credit to the contras, whom they see as a vestige of Reagan policy.
But Representative Jim Courter of New Jersey, speaking for many conservative Republicans, hailed the elections as a ''vindication of the Reagan doctrine,'' which supported insurgents fighting leftist governments around the world. Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, Republican of New Hampshire, said Mr. Ortega had agreed to hold the elections only because of pressure from the contras.
By contrast, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said the election results demonstrated ''the failure of the contra war'' and the virtues of the regional peace plan devised by President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica. The plan emphasizes negotiation and reconciliation.
Liberals described the election results as a victory for democracy and a defeat for clandestine military operations. ''This election is not a victory for the contras, who from the beginning were not a politically viable force,'' said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California.

HEADLINE: Turnover in Nicaragua;
NICARAGUAN OPPOSITION ROUTS SANDINISTAS; U.S. PLEDGES AID, TIED TO ORDERLY TURNOVER

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The leader of Nicaragua's opposition coalition crushed President Daniel Ortega Saavedra in national elections here on Sunday, apparently bringing an end to 10 turbulent years of Sandinista rule.
The landslide victory by the opposition candidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, turned the closely monitored elections into a powerful repudiation of one of Latin America's most prominent and fiercely debated revolutionary Governments.
Celebrating her victory early today after the results were made public, Mrs. Chamorro said, ''We have shown the world an example of civic duty, demonstrating that we Nicaraguans want to live in democracy, want to live in peace and, above all, that we want to live in liberty.''
 
Ortega Pledges Acceptance
President Ortega, looking subdued as the results became known, said, ''The President of Nicaragua and the Government of Nicaragua are going to respect and obey the popular mandate coming out of the vote in these elections.'' [Excerpts from the two speeches appear on page A12.] Despite Mrs. Chamorro's victory, and President Ortega's seeming acquiescence in defeat, there remains skepticism that Mr. Ortega, a lifelong revolutionary and politician, will be able to persuade the Sandinista Front to accept a Chamorro government. Mrs. Chamorro is scheduled to be inaugurated on April 25. 
The vote lays the groundwork for the first democratic transfer of power that this country has known, a turnover that parallels to some degree the changes in Eastern Europe, where Communism has little by little given way to democratic change.
 
Lead of 14 Percentage Points
Mrs. Chamorro, 60 years old, is the widow of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, the newspaper publisher whose assassination touched off the rebellion that led to the Sandinista takeover. She ran as the candidate of the 14-party National Opposition Union, a coalition of leftists, rightists and other Nicaraguan parties.
The official voting results, supervised by a large contingent of international observers, including former President Jimmy Carter, gave Mrs. Chamorro a lead of 14.4 percentage points. Her vote total with 82 percent of the ballots counted was put at 633,357, or 55.2 percent of the presidential vote. Mr. Ortega of the Sandinista National Liberation Front received 468,040 votes, or 40.8 percent of the total.
Small parties received the rest of the votes as Nicaraguans elected a President, Vice President and National Assembly, which the opposition will now control.
Across the country, beginning in the early morning, there was the almost surreal sensation of imminent change. Nicaraguans shared a widespread sense of awe at the power of their own votes, and disbelief that something so pervasive and apparently entrenched as the Sandinista Front had suddenly been swept aside. A huge rally planned near Sandinista headquarters slowly dissolved into a mournful gathering, while opposition loyalists whooped it up at the restaurant that has become their staging ground.
The Chamorro victory has stunned many political analysts, and American officials also appeared to be caught off guard by the depth of the Sandinista defeat. Polls by outside groups consistently suggested that the Sandinistas would sweep to victory, and just last week the Government mounted a rally of at least 300,000 people, dwarfing similar opposition demonstrations.
But reporters and other outsiders who spent hours interviewing average citizens in working-class neighborhoods became convinced that the polls were misleading. Their view was that the electorate of about 1.7 million in this country of 3.5 million was articulating support for Mr. Ortega while secretly looking to oust the Sandinistas after a decade of civil war and economic ruin.
In recent days the White House softened its line toward the Sandinistas, suggesting that after an expected Ortega victory, Washington would try to mend relations with the Government, against which it has waged a civil war by proxy for about eight years. Today, President Bush exulted in the opposition's victory.
 
Threats to Orderly Transition
But an orderly transition is far from certain. In recent weeks, Interior Minister Tomas Borge, who controls the secret police and is considered one of the most rigid members of the nine-member Sandinista National Directorate, has repeatedly suggested that the election of Mrs. Chamorro would make Nicaragua ''ungovernable.''
Tonight, truckloads of Interior Ministry riot troops clashed with crowds of youthful opposition supporters in Managua. Using tear gas and truncheons, the police repeatedly charged at the youths, who responded by throwing sticks and pavement stones and taunting the officers.
In the ranks of the Sandinista People's Army, which is headed by Mr. Ortega's brother, Humberto, and in the Interior Ministry, virtually all officers and most enlisted men are subject to Sandinista political training. And Mr. Borge has pointedly said that attempts to change the current leadership would be met by insubordination and even violence from Sandinista forces.
The military is particularly suspicious of members of the opposition coalition who have longstanding ties to the United States-armed contra rebels. The civil war has killed 30,000 Nicaraguans since it began in the early 1980's.
''Given the existence of revolutionary armed forces,'' the official Sandinista newspaper Barricada said, describing Mr. Borge's views, ''how could the officers obey the wild orders of those who were named Minister of Defense and Minister of the Interior?''
 
No Comment From Borge
Aides to President Ortega said he was speaking for all Sandinista party members and officials, including Mr. Borge, in his promise to respect the election results. But Mr. Borge did not appear at the gathering, and he has made no public comment on the defeat of the Sandinista Front, of which he is the last surviving founder.
The election results appeared certain to produce a dramatic improvement in deeply strained relations between Nicaragua and the Bush Administration, which gave political and financial support to Mrs. Chamorro's candidacy. They were seen as a virtual guarantee of an end to the American-sponsored insurgency. And they promised to deal a powerful blow to American adversaries like the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, and to the leftist guerrillas in El Salvador, both longtime allies of the Sandinista Government.
Mr. Ortega, who said in an interview on Friday that Mrs. Chamorro did not have ''even a hypothetical possibility'' of victory, compared his party's defeat to the bitterest moments of the Sandinistas' long guerrilla war to overthrow the former dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle. He said the party would accept without malice the prospect of leaving power.
''We were born poor and are satisfied to die poor,'' said Mr. Ortega, who remained composed as he spoke to journalists and cheering supporters at a large, modern Government convention hall here. ''We worked in these elections to emphasize a project which has become a challenge to the intelligence, the imagination, the creativity of the people in their permanent struggle for their liberation.''
The Associated Press reported tonight that Mr. Ortega briefly visited Mrs. Chamorro at her home to offer his congratulations. Accompanied by several foreign observers, including Mr. Carter, he hugged the victorious candidate, who spoke to him affectionately.
Mr. Ortega reportedly said, ''You know that I respect you, and that I love you and congratulate you on your victory,'' adding, ''I am ready to contribute to the national reconciliation.''
 
Effort to Reassure Military
Seeking to allay fears of possible retribution or wholesale dismissals from the military and security forces, Mrs. Chamorro and her advisers have repeatedly emphasized that they will remove only high-ranking Sandinista officers, and will not take abrupt or arbitrary action against soldiers or other social or political groups.
''This is an election that will never have exiles, or political prisoners, or confiscations,'' Mrs. Chamorro said in her acceptance statement. ''Here we have neither victors nor vanquished.''
There was no immediate word on how such a policy might be received by the estimated 10,000 remaining members of the contra army. Nor was there a clear sense of how contra fighters who return to the country under an expected total amnesty would be received by former Sandinista military units, or integrated into those units.
But both issues promised to add to the burdens of the diverse and frequently divided opposition leadership, which has never shown the success at internal politics that it showed in Sunday's balloting.
 
Results Were Delayed
Although election results were promised to reporters and international observers beginning just two hours after the 6 P.M. close of voting, initial returns were abruptly discontinued at mid-evening on Sunday. Official radio stations stopped broadcasting news reports, playing only a stream of music.
Questioned by reporters, election officials attributed the problem to slow receipt of information from outlying districts and inexperienced computer technicians at the large convention center, where hundreds of special phone and telex lines were installed to process the election results.
Several diplomats suggested that the counting had been stopped to give international officials time to persuade Mr. Ortega and other Sandinista leaders to accept the vote. But that version of events was denied by Mr. Carter, who said the announcement was held up by a previous agreement among the political parties not to release incomplete results. So far, independent election observers have reported few if any irregularities, and appear ready to judge the voting fair.
At the barn-like Managua restaurant that has served as an opposition meeting place during the campaign, hundreds of cheering, dancing, crying opposition supporters arrived to celebrate Mrs. Chamorro's victory, yelling loud chants and signaling ''No. 1'' with their fingers. The coalition's acronym, UNO, means ''one'' in Spanish.
Across town at a large fairground that had been reserved for a Sandinista victory celebration, crowds began appearing before the scheduled start of the midnight rally. In place were giant sound systems, spotlights and the other equipment that has become a standard feature of mass Sandinista rallies.
But as the news of Mr. Ortega's defeat filtered through the crowd, preparations for dancing and drinking gave way to silence and ashen faces.
In the working class neighborhood of Batahola North, 25-year-old Lorena Sanchez Barrios sat with her child and wept openly as she listened to Mr. Ortega's speech accepting the results.
''I can't believe it,'' she said, expressing an emotion shared by supporters of the Sandinistas and the opposition alike. ''I just can't believe it.''

HEADLINE: JAPAN INTERVENES TO GIVE STABILITY AFTER STOCK DROP

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Feb. 27

 BODY:
After a week of turmoil on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, topped by Monday's 4.5 percent plunge, the Government and the exchange itself intervened to restore stability.
The turbulence in Tokyo, however, failed to disrupt markets in the United States, where both stock and bond prices ended the day up strongly, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 38.29 points, to 2,602.48. [Pages D1 and D18.] Analysts said the Japanese market had moved up so much more sharply than other markets that some downward adjustment was due and could be weathered. [Page D8.] In Tokyo on Monday, the key 225-stock Nikkei average fell 1,569.10 points, to 33,321.87. At one point in the early afternoon, the average had fallen nearly 2,500 points before rebounding slightly.
 
An Initial Bounce-Back
On opening Tuesday, the market quickly bounced back an additional 600 points before heading downward again. At the mid-day close, the average had erased all of its gains and was down 171.30 points. The strong market in New York and signs that the Japanese Government's efforts were helping to stabilize the yen were credited for the small, temporary rebound, but the subsequent drop was taken as a sign that market confidence was still fragile. 
Some foreign brokers expressed dismay on Monday afternoon over signs that many Japanese were attributing the market's huge decline to foreign investors and foreign securities firms. As emotions flared, at least one American securities firm disclosed its trading data to try to dispel the idea that Americans were behind the market slide.
In its effort to calm the Tokyo market, which is in the midst of its largest decline since the stock crash in October 1987, the Bank of Japan on Monday offered short-term loans to banks to make sure the market had enough cash to operate. And the Finance Ministry bought bonds to push long-term interest rates lower. Rising interest rates, which tend to squelch economic activity, have been widely cited as one factor that prompted the decline.
The Bank of Japan also intervened heavily all day in the currency markets to try to halt the dollar's rise against the yen, reportedly spending $1.5 billion in this futile campaign. The dollar closed here at 148.65 yen, up more than 2 yen, to its highest level since June.
The yen's weakness has been particularly worrisome to the Japanese, since Japan, the United States and other industrialized nations have sought to strengthen the yen for the last five years to curb Japan's bulging trade surpluses and reduce growing trade frictions tearing at American-Japanese relations. The weakening yen, which would tend to increase Japan's exports by making them cheaper, threatens to aggravate those tensions further.
The last tool the central bank has to protect the yen is to increase its official discount rate in what would be the fourth such move since May. The expectation of such an increase in the rate, which is charged on loans to commercial banks, has been behind a smoldering confrontation between the Finance Ministry and the central bank.
 
Rare Public Dispute
In a rare public dispute, the Finance Ministry has fought a rate rise for fear it would slow the economy and push the stock market even lower, while the central bank has encouraged it to stem growing inflationary pressures.
Analysts have said anticipation of a rate increase had hurt the market, but now the uncertainty surrounding the Bank of Japan's plans has itself added to the market's skittishness.
The most controversial move to help stabilize the market on Monday was a late-afternoon announcement by the Tokyo Stock Exchange that it was ''requesting'' securities firms that have engaged in program trading to limit drastically their computer-driven sales of shares, except under certain conditions.
The exchange asked firms engaged in program trading not to sell shares except at the morning opening and when the market reopens in the afternoon after a two-hour lunch break. The announcement, which was interpreted by securities houses as a demand, will be effective only until the current stock index futures contract expires on March 8.
In the type of program trading being blamed for some of the market's turmoil - stock index arbitrage - an investor, aided by programmed computer orders, simultaneously buys or sells the stocks that make up a stock index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500, and takes the opposite position in the stock index futures market. The technique allows the investor to profit from discrepancies between the price in the cash and futures markets. Although Tokyo's market is the world's largest in terms of the value of shares, it is inefficient, and such price discrepancies often occur.
 
A Mix of Reactions
The announcement on program trading created a mix of reactions among traders and securities executives here. Some applauded the step as a sincere attempt to stem the dangerous volatility of the last week.
But some foreign firms, particularly American ones, saw the move as both an inappropriate change of the rules in the middle of the game and as a step toward making foreign firms scapegoats in the market tumble. Most program trading is done by the American firms Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Goldman, Sachs.
With the issue threatening to boil over, Salomon Brothers disclosed its precise level of trading to try to dispel reports from Japanese securities firms that the Americans had precipitated the market tumble.
Deryck C. Maughan, chairman of Salomon Brothers Asia, said his firm had sold a total of 33 million shares last week in program trading-related transactions, out of total trading during the week of 2.1 billion shares. Salomon, he said, did no program-related selling on Monday.
''I refuse to believe that our 33 million shares led the other 2 billion down,'' Mr. Maughan said.
But the chairman of one of Japan's top financial institutions remained steadfast in blaming foreign firms and program traders, saying that his company and a number of other major financial institutions here with huge stock portfolios had not sold a single share in the last week. Trading volume has been running extremely low, in fact, and Monday's level of 400 million shares was about half the daily level last year. Volume continued at a modest level on Tuesday morning.
 
'It's the Foreigners'
''Well, where do you think the selling is coming from, then?'' he said. ''It's the foreigners and the program traders.''
An official at Nomura Securities, the world's largest securities firm, said his analysis also pointed to foreigners as the source of most of the selling, although he said he had no figures to prove his contention.
In fact, the share of trading volume here by foreign investors has declined over the last decade, from about 20 percent to less than 10 percent. Also, foreign investors were net sellers of Japanese shares last year, unloading more than $15 billion worth, thus reducing significantly the shares in foreign hands to sell in the current bear market.
Clearly, Japanese authorities have also been bothered by the fact that the fall here has had few repercussions outside Japan. While small movements here in the past have caused sharp swings in Europe and on Wall Street, the market in New York last week fell less than half as much as Tokyo's.
 
Seen as Dangerous
That was all the more reason that the Tokyo Stock Exchange's announcement that it was altering for now the way program trading is done was regarded by some program traders as unnecessary and possibly dangerous.
''This impairs the free operation of the market,'' one American executive complained. ''It was done without notice or consultation with anyone in the industry, as far as we can tell.'' He added that there had not even been an official notification of what was effectively a rule change.
The official reports on the stock market crash in New York in October 1987 placed much of the blame on program trading, and there is much concern here about the strategy. But officials at the American firms insist that the volume of trading they do is so small that program trading could not possibly move as vast a market as Tokyo's.
''The point is, it puts all this trading in a tiny little box, where it's easy to observe, and easy to control,'' said an American executive. ''If they changed the rules once, you don't know if they will be changed again. That's why this is intimidating.'' The executive added, in a comment echoed by others, that even if the Tokyo market manages to regain its balance soon, the problems of the last week have left a residue of mistrust that may take longer to repair.

HEADLINE: Israel Letting 16 Arab Colleges Reopen

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The Israeli military authorities announced today that they were allowing 16 community colleges in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to reopen. But the universities, shut down along with the colleges in the fall of 1987, will remain closed.
Israeli military officials said the colleges were being allowed to reopen as part of a program to relax tensions as the Palestinian uprising, now almost 27 months old, seems in the army's view to be losing force. 
But the announcement came on one of the most violent days ever in the occupied Gaza Strip, where Palestinians reported that 91 people had been wounded by army gunfire. Hospital officials reported that 100 other people were examined or treated for tear-gas inhalation after the army dropped gas cannisters from helicopters into crowds of rioters.
Political leaders in Jerusalem also suggested today that the Government might be close to agreement on terms for moving to the next step in Israel's plan for Palestinian elections. #5,000 Students Affected Military officials said the 5,000 community college students in the West Bank would be allowed to return to school gradually starting next month. The schools would be allowed to remain open, they added, only as long as they are not used as centers for violence.
They gave no date for when the 18,000 Palestinian university students might be allowed to return to classes. All the colleges and universities were closed in October 1987. Israel said they were used as planning and staging grounds for violence.
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who approved the plan to reopen the community colleges, told a group of high school students in Rehovot today that in his view, ''we are now in a position to take a first step toward peace with the Palestinians which is firmly anchored in political reality, and which compels us to give a yes or no vote.''
The Labor Party, the United States, the Egyptian Government and presumably the Palestine Liberation Organization all appear to have agreed on a plan to open peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. Only the approval of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and the Likud Party is needed.
The key issue of debate is the makeup of the Palestinian delegation. The agreed plan would include two Palestinians deported from Israel and two with addresses in East Jerusalem among the other delegates from the West Bank and Gaza.
 
Shamir Seems Receptive
Today, Mr. Shamir seemed disposed to at least consider the idea.
The question of deportees and East Jerusalem Arabs, the Prime Minister said, ''is part of a whole complex of things, and it's just a small part.'' He added, ''When we have to decide on the next step, we'll decide on everything.''
The Labor Party is threatening to bring down the Government if Mr. Shamir does not decide to go ahead by March 7. Senior Labor officials repeated that threat today.
But at the same time, five far-right members of the Likud faction in Parliament led by Economics and Planning Minister Yitzhak Modai - angry that Mr. Shamir is even considering accepting the negotiations formula under discussion now - formally asked to withdraw from the party and form their own faction today.
With that and other foment in Likud, it appears that whatever Mr. Shamir decides, he will cause a Government crisis from either the left or the right.

HEADLINE: Turnover in Nicaragua;
Excerpts From the Speech by Ortega

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech this morning by President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua, as recorded and translated by The New York Times:
Friends of the national and international press:
The electoral process of historical proportions for the whole Nicaraguan people is coming to a close, during which we committed all our efforts and revolutionary convictions so that in Nicaragua everything would be better for all Nicaraguans.
The Sandinista National Liberation Front headed the struggle against the Somoza dictatorship. It lived the bitter moments of the fall of the dictator Somoza, the moments of pain when we lost a brother in combat, and we Sandinista militants learned to forge ourselves in the difficult moments facing adversity.
With the Nicaraguan people we conquered the rights to freedom, independence, democracy and peace on July 19, 1979. 
 
Years of Suffering
During those 10 hard and difficult years, cruel for the Nicaraguan people, the Sandinista Front with its revolutionary Government knew how to stay in the forefront of the defense of the interests of the people, in the forefront of the homeland, the national dignity, sovereignty, at the forefront of the struggle for Nicaraguan self-determination and of that struggle for peace.
Just as we succeeded in overthrowing Somozacism, we also defeated the counterrevolution, and also brought to trial before the world those who provided that policy of death against the Nicaraguan people, and in an act of historical transcendence for the people of the world, the World Court condemned the United States of America for its criminal acts against the people of Nicaragua and called on the United States of America to cease those acts and called on the United States of America to give indemnity to the Nicaraguan people. . . .
We went to these elections of the 25th of February 1990 with the conviction that in this battle in the electoral field must be decided once and for all an end to the war, a little peace, stability and tranquillity for the Nicaraguan people.
That is the Sandinista Front, which with more political and historical force with the patriotic and flourishing Nicaraguan people has in these elections faced U.S. policy, the contras, the economic embargo, the economic erosion provoked by the war, with confidence in the people certain that the end of this electoral process would give all Nicaraguans that peace and that stability which we so need to reconstruct this country, to lift up the economy, to free well-being in the official areas, and aspire to a minimum of political stability. . . .
 
World Is Watching
Never in the history of any independent country have elections been carried out that have been so well observed as have these here in Nicaragua, with observers from the United Nations, the O.A.S., the Carter Center, observers from Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world.
Hundreds of journalists also covered and observed this electoral process, proving that the political will of the revolutionary Sandinistas have never been fixated on power; that we were born poor and we are satisfied to die poor because we carried out our efforts in these elections to emphasize this project which has become a challenge to the intelligence, the imagination, the creativity, of the people in the permanent struggle for their liberation, their independence, their self-determination and for economic and social justice. . . .
 
Respecting Mandate
I wish to express in my name, in that of my family, of my companion, of my brothers in the National Directorate of the Sandinista Front, of my brother militant of the F.S.L.N., in the name of the heroic self-sacrificing, courageous, conscientious people who have participated in this electoral process and have given their support to the F.S.L.N., I wish to say to all Nicaraguans and to all the peoples of the world that the President of Nicaragua and the Government of Nicaragua are going to respect and obey the popular mandate coming out of the vote in these elections.
I consider that in this historic moment, the principal contributions of the Sandinistas, the Nicaraguan revolutionaries, are making to the Nicaraguan people is that of guaranteeing a clean, pure electoral process, that it may heat up our consciences even more, that it may shine with the sun of this dawn, the 26th of February, in this 1990, that it may shine towards the consolidation of democracy, the consolidation of a mixed economy, toward the consolidation of a free, independent and democratic Nicaragua, in peace without intervention by any foreign power where all of us Nicaraguans may be capable of demonstrating to the world that we can change these dreams, these hopes, into reality. . . .
Thank you, Nicaraguan brothers. Thank you, brother militants of the F.S.L.N., thank you brother combatants of the Popular Sandinista Army and of the Ministry of the Interior who with your blood fertilized this labor defending the right of Nicaraguans to exercise their right to vote, thanks to the blood of our heroes and martyrs, thanks to the pain full of hope of the mothers of Nicaragua, thanks to every Nicaraguan brother.
I urge you today more than ever so that we may act firmly with the security that the steps we have taken are the correct steps, that we have been consistent with the proposals we have made, that if after all we have pledged so much sacrifice, so much effort during these years, that once again we Sandinistas will be victorious, once more we Sandinistas will be conquerors because we have changed our words into deeds in spite of all of the campaigns raised against this electoral process, in spite of all of the distrust that was intended to be generated around this electoral process, in spite of the systematic actions of the counterrevolutionaries assassinating people during the electoral campaign. . . .
We feel proud to be contributing to Nicaragua, to be contributing to the peoples of Central America, Latin America and the Caribbean, to the peoples on the road to development, to be contributing in this unjust world divided between the strong and the weak, to be contributing a little bit of dignity, a little bit of democracy, a little bit of social justice from this small territory in Central America which saw the birth of men who made Nicaragua shine in the world as did Dario and Sandino.
Thank you, Nicaraguan brothers, and go forward, go forward with our struggle and our battle cry which is the cry of Sandino - ''Free fatherland or death.'' MUST KEEP GRAF, following subhed ''Respecting Mandate,'' that begins: ''I wish to express ... in these elections.

HEADLINE: Turnover in Nicaragua;
Sandinistas' Loss to Be Felt By Other Leftist Movements

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The overwhelming defeat of the Sandinistas in the elections on Sunday could affect the politics and military balance in much of Latin America, diplomats, military commanders and other experts said today.
In addition, the victory of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro promises to have a psychological and intellectual effect in the hemisphere, several diplomats and scholars said.
''It will be the cause of considerable soul-searching and head-scratching in Latin America,'' said a diplomat with years of experience in Central and South America. ''It really has important consequences in the hemisphere and, certainly, in the region.'' 
Mrs. Chamorro's victory not only crushed one of the hemisphere's most influential revolutionary governments but served to repudiate the Sandinistas' leftist ideology, Western diplomats and scholars said. They noted that Mrs. Chamorro, who heads a 14-party coalition of strikingly divergent and often conflicting views, owed her victory in large part to the rejection of President Ortega and his decade-old revolutionary movement.
So his defeat is also likely to be a striking setback for the hemisphere's revolutionary movements, they said. Ebullient after the victory of the Sandinistas a decade ago, many had looked to them for guidance and had sought to follow in their footsteps.
''The election shows that the romanticism of violent revolution has long passed,'' one Western diplomat said. ''The ideological fervor isn't stirring the people the same way any more. And Latin leaders are trying to forget revolutions and concentrate on the bread and butter issues and hungry stomachs.''
In Central America, the Sandinista defeat anchors the ideological balance of power firmly on the right. That promises to deal a sharp political and military blow to leftist guerrillas fighting in El Salvador and Guatemala.
Military commanders in El Salvador and United States diplomats there said they thought the Sandinista defeat would cripple the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, one of Latin America's best guerrilla armies.
 
They Can't Survive'
''They can't survive without the Sandinistas,'' Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, the Chief of Staff of the Salvadoran armed forces, said in a recent interview.
In return for critical help during the Sandinista revolution, Nicaragua has for years provided important political and military aid to the Salvadoran guerrillas. Among other things, this country has been an important staging area and logistics base. It is home for most senior guerrilla commanders and, in the past at least, has provided some of the guerrillas' arms.
Mrs. Chamorro has not publicly laid out how her Government will deal with the Salvadoran guerrillas. But the Bush Administration has conditioned the granting of vitally needed aid on ending Nicaraguan support for the rebels.
The Chamorro victory is seen by diplomats as a vindication of President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica and his Central American peace plan. The plan appears to have achieved by peaceful democratic means what years of United States military and economic pressure could not. Nonetheless, the weight of American sanctions and support for the rebels left the Government so impoverished and the people so exhausted that a political turnaround seemed inevitable.
Even when many of his advisers were convinced that the Sandinistas would win by a landslide, President Arias remained steadfast in his conviction that the election would bring radical change to this impoverished and war-racked country.
''If Ortega wins I'm going to have to go back to school and relearn everything I know about voter behavior,'' Mr. Arias said last year. He was the first head of state to call to congratulate the victor, But perhaps the most obvious result is the further isolation of President Fidel Castro of Cuba, an ardent supporter of the Sandinista revolution and of President Ortega's Government. Once the ideological beacon for leftists throughout Latin America, his stubborn rule is increasingly viewed by Latin Americans as a vestige of a failed era.
The Cuban leader now is the only major remaining leftist leader in the hemisphere. But his international pillars of political and commercial support are crumbling one by one. Diplomats here began talking about President Castro's future on Sunday afternoon as soon as they first sensed the Sandinistas' impending defeat and hours before President Ortega conceded.
Still, the first direct fallout from the election is likely to be felt in Central America. The Sandinistas' defeat removes the raison d'etre of the Nicaraguan rebels, the 11,000-man insurgent army that started eight years ago as a proxy for the Reagan Administration in its efforts to overthrow President Ortega.
Provided that the Sandinists agree to transfer political and military power, Mrs. Chamorro's victory should lead to the quick disbandment of the insurgent force and an end to the nagging, fraternal conflict, diplomats said.
On El Salvador, the President-elect's supporters and many Western diplomats in the region presume she will quickly move to comply with regional peace accords by stopping any arms shipments and preventing Nicaragua from being used as a base by the Salvadoran guerrillas.
 
A Severe Blow
The rebels have acknowledged that losing their Nicaraguan safe haven would be a severe blow. But in the short run at least it is unlikely to be fatal. While it would certainly complicate logistics operations, even the army has acknowledged that the guerrillas have stockpiled enough arms and ammunition in El Salvador to continue offensive operations without resupply for almost a year. In addition, the rebels have a committed base of support within El Salvador.

HEADLINE: Turnover in Nicaragua;
Nicaraguan Decade: War, Ruin and Turnabout

 BODY:
1978: Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, editor of the newspaper La Prensa, is shot to death on a Managua street by unidentified assassins, intensifying discontent that undermines the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza Debayle.
July 1979: The Sandinistas overthrow the Somoza Government. General Somoza flees in secret.
April 1980: Mr. Chamorro's widow, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, quits the governing leftist junta. She begins criticizing the Sandinista leadership. 
November 1980: First attacks by anti-Sandinista rebels, who become known as the contras.
February 1981: The Reagan Administration accuses the Sandinistas of arming Marxist rebels in El Salvador and suspends aid to Nicaragua. Congress approves $19 million in covert military aid for the rebels.
December 1982: Congress approves $19 million more for the contras as part of a classified appropriations bill. After the Boland Amendment is passed, barring the use of funds to overthrow the Sandinista Government, the Central Intelligence Agency spends $10 million in emergency funds to aid the rebels.
1983: The contras launch their first major offensive, and the Sandinistas impose rule by decree. The House votes to end aid to the contras, but in a compromise the rebels receive $24 million, and the C.I.A. is prohibited from using special funds to help the rebels.
1984: Central Intelligence Agency involvement in the mining of Nicaraguan ports is disclosed. The Sandinistas win the first general elections since 1979 with Daniel Ortega Saavedra, a member of the Sandinista junta, becoming President. Congress adds restrictions to contra aid, saying the C.I.A. and the Pentagon cannot spend money on paramilitary operations in Nicaragua without legislative permission.

May 1985: President Reagan imposes new trade sanctions against Nicaragua, including an embargo.
August 1985: The Senate votes to release $14 million in aid that had been set aside in 1984, but the House votes against it. Congress eventually approves $27 million in aid to the contras restricted to non-combat use. The C.I.A. and the Pentagon are barred from distributing the money.
June 1986: The House approves $100 million in both arms and non-combat aid. Restrictions on the C.I.A. are lifted, but the agency remains barred from spending special funds on the contras.
October 1986: A cargo plane with a crew of Americans is shot down over Nicaragua. The survivor, Eugene Hasenfus, is captured and implicates the C.I.A. in contra supply operations.
November 1986: Attorney General Edwin S. Meese 3d acknowledges that Reagan Administration officials sold arms to Iran and secretly gave the profits to the contras.

HEADLINE: Plantations Slip Into Texas History

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OLD OCEAN, Tex.

 BODY:
John Holland Bannister enjoyed one last glance at the white clapboard house that his great-grandfather built with a crew of slaves in 1837 in the Texas wilderness.
Then he turned to look at the huge oil refinery and petrochemical complex that has grown and grown in recent years so that now it looms over his ancestral home. A deep rumbling like distant thunder came from the maze of pipes and machinery until one of the many metal towers spewed out a big plume of smoke.
''It's just time to load up and leave,'' Mr. Bannister said. A few weeks ago, he reluctantly sold the last 840 acres of his great-grandfather's plantation, which once encompassed 25,000 acres, to the Phillips Petroleum Company. State officials believe that only a handful of parcels once owned by the original settlers of Texas are still in the hands of their descendants, and now there is one less. 
 
Plans for an Incinerator
Phillips plans to build a toxic-waste incinerator less than a mile from the Osage orange tree, still standing, that the master of the plantation, John Sweeny Jr., climbed in 1865 to tell his slaves they were free.
Along much of the once lonely Texas Gulf Coast, the petrochemical industry has expanded beyond its old enclaves in cities like Houston and Beaumont, taking advantage of low prices for its chief raw material, crude oil. A similarly rough passage has occurred in many other parts of the country when auto plants and other producers sought open frontiers in rural areas.
''It is a matter of old ways giving way to new ways,'' Mr. Bannister said.
As he spoke, the moving crew packed a Bible dated 1788 and chairs that slaves crafted from the wood of trees felled nearby. Each time a cardboard box was carried away, one of the many thin strands that bind America's present to its past was being broken.
''There are still some of the old families, proud of their heritage, who stay on around here, but a lot of them have moved off and gone on as industry has moved in,'' said Linda Wood, the research librarian at the Brazoria County Historical Museum.
 
Family Came to Texas in 1832
In 1832, Mr. Bannister's great-great-grandfather, John Sweeny, father of the man who would build the clapboard house, left Tennessee with his nine children and bought into the vast real estate development that Stephen F. Austin established as a colony before Texas declared independence. Now all that is left of the Sweeny Plantation, which produced sugar and cotton, is the old house and a slave cemetery.
The Phillips Sweeny Complex covers more than 3,300 acres, employs 1,200 people and produces more than 4 million gallons of gasoline a day among other things. Through the sheer weight of its presence, the plant came to exercise a claim on the land that eventually overpowered John Sweeny's heirs.
With the noise of the plant all but drowning out his voice as he stood in his own yard, Mr. Bannister said, ''It is too big to fight, and I am too old to fight it.''
Mr. Bannister, 67 years old, spent much of his childhood on the Sweeny Plantation, about 60 miles southwest of Houston. ''I used to ride my horse all over the county,'' he recalled, ''having lunch with one family or another, and I would go into the woods a lot hunting with my grandfather.''
In 1940, he left to go to college, then to war, then on to a career selling drilling equipment in oil fields around the world. In 1981, prosperous and retired, he returned with his wife, Nancy, to the 840 acres that his family still owned, the rest having been sold off by various relatives over the years starting in the mid-19th century..
 
'The Place Had Changed'
''I was starry-eyed with all these nostalgic dreams of coming back to live the life of the country gentleman here, but the place had changed,'' he said.
A small refinery built by the Federal Government to make aviation fuel in World War II was bought by Phillips in 1949. It grew gradually at first and then very rapidly in the 1980's.
''I didn't realize how much the old times were gone,'' Mr. Bannister said. ''Even the people had changed. They all have a connection to the plant because someone in the family works for Phillips, and all they want is more industry.''
Living in Phillips's shadow, Mr. Bannister gradually became more concerned about the environment. Three years ago, he helped organize a community protest that persuaded Phillips to quiet noisy operations, especially at night. In 1988, he raised the alarm over a leak of fluoride gas that turned hayfields and trees brown. Most recently he questioned the safety of the proposed toxic-waste incinerator at a town meeting.
 
Little Support From Neighbors
Yet he drew little support from his neighbors and concluded that not much could be accomplished. When 23 workers died in an explosion last October at another Phillips petrochemical complex on the outskirts of Houston, he decided, ''people were not meant to live next door to a great big time bomb.''
Phillips had repeatedly offered to buy the Sweeny land, and Mr. Bannister's brother and a cousin who held the title with him were willing to sell. Mr. Bannister insisted that the oil company sign a pledge to maintain the old plantation house and the slave cemetery in their present condition with two acres of open land around each. In turn, Phillips obligated Mr. Bannister not to disclose the sale price or anything about the sale other than the pledge.
Mr. Bannister did not show a hint of sadness as he prepared to leave. Both he and his wife are excited about their new life in San Saba, a rural community in the Texas hill country. ''The air is clean,'' he said. ''There won't be any industry, at least not in my lifetime.''

HEADLINE: Study Shows Racial Imbalance in Penal System

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Nearly one of every four young black males is behind bars or on probation or parole, a study released today said.
The report by The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit organization that promotes changes in punishment practices, calls for changes in the system to make first-time lawbreakers less likely to become repeat offenders. 
''These new findings should be disturbing to all Americans,'' said Marc Mauer, assistant director of the organization and the author of the report. ''We now risk the possibility of writing off an entire generation of black men from leading productive lives.''
Based on data from the Justice Department, the report says 609,690 black men ages 20 through 29 were under control of the criminal justice system - in prison, in jail, or on probation or parole - in mid-1989. The figure represents 23 percent of the black male population for that age group. It also exceeds the number of black men of all ages who were enrolled in college in 1986, roughly 436,000, the report said.
For white men in the same age category, 1,054,508, or 6.2 percent, were incarcerated or on probation or parole. As for Hispanic males, 238,255, or 10.4 percent, were in the justice system.
The report blames social ills, including high unemployment rates, for the disproportionate number of black men in the prison system.
Stu Smith, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said the report's numbers were accurate, but he declined further comment.
Representative John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the House Government Operations Committee, said he would ask the General Accounting Office, a Congressional investigatory agency, for a study to corroborate the findings. ''These are shocking, disturbing numbers,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Widespread Abuses Reported in Insurance for Nursing Home Care

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Reka Hinderks, a widow hospitalized with osteoporosis at the age of 77 last year, was so concerned about her future care that she decided to buy a $2,400-a-year insurance policy to cover nursing home costs. The agent visited her in the hospital to collect the first premium.
Mrs. Hinderks, who lives in Renville, Minn., was discharged from the hospital after a month. Two months later she entered Ren-Villa Nursing Home, where the agent came to collect her second premium. But when she filed a claim, the insurance company denied it and canceled the policy, saying it did not cover patients who were hospitalized when they purchased coverage. 
Insurance to cover the high costs of nursing care has caught on rapidly in the last five years. But a report released yesterday by Families USA, a Washington advocacy group for the elderly, said that many elderly policyholders, like Mrs. Hinderks, have found their long-term-care insurance useless.
 
'Grotesque Abuses'
''There appears to be a pattern of widespread insurance industry abuse, in terms of deception about what is covered and the experience people have when they file claims,'' said Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA. ''It's not just a few fly-by-night companies. We have documented grotesque abuses by some of the most stable, A-plus-rated companies.''
He said that agents aggressively oversell the policies, that companies arbitrarily deny benefits and that policyholders often face long delays in collecting benefits or refunds.
''We need a thorough investigation by Congress and the Federal Trade Commission, and we probably need more regulation to protect frail elderly people,'' Mr. Pollack said.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has the power to direct the trade commission to investigate the industry, plans hearings on the issue.
The industry defended its record yesterday and said it would welcome such an inquiry. ''I think the private market is trying to do a very good job of helping people,'' said Susan Van Gelder of the Health Insurance Association of America, a Washington group representing the leading long-term-care insurers.
''These are heart-wrenching stories,'' she went on, ''and if there are bad apples, let's get rid of them. But let's not discredit the whole private market, because this is a product people need.''
Earl Pomeroy, president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, also took issue with the Families USA report, saying the group was predisposed to find fault with private long-term-care insurance. ''Some groups that want to see a Government long-term-care program believe the development of private long-term-care insurance will get in the way of that,'' said Mr. Pomeroy, whose group represents the state commissioners who regulate the industry.
 
Coverage Is Spotty
With people over 85 the fastest-growing segment of the population, the long-term-care problem has become an explosive public issue. Nursing home care costs an average of $30,000 a year, and in some places the cost can top $80,000 a year. The Government has estimated that the total cost of nursing home care will be $47.7 billion in 1990, with patients and their families paying about half the bill and the Federal and state governments most of the rest.
Medicare does not cover routine long-term care, and while the requirements vary substantially from state to state, Medicaid is intended to cover nursing care only for the poor, including those whose care has used up their assets. And though the Medigap policies available on the private market pay some costs not covered by Medicare, they do not cover most nursing home stays.
So elderly consumers have been eager to buy private long-term-care insurance. The Health Insurance Association of America estimates that as of mid-1989, 1.3 million policies had been sold nationwide. According to Families USA, the average policy covering two years of care, after a 100-day waiting period, costs $307 a month for a couple in which the husband is 72 and the wife 69.
''That's Chevrolet coverage, not Cadillac coverage,'' Mr. Pollack said, ''and still 84 percent of today's seniors cannot afford to buy it.''
What the policies actually cover varies enormously. Some exclude the first 20 days in the nursing home; others require a wait of 100 days. Some provide coverage for one year, others for longer. Because of all the limitations on coverage, some policyholders have found their claims denied, or their policies canceled, when they actually need care.
 
'I Think It Stinks'
Joseph and Beverly Wiley of Ossipee, N.H., paid $1,176 a year for a policy that would pay $70 a day, after a 100-day waiting period, for up to three years of nursing home care, if the stay began within 30 days of a hospital stay that lasted at least 3 days.
Last spring, Mrs. Wiley, a 70-year old with severe Parkinson's disease, went into the hospital, weighing 68 pounds and suffering from a lung infection. She was in the hospital for 10 weeks before being discharged to a nursing home.
But in August, when Mr. Wiley filed a claim, the Bankers Life and Casualty Insurance Company denied it, saying Mrs. Wiley had not been in the acute-care unit of the hospital, as the policy required. Although the hospital and the State Insurance Department have sent letters saying Mrs. Wiley was treated as an acute care patient, the company continues to deny the claim.
''She did not meet the terms of the policy,'' said Gerald Robinson, of the company's claim review department. ''We do offer policies without the three-day hospital requirement, but they cost more and that's not what she bought.''
So Mr. Wiley pays the $82-a-day charges. ''I think it stinks, to put it bluntly,'' he said. ''I knew nothing about one unit or another; I just knew she was in the hospital. Our insurance agent is the local minister, and I'm sure he didn't know either, or he would have told me to move her.''
 
New Guidelines Taking Effect
In 1988, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners recommended that states prohibit the sale of policies with restrictions based on prior hospitalization or level of care, and last year the group recommended that insurers be required to offer policies with inflation adjustments. At least 35 states have adopted those guidelines, but they cover only new policies, not those already in effect.
''Because it's a new and evolving product, our regulatory standards are changing,'' said Mr. Pomeroy, the president of the association. ''Long-term-care insurance is complex, expensive and sold primarily to the market most susceptible to abusive marketing practices, namely the elderly. So it requires very strict regulation.''
Later this week, the Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, established by Congress in 1988, is likely to issue recommendations on financing long-term care.
''Our mandate is to come up with a solution to the long-term care problem, and the health problem, and develop a blueprint for a national health care policy,'' said Philip Shandler, a spokesman for the commission. ''There has been a growing clamor about long-term care, and there is definitely a consensus that we have problems with long-term care insurance.''

HEADLINE: Blacks Move South for Positive Reasons

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Vernon Briggs makes a specious argument when he claims that job competition from recent immigrants is forcing Northern blacks to migrate to the South (letter, Feb. 1). Indeed, 1980 United States Census data show that American-born blacks have lower out-migration rates than any other racial group. Mr. Briggs himself makes this latter point in a 1988 Population Reference Bureau publication, using 1980 Census data.
New York City Planning analysis shows that blacks who leave the city tend to fall into two groups. The first consists of adults in their prime working years who are well educated and already earning a good living. Like many other people who move to the Sunbelt, they are moving because better economic opportunities beckon from the South. In other words, they are being ''pulled,'' not ''pushed.'' 
The second group consists of retirees and women with children under age 18 who wish to rejoin family networks. Unlike other out-migrants, many blacks are returning to their state of birth. For example, more than half of those people who move to South Carolina or Alabama were born in those states. Here too, blacks' migration from the urban North is governed by desirable aspects of life in the South, not by problems of competition in the North.
Anti-immigrant sentiment has arisen continually in this country over the last 200 years. Each wave of immigrants believes the later waves will destroy the social fabric in one way or another. Today's anti-immigrants are becoming increasingly creative at finding ''liberal'' justifications for their sentiments. Mr. Briggs wants to protect American-born blacks from unfair economic competition. Who can disagree with that?
There isn't any evidence to support Mr. Briggs's contention that immigrants are hurting American-born blacks. Cities have enough troubles without academic support for ethnic strife.

HEADLINE: A New Drain On Housing In New York

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

 BODY:
Brightwater Towers, many of its tenants say, is a fine place to live, with many apartments looking out over the Coney Island Boardwalk to the steely Atlantic beyond. It is, in fact, so fine that the owner plans to pay each household as much as $38,000 to get the residents to leave.
The 738-apartment complex in Brooklyn was built more than two decades ago under the Mitchell-Lama program, widely considered one of the most successful efforts in the nation to create moderate-income housing. But now Brightwater's owner has pulled out of the program, forfeiting tax abatements and low-interest mortgages but gaining the right to convert the complex to cooperative apartments at prices from $92,000 to $270,000.
Because their profits are limited by law, more and more owners are picking up their options to buy their way out of the Mitchell-Lama program when their buildings turn 20 years old. 
And legislators in Albany, for the fifth year, remain deadlocked over how, or even whether, to stanch the loss of this huge stock of scarce affordable housing, where monthly rents average $500.
 
'Allowed to Drift Away'
''It just doesn't make any sense,'' said Paul Podhaizer, a retired postal administrator who is chairman of the Brightwater tenants association. ''You hear so much about the need for this kind of housing, and here it's just being allowed to drift away.''
Many lawmakers, along with state housing officials and tenant leaders, support a moratorium on Mitchell-Lama conversions.
''Is now really the time to let this middle-income housing go, when we can't replace it at six times the cost?'' asked Myron Holtz, deputy commissioner for housing operations at the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
But others say that New York has no right to change the rules in the middle of the game.
Unless the owners are amply compensated for staying in a program that limits their profits, they argue, future developers will be discouraged from dealing with the state at all.
So far 20 of the 421 projects built under the Mitchell-Lama program have been removed. Twenty-one others have buyout applications pending. If their applications are granted, a total of nearly 20,000 apartments will have been lost.
 
Program at Crossroads
More than 80 percent of the 170,000 apartments constructed are in New York City. But with most of the projects past or near their 20th anniversaries, the pace of conversions appears likely to accelerate unless the Legislature acts.
Until now the loss of Mitchell-Lama housing has been slow and not particularly dramatic. Regulations protect tenants from eviction and also limit rent increases. Still many tenants say they fear harassment from landlords with a strong economic incentive to force them out.
''It's slow erosion, not mass devastation,'' said Patricia Belanoff, president of the Mitchell-Lama Residents Coalition, a statewide group that wants to stop the buyouts.
 
Resistance by Some Tenants
At Brightwater Towers, the owner, a family consortium headed by Reuben Glick, has not announced when sales of cooperatives will begin. But already many tenants are vowing to remain, no matter what inducements they are offered to leave.
''Of course we don't want to do that,'' said Mr. Podhaizer, the chairman of the tenant association, referring to the proposed relocation offers. ''Even with that kind of money. Tell me, where would we go in this city?''
Mr. Podhaizer also said that the ''insider'' prices to be offered to tenants to buy their apartments as cooperatives were far too high for most people to be affordable. The prices range from $15,000 to $50,000 below the planned market prices, At Westgate Apartments, a cluster of buildings on West 96th and 97th Streets in Manhattan, many residents are also up in arms over a notice filed by the owner, KSLM Apartments Inc., to convert the apartments to cooperatives. The owner has assured tenants that they will not be evicted and can pay rents subject to rent stabilization guidelines, but many people remain bitterly opposed to the conversion of vacant apartments.
 
'An Emergency in Housing'
''The times just don't warrant this,'' said Abe Schwartz, a retired printer who has lived in the building since 1968. ''We're in an emergency in housing. Even after we go, somebody else should have the right to move in and pay a decent rent.''
The income of most people who live in Mitchell-Lama housing qualifies as low or moderate. According to 1986 figures, the latest available, the median household income of these renters is around $20,000.
But some have much higher incomes and remain. This is because people who originally qualified to move into the apartments are not evicted if their incomes later exceed the guidelines for the program; they pay surcharges of up to 50 percent, based on the amount of their higher income.
Under the Mitchell-Lama plan, created in 1955 and named after its legislative sponsors, developers and nonprofit groups got significant tax abatements and low-interest mortgages for agreeing to charge low rents.
One factor clouding the Mitchell-Lama situation is that it is not a simple landlord-tenant issue.
At some Mitchell-Lama cooperatives, there are residents who strongly favor a buyout. Theoretically residents who invested as little as $3,000 or $5,000 to move into the cooperative could make tens of thousands or more in windfall profits by selling their apartments once they are removed from the Mitchell-Lama program. Many lawmakers are trying to head this off by insisting that most of the profits be plowed back into a fiscal pool to build affordable housing.
 
Bitter Legislative Differences
Negotiations in Albany on a bill setting a 15-year moratorium on buyouts collapsed on the final day of the Legislature's session last summer. Bitter disagreements between the Assembly and the Senate appear to have carried over into this year.
In interviews, leading officials on the housing committees of the two legislative houses contended that they were unable to figure out the other side's position this year. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, in his State of the State address in January, beseeched lawmakers to move to preserve the Mitchell-Lama program, but no action has been taken.
In general, the Assembly has been more sympathetic to tenant concerns and has pushed for a moratorium, which would include changes that could offer a higher rate of return to owners. The Senate has also sought to link any moratorium to a package of measures that would benefit landlords, both in and out of the Mitchell-Lama program.
 
Rise in Profits Suggested
The moratorium backed by the Assembly would increase the landlord's allowable annual return on original investment to 8 1/2 percent from the current limit of 6 1/2 percent. But many owners do not make even 6 1/2 percent.
''I don't want to sound facetious, but the 8 1/2 percent you don't get is just the same as the 6 percent you don't get,'' said Albert A. Walsh, a lawyer and former New York City Housing Commissioner who represents the Mitchell-Lama owners committee of the Association of Builders and Owners of Greater New York.
He said the state had an obligation to let the owners take advantage of the buyout provision, which he contended had lured many into the program in the first place.
The state's Commissioner of Housing and Community Renewal, Richard L. Higgins, disagreed with that assertion, saying that the tax breaks and low-interest mortgages were far more substantial lures.
''Very few developers went in to the Mitchell-Lama program with the specific idea that 'aha, I'm going to make a whole lot money 20 years from now,' '' said Mr. Higgins, who has been struggling to fashion a moratorium agreement that both the Assembly and the Senate can accept.
In the Legislature, the housing committees tend to blame each other for the impasse.
 
Legislative Finger-Pointing
Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Housing Committee, attributed the failure to ''this death grip the landlords seem to have on the Senate.''
Richard Runes, counsel to the Senate Housing Committee, asserted that Assemblyman Grannis and others ''walked away'' from an agreement last summer on a range of housing measures that included a Mitchell-Lama moratorium.
Several officials in Albany have suggested that the leaders of the Legislature -Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino in the Senate and Speaker Mel Miller in the Assembly - take the matter away from their bickering housing committees and try to work out a compromise themselves.
That the matter remains unresolved has angered many residents of the Mitchell-Lama buildings.
''Mitchell-Lama was a wonderful plan, and it worked,'' said Jean Kane, a resident of Westgate Apartments in upper Manhattan for 21 years. ''To allow that whole program to go down the drain is an outrage.''

HEADLINE: Pumping Sand: New Jersey Starts to Replenish Beaches

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEA BRIGHT, N.J.

 BODY:
Since the beach here disappeared about 50 years ago, all that has stopped the Atlantic from swallowing the rest of this skinny Jersey Shore borough is a stone seawall the length of Ocean Avenue.
Now, after years of study and debate, Sea Bright may have a beach again, at least for a while. Cranes have begun lifting 10-ton boulders into place along the base of the sagging wall. After the wall is rebuilt, the Army Corps of Engineers will pump sand from offshore to create a beach at least 100 feet wide.
The rebuilding of the seawall is the beginning of one of the nation's largest, most ambitious and most expensive shore projects. It would be about twice the size of the recent reconstruction of Miami Beach. 
As work is completed here, the cranes and sand pumps would move, rebuilding the shorelines of Monmouth Beach, Long Branch and other towns along most of the coast as far as Lavallette, 30 miles south.
 
Disappearance of the Sand
The $250 million project is imperial in scope. It is planned to use 90,000 tons of rock and 23 million cubic yards of sand, enough to bury one lane of Interstate 80 from New York to California under 12 feet of sand. And that is just in the initial stages.
To some people, the rebuilding is essential to protect thousands of lives, restore millions in lost tourism dollars and restore some of the most badly eroded beaches in the country.
For others, especially old hands who have seen six feet of beach disappear in a single northeaster, the work would be a thumb in the dike, a pork-barrel favor and a colossal waste of money.
Whatever happens, the new beaches would be open to the public. The few patches of sand that now exist here, in season, are generally restricted to residents or beach club members. ''It's a whole new beginning for tourism and beaches,'' said Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of Long Branch.
The executive director of the American Littoral Society on adjacent Sandy Hook, Dery Bennett, said: ''My guess is that it's going to cost them a great deal more than they estimate and that it will last half as long as they expect. I don't see why the Federal Government would spend 4 cents on it.''
Washington is committed to paying 65 percent of the project. President Bush's budget proposes $29 million for the first section. Additional appropriations would be needed later. State, county and local sources have to pay the remaining 35 percent. The seawall rebuilding is classified as a state project. For many people, the project reflects the influence wielded by Mr. Pallone's predecessor, James J. Howard, before his death in 1988. The Democrat of Belmar, who represented the area for 23 years, was chairman of the powerful House Public Works and Transportation Committee. Without his power and seniority, it seems unlikely that the project could have survived budget scrutiny.
Opinion about the project is divided in this borough, four jagged miles of shoreline sandwiched between the Atlantic Ocean and the Shrewsbury River, in spots but half a block wide. Mayor Charles Rooney, a 59-year-old triathlete, said the project would be the salvation of his beloved town. ''Without the rocks,'' he said, referring to the seawall the way residents do, ''there is no Sea Bright.''
Live through one winter here and watch the waves break over the 18-foot-high concrete and stone seawall, residents said, and one can make peace with the water or move. The residents said they were not threatened by the surf's pounding against the rocks, even though they drive daily past lighted traffic signs reminding them, ''Road Flooded When Flashing.''
What some of the 1,800 residents do worry about is how much the reconstruction would cost. The local share is $1.6 million, $150,000 more than the entire 1989 municipal budget.
To Alan V. Hinton, 79, the project is ''a real waste of money.'' He should know what he is talking about when it comes to the seawall, he said, because it sits in his front yard.
Like other homeowners along Ocean Avenue, also designated Route 36, Mr. Hinton's property extends to the eastern side of the road and what used to be the right of way of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, including the sand under the seawall. A few property owners have their addresses painted on the rocks, and they have put up No Trespassing signs and wood stairs to concrete patios on top of the wall.
 
Science and Art
Mr. Hinton insists that the wall is not Sea Bright's responsibility. Another resident, John A. Robertson, said the wall protected a highway, power lines and sewers. ''It's the coastline of the United States we're talking about,'' he said.
Mr. Bennett said the project would provide little public benefit, but insured that the local property values would rise. ''What we're talking about here is real-estate protection, not shore protection,'' he said.
For the Army Engineers, building a beach is a science and an art, an attempt to do with bulldozers and pumps what nature does by whim.
Section 1 covers the 12 miles from Sea Bright to Loch Arbour. Engineers plan beaches at least 100 feet wide and about 10 feet above low water. Hydraulic pumps and tankerlike dredges would carry sand from the ocean floor a mile and a half away to the seawall. Working 24 hours a day in season, the work could take five years.
 
Flow of the Sand
Jetties, also called groins, once the choice to protect beaches, are now recognized as often causing more harm than good. The corps is experimenting with pumping sand at the seawall base and then shooting more sand at Long Branch, south of here. That beach is to be a feeder for the few beaches to the north, providing the ocean with sand to carry up the coast with the natural drift. As the project proceeds, other feeders would be established.
The Army project manager, Michael L. Jurist, said the feeders would have to be replenished on average every six years for the next half-century. Most of the sand would eventually make its way to Sandy Hook, parts of which are badly eroded. The nourishment of Sandy Hook, part of the Gateway National Recreational Area, is considered a principal benefit of this plan.
Studies estimate the project would also prevent $7.2 million a year in storm damage to private property and generate $8.3 million a year in recreation and tourism.
Beach erosion is nothing new in New Jersey. But the state's attitude toward the shore is changing. Regulators have become progressively more concerned about overbuilding in sensitive coastal areas. For 10 years, the state has been reluctant to protect developed coastal areas, except in emergencies.
 
Bicycle Path for Public
For this project, state officials said they decided to cooperate only after Sea Bright and Monmouth Beach had agreed to make the new beaches accessible to outsiders. At the outset, the state had asked for large parking lots at the base of the rocks, but opposition was strong.
''I wouldn't have wanted to come down here on a Sunday and have one of the neighbors say, 'Where'd all these cars come from?' '' Mr. Rooney said. ''They'd shoot me.'' The compromise was for the state to build an 18-foot-wide bicycle path at the base of the wall. There will be a few small parking areas, and stairs will be built in several spots so people can pass over the rocks to the new beach.
Similar arrangements are to be made in Monmouth Beach.
The shore remains critical to the New Jersey economy. Tourism is still the state's No. 1 industry. But to some crtiics, such grandiose projects reflect hubris about taming nature.
''The most comprehensive approach to this,'' the state's coastal resources director, John R. Weingart, said, ''would have been to move all the buildings away and say this is not a safe place to live.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo and Florio Criticize Bush on Lack of Money for Education

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The Democratic governors of New York and New Jersey, both of whom face major budget problems at home, criticized the Bush Administration today for failing to commit Federal dollars to the education goals established on Sunday by the White House and the nation's governors.
After joining members of the National Governors Association in a meeting with President Bush this morning, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Gov. Jim Florio both complained that Mr. Bush expected state and local governments to shoulder the full tax burden of improving the country's educational system.
Mr. Cuomo said increases in state and local taxes would hit poor and middle-income Americans the hardest at a time when the Federal Government has slashed income-tax rates for the wealthiest taxpayers. 
''What they're saying right now very clearly is we approve of taxing the middle class and working poor before we go back to the rich people,'' Mr. Cuomo said after the White House meeting.
 
'Weakening the Fabric'
Stephen T. Hart, a White House spokesman, said all levels of government had increased education spending in recent years with little improvement, and he criticized Mr. Cuomo for believing that money alone could solve the crisis. ''He's sounding a familiar refrain, which is that the answer to our education problems is simply more money, Mr. Hart said. ''We disagree.''
Mr. Florio said he was not optimistic about the Federal Government paying a larger share of the country's education costs. ''If it happens, that's fine, that's nice,'' he said. ''But we don't have the luxury to wait around.''
On Sunday, the governors unanimously approved a resolution, negotiated with the White House during the last year, which sets national education goals for the year 2000. The goals include reducing the high school dropout rate to 10 percent and insuring that every adult is literate.
Mr. Bush said today that he will ''encourage the people of this country to support state and local initiatives'' to improve education. But with the exception of increasing Head Start financing by $500 million, his proposed budget includes little new money for education.

Later, Mr. Cuomo met with John H. Sununu, White House chief of staff, to discuss education and economic issues, as well as ''how much fun it is to be a governor,'' said Mr. Sununu, former Governor of New Hampshire.

HEADLINE: Baseball Factions Leave the Table

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
As union officials left for Phoenix and a players' executive board meeting today, the chances for a settlement that would end the club owners' lockout and salvage the start of the baseball season seemed to hinge on the possibility of a last-minute proposal from the owners. No proposal, however, was forthcoming.
''It's not going to happen,'' Fay Vincent, the baseball commissioner, said last night. ''There aren't going to be any more suggestions or proposals for a while. We just don't have any.'' 
With the lockout of players from spring training camps nearly two weeks old, baseball's labor dispute faces a lengthy recess in negotiations that is virtually certain to affect the start of the season, scheduled for April 2.
Donald Fehr, the union leader, said yesterday that after the executive board meets today, he may hold two or three meetings with groups of players in cities around the country. The owners' negotiators said they had no plans to follow Fehr so they could resume the talks.
 
'Really Serious'
Acknowledging that he saw a lengthy recess coming, Vincent said: ''I think it's really serious. It makes everybody become more extreme. Positions harden. People move further apart. This has all the earmarks of a very serious one.''
Not even a ''courtesy call'' Fehr paid on the commissioner in Manhattan before he left for Phoenix had any effect.
''It was my invitation,'' Vincent said. ''At least I wanted to say I didn't have any more thoughts. I owed them that. I asked Don where he was going after Phoenix and he said he didn't know. I guess he'll go on his trip and we'll see what happens.''
At a news briefing yesterday, Charles O'Connor, the owners' labor spokesman, did release a list of the owners' current proposals, and a few of the provisions were new. None, however, dealt with the impasse over salary arbitration.
The clubs changed their position from two years to three on when either side could terminate the proposed four-year agreement and initiate negotiations on a new one. They offered collusion protection in the form of triple damages and new-look free agency remedies if the clubs again engage in collusion against free agents. And they said that members of the study commission on revenue participation would be non-baseball people.
Negotiators for the two sides did not meet at the bargaining table yesterday. Instead, they spent the morning and early part of the afternoon making telephone calls and sending fax messages dealing with language on such matters as the study commission the owners want and the collusion protection the players want.
Fehr said the communications did not touch on the key issues in the dispute: eligibility for salary arbitration and the owners' contribution to the players' pension and benefit plan. Appearing briefly at a news briefing at the Helmsley Palace, he left the impression that the prospects of a settlement looked bleak.
''We have not broken through the salary arbitration problem,'' he said. ''There have been no new proposals made on the benefit plan, minimum salaries, rosters. I'll report to the players tomorrow as to what the status is and we'll go from there.''
 
'Appropriate to Separate'
O'Connor did not present a rosier picture when he was asked about the recess in talks. ''We have reached the point where it is appropriate to separate for a while,'' O'Connor said.
About 15 minutes after Fehr spoke with reporters, he was at the commissioner's office, where he was spotted by a group of reporters who themselves had hoped to see the commissioner. A few minutes later, Fehr emerged with two of his aides, Eugene Orza and Mark Belanger.
Asked why they had been there, Fehr said: ''We paid a courtesy call to Fay. We came over to say goodbye.''
Fehr was asked whether he was accustomed to saying goodbye to the commissioner before he left on a trip.
''Steve had asked if we would stop by for two minutes before we left,'' he replied, referring to Steve Greenberg, the deputy commissioner. ''We said sure. We stopped by for two minutes and left.''
Vincent was especially downcast over his inability to generate some movement Sunday on the arbitration eligibility issue. The owners have been adamant about keeping the eligibility level at three years of major league service. The players have just as adamantly demanded a return to two years, where the level stood before the 1985 negotiations.
''There's got to be some compromise,'' the commissioner said. ''No one here knows what the compromise might be. It's hard to deal with. The players' position was there should be some players treated as three-year players who aren't. I tried to come up with something, but they didn't move.''
 
'National Disgrace'
ANNAPOLIS, Md., Feb. 26 (AP) -Gov. William Donald Schaefer of Maryland and 13 other governors sent a letter to Commissioner Fay Vincent and representatives of major league baseball owners and players today, calling their labor dispute ''a national disgrace.''
''Baseball is too important to our country - both economically and culturally - to allow this to drag on,'' the letter said.
It urged the owners, players and the commissioner to do everything possible to reach an agreement quickly so spring training could begin and the season open on time.
Schaefer persuaded chief executives from three other states with major league baseball teams - California, Massachusetts and Ohio - to sign his letter.

HEADLINE: On Horse Racing;
At Gulfstream, All the Extras Add Up to Less

BYLINE: By Steven Crist

DATELINE: HALLANDALE, Fla.

 BODY:
For Gulfstream Park, life at the top is proving lonelier than expected.
Over the last 20 years, Gulfstream has supplanted Hialeah Park as the Miami area's most successful race track. Beginning in 1972, Gulfstream was given a crack in alternate years at operating during the prime midwinter racing dates and it consistently outdrew and outhandled Hialeah. The state began awarding the prized dates to Gulfstream more often and this year Hialeah shut down altogether. 
Florida winter racing belongs entirely to Gulfstream this season and the game figured to be stronger than ever. Stall space was tight, so only the best and readiest horses would be on the grounds.
Without a dominant Kentucky Derby favorite, the 3-year-old ranks would be busy and contentious. Freed from the usual wrangling with Hialeah, Gulfstream would be able to expend its full resources on promoting and improving its product. An imminent change of ownership, bringing both Gulfstream and Calder Race Course in North Miami under the control of Bertram R. Firestone and partners, would bring fresh energy, money and ideas.
Instead, business is slumping after two decades of steady growth. Through the first 35 days of the meeting, attendance is off 3.61 percent and the betting handle has plummeted by 7.08 percent. The racing, always a mix between national stars and cheap locals, has had more of the latter than ever before. Even the stars have been slow to come out.
The best racing is likely to come over the next three weeks, but the worst business will follow that. Gulfstream is operating a 90-day meet this year, nearly twice as long as usual, and track officials are bracing for a dismal final month.
The top horses and the tourists will be gone by April, and the racing may be indistinguishable from the drab fare offered at Calder during the off season. Having won a 20-year battle to conduct the best winter racing in the East, Gulfstream is now losing customers, bets and quality. What went wrong?
Track officials have a plausible menu of short-term explanations for the business decline. They say this has been a soft tourist season, perhaps because of a mild winter in the Northeast, perhaps because of a slowing national economy. They say the closing of Hialeah has limited the number of horsemen here for the winter, and owners and trainers usually account for about 20 percent of the betting handle. The Super Bowl was in Miami last year, which helped business and the Florida Lottery is more popular than ever.
These factors, though, do not explain the tepid nature of the racing, though, nor do they address the feeling among horsemen and horseplayers that something is amiss this winter. One problem is Gulfstream's highly erratic racing surface. Many top horses are training poorly over it, and their trainers are making noises about wintering elsewhere next year. For much of the meeting, the inside of the track has been so hard and the outside so deep that races were effectively decided at the post-position draw.
The major theme of this winter, though, is excess, and the lesson is the old one that more is sometimes less.
Every time that a race track has expanded its season, the quality of the racing has declined along with the daily average attendance and handle. More subtly, and just as important, the track's appeal has been diluted. Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark., lost its spring-festival charm when it began opening in early February. New York racing lost all sense of season once winter racing made the game a year-round grind. If you extended Saratoga from four to seven weeks, it would no longer feel like Saratoga.
It is no coincidence that New York and California, which present the very best racing in the country, also offer the fewest races a day. Nine are enough for the most successful tracks, but Gulfstream went to 11 races a day this year. The days are too long, the homework too demanding for even the most dedicated horseplayer. The extra races are just extra opportunities to separate the public from its money while putting up minimal purses for the worst horses in the area.
The betting is down more than the attendance because the turnstiles keep counting all day but more and more fans are arriving late in the card. Unless you are desperate for parimutuel action or a fan of cheap and formless claimers, you can safely skip the first four races on most Gulfstream cards and spend an extra two hours on the beach.
Handicapping the future of Florida racing is as tough as deciphering the early races as Gulfstream, since so much hinges on Hialeah's future. Regardless of that, though, Gulfstream seems sure to operate during the midwinter dates, and is in a unique position to make intelligent choices. Most tracks expand their seasons to ensure their survival or under state mandate to increase public revenues. Once Gulfstream and Calder are officially under common ownership, though, Firestone and his partners can make the Gulfstream meeting however long they choose and run the rest of the dates at Calder.
Firestone has said often that he wants to make Gulfstream the home of the nation's finest winter racing. After this season, it seems clear that the way to do that is to remember that less is sometimes more. A 50-day meeting with no more than 10 races a day would be plenty.

Japan's Government and the Tokyo Stock Exchange sought to calm investors amid the largest stock decline since the crash of October 1987. The Bank of Japan offered short-term loans to banks to make sure the market had enough cash to operate. The Finance Ministry bought bonds to push long-term interest rates lower.

The United States stock market showed its resiliency yesterday, weathering the second-biggest drop in the history of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Although the Dow Jones industrial average fell at the opening, it rebounded to remain about 20 points higher throughout most of the afternoon. It finished the day with a gain of 38.29 points, or 1.5 percent, at 2,602.48.
The performance yesterday was in sharp contrast to that of last week. The Dow fell 10.58 points on Friday, to 2,564.19, bringing its loss for the week to 71.40 points. 
Stocks were helped by the strength of the dollar on foreign exchange markets. The dollar made strong gains against the yen and was higher against the West German mark.
 
Focus on Blue Chips
Traders pointed out that yesterday's stock market gain, which was also bolstered by bargain hunting and a spate of futures-related buying near the close, was concentrated in blue-chip stocks. Rising issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declining ones by a relatively narrow 822 to 639. Indeed, the overall market was mixed until the final hour, when the buying of secondary issues picked up.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 4.52 points, to 328.67, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.91 points, to 181.26.
Volume on the Big Board continued to be relatively light. Only 148.9 million shares changed hands, up slightly from the 148.5 million of Friday.
 
Japan's 2d-Biggest Drop
In Tokyo today, the Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 576.08 points to 33,897.95, after tumbling 1,569.10 points, or 4.5 percent, yesterday, when worry about inflation and weakness in the yen led to widespread selling.
On a point basis, the drop yesterday was second only to the Nikkei's decline of a record 3,836.48 on Oct. 19, 1987. Last week, the Nikkei index fell 6.9 percent.
Analysts, noting that the link between movements in the American and Japanese markets may not be as critical as previously believed, said the United States market was also buoyed when other foreign markets did not follow Japan's lead. Stocks were up moderately in London, off a bit in Frankfurt, up slightly in Parisand narrowly lower in Hong Kong.
''The sharp drop in the overpriced Tokyo market to more sustainable levels could have a stabilizing influence - neutralizing a potentially serious threat to world markets,'' said James Kalil Sr., president of Compu-Val Investments Inc., in Wilmington, Del. ''In the absence of panic selling, both the U.S. and Japanese markets will respond to internal factors - the Japanese to interest rates and very high price-earnings ratios, while our concern is for interest rates and the economic outlook.''
Among individual issues, Federal Express soared 4 1/4, to 51 1/2. Analysts attributed the gain to an improved long-term outlook for the company as well as to an unconfirmed rumor that British Airways might be interested in buying the company.
Gold and other precious metals stocks dropped across the board as the spot price of gold on the Commodity Exchange in New York settled at $408.70 an ounce, down $6.30. Platinum sank $15.40 an ounce, to $511, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Traders said the Japanese were selling precious metals to raise cash for margin calls after the drop in the stock market created a liquidity crisis for both private investors and institutions.
Among the hard-hit precious metals stocks were ASA Ltd., down 3 7/8, to 51 1/8; Homestake Mining, off 1 3/4, to 19 5/8; Sunshine Mining down 1/8, to 3 3/4; Newmont Gold, down 2, to 53, and Newmont Mining, off 1 5/8, to 51 7/8.
Tiffany fell 1/2, to 34 5/8, on what traders said were concerns that Japanese consumers would cut back on their purchases of the company's merchandise because of the decline in Japanese stocks.
Pfizer slipped 1/4, to 56, after being off more than a point in early trading. Officials at the Food and Drug Administration and Pfizer, the maker of an articial heart valve linked to hundreds of deaths, were questioned yesterday by Congressional investigators. The Acting Commissioner of the F.D.A., James S. Benson, said questions about Pfizer's marketing of its Shiley valve merited investigation by his agency.
Japanese stocks traded in the United States were sharply lower. Kyocera fell 1 1/2, to 85; Hitachi 1 1/2, to 98, and Matsushita 3/4, to 138 1/4.

HEADLINE: Japan Now Ahead in Nuclear Power, Too

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Japan is rapidly outpacing the United States in the field of nuclear power, American experts in Government, academia and the utility industry say.
Japan's advantages are widening in research and development, in construction techniques and in safe operation of the plants, according to a team of seven experts who recently returned from a National Science Foundation trip to Japan.
Even in the areas of nuclear-plant design, where American companies are making progress, the improvements will first make their way from blueprint to steel and concrete in plants built in Japan.
Several of the experts compared the loss of American leadership in nuclear power - a technology invented and first commercialized in the United States - to the fate of the American computer and auto industries, which are threatened by Japanese inventions and manufacturing advances.
Members of the team returning from Japan noted at a conference here this week the long hiatus in orders for nuclear plants in this country and said the American losses were becoming harder to reverse. 
''The infrastructure required to build nuclear plants in the United States is slowly dwindling,'' said Kent F. Hansen, a professor of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the chairman of the group. ''Without more projects, our ability to build them as cheaply as others will suffer.''
The last order for a nuclear power plant in the United States was in 1978, and since then utilities in this country have canceled about 65. In the same period, Japan has broken ground for 23 reactors. Japan has 37 operating, compared with 111 in this country. It has 12 plants under construction; this country has 5, all mostly completed.
Kevin D. Burke, an international relations specialist at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said in a telephone interview that a late start gives Japan a natural advantage. ''They've been able to look at the other nuclear programs in the world and, in many ways, improve on them, learning from the operating experience of the French program, the German program and the American program,'' he said. ''It's unfair to say in black and white that their program is better; it should be better.'' Revival Sought in U.S. Supporters of nuclear power hope American orders will revive in the middle of this decade, spurred by new designs and changes in the system for building and licensing plants. Two American manufacturers, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the General Electric Company, are designing advanced plants in work supported by the Government, and applying to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for generic approval. The idea is that utilities could win quick permission for a new plant by picking one of the approved designs rather than custom-designing, as has been the case in the past.
Still, the first copies of both companies' new plants are likely to be built in Japan, the experts said.
Building those models here successfully would require learning from the experience of the Japanese, said Loring Mills, a nuclear specialist of the Edison Electric Institute, the utility trade association. ''If we don't find a way to build new plants in the next four or five years like they do, we're not going to build them,'' he predicted.
 
More Important in Japan
But experts at the conference here were quick to point out that nuclear power is far more important for Japan, which has virtually no indigenous energy resources and a strong desire for energy independence, than for the United States, which can burn native coal for most of its electricity and is content to import oil and natural gas for much of the remainder.
Experts made these points about the deterioration of the United States leadership in nuclear power:
* Construction of a nuclear plant averages 5 years in Japan, compared with 11 in this country. Because designs are better developed before construction in Japan, a Japanese plant requires only half as many hours of work by skilled craftsmen as does an American one of the same size. And Japanese builders guarantee the prices, eliminating ballooning costs on the way to completion.
* Operation is smoother in Japan, with unplanned shutdowns coming only one-tenth as often as in American plants, on average. Japanese plants ran at 72.3 percent of capacity last year, compared with 63.3 percent in this country. The level of radioactivity in the cooling water in Japanese nuclear plants is 500 times smaller than in American plants, and the radiation dose to plant workers is 10 to 15 times smaller.
* Research and development has produced more advances in many areas in Japan. Among them: computers in some control rooms that respond to the spoken commands of operators and run a growing range of systems automatically. Researchers are making progress toward a new nuclear fuel that will last substantially longer than the current nine months, which would allow a longer interval between refueling shutdowns. And researchers are beginning work on a ''self healing'' plant that will diagnose its own problems and send robots to fix them.
 
Attention to Detail
The team spent a week in Japan last month, visiting 17 agencies, institutions and companies. The visit was part of a series organized by the National Science Foundation's Japanese Technology Evaluation Center, based at Loyola College in Baltimore, to evaluate Japanese progress in such fields as biotechnology, telecommunications and superconductivity.
As with assessments in other areas, the nuclear team found that the United States retains a lead in some areas. For example, the Japanese rely heavily on computer codes developed in this country to simulate various reactor conditions, and the American lead in the field is growing.
But the team found that patience and attention to detail were propelling Japan toward leadership in still another field. From a distance, Japanese reactors are similar to American ones, on which they are based, said Donald R. Olander, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. ''They are very similar, much as a Nissan pickup truck is similar to a Ford Ranger,'' he said. ''But there are small differences which make an enormous difference.'' These, he said, are reflected in higher reliability.
 
New Developments a Factor
In building their own industry, the Japanese have taken advantage of numerous technological developments not available when most American plants were planned, the panel said. These include computer-assisted design, advanced computers for controlling plant processes, fiber-optic communications channels, increased fabrication of large parts in shops instead of in the field, and new construction materials.
Some innovations are not Japanese, but have been perfected in Japan, said Dr. Hansen of M.I.T. ''The heaviest-lifting crane is a U.S. design,'' he said. ''They have several of them there and know more about how to use them than we do.''
In addition, Dr. Hansen said, the Japanese construction industry spends $800 million a year, about 0.54 percent of sales, on research and development of new techniques, some of which can be applied to nuclear plants. By contrast, the United States industry invests $50 million, or 0.04 percent of sales.
Japan also outspends the United States on research and development for advanced reactors, by $775 million a year to $187.5 million, and on research for the current generation of reactors, by $291 million to $180 million. Both figures exclude proprietary research by companies.
 
More Scholarly Papers
The nuclear programs of Japanese universities are well supported, the panelists said, and Japanese scientists in academia, industry and the national laboratories publish nearly twice as many scholarly papers on nuclear materials as Americans do.
Some research is in areas this country has rejected. The Japanese industry has pursued a reactor for ship propulsion, even though it does not think such a reactor will be commercially attractive any time soon, the experts said. In addition, the industry is pursuing plans to recover and re-use the plutonium fuel created in the operation of existing reactors, a step rejected in this country because it could lead to the spread of nuclear weapons. Japan is also building a ''breeder'' reactor, which makes nuclear fuel faster than it uses it up.
While the United States is unlikely to move to a breeder system, with extensive supplies of uranium available cheaply, this country would benefit from a more long-term, safety-oriented approached to the technology, the experts said. But one of the panelists, Victor H. Ransom, a scientific and engineering fellow at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, said that while the United States nuclear industry would benefit from adopting the Japanese drive toward quality and reliability, the drive arose not from technology but culture. Regulation is less contentious in Japan, he said, because the Ministry of International Trade and Industry trusts ''that the utilities will actually do the right thing.''
''The same system probably would not work here,'' he said. ''There are enough organizations that have stayed within the law but have done everything on the basis of economics,'' scrimping on expenditures that would mean long-term savings.

Training Unit Sought by Edu

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 26

 BODY:
A former executive of the National Education Corporation offered to aquire its troubled corporate-training division, Applied Learning International Inc.
The former executive, William R. Roach, offered through a company called the Edu Coporation to merge with Applied Learning. Under his proposal, Edu would inject $20 million in capital and National Education would retain a ''substantial minority equity position'' in the new company, which Edu would run. The plan does not call for National Education to receive any payment for giving up control.
Officials at National Education, based in Irvine, Calif., did not return calls seeking comment.
Recently, Mr. Roach has presented several offers for Applied Learning to the board of National Education, which is the nation's largest operator of vocational schools and corporate training programs.
 
Largely because of losses at
Applied Learning, National Education's stock has fallen from a high of over $30 in 1988.
The stock closed at $6.25 today, up 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Mr. Roach ran Applied
Learning in 1988. He later started Edu, which acquired the Control Data Corporation's training division last year.

HEADLINE: Why World Shrugged Off Tokyo's Stock Tumble

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
For some time, market watchers around the world have expressed concern that if the high-flying Tokyo stock market ever plunged, other markets would be carried down with it. But the Japanese stock market's 11 percent dive over the last week, a fairly big move by most standards, has not touched off sharp slides elsewhere, and analysts are scurrying to explain why.
The most common explanation is that the Japanese market had moved up so much more sharply than other markets that some downward adjustment was due, both to bring it into line with the bond markets in Japan and with financial markets in other countries. Some movement, analysts argued, could be accommodated -even expected. 
''I don't see why this should become self-feeding, because there is no real talk of a worldwide recession and earnings are still reasonable,'' said David A. Robbins, head of the international securities department at UBS Securities. ''This should support equity markets.''
 
'Peculiarly Japanese'
''So far investors look at the Tokyo market decline as a peculiarly Japanese situation, not a global situation,'' said Yuichi Kohashi, executive vice president of Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New York.
This is not to say investors in other markets have not been worried about the 4,138.45-point decline in the Nikkei 225 index of leading stocks in the last six days. A sharp decline in a major market, even if easily explained, can be unsettling. The United States stock markets fell each day last week, although the Dow Jones industrial average shot up yesterday by 38.29 points, to 2,602.48. For the year, the United States is down about 5 percent, Britain has dropped close to 7 percent and France is off more than 10 percent.
The relatively benign view of the decline in the Japanese stock market, which is now down 14.4 percent since the end of last year, rests on the fact that many analysts thought the rise to record levels at the end of December had taken the market too high. Because of this, it was expected that the Japanese market would fall, a move known in market jargon as a correction.
 
'Its Own Correction'
''A lot of stock markets I follow have already corrected,'' said Lawrence W. Harris 3d, manager of the Worldwide Value Fund. ''Japan seems to be having its own correction.''
In addition, the sharper rise in interest rates in Japan and the unusually public fight over interest-rate policy between the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, and the Finance Ministry have, for now, made this more a Japanese problem than a global one.
While interest rates have risen around the world, the increase in Japan has been sharper than in many other countries. Rates on 10-year bonds in Japan are up about 19 percent this year, compared with 7 percent in the United States. This means earnings on bonds became far more attractive than those on stocks, drawing money out of the stock market into bonds. The divergence in Japan has been larger than in other countries, like the United States and Britain. That is one reason the stock markets in those countries have fared better, said Alistair Ross Goobey of James Capel Inc., a London brokerage firm.
''The Japanese market, more than any other market, was extended in relation to its bond market,'' said Jeffrey M. Weingarten, director of international equity research at Goldman, Sachs in London.
 
Fight Over Interest Rates
Despite the fact that the Japanese wave has not yet swamped the rest of the world, many financial experts say the outlook is still uncertain. The fight in Japan over interest-rate policy could be unsettling. But Mr. Kohashi of Daiwa, for one, thinks Japan's desire to stabilize its market means interest rates will not be raised again soon.
But not everyone agrees. Some analysts warn that Japan may have to raise interest rates further to prop up the yen, which leaves the door open to a continued decline in Japanese stocks. With higher interest rates and a further decline in stock prices - of perhaps an additional 2,000 to 3,000 points - analysts said Japan's market problems could be contagious. Higher rates in Japan could help push interest rates higher around the world, weakening equity prices everywhere.
There are other pressures, too, that investors fear could push interest rates higher around the globe. Perhaps the most important is that the unification of Germany and development of Eastern Europe will push world interest rates higher by increasing the demand for credit. If that happens, that could force stock prices in Japan and other nations down further.
 
Pressure on Institutions
Another fear is that Japan's market weakness could spread if Japanese economic officials get so worried about the fall of their market that they put pressure on large institutional investors to bring some of their money back to Tokyo to support the market there.
''It's not changing my view that the sidelines are the place to be,'' said Barton M. Biggs, director of worldwide strategy at Morgan Stanley, who said he was surprised by the rise in American stock prices yesterday. ''I think it is a silly reaction because the Japanese market is another cloud on the horizon.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Climb in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday, bolstered by a strong dollar, a drop in the price of gold and other precious metals, and another big decline in the Japanese equity market.
The selloff on the Tokyo Stock Exchange prompted the initial rise during overnight trading, traders said, as market participants bought securities on the expectation that stocks in the United States would take a plunge.
The anticipated spillover did not take place, however, and as stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange moved higher early in the day, dealers were forced to pare their positions in the credit markets somewhat.
But the dollar's strong performance and the drop in metal prices tempered the declines and encouraged further buying later in the session. A stronger dollar and weaker metals prices help to cool inflationary pressures. 
In addition, participants said the fact that no new Treasury debt issues will be offered to investors for the better part of a month helped to firm prices.
''I think we can do better from here,'' one Government bond trader said. ''We don't get any new supply until late March, and the strength of the dollar is helping us. You don't need to be too sophisticated to see that on a day when foreign markets are doing worse and ours are doing better that money is moving into this country.''
William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said that ''there seems to be a new assessment about what is going on in foreign markets and how it effects the United States.'' He added, ''Among other things, we are learning that turbulence in the Japanese equities market is pushing people into Treasuries.''
 
Long-Term Notes and Bonds
The bulk of the price improvement was reflected in longer-term notes and bonds.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 100 1/8, up more than half a point, or more than $5 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.48 percent, compared with 8.56 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 11/ 32, up half a point, to yield 8.45 percent. And 8 1/2 percent two-year notes auctioned last week were offered at 100 1/4, up 2/32, to yield 8.34 percent.
Meanwhile, rates dipped on three-month and six-month Treasury bills auctioned yesterday.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.72 percent, down from an average rate of 7.80 percent at last week's sale.
 
Six-Month Bill Rates
Six-month bills were sold at an average rate of 7.70 percent, compared with an average rate of 7.77 percent a week ago.
While some analysts said that a dearth of new Treasury issues would tend to improve market conditions, others said that Japanese activity over the next month or so could limit any real improvement.
''I still have a lot of uncertainty regarding what Japanese institutions will be doing as they move toward the end of their fiscal year on March 31,'' said Robert Sinche, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Alliance Capital.
''Some institutions may have some unrealized gains in dollar-denominated fixed-income securities that they may want to use to offset big equity losses in Japan. We are optimistic about the market as the year progresses, but we don't think there is much room for improvement until this uncertainty about Japan recedes.''
Activity in the new-issue market for investment-grade corporate bonds was highlighted by a $500 million offering of 10-year notes from the Province of Quebec.
The 9 1/8 percent notes, which mature March 1, 2000 and are noncallable for life, were priced at $99.854, to yield 9.147, 69 basis points, or hundredths of a point, over the prevailing yield on the 8 1/2 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Corporate bond traders said that prices of most actively traded issues in the secondary market rose by 3/8 point to 1/2 point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, participants said that prices of most issues rose by 1/4 point to 3/8 point in sluggish trading.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

Dollar Up Broadly, Reaching 8-Month Highs Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar climbed broadly yesterday in foreign exchange trading, reaching its highest levels in eight months against the Japanese yen despite reported efforts by monetary authorities in Japan and the United States to curb its advance.
In New York, the United States currency rose to 148.63 yen, from 147.07 yen in late trading Friday.
Another sharp decline in the Tokyo stock market overnight helped the dollar because the decline reduced chances that Japanese authorities would raise interest rates there, analysts said. Higher interest rates in Japan would encourage foreigners to purchase yen to make investments in that country, but they would also make consumer and corporate borrowing more expensive. 
''They can't raise interest rates because that would send their stock and real estate markets into a tailspin,'' said Jerry Rothman, a currency broker for Elders Futures Inc.
He said the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve Board each intervened in the currency markets during the trading day in an effort to curb the dollar's rise and stop the yen's fall.
But Mr. Rothman and other dealers said the dollar sales by the central banks failed to drive the dollar lower.
''This is the highest dollar level against the yen since last June,'' Mr. Rothman said. ''But there is little they can do about it short of raising interest rates.''
Karen Gibbs, a senior vice president in financial futures at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago, said the dollar also benefited from its traditional role as a safe haven because of the financial uncertainty in Japan.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 148.65 Japanese yen, from 146.47 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 148.80 yen.
It also rose strongly against the West German currency, up a pfennig, to 1.6882 marks from 1.6785.
The dollar gained ground against the British pound. In London, the pound fell to $1.6927, from $1.7090 late Friday. In New York, the pound fell to $1.6903 from $1.7092.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.4860 Swiss francs, up from 1.4740; 5.7140 French francs, up from 5.6825; 1,248.50 Italian lire, up from 1,241.50, and 1.19405 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19825.

Broadening The Study Of Business

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the Great Depression and World War II might have been living drama for their grandparents, they are but historical footnotes for many of today's students, who often complete college without encountering courses in history or the social sciences.
One reason: core programs and emphasis on choosing elective courses related to a speciality tend to leave litte room for a broad range of courses.
That may be changing, however, as several graduate schools of business are giving new emphasis to the study of history, international studies and other areas that provide a broader perspective on business.
Tomorrow, for example, the Stern School of Business at New York University will announce the professor for a new course entitled the history of financial institutions and markets. The professor will fill the new Henry Kaufman chair, named for the economist. 
Dr. Kaufman, who was a graduate of the business school, endowed that chair, as well as the Charles Simon Professorship of Finance. His gifts also established Stern's Salomon Brothers Center for the Study of Financial Institutions.
Forty years ago, N.Y.U.'s business school offered three popular year-long electives: financial history, economic history and the business history of the United States. In recent years, such courses vanished or declined in number at many graduate business schools; they were often relegated to economics departments as the business schools stressed such courses as management and finance.
Dr. John W. Rosenblum, dean of the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business, called the dearth of history courses in business schools ''a serious missing component.''
Meyer Feldberg, the dean of the Columbia Graduate Business School, agreed: ''Students don't have much sense of history these days,'' he said.
Then, in 1986, when Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management introduced a business history course, the trend seemed to reverse, and many business schools began to re-examine their curriculums.
Dr. Feldberg's vision for Columbia goes beyond additional emphasis on history. Shortly after assuming the deanship last July, he named a curriculum review committee to focus on course changes that would broaden the school's approach to prepare students for the growing internationalization of business.
The committee is reviewing how to introduce what he calls the ''ethic of quality'' into courses to instill the importance of productivity in keeping American business competitive in the world market.
Also, Dr. Feldberg thinks that in the 1990's there will be more emphasis on management of human resources. ''There will be a comeback for human resources,'' he said, noting that the area was much less important in the 1980's, when the focus was on financial management.
He poses a question also to be decided by his faculty: ''Do we want Columbia business school graduates who will fill medium- and senior-management positions, or do we want to educate risk-takers?'' He favors training ''perceptive leaders who are builders, creators and innovators.''
''We're not adding more international courses,'' he said. ''The idea is to incorporate international aspects into all courses.''
At the University of Virginia, Dean Rosenblum agreed that there was a new emphasis on global aspects of business.
''The faculty wants to remove the word 'international' from international finance courses because all finance has to be international these days,'' Dr. Rosenblum explained.
At Darden, he said: ''Our first-year changes are in place as of last fall and include adding required courses in ethics and information technology. And second-year changes will be in place this fall, including more variety in electives and more careful sequencing of courses.''
He also stresses the importance of business people teaching and speaking on campus.
''I think this trend toward business schools hiring businessmen will grow,'' he said, adding that he would like to provide tenure to such teachers, which is usually difficult if they lack doctorate degrees.
''Leading business schools can hire a large number of businessmen to teach because most professors do have doctorates,'' he explained. ''The smaller, less prestigious business schools cannot hire many because they need more Ph.D.'s on their faculty for accreditation reasons.'' For accreditation, the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business requires that professors with Ph.D. degrees make up a certain percentage of a school's faculty.
But at a time when business-school professors are in short supply, Dr. Feldberg said he thinks the six-year rule for gaining tenure is not only unfair but unwise. Professors refused tenure often leave an institution.

HEADLINE: TURNOVER IN NICARAGUA;
Chamorro and Sandinista Rulers Begin Delicate Transition Talks

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Feb. 27

 BODY:
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has begun preliminary talks with the Sandinista Government on the first democratic transfer of power in Nicaraguan history.
The talks began late Monday night, after the results of Sunday's election became known, when Mrs. Chamorro held an emotional session with President Daniel Ortega Saavedra in which they pledged to work together. Representatives of the two sides met again today, and they described the negotiations as positive and productive.
But the talks went forward amid lingering questions about the Sandinistas' willingness to hand over military power, and the tension resulting from Mrs. Chamorro's victory set off sporadic confrontations through the night between supporters of the two sides.
 
Days of Uncertainty
The uncertainty shadowing the early days of the transfer was drawn more starkly this afternoon, when President Ortega told a rally of 10,000 in Managua that the Sandinistas would not give up control of the army and security apparatus unless the United States-supported contra rebels were quickly demobilized. 
''The security, the stability of Nicaragua and the development of democracy in Nicaragua is truly one of the fundamental concepts of the revolution,'' he said. ''And this has to be respected.''
But he called on a Chamorro government to ''maintain the integrity and professionalism'' of the Interior Ministry and the national army, which currently amounts to an arm of the party.
Mr. Ortega was clearly trying to reassure the most entrenched and hard-line Sandinistas, who have fought against the rebels in eight years of civil war in which more than 30,000 people have died. But his remarks and the conditions he set on the contras left many in Nicaragua and the United States nervous.
The tension of the moment reflects the country's deep polarization. A decade of war, revolution and economic ruin has created deep divisions between supporters of the governing Sandinista Front and supporters of the opposition, and those suspicions pervade almost all aspects of daily life.
But the worry also grows out of the political void created by the Sandinistas' defeat in Sunday's voting. There has never been a peaceful transition from one elected Government to another here, and the Sandinistas and the National Opposition Union, or UNO, are groping in the dark, seeking a smooth path to change.
Forty-eight hours after the polls closed, both sides are still having trouble believing that the opposition brushed aside what at times appeared to be the immovable force of Nicaraguan life. The Sandinistas had been the public and revolutionary face of power in Nicaragua for the last decade, personifying the country.
But officials from both sides said the early transition talks went smoothly, in an atmosphere of reconciliation. President Ortega so far has complied with the letter and spirit of his vow on Monday ''to respect and obey'' the election results, officials familiar with the negotiations said. ''It was an extremely difficult decision to reach, but I think he's going to stick by it,'' said Eduardo Palacio, a senior spokesman for the opposition coalition.
 
Ortega Gains Credit
Opposition leaders credited President Ortega with taking a vital preliminary step toward reconciliation on Monday night when he and several senior aides went to Mrs. Chamorro's house to discuss the mechanics of the transfer of power.
''My beautiful little father, come in, because I love you,'' Mrs. Chamorro was quoted as saying in greeting President Ortega.
''You know that I respect you and love you and congratulate you on your triumph,'' the President replied before they hugged each other.
''There were no winners or losers in these elections,'' Mrs. Chamorro added. ''What I want is that we all work for the reconciliation of Nicaragua.'' ''I am ready to cooperate,'' the President said. The meeting had particular poignancy because Mrs. Chamorro and Mr. Ortega both served on the five-member ruling junta that took power in 1979 after the fall of the Somoza family dictatorship. Mrs. Chamorro eventually left the junta in a bitter feud with the Sandinistas.
Opposition officials also praised Mr. Ortega for trying to soothe his supporters' raw passions by calling the national radio station here and persuading it to moderate its inflammatory interviews, during which one Sandinista supporter after another condemned the election results.
But some question whether Mr. Ortega can persuade all his supporters and several leaders of the Sandinista Front to follow his lead. They noted that the two sides had yet to discuss the most sensitive or explosive issues, like handing over control of the 75,000-person army and the Interior Ministry, which controls the secret police and what amounts to a second army complete with uniformed troops and tanks.
Tomas Borge Martinez, the powerful Interior Minister who is considered one of the hardest-line members of the Government, did not join President Ortega on the stand during Monday's concession speech and has not been seen in public since the 14-percentage-point defeat.
That has led to speculation that divisions may be emerging in the nine-member Sandinista National Directorate and that hard-line members may be resisting turning over power to a Chamorro administration.
Officials familiar with the transition talks said the Sandinistas had a variety of security concerns. They said the Government was seeking assurances that the Chamorro administration would prevent violent reprisals against Sandinista leaders and their supporters.
As Mr. Ortega made plain today, the Government also wants the Nicaraguan rebels disbanded before April 25, when Mrs. Chamorro is to be inaugurated.
''The Sandinistas want the contras demobilized so they do not return to Nicaragua and carry out vengeance,'' an official said.
Hundreds of the election observers who closely monitored the vote have left the country, even though the final results have not been released. But in unofficial projections based on 81.4 percent of the precincts, the opposition coalition was given 52 seats in the 91-member National Assembly, while the Sandinistas received 38.
The Social Christian Party won the remaining seats. In Nicaragua's last national election, in November 1984, the Sandinistas won 61 percent of the vote. But that vote was boycotted by major opposition leaders, who contended that the election rules were unfair.
 
Some Violence in Streets
Some Nicaraguans expressed hope that the observers would remain long enough to guide the new government into power. The UNO coalition is so splintered that there is some concern that it will not even be able to agree on how to handle the turnover of power.
The sporadic violence that erupted on Monday night was over by late this afternoon. But the skirmishes between UNO backers and Sandinista partisans left a few scars.
Leaders of the National Opposition Union said the homes of supporters and several party headquarters were attacked and stoned on Monday night in a half-dozen northern cities. At least two organizers were arrested on Monday and were being held in jail, party officials in Ocotal said this afternoon.
They said groups of Sandinista loyalists fired assault rifles into the air while attacking opposition leaders' homes. Residents of Esteli said the police stood by while mobs pelted the houses of several opposition members and burned the coalition's headquarters to the ground. A few scattered papers and the charred remains of the office's furniture were all that remained at the site today.
The violence was part of what led the opposition leaders in Esteli to ask that some of the almost 2,000 international observers who came to Nicaragua to monitor the voting remain to supervise the transition.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stock Market: Island No Longer

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The turbulence in the Tokyo financial markets in the last week has shown that the influence of one nation's market on another's, a process that has been dubbed globalization, is in some ways more powerful but works in more subtle ways than had been thought. It has also provided a vivid lesson of how much Japan's financial markets, now the world's largest, have changed in the last two years because of the easing of financial regulations and the rise of Japan as a global financial power.
This market deregulation has made it easier for capital-rich Japanese to invest abroad and influence other markets. But over the last week, the flip side of the process has become evident: The Japanese markets are also more vulnerable to influences orginating from the other markets around the globe. 
The deregulation, much of it done under heavy American pressure, allows Japanese investors to do more and has given American and other foreign financial institutions greater entry. Along with the vast investment of Japanese money overseas, this has made Japanese interest rates, Japan's bond market and the yen far more responsive to influence from elsewhere on the globe, whether it be Congressional testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman or the economic consequences of the expected reunification of Germany. Interest rates will continue to soar as that nation seeks money to finance the redevelopment of East Germany and the rest of Eastern Europe. Those rates could sway Japanese investors looking for a higher return on their money to convert yen into the Deutschmarks needed to buy German bonds. That, in turn could cause Japanese rates to rise in the domestic competition for the money that remains.
In other words, the Japanese Government is no longer able to closely manage its financial markets, a notion that many here had accepted only in the abstract before the recent volatile market gyrations. The Japanese government's frustration has been one factor worrying investors in Japan's stock market. With the Japanese government holding less sway, the concerns and fears of investors have become more dominant.
''The really important thing is that what has happened to interest rates and the markets has been investor driven, not decreed by administrative orders,'' said John S. Wadsworth Jr., head of Morgan Stanley & Company's Japan operations. ''The markets are a business now, and they weren't before.''
In a particularly revealing comment, Takahisa Iido, general manager of the Treasury Department at the Yasuda Trust & Banking Company, explained what he did when faced with great uncertainty about the direction of Japanese interest rates last December: He flew to Germany to observe the rapid economic changes taking place there, rather than consulting experts or officials in Japan, something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.
''When I observed how the markets were responding there,'' he said. ''I understood that the same influences would affect Japanese interest rates.''
Kenneth Courtis, senior economist at Deutsche Bank's Tokyo offices, said: ''Because of deregulation, the government can no longer finesse the markets and make things happen, as they could before. The government and people in the markets are confronting a much more difficult and complex policy agenda.''
A good example of that has been the performance of the yen on foreign currency markets. Early Tuesday afternoon, the yen weakened to 149.5 against the dollar, its lowest level since last summer, and a harbinger of higher rates here. Despite intervening by spending several billion dollars to buy yen to try to prop up the currency in the last week, the Bank of Japan has been unable to force rates to move down as desired.
Higher interest rates - as is the case with West Germany - make that country's currency more attractive to investors and traders to hold on to or to buy investments denominated in that currency.
But if value is falling - as with the yen - it often tends to force interest rates up as a nation's central bank tries to create an incentive to buyers to counter the selling. And if a currency is rising fast it tends to push interest rates lower, because less incentive is needed to attract buyers and because inflation worries begin to emerge.
But the experience of the last six weeks in Japan, in which interest rates soared in response to sharply higher rates in Germany, and then the stock market began to decline after the Japanese election on Feb. 18, has also shown that these cross-border influences can still be difficult to predict and understand.
For instance, when the New York Stock Exchange skidded in January because of rising interest rates, the Tokyo market fell, but much more moderately. Now, the American markets have been relatively stable, while the stock market in Tokyo has plunged about 10 percent since the beginning of last week. That has proved a stunning contradiction of earlier pronouncements that, when the huge Tokyo market fell sharply, the New York markets would quake and perhaps crash.
In fact, after Tokyo went into a 4.5 percent tailspin on Monday that frightened traders and government officials here, New York responded with a smart rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day up 38.29 points, or about 1.5 percent.
''After the crash in 1987, people had this wave theory that said the stock markets would fall like dominos if one really went,'' said Deryck Maughan, chairman of Salomon Brothers Asia. ''That clearly is not true in stock markets. We're not quite sure why, but there are lags and differences in the reactions. It's in interest rates and exchange rates that these things are transmitted much faster. And that's partly due to deregulation.''
He was referring to some of the steps taken by the government here to liberalize financial markets for both Japanese citizens and foreign firms. Among them have been the creation of several new and more open markets in short-term financial investments, and in bond futures and stock index futures; the removal of some rules governing how much interest that banks can pay Japanese depositors, and a opening up of the way the government sells its bonds, in which foreigners can now participate.
The effect of these and other steps has been to inject truer market considerations of supply and demand into how real interest rates and bond prices are determined.
One result has been that in Tokyo, the rate on the government's benchmark 10-year bond rose quickly from just under 6 percent in December to nearly 7 percent now. But with West German rates hovering near 10 percent, the possibility exists that Japanese rates would have rise further to compete for yen and dollars.
Meanwhile, the yen was still falling against the dollar. If this forces the central bank to increase its discount rate, which is the rate it charges banks for short-term loans, it could possibly jolt the the economy, which is vigorous now but might slow under the burden of higher interest rates.
''Deregulation in Japan tied the money markets into each other much more closely and this showed it,'' said Gary Seevers, co-head of the Japan operations at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
What was odd to many here was that the Tokyo stock market, after hitting a record high with a booming rally in December, barely reacted to what should have been the negative effect of sharply higher Japanese interest rates.
''Japanese investors were still thinking of December in the stock market,'' said Mr. Iido of Yasuda Trust. ''They were too optimistic and ignored everything negative until now. The economy has been affected very much by these changes in interest rates and exchange rates, but people neglected that in the stock market. Japan was simply late in looking at these changes.''
Added Mr. Courtis of Deutsche Bank: ''The market had been sleepwalking. The consensus had been that if the ruling party won the election, the yen and the stock market would get stronger. Well, the yen got weaker instead, and the stock market finally reacted.''
''The lesson has been that globalization does not just mean that when the stock market goes down in Asia then it goes down in Europe,'' said Mr. Wadsworth. ''The interest rate influences are more direct, but in the stock market it means that people just begin to think about and look around for values.''
There is clearly frustration by some Japanese officials over their inability to manage the markets here better and a highly unusual dispute between the the markets here better and a highly unusual dispute between the Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance broke out last week over how the government should react. But few expect the changes in the marketplace to stop.
Computerized program trading, which was made possible by the creation of the stock index futures market 18 months ago, has been blamed by some for aggravating the stock market's decline and the Tokyo Stock Exchange has taken steps to limit its impact. Whatever role program trading is playing, it is a product of deregulation that has added an important new variable to the Tokyo market. It does not seem likely that this variable will be removed.
First of all, the United States is still pushing Japan hard to continue the liberalizing its markets. But most important, like interest rate and exchange rate movements, deregulation has become another influence that travels from market to market, and is proving extremely difficult for any government to resist.

HEADLINE: EXXON IS INDICTED BY U.S. GRAND JURY IN SPILL AT VALDEZ

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
A Federal grand jury in Anchorage today indicted the Exxon Corporation and its shipping subsidiary on five criminal counts stemming from the Alaskan oil spill, after negotiations between the Justice Department and the company on a settlement of the case broke down. .
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh called the indictment on two felony and three misdemeanor charges ''our best shot at prosecuting this incident.''
The indictment comes just four days after the Justice Department acknowledged that it was drafting a plea bargain that would allow Exxon to avoid a criminal trial. Mr. Thornburgh said the company had refused to accept the department's terms for entering a guilty plea and avoiding a trial, although he would not rule out further negotiations.
But the details of what happened behind the scenes to bring about the collapse of the plea bargain were not clear today.
Even so the developments in the case represented a victory, at least for now, for the state of Alaska, environmental groups, and private parties seeking civil damages from the company in connection with the March 24, 1989 accident that spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound. Those seeking civil damages had complained bitterly last week that the Justice Department's proposals would undermine those efforts. 
Exxon's chairman and chief executive, Lawrence G. Rawl, said in a prepared statement that the company was ''disappointed'' with the indictments and that officials would ''defend ourselves in court against these charges.''
Because the potential criminal penalties under the indictment cannot yet be calculated, it is difficult to compare Exxon's potential liability with what it would have been forced to pay under a plea bargain.
Justice Department officials said the indictment could result in penalties of at least $600 million, perhaps far more, but not until a conviction, which is far from assured and could take years to obtain.
The plea bargain, officials said, would have imposed about $200 million in criminal fines and would also have required Exxon to contribute up to $550 million, beginning with an immediate payment of $150 million, to a fund that would be used for environmental restoration. The plea bargain would not have prevented civil lawsuits against Exxon, but the restitution fund could have offset some of the awards won by civil plaintiffs.
If Exxon is convicted, it could be fined more than $1 billion if the court applies legal provisions setting fines on the basis of economic losses or environmental damage. In that case Exxon might have to pay fines calculated at double the damages caused by the spill to the environment itself, and double the costs incurred by the Government and private parties. The Justice Department said $600 million was a conservative estimate of potential criminal fines.
In any event, the criminal penalties Exxon might face are probably dwarfed by the potential civil liabilities. Those are calculated based on the actual damage to the environment, and the cost of restoring it to its original condition or buying equivalent property. The spill killed thousands of birds and animals and crippled much of the state's fishing industry.
Today, after a meeting with Mr. Thornburgh, Governor Steve Cowper of Alaska said: ''If there is an indictment in Anchorage, and there is no plea bargain, at least in the form that we've seen it, that's fine with us. Things can be negotiated from here.''
''People ask me every day, frankly how much we want,'' said Governor Cowper. ''The answer is, we don't know. We're just beginning to put our evidence together.''
Sarah Chasis, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is suing Exxon on civil claims to force it to pay for the restoration of damages caused when the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound last March, spilling 11 million barrels of oil, also welcomed the developments.
''We think it is appropriate that the Federal Government has decided to pursue criminal penalties, and we are glad that the proposed plea bargain has not been adopted,'' Ms. Chasis said.
Mr. Rawl particularly objected to the two felony charges, which are based on the assertion of willful wrongdoing. ''Nobody willfully grounded the ship or caused the spill,'' he said. He also disputed the Justice Department's assertion that fines, under the Alternative Fines Act, could be set at double the value of the damage to natural resources. Unless that law is invoked, the fines would be minimal under the statutes that Exxon is accused of violating.
The indictment does not make any charges against Exxon corporate officers, and thus would not send any individuals to jail upon conviction.
Its two felony counts cite the company for failing to ensure that the Exxon Valdez was operated by competent crew members during its voyage out of the huge oil shipping harbor at Valdez. After leaving normal shipping channels in an effort to avoid heavy ice, the ship's crew ran into shallow waters while the captain of the vessel was below deck.
The captain, Joseph Hazelwood has been accused of drinking before the accident and is on trial in Anchorage on charges in the case; the officer left to navigate the ship was allegedly not properly licensed for those waters.
One of the felony indictments was brought under the 1972 Ports and Waterways Safety Act, which the Justice Department said ''requires the owner, master or other persons in charge of a vessel to ensure that the wheelhouse is constantly manned by competent persons.''
The other felony count was brought under the Dangerous Cargo Act, which the department said ''provides that a felony is committed if a person willfully and knowingly violates a regulation prohibiting any person from being engaged on a crew of a tank vessel, if such person is known to the employer to be physically or mentally incapable of performing the duties assigned to him or her.''
Mr. Thornburgh said that the indictment against Exxon represents the first time the Federal Government had brought such charges under the Dangerous Cargo and Ports and Waterways Safety Acts.
Prosecutors today refused to elaborate on the basis for the charges, saying that the evidence would be presented in court.
The three lesser charges were made under the Clean Water Act, the Refuse Act, and the Migratory Bird Act.
At a press conference in Washington, Mr. Thornburgh said that the prosecution of the company sent ''a strong signal that environmental crimes will not be tolerated. Firms which violate the environmental laws will face tough prosecution in the federal courts.''
Speaking privately, department officials said that they believed the proposed plea bargain might have gone through had Alaskan officials not objected to it so strenuously. But Mr. Thornburgh said that it was rejected by the company, and that the complaints of the state were irrelevant.
It appeared that the state's vehement objections to the plea bargain and the resulting political pressure had, in any event, eliminated any possibility of further compromise by the Justice Department in the final days of its negotiations with Exxon.
Conversely, attorneys said, the indictment would probably increase pressure on the company to seek more negotiations on a possible plea.
Mr. Thornburg rejected any suggestion that Exxon and the Justice Department have actually agreed quietly that the company will later agree to a plea bargain, now that the indictment has been handed down.
But he added that a criminal defendant can at any time approach prosecutors with a plea bargain proposal. He refused to say whether the department would now accept a settlement based on its earlier proposals.
Justice Department officials said that Alaska's consent to the plea bargain was essential because Exxon wanted it to affect not just the criminal case but future civil lawsuits, which will provide the state its main recourse in attempting to recover from the harm done.

HEADLINE: Philippine Support for Aquino Continues

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I found ''Aquino's Rule Is Imperiled as Foes Multiply and 'People Power' Grows Frail'' (news article, Feb. 7) inconsistent with other reliable information coming from the Philippines. To my knowledge, the most reliable sources of information concerning public opinion in the Philippines are the Social Weather Station surveys, which are conducted by the Ateneo de Manila University. Unlike your other news reports on the Philippines, this article did not refer at all to these surveys. 
The results of the public opinion survey conducted last Dec. 11-18 found the latest military coup attempt, which took place that month, to be highly unpopular. Those leaders, military and political, who defended the administration of President Corazon C. Aquino and the democratic system received very high margins of popular support, while those leaders, military and political, who supported or were perceived to have supported the coup attempt received abysmal popular support.
Mahar Mangahas, the driving force behind these surveys, has argued, in The Manila Chronicle for Jan. 15, that it would be incorrect to infer that those military leaders who defended the Aquino Government and are now enjoying strong popular support, sometimes higher than President Aquino herself, would be welcomed by the public should they lead the next coup, a position that is implied in your article.
Dr. Mangahas cites the examples of former Col. Gregorio Honasan and the Scout Rangers, whose public support previously had been high, but who, once they were implicated in a coup attempt against the Aquino administration, experienced a plummet in popularity.
Apparently, these surveys, in contrast to your article, show that people power is still alive and that the democratic system in the Philippines enjoys extensive popular support.
Unfortunately this democracy is now being challenged by a significant segment of the Philippine military and political elite who wish to grab the reins of power through force. Needless to say, United States policy toward the Philippines must continue to be fully committed to supporting the democratic process and its elected leaders during this continuing crisis.

HEADLINE: Poland Resumes Full Diplomatic Ties With Israel

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WARSAW, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Israel and Poland resumed full diplomatic relations today after a 23-year break. Poland was the third Warsaw Pact country to renew relations with Israel in the last six months.
The Poles ended relations in 1967 to support the Arabs in the Middle East war that year. Hungary restored relations in September and Czechoslovakia followed suit on Feb. 9. 
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki looked on as the Israeli Foreign Minister, Moshe Arens, and the Polish Foreign Minister, Krzysztof Skubiszewski, signed the agreement at a Government palace, and the delegations celebrated the long-awaited event with champagne.
Poland has had low-level ties with Israel since 1987, and the new Solidarity-led Government is hoping that the restoration of embassy-level relations will lead to closer economic and cultural cooperation.
''We are today opening a new chapter in the long history, full of tragedies, of the Jewish people of Poland,'' Mr. Arens said on the Israeli Army radio. ''I hope for good and close relations between Israel and Poland.''
Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, he emphasized that Israel also hopes for Polish support for its diplomatic positions in the Middle East peace process.
He later told the army radio that he found ''great understanding'' for Israel's problems among Poland's leaders. ''It seems even a greater and fuller understanding than we have found in Western Europe,'' he added.
Poland has said that resuming relations with Israel should not disturb its relations with Arab countries. Poland continues to endorse Palestinian rights to self-determination, and Mr. Skubiszewski held a January meeting with Arab diplomats to assure them of continued support.
Nevertheless, the state radio in Libya expressed ''deep regret'' over the resumption of relations. The Polish Ambassador to Tripoli was summoned to the Libyan Foreign Ministry and told that the action would harm Libyan-Polish relations and Arab-Polish relations generally, the Libyan report said.
 
Jaruzelski to Visit Israel
Mr. Arens, in his radio interview, said he had invited the Polish President, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, to Israel. The invitation was accepted but no date was scheduled, he said.
Mr. Arens said he expected that resuming diplomatic ties would lead to ''very extensive economic relations'' as well as closer people-to-people links.
''There is no doubt in my mind that it will bring about a widening, a deepening and a strengthening of the relationship between the Polish people and the Jewish people in Poland and Israel,'' he said.
He spoke of the small number of Jews - about 10,000 - remaining in Poland after the Nazi killings and of the postwar emigration of Polish Jews, mainly to Israel and the United States. In addition, many of the Jewish survivors fled in the late 1960's during an official anti-Zionist campaign associated with the 1967 Middle East war.
On Monday, Mr. Arens paid emotional visits to memorials to Poland's Jews, who numbered about 3.5 million before World War II.
He paid homage at the monument to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943, when Jews rose up against the Nazi occupiers. Mr. Arens stood in silence at the monument at Umschlagplatz, the depot where Warsaw's Jews were loaded onto trains to the Nazi camps. Today, Mr. Arens also discussed economic issues with Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, met with Prime Minister Mazowiecki and had a session scheduled with General Jaruzelski, who was Communist Party leader when the then-Communist Government initiated contacts with Israel.
He commended Poland's leadership in the democratization of the East bloc during a Monday dinner toast and said this was clearly related to its readiness to improve ties with Israel.
''It is remembered in Israel that Poland was the first country in the Soviet bloc to start the process of improving relations with Israel. It took great courage,'' he said.
At least 350,000 Israelis were born in Poland, including the country's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, and the present one, Yitzhak Shamir.

HEADLINE: TURNOVER IN NICARAGUA;
Honduran President Asks Contras to Leave Soon

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
President Rafael Leonardo Callejas of Honduras insisted yesterday that the victory of the opposition in Nicaragua's election Sunday means that Nicaraguan rebels based in his country must leave as soon as possible.
''I don't want to force circumstances in Nicaragua, which is now going through a period of political transition following a victory by the opposition at the polls,'' Mr. Callejas said yesterday at a news conference in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. ''But these rebels should not continue to stay in our territory.''
A contra official, Israel Galeano, said, however, that the rebels intended to stay in their bases along Honduras's southern border until Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the opposition candidate, is sworn in as President in April. 
President Callejas's statement came as governments around the world reacted to Mrs. Chamorro's victory.
Cuba views her victory as ''a great setback,'' its Communist Party newspaper said yesterday, but not necessarily a signal of ''political bankruptcy'' for the Sandinistas.
 
Isolation for Cubans
But with the Soviet Union announcing that it is willing to continue aid to Nicaragua, even under the new regime, Cuba seems increasingly isolated in the region. Japan said yesterday that it is willing to help rebuild Nicaragua's shattered economy, and the United States has already pledged to provide aid and to lift a trade embargo imposed in 1985.
''There is no doubt that it is a great setback, but it doesn't mean political bankruptcy'' for the Sandinistas, the Cuban newspaper, Granma, said in an editorial. Cuba has been one of the Sandinista Government's closest allies since the 1979 revolution.
Granma said Nicaraguans voted as they did because they were ''faced with the contradiction that a victory for Sandinismo would not mean the end of the war or the lifting of the blockade or the end of sanctions.'' Another factor, it said, was that traditional Sandinista allies in Eastern Europe are facing political and economic uncertainty because of ''historical retrogression,'' a reference to Western-leaning reforms sweeping the Soviet bloc.
In Moscow, however, the deputy chief of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Latin American Department, Ion Bourliai, said at a news conference that the Soviet Union was willing to continue economic aid to Nicaragua under the new leadership. ''The people have made their choice, which must be unconditionally respected by all the members of the international community,'' Mr. Bourliai said, pointing out that trade agreements between the two governments remain in force.
 
Call From El Salvador
Moscow has been providing about $333 million annually in economic aid to Nicaragua on a credit basis, and $25 million tons of wheat and rice free of charge, Mr. Bourliai said. Moscow has not supplied Nicaragua with arms since 1988, he said, but added, ''We are willing to discuss the question of cooperation in the military field with the new Government if the necessity arises.''
The Government in El Salvador, which for 10 years has been locked in a civil war that has left 72,000 people dead, used the occasion to call for reopening of peace negotiations with leftist rebels. Armando Calderon Sol, head of the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance Party, known as Arena, said: ''With the upset of the Sandinistas, democracy in the region is taking hold. There's no call to go on killing in El Salvador, and we should facilitate dialogue.
''Now is when the Salvadoran democratic process should open political spaces for the incorporation of the guerrillas and seek social harmony,'' he added.
A leader of the Salvadoran opposition, Ruben Zamora, did not say whether the Nicaraguan election offers a turning point for the civil war in his country. But he praised the Sandinista Government for a clean electoral process. The elections ''are an example of democracy,'' said Mr. Zamora, who is head of the Popular Social Christian Movement party and the Democratic Revolutionary Front. Those parties are aligned with guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
The Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo did not say how much aid it was prepared to send to Nicaragua, but said Japan is ''determined to make as much contribution as possible in this regard.'' Japan has the world's largest budget for nonmilitary foreign aid, about $10 billion a year.

HEADLINE: Mitchell Set to Move a Clean Air Bill to Senate Floor

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
As bargaining on clean air legislation continued out of the public eye, the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, insisted today that he would bring legislation back to the floor Thursday, with or without an agreement with the Bush Administration.
In discussions over the last month, Senate leaders and Administration negotiators have reached agreement on many elements of legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act of 1970. They include the difficult issues of how to control toxic chemicals sent into the air by industry and new requirements for cities that have not been able to reduce smog to levels mandated by law.
As of today, however, the two sides have not been able to resolve differences on several other important issues, most of them having to do with how stringently to crack down on pollution from automobiles. 
 
Negotiations on Acid Rain
Today the negotiators took on the still unresolved question of how the legislation would deal with acid rain, which is not a major source of contention between Senate leaders and the Administration but is an area of dispute among senators themselves. Both the legislation proposed by President Bush last year and the bill reported by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, now pending on the Senate floor. would require coal-burning power plants to make steep reductions in the pollution that causes acid rain.
A number of Senators, particularly from the Midwest, where most of the plants are situated, are concerned about the impact the plan would have on their states' economies and are seeking changes.
Senator Mitchell said today that he would introduce substitute legislation on Thursday to incorporate the negotiated changes. He did not say what he would do about those areas of the bill for which there was no agreement.
While negotiators were unable to agree with the White House on how much to control automobile pollution, sources said Senator Mitchell had reached a compromise with Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, that would reduce some concerns of Detroit's manufacturers.
 
Cloture Move Possible
For one thing, car makers would not be required to increase their vehicles' fuel efficiency substantially so as to reduce carbon-dioxide pollution. Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is the most significant industrial gas now accumulating in the atmosphere, and many scientists believe this will lead to a substantial warming of the earth in the next century.
A spokeswoman for the Majority Leader said Senator Mitchell might introduce a petition on Thursday to limit debate and the number of amendments that may be offered to the bill. The petition for cloture needs 60 votes to be adopted.
Senator Mitchell has repeatedly said that he has conducted the back-room negotiations because without them he would be unable to block or end a filibuster, particularly if it is supported by the White House.
President Bush has said he would not accept the committee bill because it was too costly. Administration officials said the Senate bill would cost the country $41 billion a year by the year 2000, whereas the President's bill would cost $19 billion. Senate aides and enviromentalists say the Administration's cost estimates are based on incorrect assumptions and are grossly inflated.
The disagreement over controlling automobile pollution is largely about a provision in the Senate bill that would require two rounds of reductions of tailpipe emissions of ozone and carbon monoxide. The Administration strongly objects to the second round of controls, scheduled to go into effect in 2003 under the Senate bill, on the ground that it would cost a huge sum and achieve only marginal improvement in air quality.
The Senate leaders, joined by state air quality officials and environmentalists, maintain that the goal of clean air cannot be met in most cities without the second round of tailpipe controls, given the growing number of cars on the road and the steadily increasing number of miles driven by each car.
The compromise on controlling toxic chemicals in the air removes one of the sorest points of contention between senators and the Administration, which said compliance with the Senate committee's provision would force many companies out of business.

HEADLINE: Fed Chairman Criticizes Social Security Tax Cut

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
As lawmakers continued to grapple for a response to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to cut Social Security taxes, Alan Greenspan, who as chairman of the Federal Reserve is the Government's most influential economic policy maker, said today that Mr. Moynihan had properly diagnosed a crippling national problem but had prescribed the wrong medicine.
Agreeing with Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Greenspan called it ''most improper'' for the Government to continue to use surplus Social Security taxes to cover general operating expenses and said the money was being ''squandered.'' He said the solution was to raise other taxes or cut spending enough to eliminate the deficit in the operating budget.
But if the proposal on Social Security by Mr. Moynihan, Democrat of New York, is adopted, Mr. Greenspan said, ''support for the system may well erode when the next generation is asked to take on a tax bill that their parents were unwilling or too short-sighted to assume during their own working years.'' 
As a private economist, Mr. Greenspan was chairman of the Presidential commission in the early 1980's that established the current payroll tax structure for Social Security.
 
Strauss Takes Exception
Later, Robert S. Strauss, a Democratic Party elder, also took issue today with the Moynihan plan but said leading politicians in both parties need to join forces to correct an unwise and unjust tax and spending system.
''The political process has failed our citizens,'' Mr. Strauss said. ''We can talk openly about sex, violence, war, condoms and deviant behavior on television, in the newspaper and on the floor of the Congress. Yet we cannot seem to talk honestly and openly about whether we need more or less taxes, more or less spending, or what, if anything, we should do about the rising cost of entitlements.''
Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Strauss testified before the Senate Finance Committee. While neither is in a position to do anything about taxes or spending, Mr. Greenspan's opinions on the economy and Mr. Strauss's on politics are important because of the stature of the two men.
Mr. Greenspan is treated in Congress with a respect bordering on reverence. At a time when fiscal policy seems out of control, he is seen by lawmakers as having single-handedly kept the country out of a recession with his deft manipulation of the money supply and interest rates.
Mr. Strauss is a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and for years has been an adviser and friend of Presidents and other politicians in both parties.
 
Democrats Look at Alternatives
Behind the scenes, a group of Democratic leaders prepared to meet this week to try to develop an alternative to the Moynihan plan on which the party can agree. Republicans have not formed a similar group, but President Bush's proposal to begin using part of the Social Security surplus in 1993 to pay off the national debt has won little support.
The Social Security surplus has also drawn the attention of the House, where the Ways and Means Committee voted today to recommend that the surplus be removed from deficit calcualtions to draw attention to the size of the deficit in the day-to-day operations of the Government.
This proposal has widespread support among lawmakers of both parties, but it is symbolic and would do nothing to solve the deficit problem.
Mr. Bush has maintained that $14 billion can be raised by cutting the capital gains tax, stepping up enforcement of the tax laws and extending some minor excise taxes that are due to expire. He has said he would veto any measure that amounted to a real tax increase.
 
Democrats Critical of Bush Plan
But Representative Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said he saw ''absolutely no way'' to increase tax collections by $14 billion, as Mr. Bush wants, without risking a veto.
Democrats oppose a cut in the capital gains tax, which they believe would mostly benefit the rich and cost the Government large sums in lost revenue in years down the road, and maintain that the prospect of raising billions from tighter enforcement is a pipe dream.
The Moynihan plan has caused political turmoil since he proposed it two months ago.
Economists and politicians of both parties agree that these are the facts: Social Security tax increases were legislated in 1977 and 1983 to generate enough so that workers in the next century would be able to pay the retirement benefits of the baby boom generation. But the Government has failed to raise enough money from other taxes to pay for the general operating expenses of the Government, from battleships to paper clips, and the Social Security surplus is being used to offset the deficit in the rest of the budget.
As a result, money that should be saved is being, in Mr. Greenspan's word, ''squandered.'' And the Social Security tax, which is borne mostly by low- and middle-income workers, has partly supplanted the income tax, which falls more heavily on the affluent.
Just as they agree on the problem, the economists and politicians agree on the solution: balance the budget and save the surplus in Social Security taxes. What they disagree on are the steps to reach that end.
Mr. Moynihan, frustrated by the lack of progress, argues that since the President and Congress seem unwilling to balance the budget and save the Social Security surplus, the tax ought to be reduced and the retirement system put on a pay-as-you-go basis. Others want to bring the budget into balance by dramatically cutting spending. Still others want to raise taxes. So far, there is nothing approaching a consensus.
Neither Mr. Greenspan nor Mr. Strauss had specific recommendations on how to balance the budget. But Mr. Strauss said he was confident that the President and Congress, working together, could work their way through the ''political mine fields'' and reach an accommodation. ''Whatever we decide to do,'' he said, ''we must do it together.''

HEADLINE: TURNOVER IN NICARAGUA;
Lenders Say Managua Has a Long Road Back

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Despite a newly proclaimed eagerness by the Bush Administration and the World Bank to breathe new life into Nicaragua's economy, economists predict that the rebuilding will take years after more than a decade of war and a United States-sponsored trade embargo.
The Bush Administration is preparing to end the 1985 embargo that has cut trade to a trickle, and to reverse the virtual veto that the United States has held since 1983 on loans to Nicaragua from international financial organizations like the World Bank.
The White House has begun consultations with Congress on a new aid program and has just invited economic advisers of Nicaragua's newly elected democratic leader, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, to visit Washington.
The World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund, other potential sources of major funds, are preparing to resume talks with Managua. 
 
Pauperized and Afflicted
Still, the Nicaraguan economy is so pauperized and so afflicted by hyperinflation and mismanagement that American and international officials say it will take years to put it right.
While the Administration may shortly ask Congress for humanitarian funds for Nicaragua, no one expects much money from donor countries or international lending organizations until after the April 25 inauguration.
''There's still a lot of doubt about what happens then, about what kind of government will emerge and about the economic program they will put forward,'' said an Administration official.
The Agency for International Development, the arm of the State Department that manages aid programs, is expected to send a delegation to Managua within the next few weeks to make a preliminary assessment of aid needs, another Administration official said.
 
Harder Case Than Panama
Most officials agree it will be harder for Nicaragua to attract investment than for Panama and even the newly democratic states of Eastern Europe.
''In Nicaragua there just isn't much to invest in,'' said Riordan Roett, a Latin American scholar at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ''What you're really doing economically is starting all over again.''
William T. Archey, a vice president at the United States Chamber of Commerce, added, ''Businessmen are going to be very, very cautious until they see the way this thing works out. Remember, until recently it took considerable courage down there to propound capitalism.''
Still, experts point out that the country, with a low population density, excellent ports on the Atlantic and Pacific and a superior soil fertilized by volcanic ash, has considerable economic potential.
 
How to Redress Trade Deficit
One of the main problems is how to redress a trade deficit estimated by Prof. Lance Taylor, a development economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, at $300 million to $400 million a year.
Nicaragua's economy is based on exporting commodities, mainly bananas, coffee, sugar, cotton, beef, shellfish, sesame, forest products and a little gold. It imports machinery, consumer goods and petroleum.
Until now the gap has been filled by credits from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and some aid from Nordic countries.
A Soviet Foreign Ministry Official, Yan Burlyai, told a news conference in Moscow that his Government was providing $333 million annually in credits to Nicaragua and $25 million worth of wheat and rice free, Reuters reported.
 
Continued Soviet Help Doubted
Although Mr. Burlyai said that Moscow would be willing to continue its Nicaraguan aid, Professor Taylor and other analysts said that with the Soviet geopolitical interest fading, they doubted Moscow would continue its support for much longer.
''I can't imagine anybody else's lap that Nicaragua will fall on except ours,'' said Professor Taylor.
The extent of economic assistance for Nicaragua, Administration officials said, will depend in large measure on the arrangements that the Chamorro Government makes with the I.M.F., an international agency that lends to countries facing severe short-term economic strains. But to qualify for the money, borrowers have to pursue sometimes painful economic changes.
In Eastern Europe, the Philippines and other countries, agreements with the I.M.F. have been a seal of approval for other assistance. The I.M.F. could lend Nicaragua about $270 million over three years, but would probably force the state to sell off state enterprises and take even more austere measures to cut inflation, now about 25 percent a month. $250 Million Overdue To get money from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, Nicaragua still has to clear up $250 million in overdue debts to both organizations. Officials here said that there would probably be some international help with those arrears.
Both organizations' lending programs, which are intended for long-term construction, could be critical to building up power plants, telecommunications networks and other such structures to support expanded business and investment. They can also aid agriculture and social projects like schools and hospitals.
In addition to lifting the trade embargo, Administration officials said they are studying ways to provide trade preferences to Nicaragua that are similar to those already offered most developing countries, including neighbors in the Caribbean Basin.
Also, the Administration wants to restore Nicaragua's quota to sell sugar in the United States. The quota was withdrawn early in the last decade.

Tolls Gov. Florio Can Support

 BODY:
Former Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey did commuters no favor in December by blocking a proposed $1 toll increase on bridges and tunnels run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. They are vital to the region's economic health and badly need maintenance, and the region's airports can no longer subsidize them. 
The issue now tests New Jersey's new Governor, Jim Florio. Last week Mr. Florio rightly rejected a premature request for higher tolls from his state's troubled Turnpike Authority. But the proposed $1 toll increase on bridges and tunnels merits support.
The plan would increase round-trip tolls from $3 to $4 beginning July 1 on four bridges and two tunnels. Monthly commuter discount packages would jump from $40 to $60. The $1 PATH fare would rise to $1.25. The Automobile Club of New York complains that drivers are again being asked to pay for losses on the PATH train line. But drivers clearly benefit from PATH: it reduces congestion. Further, the proposed fare compares favorably with the $5 toll charged on crossings run by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.
Mr. Florio's decision is likely to influence Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, who shares veto power but not the same keen pressure from trans-Hudson commuters. The burden is now on Mr. Florio either to approve the higher tolls or suggest a prudent alternative.

HEADLINE: A Postal Showdown in Westchester

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Working conditions in the cramped regional mail center here are bad, postal officials concede. The roof leaks, sorting is done on several levels and employees have only a third of the space they require. In summer tents are put up.
On Monday, accompanied by engineers and technical experts, Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank arrived from Washington to help resolve what he said had become ''our No. 1 priority, a new facility for Westchester County.'' The postal center, which also handles mail for Rockland County and parts of Connecticut, accounts for 1 percent of the nation's mail. 
But selecting a replacement site has not been an easy task for Mr. Frank.
 
Choice Narrows to 2 Sites
Dozens of sites have been studied, selected and rejected, with a choice likely to be made within a week. The final contenders are a site next to Westchester County Airport and one on hilly land in Yonkers that opponents of the airport site favor.
Mr. Frank was familiar with the airport site, but had not seen the one in Yonkers. So he explored it, often ankle deep in snow, asking questions and offering comments that seemed to suggest a measure of uneasiness in converting the wooded, undulating land into the site of a postal center.
The post office had surveyed 70 possible sites in the last two years, finally proposing to build the new center in Armonk, a central Westchester community of comfortable homes and abundant open space where I.B.M. has its corporate headquarters.
When that site encountered strong opposition from residents, the Postal Service chose one on Route 120 next to the airport in Harrison for the 569,000-square-foot building. Opposition rose there, too.
 
Environmental Study Sought
A citizens' group, the Purchase Environmental Protective Association, headed by Robert Wise, sued the Postal Service last year contending that it did not comply with environmental requirements. Purchase is a residential community in Harrison.
Mr. Wise said that ''if you look at the size of the proposal - 1,600 employees and 500 trucks coming and going every day through a semi-rural, low-density residential area - and say that it has no environmental impact, it's ludicrous.'' Traffic would use Interstate 684 and Route 120, a local road, to reach the site.
Last year Representative Nita Lowey, a Harrison Democrat who won the Congressional seat in 1988, took up the struggle against putting the postal center near the airport.
''When I took office, my goal was to establish a procedure that would stop the Postal Service from proceeding with the airport site for three months to provide time for a final study,'' she said.
She formed the Citizens Advisory Committee, which conducted its own survey of postal center sites, selecting as its first choice the wooded ridge in Yonkers that stands between two north-south arteries, the Sprain Brook Parkway and the Thomas E. Dewey Thruway.
 
Roads to Site Evaluated
The only occupant of the ridge is the Loral Corporation, a manufacturer of electronics and other equipment used mostly in jet fighters and other defense-related industries. Loral is accessible from the Thruway at an interchange that is being expanded to provide access to an industrial park being built in Yonkers.
Mr. Frank, who said he would make a decision ''in a few days,'' noted that access to a postal center from the same Thruway interchange, but along its own road, would be ''steep'' and the project would be expensive. But, he said, ''it's a viable site.''
He also said that while the airport site would contain two points of access, from I-684 and on 120, ''here there would be only one access road - and very steep, and with a sharp curve.'' If ''some truck gets stuck - we'll have a truck every three minutes - that's the end of mail service for Westchester that day.''
He said that cost also was a factor, possibly the principal factor ''for a service that has to pay its own way.'' Mr. Frank said it would cost about $150 million to build the postal center in Yonkers, compared with $100 million next to the airport.
 
County Help Possible
After members of the citizens' group met, there were reports that the county, which owns the land in Yonkers at what has come to be called the Loral site, would give the Postal Service an easement that would lower the cost of development there.
Representative Lowey said ''there is support in Yonkers for the Loral site, and it would be part of the city's economic revitalization plan.'' She said a postal center would be ''welcomed'' in Yonkers, and opposed in Harrison.
She also argued that a Yonkers site would mean less employee dislocation ''because half of the 1,200 postal workers live in Yonkers or Mount Vernon.''

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
U.S. and Cape Town Team Up to Train Managers

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
In an unprecedented move, an American university and a South African university are starting a joint program aimed at training black, Indian and mixed-race South Africans for business management posts in the racially divided nation.
Beginning next fall, 15 to 20 graduate students from the University of Cape Town are expected to attend the Rochester Institute of Technology for a year of intensive study in its business school. The students will then be placed in United States corporations for six months of practical work before returning to South Africa, Rochester officials said yesterday.
Blacks make up about 70 percent of South Africa's 35.6 million people, but there are relatively few blacks among the country's managerial class, American and South African educators said. Primarily as a result of the Government's apartheid policy, relatively few blacks and mixed-race South Africans are adequately trained for management jobs, said the institute's president, M. Richard Rose. 
Ninety-two percent of all South Africans who hold undergraduate degrees are white, according to a report issued this month by the South African National Students Congress. Of those holding graduate degrees, 92.2 percent are white, the report said.
 
'There Have to Be Opportunities'
''With this program, R.I.T. can participate in a very positive way in helping destroy apartheid,'' Dr. Rose said. ''For racial equality to ever be established, there have to be opportunities for people to move up the economic ladder to positions of influence.''
The program is expected to cost about $35,000 per student. South African companies are expected to shoulder much of the cost, said Piet Human, an associate professor at the University of Cape Town, who is recruiting companies to participate.
In a telephone interview on Monday, he said some aspects of the joint program, which promises its graduates a master's degree in business administration, have yet to be worked out. ''We are still negotiating it,'' he said.
Dr. Rose said he was confident that South African companies willing to invest $35,000 per student in the program would be likely to employ those students later.
 
'In a Bit of Turmoil'
The release earlier this month of Nelson Mandela and the legalizing of the African National Congress, of which Mr. Mandela is a leader, have moved some South African educators to advocate broadening the R.I.T. program to include training black managers for roles in the South African Government.
Recent events have ''put us in a bit of turmoil,'' Dr. Human said, adding that the University of Cape Town, known for its politically progressive policies, is ''reflecting on the implications of the changes.''
Current plans call for the program to gradually expand over the next four to five years to include 100 students. But there are no plans at present to prepare students for government management.
In the meantime, the program is expected to begin on schedule, Rochester officials said.
Response from corporations both in the United States and in South Africa has been good, said Prakash Sethi, a visiting professor from the City University of New York, who is teaching international business at Rochester. The program was his idea. ''The university has done some informal checking and the response has been almost uniformly supportive,'' Dr. Sethi said of American companies who have been asked to employ the students for six months. ''They all want to know the details of the program.''
 
Protecting Investments
South African corporations have responded in much the same way, said Dr. Human, of Cape Town. But he added that South African companies are concerned about how to protect their investments by insuring that students they sponsor return to work for them.
Susan Mnumzana, an African National Congress member who works with the Archbishop Tutu Southern African Refugee Scholarship Fund in New York City, called the program ''a good idea,'' and praised the participation of the University of Cape Town.
''It has become an anti-apartheid center in terms of education,'' she said, adding that the school has distinguished itself in recent years by accepting students on merit, not by race.
The university's racial sensitivity provided a twist, Dr. Rose recalled: ''They were concerned that there could be some sort of reverse discrimination. We assured them that that would not be the case.''
While the program's emphasis will remain on nonwhite South African students, a group historically denied educational opportunities, white South Africans will not be excluded, Dr. Rose said.
The widespread perception among many nonwhite South Africans is that South Africa's white business community, now hard hit by anti-apartheid trade sanctions, is an extension of apartheid.
''Because of this, a career in business is not particularly attractive to blacks and coloreds,'' Dr. Rose said. ''But it is easier for a manager to influence his company than if he is a laborer.''

HEADLINE: Dow Climbs by 14.64; Tokyo Market Gains

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices advanced for the second straight session yesterday on slightly stepped-up volume.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.64 points, to 2,617.12, as investors absorbed the news of an exceptionally large drop in durable goods orders much as they did the 4.5 percent plunge in the 225-Nikkei stock index in Tokyo the day before. The Dow weathered that drop to post a 38.29-point gain. 
Yesterday the Nikkei index spurted 576.08 points, to 33,897.95, its ninth-largest one-day gain in terms of points. Psychologically, at least, the sharp rebound in Japan's shares lifted the American market, which also benefited in early trading from technical and futures-related buying.
Analysts said that the stock market received some indirect help during the day from the bond market, where prices rose and interest rates declined in part because of the weakness suggested by the 10.5 percent drop in durable goods orders for January, the biggest drop on record. Lower interest rates make investment in bonds less competitive with stock investments.
By late in the day, the 30-year Treasury issue was up about a half a point to 100 19/32, to yield 8.43 percent.
Japanese stocks traded here fared well across the board. Kyocera rose 5 3/4, to 90 3/4; Hitachi 3 1/2, to 101 1/2; Matsushita 2 3/4, to 141; Pioneer Electronics 6, to 86, and the TDK Corporation, 2 3/4, to 41 1/4.
The advance was broad based yesterday, with 927 issues rising in price and 558 falling. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.59 points, to 330.26, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 0.90, to 182.16.
Volume on the Big Board rose to a still-moderate 152.6 million shares, from 148.9 million on Monday.
American Express was the most active stock, falling 5/8, to 28 1/8, on a volume of 3.4 million shares. Traders said the company's new recapitalization plan for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. disappointed some investors who had hoped American Express would carry through with its plan to lower its stake in Shearson to below 50 percent.
Pfizer jumped 3 1/8 points, to 59 1/8. The stock rallied after Congressional hearings produced no significant new information on regulation of heart valves.
AMR rose 1 point, to 59 1/2. Wertheim Schroder's airline analyst, Candace Browning, upgraded her rating on AMR from ''neutral'' to expected to outperform the market.
The rise in AMR helped propel the Dow transportation average 16.89 points higher, to 1,116.29. Other airlines also contributed, with UAL Corporation up 2, to 128 1/2; Delta Air Lines 1 1/2, to 68 3/8; USAir 1 1/2, to 30, and Pan Am, 1/8, to 3 1/8.
Honeywell gained 1 3/4, to 80 5/8. A Paine Webber Inc. analyst, Mark Altman, upgraded his rating on the company to ''attractive'' from ''neutral'' on the prospects that Honeywell, which began a restructuring last year, would show better earnings.
Active blue-chip stocks included General Motors, up 1/2, to 45; I.B.M., off 1/4, to 103 3/4; General Electric, up 3/4, to 62; Philip Morris, off 1/8, to 37 5/8, and A.T.&T., up 1/2, to 39 5/8.and A.T.&T., up 1/2, to 39 5/8.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.04 points, to 351.40, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index gained 1.66 points, to 422.61.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Note and Bond Prices Are Higher

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
An economic report that was much weaker than anticipated helped to push up prices of Treasury notes and bonds yesterday.
The Commerce Department report showed that durable goods orders slumped by 10.5 percent in January, about three times as large as market participants had been expecting. Traders said that its release encouraged retail accounts, absent from the market for much of the year, to do some buying.
''Now that the refunding auctions are out of the way, people are feeling more comfortable,'' one bond trader said. 
''Every day you see investment money pouring in, from both domestic and international accounts. And while the economy may not be on the Street's mind, with the buying we saw today it seems that it is on the mind of retail investors.''
Analysts said the steep decline in the volatile orders statistics, which followed increases recorded in November and December, does not suggest rampant weakness in the manufacturing sector. But the new figures, they said, tend to reaffirm the notion that the economy is far from vibrant.
Moreover, the analysts said the numbers might force credit market participants to refocus their attention on domestic developments after spending the last few weeks reacting to financial and political events beyond the borders of the United States.
''These numbers tell you the apparent run-up in durable goods orders was clearly suspicious,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. ''But all they do is take you back to a couple of months ago, when the numbers were showing that the industrial sector was flat.''
Jeffrey Leeds, chief economist at Chemical Bank, said, ''You can pretty much date the beginning of the recent run-up in interest rates to the release of the November durable goods report in mid-December,'' he said. ''That one number got people into a certain train of thought about the economy, which was kept moving by subsequent events.''
Mr. Leeds added that one number would not be enough to change the current mood of the market, or of the Federal Reserve Board.
''If there is going to be a change in psychology, which invariably leads to a change in policy, we will need to see some corroboration of weakness from additional data,'' he said. ''But I don't doubt for a minute that that will happen down the road.''
The next report on the state of the economy could come tomorrow, when the February survey of the nation's purchasing managers is expected to be released.
 
Durable Goods Numbers
The durable goods numbers were sufficient to encourage buying yesterday, however.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 100 19/32, up half a point on the day, to yield 8.43 percent. Late Monday the bellwether issue was offered at a price to yield 8.48 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 21/ 32, up 11/32, to yield 8.40 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 5/8, up 5/32, to yield 8.33 percent. Treasury bill rates were mixed. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.71 percent in late trading yesteday, up five basis points, or hundredths of a point. But six-month bill rates dipped by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.64 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.49 percent.
A number of new issues were offered in the investment-grade corporate bond market yesterday, including a $200 million issue of first refunding mortgage bonds from the Virginia Electric and Power Company.
The 9 3/4 percent bonds, which mature March 1, 2020, were priced at $98.85, to yield 9.87 percent, 1.40 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent 30-year bond at the time of pricing. The bonds are noncallable for five years.
Morgan Stanley & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary corporate bond market, traders said that prices of the most actively traded issues rose by 1/4 of a point to 3/8 of a point.
The sale of new issues of New York State and South Carolina bonds had little negative impact on prices in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities.
Market participants said that prices of most issues in the secondary municipal bond market rose by about 3/8 of a point.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up Against the Yen Despite Bank Intervention

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen yesterday, reaching an eight-month high despite intervention by central banks. It closed mixed against other currencies.
Thomas Palladino, a trader with the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York, said the Federal Reserve sold dollars in New York in an attempt to drive down the currency's value against the yen when the dollar reached the level of 148.80 to 148.85 yen. He said the intervention appeared to have little effect. 
Earlier, the Bank of Japan tried to stem the dollar's rise against the yen in the Tokyo market. On Monday, both central banks sold dollars, but the currency moved up against the yen despite the intervention.
The dollar rose yesterday to 148.73 yen in late trading in New York from 148.63 late Monday. The dollar has not closed that high against the yen since last June 15, when it reached 151.30 yen.
 
Softened in Morning
Traders said the dollar softened a bit in the morning after the Commerce Department reported that orders to United States factories for durable goods plunged 10.5 percent in January, the biggest decline since the gauge began 32 years ago. But the dollar soon regained its strength.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 149.03 yen from 148.65 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it slipped to 148.57 yen.
The dollar was mixed against the British pound. In London, the pound traded at $1.6915 late Tuesday, down from $1.6927 late Monday. In New York, the pound cost $1.6908, up from $1.6903 of late Monday.
Against the West German currency, the dollar slipped to 1.6880 marks, from 1.6882.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Monday, were: 1.4840 Swiss francs, down from 1.4860; 5.7150 French francs, up from 5.7140; 1,248.75 Italian lire, up from 1,248.50, and 1.1938 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19405.
 
Gold Is Down
Gold prices fell yesterday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid for gold at $408.25 an ounce at 4 P.M., down 25 cents from late Monday.
On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery dropped 70 cents an ounce, to $408.
Earlier, gold traded in London at a late bid price of $407.25, down from $411.75 bid late Monday. In Zurich, the bid price was $411.25, unchanged from late Monday. In Hong Kong, gold fell $4.30 to close at a bid of $407.85.
Silver bullion closed in London at a bid price of $5.11 an ounce, down from $5.23 on Monday. In New York, silver for current delivery fell to $5.075, from $5.147 on Monday, on the Commodity Exchange.

HEADLINE: Durables Orders Fall 10.5%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
New orders for durable factory goods, the backbone of the nation's manufacturing economy, tumbled a record 10.5 percent in January, the Commerce Department reported today.
The drop, to $118.2 billion, was about three times as much as expected and was mainly attributed to a falloff in orders for a broad range of transportation equipment, including aircraft. Without the transportation category, orders for durable goods, which are items expected to last three years or more, were down 3.4 percent.
Much of the decline in the transportation category in January reflected the comparison with an unusually strong figure in December, when aircraft orders surged following the settlement of the Boeing strike in late November. 
 
Generally Poor Results
Still economists regarded the results as generally poor, and some said they raised fresh doubts about further export gains and about whether companies would carry through plans to increase capital spending by more than 6 percent this year. New orders for capital goods, which are items used by businesses to provide goods or services, plunged 17.8 percent last month, or 13.7 percent when military orders are excluded, today's report showed.
Analysts cautioned, however, against concluding that the overall economy has begun to slide or even that the battered factory sector had taken a significant turn for the worse.
''They look mighty weak,'' an economist with Bankers Trust, Jay N. Woodworth, said of the durable-goods orders. ''But I wouldn't extrapolate the January softness to the whole first quarter.''
 
Subject to Wide Swings
Private and Government analysts said this series of statistics is normally subject to wide swings, and they suggested that several mitigating factors were at work this month, including bookkeeping aberrations, like the tendency of companies to post orders just before the end of the year, thus exaggerating the figures for December at the expense of January.
There was also a sizable decline in electrical machinery, especially communication equipment. But primary metals and nonelectrical machinery posted modest gains.
The stock market shrugged off the report early in the day and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.64 points. The bond market was encouraged by the news, which provided further evidence of weakness in the economy and therefore less chance of higher interest rates.
The markets might have taken a cue from the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan. In an appearance before Congress on the subject of Social Security today, Mr. Greenspan said in response to a question that the durables orders numbers, which he called ''highly unstable,'' were not particularly worrisome.
''Our judgment is that orders are basically flat,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''Other data that we have suggests that the order pattern is soft,'' but the evidence, he added, is ''by no means accumulating on the downside.''
Mr. Greenspan and other analysts also observed that much of the decline was in aircraft, which had previously risen sharply, and in automobiles, which are measured as shipments and thus really reflect current production rather than longer-run business. Auto maker's statistics show that the output of motor vehicles has rebounded somewhat in February.
 
Undercuts Minority View
Wayne M. Ayers, senior economist for the Bank of Boston, described the durables orders as consistent with other recent weak factory data. While not forcing a policy change on the Federal Reserve, he said, the indicator ''at least undercuts'' the minority view that the Fed's next move is to raise interest rates in the wake of recent sharp - albeit probably temporary - increases in inflation.
Over all, the 10.5 percent drop in orders for dubable goods was the biggest since the Department started recording them in 1958. The second-biggest decline, 9.2 percent, came in February 1982.
Last month's drop followed gains of 1.4 percent in December and 4.8 percent in November. The December gain had previously been put at 3.2 percent until revised downward today.
Transportation equipment plunged 27.6 percent, to $27.9 billion, following increases averaging 7.8 percent in the preceding two months. Aircraft and parts, which had been running at unusually high levels, accounted for nearly half the decline, but motor vehicles and parts and shipbuilding and tanks were also both down sharply, the Department reported.
 
Too Soon to Show Up
A Commerce Department analyst, Ruth Runyan, said she thought it too early for reduced international tension to be reflected in orders for military equipment. ''That wouldn't have shown up yet,'' she declared.
Not counting military orders, factory durables orders fell 8.4 percent last month after gains averaging 3.2 percent in November and December.
Electrical machinery fell 17.6 percent, to $18.8 billion, following increases averaging 6.5 percent in November and December. Nearly all the decline was in communications equipment, the Department said.
Nonelectrical machinery, however, rose 2.6 percent to $22.3 billion, while primary metals rose 1.5 percent to $11.1 billion.
Before seasonal adjustment, durable goods orders slumped 17.4 percent to $110.2 billion, or 8.9 percent below the level of January 1989.
Today's report also showed that shipments of factory durables fell 3.7 percent, to $117.7 billion last month, the 10th decline in the last 13 months. Unfilled orders edged up one-tenth of 1 percent, to $494.7 billion.

So Long, Marlboro Man

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THE latest figures on death and destruction from tobacco, released last week by the Department of Health and Human Services, hold few surprises. The $52 billion financial toll estimated for 1985 looks downright conservative next to the $65 billion calculation made five years ago by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment.
What may surprise, though, is the department's little-noticed acknowledgment that smokers carry most of the financial burden themselves. Indeed, those who abstain may actually benefit from the tobacco pestilence: Smokers have a habit of dropping dead before they consume their share of Social Security and private pension benefits. 
If someone must pay, one supposes, it might as well be those who make the choice to smoke. But the department's confirmation, based on a number of economic and epidemiological studies, does cloud the moral case for raising excise taxes to deter cigarette consumption. For smokers, who on average are poorer than nonsmokers, already pay as much as 54 cents a pack in state and Federal taxes. A less problematic deterrent - one that may, paradoxically, serve the interests of cigarette makers as well as tobacco's victims - would be a ban on advertising and promotion.
According to ''Smoking and Health, a National Status Report,'' cigarette consumption for each adult American is down 15 percent since 1985. But it is hardly out: The 26 billion packs consumed last year shortened smokers' lives by an estimated three million years. In 1985, smoking-related illness cost $34 billion, while income lost from premature death added $18 billion.
This $2-a-pack cost offers a tempting rationale for raising cigarette taxes. Along with generating tens of billions of dollars in revenue, a tax in the $2-a-pack range would have a powerful impact on the habits of those at greatest risk. One study indicated that an increase of just $1 a pack would cut smoking by 12- to 17-year-olds by half.
But Ken Warner, an economist at the University of Michigan, points out that taxing smokers is the economic equivalent of double jeopardy. Tobacco addicts obviously have the most to lose from smoking-related illness and death. According to two Swiss researchers, R. E. Lau and T. Schaub, over a lifetime smokers' medical insurance costs are not appreciably greater than nonsmokers'. And as a Stanford University economist, John Shoven, has calculated, premature death saves society about $20,000 in Social Security benefits for each smoker.
In any event, survey data from the Centers for Disease Contol suggest that smokers could not easily afford the levy: while just 16 percent of those with college degrees still smoke, 36 percent of high school dropouts continue to puff away.
One alternative to deterring smoking with taxes is to clamp down on cigarette promotion that seduces teen-agers and reinforces adult addiction. This approach, pressed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, has proved a political non-starter in Congress because it draws fire from advertising interests as well as from the tobacco lobby. But changes in the politics and economics of the cigarette business could turn the tide.
The cigarette market is increasingly dominated by one company, Philip Morris, and its overwhelming best seller, Marlboro. Research by Mark Roberts and Larry Samuelson, economists at Penn State, concludes that advertising existing brands will not reverse the trend; the only practical way for competitors to regain market share is to offer new brands. But the recent experience of the No. 2 manufacturer, RJR Nabisco, suggests that even that route is fast closing.
Premier, the no-tar, low-smoke cigarette aimed at the health-conscious, never made it out of the St. Louis test market. The debut last month of Uptown, aimed at blacks, was sunk in a wave of adverse publicity. And the same fate may await Dakota, RJR Nabisco's best hope for winning back the legions of young blue-collar smokers who identify with the Marlboro cowboy.
If the barriers to creating a Marlboro-buster have indeed become insurmountable, it may well pay all cigarette makers to stop worrying and enjoy their shared monopoly over a shrinking market. Promotion, everything from billboard ads to the sponsorship of tennis tournaments, cost the industry $2.4 billion in 1986. A ban on these expenditures would transform that $2.4 billion debit into a $2.4 billion credit, increasing the industry's earnings by a third overnight.
Cigarette makers are not likely to endorse so direct an assault on the legitimacy of their product. Probably all that would be needed to disarm the opposition to a ban on promotion, however, would be a few second thoughts. The days of cigarette advertising may be numbered.

FOOD manufacturers seem to have a penchant for taking nutritious foods and processing them to the point where they are no longer wholesome. Potatoes are a good example. In its purest form, a medium 5-ounce potato provides only 155 calories and is virtually free of fat and sodium. Potatoes are also good sources of complex carbohydrates, fiber and vitamin B6, and excellent sources of vitamin C and potassium.
But processing often transforms potatoes into oily or cheese-laden concoctions like potato chips, french fries, deep-fried hash browns or scalloped potatoes with bacon. These might have up to 230 calories a serving, with more than half of their calories as fat, and more than 500 milligrams of sodium a serving. That is a far cry from what nature intended. 
Potato consumption is up slightly in recent years, said Nancy McCarthy, director of consumer relations for the Potato Board in Denver, a trade association of growers. ''But we're eating more processed potatoes than fresh potatoes,'' she added.
The Potato Board cites figures from the Economic Research Service of the Federal Department of Agriculture. In 1988, the most recent year for which figures are available, Americans consumed one-third more processed potatoes than fresh. From 1968 to 1988, the consumption of fresh potatoes per person dropped 17 percent, while the consumption of processed potatoes rose 46 percent.
The nutritional decline of potatoes starts in the early stages of processing, when they are peeled. Peeling removes about half of a potato's fiber. After the fiber has been stripped, fat is added by frying or dressing with cheese. Along the way, potato products also lose most of their vitamin C, which is easily destroyed by exposure to heat and air.
Of the more than 500 million pounds of frozen french fries produced for retail sale in 1988, most were fried in processing so they could be baked in a microwave or conventional oven and still have a deep-fried appearance. Thus, even if consumers bake these french fries instead of frying them, fat has already been cooked into them. If they are deep fried at home, more fat is absorbed. A few french fry producers go a step further and spray on additional fat after longer-than-average frying.
Most major manufacturers of french fries fry only with polyunsaturated vegetable oils, which do not raise cholesterol levels, but no such assurance can be made for fries sold by fast-food chains. Some chains fry their potatoes in a mixture of oils that include beef fat. The saturated fats in beef raise blood cholesterol levels.
At the more healthful end of the spectrum, are ''light'' fries, in which fat is cut two-thirds by reducing the frying time.
John Lord, senior manager of quality assurance at Ore-Ida Foods, the largest American manufacturer of processed potato products for the retail market, said a good guideline for choosing a french fry is the larger the cut of the fry, the lower its fat content. Smaller cuts, like shoestrings, absorb more oil than larger cuts, like a dinner fries.
Sodium in processed potatoes is not quite as widespsread as fat. Most frozen french fries are actually low in sodium, providing less than 50 milligrams in a 3-ounce serving. The products most likely to be heavily salted are packaged dehydrated potato side dishes, like scalloped or au gratin potatoes, or potato products that are mashed and then reformed into desired shapes, like hash brown patties and frozen stuffed potatoes.
Sodium in these products can run as high as 700 milligrams a serving or about 20 percent of the daily maximum recommended by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md., a branch of the National Institutes of Health.
Though chips are thought of as the saltiest potato products, most packaged potato side dishes contain at least as much sodium per serving as four ounces of tortilla chips.
''With fat and salt often comes sulfites,'' said Jayne Hurley, associate nutritionist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group in Washington. Sulfites, which are sometimes added to dehydrated potato products to prevent them from turning brown, can cause life-threatening allergic reactions to those suffering from asthma or others who are sensitive to sulfiting agents. The ingredient list on a package will include ''sodium bisulfate'' if sulfites are present.
Though frozen french fries are usually free of additives except the oil absorbed in frying, packaged potatoes acquire a long list of additives, preservatives, colorings and flavorings in processing that further distance them from their origin.
Considering that fiber is stripped, vitamin C is destroyed and sodium, fat and unnecessary additives and preservatives are processed into potato products, most nutritionists agree that a half-cup serving does not count toward the five or more servings of fruits and vegetables that they recommend people consume each day.
''You don't have to resort to things that come in a package for a fast side dish,'' Ms. Hurley said. ''If you have a microwave, you can bake a potato in just a few minutes.'' She suggests topping potatoes with low-fat or nonfat yogurt, salsa or Parmesan cheese.
To bake a potato in a microwave oven, pierce it with a fork, then place it on a paper towel in the oven. Cook on high in a 650-to-700-watt oven for four to six minutes, turning once. Let stand for two minutes. Cook six to eight minutes in a smaller oven.
Ms. McCarthy of the Potato Board said potato skins make a quick snack or side dish. Though those served in restaurants are usually fried, Ms. McCarthy says they don't have to be. ''I bake them, scoop them out and then bake them again with toppings,'' she said.
Baked potatoes or potato skins can also be topped with leftover vegetables, stews, pilaf, lentils, split pea soup, fresh tomatoes, chilies, mushrooms, bell peppers or onions to create a healthful potato dish.
