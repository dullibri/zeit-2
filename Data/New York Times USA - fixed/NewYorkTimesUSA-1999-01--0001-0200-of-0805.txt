Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 6. 

Now Playing
 
 "AMERICAN HISTORY X," starring Edward Norton, Edward Furlong and Beverly D'Angelo. Directed by Tony Kaye (R, 118 minutes). Flawed but gut-slugging, renounced by its director yet still a showcase for his effective style, this story of a neo-Nazi skinhead who develops a heart of gold presses every possible hot button. And its toughest images stick even when its lurid self-aggrandizing, presented in the ersatz poetic idiom of videos and commercials, spins out of control. In a show of De Niro-like fury and versatility, Mr. Norton plays a savage, racist killer who learns the error of his ways through simple-minded but brutally effective plot devices and trying to protect his younger brother (Mr. Furlong). Hotheaded and sensationalistic, but startlingly tough (Janet Maslin).
 
 "ANTZ," starring the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman and Christopher Walken. Directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson (PG, 83 minutes). Computer animation has advanced to the point where it can make a cute romantic couple out of Mr. Allen and Ms. Stone. This and other surreal tricks are shown off in a funny, ingeniously animated insect picture that often reaches the anthropomorphic cleverness of "Toy Story" and shows off Mr. Allen's sharpest comic timing with one-liners. But "Antz" winds up overplotted in bizarrely grandiose ways, with the threat of genocide invoked for a jarring change of pace. Must every child-friendly adventure film, even one with considerable potential to delight grown-ups, boil down to a struggle for world domination? Surely a threat of bug spray in the picnic basket would have done the trick (Maslin).
 
 * "A BUG'S LIFE," featuring the voices of Dave Foley, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey. Directed by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton (G, 94 minutes). The best animated ant-colony movie of the year. And this is a more clearly defined family film than the verbally adult "Antz." With the same anthropomorphism that gave Mr. Lasseter's "Toy Story" so much spark, this pastel-hued, visually ingenious feat of animation tells a tale of ant courage while incorporating lively wit and an enchanting sense of nature. And it's a showcase for the incredible range of facial expressions that make this type of animation more and more invitingly lifelike all the time (Maslin).
 
 * "CENTRAL STATION," starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Mr. Salles's film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Mr. Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance is one of 1998's very best (Maslin).
 
 * "DANCING AT LUGHNASA," starring Meryl Streep, Brid Brennan, Michael Gambon, Kathy Burke and Catherine McCormack. Directed by Pat O'Connor (PG, 94 minutes). Ms. Streep is grand, as are the other principals here, in an actors' heyday of a film adapted from Brian Friel's delicate play. And if Mr. O'Connor has lost some of the play's intensity by opening it up so overwhelmingly, he's also gained a good deal in the way of lovely Irish scenery and quaint rural charm. Set in 1936, the story presents a family of five unmarried sisters on the brink of change and revolves around the return of their gently eccentric brother from many years' missionary work in Africa. Rather than major dramatic events, this beguilingly atmospheric film observes the sea changes that alter these characters' lives (Maslin).
 
 "ELIZABETH," starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124 minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Elizabeth I as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays the Queen as if her principal responsibilities were being bejeweled, selecting consorts and saying "Leave us!" with a wave of the hand. For all its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, this is historical drama for those whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene reminiscent of "Saturday Night Fever," it winds up imagining the Queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman afflicted by a super-intense case of having it all (Maslin).
 
 "ENEMY OF THE STATE," starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight and Regina King. Directed by Tony Scott (R, 128 minutes). Mr. Smith goes on the run in a paranoid thriller whose high-tech gizmos are a main attraction. He also carries the story ably in his first real leading role, that of a successful lawyer who suddenly finds himself under surveillance by a sizable nerd squad at the National Security Agency and a satellite in space. Fortunately, it all hurtles by too fast for audiences to stop for plot questions. Sterling cast members like Mr. Hackman as an eccentric technology whiz and Mr. Voight as a chilly advocate of surveillance tactics bring an additional touch of class (Maslin).
 
 "THE FACULTY," starring Jordana Brewster, Clea DuVall, Laura Harris and Josh Hartnett. Directed by Robert Rodriguez (R, 111 minutes). Like Frankenstein, "The Faculty" plunders the crypts of cinema for its body parts. Here are the paranoia and parasitism of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." There are the slimy, sharp-toothed creatures of "Alien." And over there are the movie-wise teen-agers of "Scream." The list could be extended, but the point is clear: this mediocre sci-fi horror film about an Ohio high school being taken over by thirsty space aliens intent on world domination breaks no new ground. But written by Kevin Williamson, it has an engaging cast, with half a dozen appealing young actors playing the roles of teen-agers who are all that stand between the Midwestern monsters and the end of the world as certain moviegoers know it (Lawrence Van Gelder).
 
 * "GODS AND MONSTERS," starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser. Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a performance that well deserves to be remembered at Academy Award time, Mr. McKellen becomes the deliciously urbane James Whale, the gay "Frankenstein" director, playing him late in life. Shaken by the aftereffects of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming back to greet him just as the present offers new fascination in the Adonis-like form of the gardener (Mr. Fraser, also fine), whom Whale finds mowing his lawn. This beautifully acted, witty and heart-tugging film, from a Christopher Bram book, imagines what Whale's final days might have been like while shaping a splendid character study and a droll portrait of closeted gay Hollywood. Lynn Redgrave provides ballast and comic relief as Whale's perpetually scandalized housekeeper (Maslin).
 
 * "HAPPINESS," starring Jane Adams, Dylan Baker, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Lara Flynn Boyle. Directed by Todd Solondz (not rated; 135 minutes). In a much bigger film than his "Welcome to the Doll House," this audacious, deadpan filmmaker explores loneliness in his murderously funny fashion. Outrageous touches -- none more so than its title -- come easily to "Happiness," and so do the dark secrets that would surely have brought it an NC-17 rating. No point in cataloguing this film's perverse details: what emerges most clearly is a ruthless yet tender portrait of suburban characters seeking romance, captured with enough acid precision to make this a "Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice" for totally dysfunctional times. Ms. Adams plays the dartboard in a three-sister family with hilarious tremulousness. Mr. Baker's gutsy portrayal of a bland-seeming pederast who is also a respected doctor and a loving father is impossible to forget (Maslin).
 
 * "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL," directed by and starring Roberto Benigni (PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to find humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly entertaining as its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more somber second act, Mr. Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear (Maslin).
 
 "JACK FROST," starring Michael Keaton, Kelly Preston and Joseph Cross. Directed by Troy Miller (PG, 100 minutes). Mr. Keaton stars as the title character, one of those rock-and-roll musicians who are also great husbands and devoted dads. The film is about what happens after Jack dies in a Christmas Eve automobile accident and returns to his family as a large, wisecracking marshmallow man parked on the front lawn. As one more Hollywood effort to look on the sunny side of fatality, this one is so sugarcoated that it makes other recent efforts in the genre look blisteringly honest by comparison. The actors are as plausible and nice as possible in displaying emotions as sincere as the soap-flake snow that coats the sets (Maslin).
 
 "LITTLE VOICE," starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn, Ewan McGregor and Michael Caine. Directed by Mark Herman (R, 99 minutes). The main attraction here is watching wispy Ms. Horrocks put on a spectacular one-woman diva festival, with her phenomenal mimicry of musical grande dames from Judy Garland to Marilyn Monroe. What works less well is the broad and stagy story built around her. As the timid title character, she is harangued by her blowsy mother (Ms. Blethyn), latched onto by the talent agent who is the mother's boyfriend (Mr. Caine) and courted by a nice young man who loves his pet pigeons. In that last role, Mr. McGregor makes a telephone installer scintillating and once again shows that he can do anything. Incidentally, the soundtrack is divine (Maslin).
 
 "LIVING OUT LOUD," starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito and Queen Latifah. Directed by Richard LaGravenese (R, 102 minutes). Making his directorial debut, Mr. LaGravenese, a sensitive screenwriter, remains very much a writer, constructing a talky, introspective character study laced with flights of musical fantasy. Ms. Hunter stiffly but passionately plays a newly divorced woman trying to reinvent her life. Mr. DeVito is warmly credible as a lonely elevator man who cares for her. Queen Latifah is the film's most attention-getting figure in the small but glamorous role of a torchy nightclub singer. Would-be Chekhovian touches abound in this story of lonely people, but they don't make it jell (Maslin).
 
 "PATCH ADAMS," starring Robin Williams and Monica Potter. Directed by Tom Shadyac (PG-13, 110 minutes). As a maverick doctor intent on making terminal patients laugh, Mr. Williams delivers a little clowning and a lot of maudlin feel-good sentiment, along with vulgarity left over from the filmmaker's "Ace Ventura" days. He also spends a lot of time being congratulated for his good works, as the film's minor players are kept busy marveling at his antics. The real-life story of this doctor may sound like a fine occasion for Mr. Williams to cut loose, but the film version proves narrow and predictable. Ms. Potter, with a nostrilly resemblance to Julia Roberts, figures in a romantic subplot with a bizarre twist (Maslin).
 
 "PLEASANTVILLE," starring Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan Allen and William H. Macy.Don Knotts, J. T. Walsh and Jeff Daniels. Written and directed by Gary Ross (PG-13, 116 minutes). This cleverly executed fantasy, with a back-to-the-future trip into the small-town, squeaky-clean paradise of a 1950's television show, tends toward the black and white, visually and otherwise. The missionary zeal with which teen-agers from the 1990's try to awaken benighted 50's types from their slumber is an attitude that wears thin. But in the meantime there are witty tricks integrating color into black-and-white images, and nice little touches abound. The cast is poignant and amusing, with Ms. Allen especially touching as a prefeminist housewife who's the prime recipient of 90's hindsight (Maslin).
 
 * "THE PRINCE OF EGYPT," starring the voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Sandra Bullock and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93 minutes). First came the great expectations for this animated magnum opus from Dreamworks. Then came reality, in a film struggling mightily to balance animated whimsy and biblical stature. The upshot is an admirably worthy rendering of the Exodus story, even if Moses must initially be seen as a playful young scamp. Biblical plagues and miracles serve as special inspiration for the animators' reality-bending ingenuity (Maslin).
 
 "PSYCHO," starring Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, William H. Macy and Julianne Moore. Directed by Gus Van Sant (R, 100 minutes). It turns out that the apparent rocks in Mr. Van Sant's head, as he contrived this near-exact color replica of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic, were only pebbles. His remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) is artful and good-looking, faltering only when it tries to improve on the brilliant original blueprint. The casting of Mr. Vaughn as Norman Bates is the film's biggest Achilles' heel, since the performance Hitchcock elicited from Anthony Perkins remains an impossible act to follow. Still, Mr. Van Sant has tried an outlandish experiment and come up with what are, especially for fans of the original, intriguing variations on a theme (Maslin).
 
 "THE RUGRATS MOVIE," starring the voices of E. G. Daily, Christine Cavanaugh, Kath Soucie, Tara Charendoff and Tim Curry. Directed by Norton Virgien and Igor Kovalyov (G, 90 minutes). Dil Pickles is not the first baby whose resentful older sibling wanted to return him to the hospital, but he's probably the only one who has such an interesting trip back. Dil (full name: Dylan Preston Pickles) is the newborn hero of the first film starring the five talking babies of Nickelodeon's hit children's series "Rugrats." The pleasant surprise is that the film is a delight, from encounters with wolves, wizards and circus monkeys in the forest to musical numbers at the "baby store." There's material for grown-up moviegoers, too, including a scene with some pathetic reporters who turn up at the Pickles house when the children disappear, getting everybody's name wrong and asking, "Is it true a dingo ate your baby?" (Anita Gates).
 
 "STAR TREK: INSURRECTION," starring Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes and Brent Spiner. Directed by Mr. Frakes (PG, 105 minutes). The latest movie episode of the series that will not die finds Captain Picard (Mr. Stewart) and the crew of the Enterprise saving a tribe of utopian space pioneers who live on a planet where everyone enjoys eternal youth. The bad guys want to relocate the people forcibly and exploit the planet's life-giving properties. Picard, standing up against the admiral of Starfleet and risking court-martial, delivers impassioned speeches about the ugly history of forcible relocation and also falls in love with a 309-year-old beauty (Donna Murphy). Although in its ninth movie episode, the series has retained its sincerity and multicultural right-mindedness. It's hokum, but executed deftly and with a warm heart (Stephen Holden).
 
 "STEPMOM," starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG-13, 120 minutes). A man's ex-wife and new girlfriend lock horns over who can be nicer to his two children, in a sudsy story made livelier by its two female stars, both in appealingly high gear. Ms. Roberts plays the nicest person ever to wear black to a downtown photo shoot, while the especially fiery Ms. Sarandon plays the suburban mother as mama lion. Even when the prospect of mortality looms, the story manages to maintain its big, lavish look and peculiar (under the circumstances) sense of fun. As in "Home Alone," Mr. Columbus directs with sunny indifference to reality: medical, economic or otherwise (Maslin).
 
 * "TOUCH OF EVIL," starring Orson Welles, Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh. Directed by Welles (not rated, 108 minutes). Anyone familiar with Welles's 1958 film-noir landmark knows that it could just as well have been called "Truckload of Evil," and that its crazily sinister plot turns and breathtaking camera work remain astonishingly fresh. "Touch of Evil" is, among so many things, the other film to find Janet Leigh at a lonely motel under strangely menacing management, and the one in which Welles gave one of his most droll, swaggering performances as a corrupt police captain in an American town on the Mexican border. As visually thrilling as it is sin-soaked, this artfully reconstructed version of "Touch of Evil" remains one of the brightest lights on the cinematic landscape this season (Maslin).
 
 * "WAKING NED DEVINE," starring Ian Bannen, David Kelly and Fionnula Flanagan. Directed by Kirk Jones (PG, 91 minutes). Delightful shenanigans greet the news of a winning lottery ticket in a tiny Irish village. Especially after the winner turns out to be dead. Mr. Bannen and Mr. Kelly are wonderfully funny as two old coots who concoct a plot to claim the winnings and unite the town's cast of hearty characters in the process. Mr. Jones's prize-winning career directing television commercials means that everyone here is an amusing eccentric with colorful quirks, and that the septuagenarian stars' naked motorcycle-riding scenes are played for all they're worth. This comedy doesn't have the tart edge of "The Full Monty," but it knows how to coax laughs from making a spectacle of elderly gentlemen in the buff (Maslin).
 
 * "YOU'VE GOT MAIL," starring Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Greg Kinnear and Parker Posey. Directed by Nora Ephron (PG, 110 minutes). This cozy, inviting comedy romanticizes the rivalry between two bookstore owners, while also finding time to fall in love with books themselves, the instant intimacy of E-mail and a picture-perfect rendering of Manhattan's Upper West Side. With a feel-good ambiance much less forced than that of "Sleepless in Seattle," Ms. Ephron borrows adroitly from "The Shop Around the Corner" while making this knowing, urbanely funny film very much her own. Ms. Ryan is fresh and adorable without trying, while a ruefully lovelorn Mr. Hanks proves that he can do anything. Again (Maslin).

HEADLINE: Afghans and the U.N. Agencies Are Far Apart on Resuming Aid

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 30

 BODY:
A hardening of positions by the United Nations and the movement that controls most of Afghanistan is crippling efforts to resume international relief work there, officials from both sides say.
Stalled talks with the Taliban, the militant Islamic movement that rules more than 90 percent of the country, mean that almost no significant work in vital areas like health and reconstruction from more than 20 years of civil war can take place in the country, which has now fallen under the grip of winter. 
 Unicef, the United Nations children's fund, said this week that education in Afghanistan had all but ground to a halt, with nearly 9 of every 10 girls and 2 out of 3 boys not in school.
Unicef said that 257 of every 1,000 children die before age 5, the fourth worst rate in the world. Other relief groups say that hospitals have run out of medicine and other essential supplies, while inflation has driven up the price of food.
The dispute with the Taliban boils down to this: The United Nations, which withdrew all of its foreign workers four months ago, will not return until it has firm security guarantees for its staff. And the Taliban will not allow other activities by the international organization -- such as human rights investigations -- until the United Nations reopens its offices in the capital, Kabul.
In August, the United States carried out missile attacks on training camps in Afghanistan run by a Saudi-born militant, Osama bin Laden. The United States has linked him to terrorist activities against American targets, including United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
After the attacks, an Italian military officer serving with the United Nations was killed in Kabul, apparently in retaliation. The United Nations is demanding that the Taliban account fully for that killing and prosecute the attackers, and also that it solve the mystery of the earlier killings of two Afghan workers attached to the World Food Program in Jalalabad.
Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the Taliban's representative-designate at the United Nations, said in an interview on Tuesday that his Government had "done a lot of work in this regard." Shortly after the killing of the Italian officer, the Taliban authorities arrested two Pakistanis and charged them, he said.
"We have these two convicts and we have been investigating them," Mr. Mujahid said. "So far they didn't admit anything. We gave some information to the U.N., but they didn't consider that it was enough."
He said that the Taliban want to interview a French officer who was wounded in the attack to determine if he could identify the suspects in custody, but that their requests have gone unanswered.
Mr. Mujahid said that the United Nations had also rejected as inadequate the information gathered on the attack on the two local relief workers in Jalalabad, a generally lawless city where kidnappings and shootings are frequent.
In November, the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, recommended that the United Nations send human rights investigators to Afghanistan to look into accusations of massacres of Taliban troops in 1997 by opposition forces near the northern opposition stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif.
The investigators were also to look into reports that forces allied to the Taliban, if not the Taliban itself, had in turn killed an unknown number of civilians and opposition fighters in the same region this year, when the Taliban retook the area.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Dollar Is Lower in Final Day Before Euro's Introduction

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday in the last day of trading before Europe's new single currency took effect, ending a tough year in which the United States currency was battered by volatility in the stock market.
The dollar declined against the Japanese yen and German mark after European finance ministers set conversion rates for the new euro ahead of the currency's introduction at midnight. The drop was also attributed to traders with strong dollar positions balancing their holdings ahead of the new year. 
 Neither factor had significant effect, but it takes few trades to move markets during the typically slow holiday season.
In late New York trading, the dollar traded at 113.57 yen, down from 114.85 on Wednesday. The dollar also was changing hands at 1.6685 marks, down from 1.6717.
Against the yen, the dollar ended the year down 13 percent from the end of 1997, when it was trading at its highest in five and a half years. The dollar finished 7 percent lower against the mark for the year.
The dollar gained against the yen and remained relatively steady against the mark until August, when the stock market's summer slump began punishing the dollar.
After being knocked from an eight-year high of 147 yen in August, the dollar suffered its worst free fall against the yen in 25 years in October as troubled hedge funds sold off investments in risky markets that were bought with dollars.
The dollar stabilized along with the stock market in the fall but dipped again toward the end of the year on worries about the expected slowdown in economic growth in 1999 and the fate of President Clinton. Those concerns, along with the expected strength of the euro, could hurt the dollar in the new year.

HEADLINE: THE NEW EUROPE: Founding Fathers;
Its 3 Fathers Are Proud of Baby Euro, and Certain It Will Grow Up Strong

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: HAMBURG, Germany

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, when he was Chancellor of West Germany, Helmut Schmidt thought there would be a single European currency by the early 1980's. Instead, he is still carrying around six different kinds of money in his briefcase.
"I always have the German mark, English pounds, French francs, Swiss francs and Italian lire, plus American dollars, but I always end up just using credit cards," laughed Mr. Schmidt, who travels frequently as a publisher of the weekly newspaper Die Zeit. 
 But starting in January, he can write checks in euros, the common currency that 11 countries in the European Union are introducing, almost two decades later than he and other European leaders had planned. And three years from now, he will finally be able to put euro notes in his briefcase.
The euro's launching is a particular point of pride for Mr. Schmidt and two other prominent European leaders, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, once President of France, and Sir Edward Heath, the former Prime Minister of Britain. The three men took some of the earliest steps toward a single currency, in the 1970's, and kept promoting the idea even when it lost its luster.
"It should have happened a lot earlier," said Mr. Schmidt, who turned 80 on Dec. 23.
Indeed, it could have, agreed Sir Edward, 82, who negotiated the 1972 treaty that took Britain into the European Economic Community when he was Prime Minister. Later that year, he and other European leaders endorsed a plan devised by Pierre Werner, then the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, for a common European currency to combat the monetary instability caused by the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, which had been based on the dollar.
"We hoped then to have it done by 1980," he said, but the sharp rise in oil prices in 1973 derailed the project.
Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, now 72, and Mr. Schmidt, friends from the days when both served as finance ministers, tried to get monetary union back on the rails over drinks in Mr. Schmidt's lakeside cottage north of here in 1978.
They persuaded fellow European leaders to establish something called the European Currency Unit, expecting it to become coin of the European realm by the early 1980's, but it failed to speed the process.
"The delay was unnecessarily long," Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said in an interview in Parliament, "and without wanting to be too severe, I think it was caused by indifference and to some extent lack of financial literacy on the part of the European leaders of the early 1980's. They did not ascribe the same importance to it as we did, and maybe they were hesitant to get into the technical details, so the system went into a kind of hibernation from 1981 to 1988."
Then, with the collapse of Communism in 1989, President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany pushed harder for the common currency again, partly to bind a reunited Germany more firmly into a new single European market.
But even then, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her successor, John Major, kept Britain out. And, Mr. Schmidt said, "the central bank officials in the other countries did not want to lose their power so they invented a thousand conditions, but in the end the idea finally prevailed."
"If they'd only listened to us" was the common refrain in separate interviews recently with these fathers of the euro as they fretted impatiently for the long-awaited birth.
To listen to them now, a common currency, strengthening the unified market that came into its own in 1993 when the last customs and tariff barriers fell in the European Union, will finally give Europe the opportunity to become a global power.
Sir Edward harrumphed all reservations aside in an interview in his London pied-a-terre, near Eaton Square. "There's no single market in the world without a single currency, not in Japan and certainly not in the United States," he said. "Imagine what the United States would be now if each of the 50 states had its own currency!"
With new confidence in the stability of the economic and monetary policy of Europe, according to the these most enthusiastic of the euro's cheerleaders, dynamic growth could finally cure the Continent's chronic unemployment problem. And investors around the world, they say, may welcome a strong new currency that can diversify portfolios.
That could weaken the dollar and force up interest rates in the United States, they concede, but they shrug that off almost as easily as most Presidents since Richard M. Nixon have shrugged off the effects of American monetary policy on smaller currencies.
"America and Europe will continue to need each other into the 21st century," Mr. Schmidt said, "but it remains to be seen whether the euro is good for the United States. Some governments will shift dollar-denominated assets into euro-denominated ones, which means the U.S. Treasury might have to pay higher interest rates to attract investors."
Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, though, wishes the euro were not quite so strong at the start. "The dollar at the moment is a little too weak," he said. "I have the feeling the American economy is slowing down a bit, and that the American authorities accept that. There will be a dynamic between the euro's spontaneous tendency to strengthen, and a monetary policy for the euro that will try to contain that tendency."
The difference in views reflects longstanding divergence in German and French attitudes toward money. For Germany, a strong mark was a symbol a defeated nation could take pride in after the war, a fact Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said he had felt obliged to take into account when he and Mr. Schmidt devised their 1978 plan.
"For the Germans, the idea of abandoning the Deutsche mark, losing it, and entrusting it to a bank controlled by governments they did not feel as much confidence in as in their own independent central bank, was impossible," Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said. "So independence for the European central bank was an essential core idea.
"The ease with which the Germans have accepted the end of the mark surprised me, and I think it surprised them, too. The strict criteria, the requirement to cut budget deficits, the independence of the central bank in the plan, all had the merit of reassuring the Germans."
The idea of a strong central bank found its way into the treaty that spelled out the final plan for the euro more than a decade later, though not quite the way Sir Edward would have preferred. Britain, alas, will not use the euro, at least at the start.
"Under our original plan, the City of London would have been the center of the whole deal," he said. Instead, he added, "it all went to Frankfurt," where the new European Central Bank is located.
All three leaders, with vivid memories of what World War II did to their countries, said they hoped monetary union would force the members of the European Union still closer, encouraging them to share sovereignty in foreign, military and domestic policies, not just economics.
Mr. Schmidt, a junior officer in the Wehrmacht during the war, looked out of his corner office high over prosperous Hamburg, a city rebuilt on postwar trade with Britain and France, and remembered seeing it as a vast expanse of rubble and flames strewn with bodies after a huge raid by British and American bombers in July 1943. "I'll never forget it," he said.
He and Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, who joined the French Resistance as a boy, were on opposite sides then, and both said French reconciliation with Germany is at the heart of modern Europe.
"I want the euro to be an instrument in the federative approach to Europe," Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said. "The word 'federative' is a French 18th-century word Montesquieu used. It means sharing power or competence."
That is not the same at all, he added, as the English word "federal," as in the "federal European superstate" so dreaded by Lady Thatcher.
Mr. Schmidt said it was nonsense to think that a common currency would fail without a federal European state. "Before 1914 Europeans had one currency: gold," he said. "Parities were fixed and did not change, and all countries followed the constraints that the system entailed."
Sir Edward, who fought Germans as a British artillery officer during the war, thinks his country's reserve is a historical mistake. "I was the only one bold enough to do it," he huffed.
British markets, like the Continent's, will start dealing in euros in January, even though Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Government, like its Conservative predecessor, wants to see how the euro works before Britain decides whether to give up the pound. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said he thought the British attitude was entirely reasonable, but Sir Edward disagreed.
"Ever since the 1950's, Britain has stood aside while all the European arrangements were made, so we had no influence on them, and then we decided to come in later," Sir Edward lamented.
Britain first started negotiations for European membership in 1961, but France's autocratic President, Charles de Gaulle, vetoed it two years later. His successor, Georges Pompidou, relented in 1972.
"Now we're back on the old path," Sir Edward said.
A previous engagement, he said, would keep him from coming to Hamburg on Jan. 6 for a delayed celebration of Mr. Schmidt's 80th birthday. But Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said he would be there. "We'll celebrate the arrival of the euro together," he said.

SmallStocks Star in Market's '98 Farewell

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Shares of large companies fell yesterday and shares of small companies had their best day in two months as investors completed tax-related selling on the final day of 1998.
Small and midsize companies such as CMP Media Inc. and Covance Inc. rose, while the American Express Company, the DuPont Company and J. P. Morgan & Company declined. 
 "At the end of the year you get funny stuff going on," said Ron Muhlenkamp, president of Muhlenkamp & Company, a money management firm in Wexford, Pa. "Trades are made for noninvestment reasons."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 93.21 points, to 9,181.43, but still ended the year with a gain of 16.1 percent. The average was buffeted at the end of the session by computer-guided buy and sell programs.
The Russell 2000 index of small stocks rose 10.05, to 421.96, its biggest gain in more than eight weeks.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.70, to 1,229.23, but finished up 27 percent for 1998. The results continued a four-year streak of 20- percent-plus gains for the index.
The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with software, semiconductor and computer makers' shares, gained 25.74 points, to a record 2,192.69, finishing the year with an increase of 39.63 percent. The Nasdaq-100 index of the Nasdaq's largest stocks rose 86 percent, the best showing in its 14-year history.
Small shares gained partly because many investors had finished their selling of beaten-down small stocks to offset taxable gains. Many of these stocks were seen as undervalued, attracting buyers.
CMP Media, which publishes technology magazines and earlier this year was down 71 percent from its high, rose 7 1/4, to 18 1/4. The company has been hurt by declining advertising revenue as technology companies struggle amid the Asian economic slowdown.
Small stocks also gained as traders anticipated the "January effect." Historically, small stocks have bounced higher in January as money managers buy back the small shares they sold at the end of the year to take losses and offset taxable gains.
Although many investors and traders had taken off for the holidays, volume on the New York Stock Exchange reached 754.9 million shares, somewhat higher than the daily average in recent weeks.
The market will be closed today for New Year's Day. Markets in Europe and Asia, which were closed yesterday, are closed today, too.
The Firstar Corporation rose 1 11/16, to 93, as managers of funds that mirror the S.& P. 500 bought the bank holding company ahead of its inclusion in the index on Monday.
Lycos Inc., the No. 3 Internet directory, rose 2 3/16, to 55 9/16, after it said it was creating a Web site for the Super Bowl, an alliance that could mean millions of dollars in revenue for both it and the National Football League.
In the bond market, Treasuries ended little changed, finishing their best year since 1995.
"It has been an exceptional year," for Treasuries, said Chris Sullivan, who oversees about $450 million at the United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York. "I don't think there's going to be a threat of inflation for quite a while."
The 30-year bond fell 5/32, to 102 13/32, pushing its yield up to 5.09 percent from 5.08 on Wednesday. The bond market is closed today.
When price gains and reinvested dividends are taken into account, the 30-year Treasury returned 18.5 percent in 1998, the best performance since 1995, when long-term bonds gained 34.7 percent.

EUROPE
 
RUSSIA: 84% INFLATION -- Russian inflation hit 84 percent for 1998, the Government said. Russia suffered from hyperinflation after it moved to a market economy in 1992, but the Government seemed to be taming it until the financial crisis struck last summer. The economy contracted about 5 percent in 1998, leaving Russia trapped in one of the worst depressions experienced by an industrialized nation. (AP)
 
SWITZERLAND: TALKS ON GERM WEAPONS -- Arms control experts from about 50 countries will resume negotiations in Geneva on Monday to strengthen checks on biological weapons, the United Nations said. In the three-week talks, the first of five sessions scheduled in 1999, the experts aim to make progress on a protocol to detect cheating on the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. Western diplomats suspect at least 12 rogue states, including Iraq, of having biological weapons programs. (Reuters) 

BRITAIN: U.S. EX-SENATOR KNIGHTED -- Britain honored former United States Senator George J. Mitchell, left, for working to bring about peace in Northern Ireland. The Maine Democrat, who spent months in Belfast as co-chairman of the marathon talks leading up to the peace accord last April, was given an honorary knighthood as a Grand Knight of the Order of the British Empire. (Reuters)
 
FRANCE: JOURNALISTS SAFER -- Fewer journalists were killed in 1998 than in recent years, though journalists investigating corruption were in danger in many countries, a French watchdog group, Reporters Without Borders, said. In 1998, it said, 19 journalists were killed worldwide, 487 others were arrested and 697 were physically abused or threatened. In 1997, 26 journalists were killed. (AP)
 
FRANCE: ARCH REOPENS -- The Arc de Triomphe in Paris re-opened to the public after striking workers reached a deal with management over wage demands and staff increases. One of the world's most famous monuments, the stone arch at the head of the Champs-Elysees had been closed since Saturday. (AP)
 
ASIA
 
CHINA: POET IS JAILED -- Ma Zhe, a poet from the southwestern province of Guizhou, has been sentenced to seven years in jail for subversion, according to the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China, a human-rights group based in Hong Kong. Mr. Ma was detained in January with three other poets who had launched a "cultural renaissance" movement calling for political reform and who had planned to publish a magazine promoting literary freedom. (Agence France-Presse)
 
JAPAN: EXTRA NUMBER TO DIAL -- Japan is bracing for mass confusion today when more than 40 million mobile telephone users grapple with new 11-digit numbers. To cope with rapid growth in the industry, one digit is being added to the 10-digit numbers for all Japanese mobile telephones. (Agence France-Presse)
 
INDIA: CATHOLIC HALL SET ON FIRE -- Four nuns and two priests were injured when mobs set fire to another Catholic prayer hall in Gujurat. It was the 10th reported attack on Christians attributed to militant Hindus since Christmas Day. (Reuters)
 
SINGAPORE: POLITICAL FOE TO BE TRIED -- Police said that an opposition politician, Chee Soon Juan, left, would be prosecuted for holding a rare public rally Tuesday in Singapore's financial district without an official permit. Dr. Chee, the secretary general of the small Singapore Democratic Party, told reporters he had been forced to defy the rules because the authorities delayed or refused his requests for permits. (Agence France-Presse)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: MORE HOMES ON WEST BANK -- The Israeli Housing Ministry issued tenders for the construction of 1,051 more housing units for Jewish settlers in the West Bank, including 651 units in Betar Elit, south of Jerusalem, where about 10,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews reside. The Peace Now movement, which opposes settlements, called the tender significant because it represents one-third of the tenders issued annually for construction in the West Bank. (Agence France-Presse)
 
AFRICA
 
ANGOLA: U.N. WANTS ACCESS TO CRASH -- The United Nations Security Council demanded that Angolans immediately allow a rescue operation to look for survivors of a United Nations C-130 cargo plane that crashed Saturday with 14 aboard in territory where fighting has intensified between Government troops and rebels from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. Although the wreckage was spotted by high-altitude aircraft, no one has been allowed near the site in an area presumed to be controlled by guerrillas. (Reuters)
 
SIERRA LEONE: A REBEL DEFEAT REPORTED -- West African peacekeepers reported repelling rebels at the garrison town of Hastings, a dozen miles from the capital, Freetown. Information Minister Julius Spencer denied a report that rebels were in control of northern Sierra Leone. (Reuters, Agence France-Presse)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
MEXICO: AUSTERITY BUDGET ADOPTED -- Mexico's Congress approved what was described as the country's most tight-fisted budget in modern times and sent it to President Ernesto Zedillo for his signature with just hours to spare before the constitutional year-end deadline for enactment. The budget battle was down to the wire in the Chamber of Deputies as lawmakers struggled to find ways to make up for tumbling oil prices without unpopular new taxes, all while keeping the country's budget deficit from soaring. (Reuters)
 
UNITED NATIONS: NEW COUNCIL MEMBERS -- Canada, Malaysia, Namibia, the Netherlands and Argentina became members today of the prestigious 15-member United Nations Security Council for two-year terms. The Netherlands will take over the chairmanship from Portugal of the council's sanctions committee on Iraq, the most active of its subgroups. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: Stocks Soar Phoenix-Like in Big 4th-Quarter Turnaround

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The fourth quarter of 1998, when "technology" and "Internet" were synonymous with almost instant paper wealth and the stock market staged as stunning a turnaround as any in recent memory, left many professionals rubbing their eyes in disbelief.
"I can't explain it other than to say it is irrational exuberance," said Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call. "It is momentum investing, and there is no logic to it." 
 But there was some logic to why stocks rose from an apparent abyss to solid double-digit gains for the year.
On Oct. 1, when financial markets appeared on the verge of imploding, the Dow Jones industrial average fell by more than 210 points and closed less than 100 points above 7,539.07, the low it hit on Aug. 31.
Since then, foreign markets have staged a comeback. The steep slide in United States stock prices was seen by many as a buying opportunity. Third-quarter earnings were not as bad as expected. Perhaps most important, the Federal Reserve Board and more than 50 central banks around the world have cut interest rates.
"This was a liquidity-driven market," said Byron R. Wien, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company. "The world was awash in it."
The decline in interest rates not only helped to revive Wall Street's badly shaken psyche, but also propelled the three most widely watched market indexes -- the Dow, the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite -- to new highs during the quarter.
The gains for those measures were undeniably impressive.
The Dow rose 17 percent during the quarter. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained nearly 21 percent, its second-best quarter ever. And the Nasdaq, weighted heavily with technology company stocks, performed amazingly, rising 29.45 percent, just shy of its best quarter ever.
The strong finish accounted for most of the market's double-digit gains for the year. For all of 1998, the Dow rose 16.1 percent; the S.& P. 500 was up 26.67 percent, and the Nasdaq jumped 39.63 percent.
But, as was true for most of the year, a mere handful of stocks accounted for most of the market's strength in the fourth quarter. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rebounded from Oct. 8, when it closed at 310.28. But the index never came close to regaining the peak of 491.41 it hit on April 21 and finished at 421.96, down 3.4 percent for the year.
"If you look at the four major indexes -- the Dow, the S.& P., Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange composite -- two of them have Intel, Cisco Systems, MCI Worldcom, Lucent Technologies and Dell Computer," said Walter Murphy, a senior market analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company.
"This is a very, very narrow market," he said. "To me that suggests there is a case to be made that once this rally is over, the market will go through a reasonably substantial retracement."
Those five stocks, among the biggest and most widely traded, did extremely well.
Intel, for example, which started the quarter at 85 3/4, closed yesterday at 118 9/16, up 38.3 percent. Cisco, at 61 13/16 at the end of September, finished the year at 92 13/16, a gain of 50.8 percent. And Lucent Technologies moved from 69 1/16 to 109 15/16 yesterday, up 59.2 percent.
However, while technology stocks in general and Internet stocks in particular grabbed the headlines, they were not the S.& P. 500's best-performing group during the quarter. Transportation issues, battered earlier in the year, gained that distinction, followed by investment banking and brokerage stocks and apparel retailers.
Not surprisingly, the steep decline in oil prices hurt energy stocks, particularly oil-service and production companies.
Of the four worst-performing groups in the S.& P. 500, these stocks occupied three of the slots. Only gold stocks did worse.
Among the Dow stocks, none did better than Wal-Mart Stores, which rose 49 percent in the quarter. And none did worse than Eastman Kodak, which fell 6.3 percent despite strong competition from Boeing, which dropped 4.9 percent, and Sears, Roebuck, down 3.8 percent.
Then there were the Internet stocks.
It is hard to imagine, let alone explain, the rise in a stock like Ebay. The on-line auction house, which went public in mid-September at 18 a share and was trading at just more than 45 on Sept. 30, finished the year at 241 1/4, a gain of about 435 percent over all.
Amazon.com did not do badly, either. The on-line book, tape and video retailer started the quarter at 111 5/8. It closed yesterday at 321 1/4, for a jump of 187.8 percent.
For the quarter, the 50 stocks that make up Interactive Week's Internet Index -- a list that does not include stocks that have not been publicly traded for less than six months -- posted a gain of 71.4 percent.
The golden touch of the Internet seemed to reach nearly any company that operated a Web site.
Charles Schwab, the brokerage house that does a lot of business on line, was the best-performing stock in the S.& P. 500 index for the quarter. Earlier in the week, its market capitalization rose above that of Merrill Lynch, a far bigger, more diversified enterprise.
Few expect the current enthusiasm to continue. But the excitement generated among investors by the Internet's potential is justified, analysts said.
"The Internet is the most exciting business phenomenon since the airplane or television," Mr. Wien of Morgan Stanley said. "It is truly a dramatic life-changing event, an open-ended situation investors have not been confronted with for some time. To say that this is a fad is an easy trap to fall into. But this is bigger than that."

Owen Wells, financial adviser to the Maine philanthropist Elizabeth B. Noyce, had just returned from a trip to the Pacific Northwest, where he had visited the Pike Place Market in Seattle and the Granville Island Public Market in Vancouver, British Columbia.
"I said to Betty, 'I think we ought to build a public market in Portland,' " Mr. Wells recalled. "She said that was a great idea." 
 Mrs. Noyce, who had come into her millions through a divorce settlement from her husband, Robert N. Noyce, a co-inventor of the microchip, was not particularly concerned about cost. It was 1993, not long after she had responded to the closing of banks across Maine by blithely creating a new bank in downtown Portland, the Maine Bank and Trust Company. If a public market would help further revitalize downtown, if it would create jobs for this city of 65,000, if it would help the farmers of her beloved state of Maine, then she was all for it.
Mrs. Noyce, who lived in Bremen, died in September 1996 at the age of 65. She had given away $75 million, primarily to Maine charities, including the Portland Museum of Art, the Maine Maritime Museum, the University of Maine and the Maine Medical Center.
The Portland Public Market, nearly as long as a city block and about half as wide, opened this past October. It is a soaring two-story structure of glass and timber built on land owned by Mrs. Noyce.
"We had a great fall," said Ted Spitzer, the market director.
Mr. Spitzer was giving a tour of the market the day after Christmas, showing off the displays of poultry, beef and bison -- the bison are raised in Waterford -- fruits and vegetables, homemade pies and ice cream, and fish not just from Maine but also from all over the world.
The Portland market, with 23 vendors and more expected, is a tiny fraction of the size of the Pike Place Market, which has 250 businesses. But it does have the expertise of Walter Compare, who left his fish job at Pike Place to move back east with his wife, Holly, a Maine native.
Mr. Compare was behind the counter at Hanson Brothers Seafood, where he had arranged a still life composed of mussels, eels, oysters, tuna and salmon. He does throw an occasional fish, he said, like the showmen at Pike Place, "but we don't like to copy."
At the other end of the market, the Port City Jazz group was serenading shoppers. People were grazing on generous free samples of smoked salmon, goat cheese and homemade jam and crackers. Emma Hayes, 6, and her sisters, Isabel, 4, and Eliza, almost 2, from Cumberland, were enjoying strawberry ice cream cones from Smiling Hill Farm with their mother, Betsy Hayes.
At Borealis Breads, which was closed for the day, a hand-printed sign said the bakers were home with their families. Mr. Spitzer said the owner, Jim Amaral, had contracted with several Aroostook County farmers to grow wheat for his bread.
This is exactly the market that Betty Noyce would have wanted, Mr. Wells said. "She would have admired the entrepeneurial ability of these people," he said.
It cost $9.4 million to build the market, which operates seven days a week, year-round.
"She wanted it done right," said Mr. Wells, who is the president of Mrs. Noyce's philanthropic foundation, Libra. "She said, 'I don't want the market to become like Quincy Market where they sell T-shirts and knickknacks.' She wanted food."
The market is next to the Maine Bank and Trust, which now has 14 branches around the state, and a few blocks from Barbara Bush Children's Hospital, which Mrs. Noyce helped endow.
None of Mrs. Noyce's projects bear her name.
"She never wanted any kind of memorial," Mr. Wells said. "People wanted to name scholarship funds after her, and buildings, and she always said no."
In the same spirit, she also refused honorary degrees.
"She thought just giving money was not the appropriate measure for an honorary degree," Mr. Wells said.
But on the second floor of the market is Mr. Wells's private tribute, a small sculpture of an old woman pushing a cart laden with vegetables, and feeding corn to a crow. The sculpture, by a Colorado artist named Nancy Roper, was originally titled Henrietta and the Heckler. Mr. Wells has renamed it "Betty Sharing the Bounty."

HEADLINE: Midwest Shows Rise In Industrial Activity

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 31

 BODY:
Manufacturing activity in the Midwest picked up unexpectedly in December, helped by rising production and an increase in inventories.
The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said today that its monthly index of regional manufacturing activity rose to 50.9 in December from 50.2 in November. Analysts had expected a reading of 49.7. An index above 50 means the number of manufacturers who said business improved was greater than the number of those who said it deteriorated. 
 The Chicago purchasing managers index of new orders was unchanged at 53.2 in December, the same as in November. The production index rose to 54.9 from 51.2. The inventory index, a gauge of pent-up demand, rose to 54.8 in December from 44.4 during November. That was the highest level since November 1996, when the inventory index was 55.7.
While it only measures activity in the Chicago area, investors watch the Chicago purchasing managers report because in the past it has foreshadowed the National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index, which measures conditions nationwide.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Up Steeply in Week

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment offices last week experienced the largest weekly jump in benefit claims since 1992.
The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose 79,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 368,000, the Labor Department said today. That pushed total weekly claims to their highest level since July, when a General Motors strike temporarily increased unemployment. The department offered no explanation but noted that winter storms plagued some parts of the country. 
 Last week's increase in claims could be a sign that hard times abroad are hitting American companies harder. But the department issued a statement with the report stressing that the weekly claims data are often volatile. "Changes for any one week are not necessarily indicative of directional changes in the economy," the statement said.
The big increase followed a week when total jobless claims were at their lowest in nearly a year and a half, at a revised 289,000.
A more reliable and closely watched four-week moving average of unemployment claims rose by 13,500, to 321,250, for the week that ended on Dec. 19.
That is only slightly higher than where the four-week average hovered for most of November, when the nation's official unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Korea to Sell Control of Bank to U.S. Investors

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 31

 BODY:
The South Korean Government signed an agreement today to sell a controlling stake in Korea First Bank to a consortium led by GE Capital, the world's largest nonbank financial services company, and Newbridge Capital, a buyout fund backed by the financier David Bonderman's Texas Pacific Group.
Coming 15 months after the Government nationalized Korea First, the agreement sets the pace and could well establish a blueprint for other Asian countries, including Japan, Thailand and Indonesia, that are struggling to shore up their financial systems in the midst of one of the deepest economic downturns since World War II. 
 The purchase price was not disclosed, and a spokeswoman for the Financial Supervisory Commission, the Government watchdog agency for the banking system, said the price and many other important details were not final.
Should the deal be concluded -- and several agreements between foreign investors and Korean companies have already fallen apart -- it would be significant in a couple of respects.
First, it is the clearest vote of confidence that the Government of President Kim Dae Jung has received from a foreign investor since the Asian economic crisis took hold here last year. It also marks the start of the final phase of Government efforts to overhaul South Korea's debt-laden financial system, underscoring the swiftness with which Mr. Kim and his economic team have moved to repair parts of the economy.
"It's quite an achievement for the Korean Government and for Morgan Stanley to attract such high-quality bidders into the Korean market," said Wilbur Ross, senior managing director at Rothschild, who is an adviser to the Halla group, a large Korean conglomerate undergoing a painful reorganization, and to the Chohung Bank, another troubled South Korean bank. "I think it's another sign that the Korean economy is getting fixed."
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was retained by the Government to sell Korea First and Seoul Bank, another nationalized bank.
Bankers involved in the discussions said yesterday that the Government was seeking at least $2 billion for a portion of the 93.8 percent stake it acquired in August 1997 when it recapitalized Korea First by nationalizing it after two large corporate bankruptcies effectively made it insolvent.
The selling point of the consortium's bid was apparently its willingness to take only a 51 percent stake. The other bidder, HSBC Holdings P.L.C., parent of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, wanted a much bigger stake, as large as 80 percent, according to one person close to the discussions.
But the Government wanted to hang on to more of its stake than that. Presumably, if a buyer succeeds in turning Korea First around, its shares will be worth more in the future, and that would help the Government recover a bigger portion of the 1.5 trillion won of tax money -- currently almost $1.25 billion -- that it used to recapitalize the bank.
At the end of June, Korea First's capital-adequacy ratio stood at 7.78 percent, up from a negative 2.7 percent at the end of 1997. The Bank for International Settlements, which sets guidelines for international banking supervision, has established 8 percent as the minimum standard for a bank's capital adequacy -- the percentage of the institution's total assets held as reserve capital.
But after June, the Government was forced to give Korea First a second capital injection, in part because of severity of the economic crisis. Korea First now has three trillion won in nonperforming loans -- almost $2.5 billion at today's exchange rate -- and the Government has pledged to buy back any more loans that go bad in the first year after the consortium's purchase.
"The sale of Korea First Bank will help the country to bolster its financial industry by acquiring advanced financial technologies," Lee Hun Jai, head of the Financial Supervisory Commission, said at a news conference today in Seoul.
No doubt some analysts will contend that a deal with HSBC would have better served the Government's goals. HSBC is one of Asia's few remaining banking powerhouses, and its involvement in the restoration of the South Korean banking system would have been reassuring to many investors.
But GE Capital is also adept at financial management, and HSBC may end up owning part of Seoul Bank, which the Government has also nationalized and promised to sell by Jan. 31.
In addition, by selling to the GE Capital consortium, the Government may be hoping to mute criticism that it is selling Korean assets to foreigners in a fire sale. Were HSBC to buy the bank, it would forever become part of HSBC. But because GE Capital and Newbridge are financial buyers rather than strategic ones, the bank may again return to Korean hands through a sale of stock or some other exit strategy that allows them to gain a hefty return on their investment. Newbridge's main strategy is to buy into distressed companies in the hope of turning them around and reselling them at a profit.
For GE Capital, a General Electric Company unit, the agreement represents another step in its expansion across Asia since the economic crisis began in Thailand in the summer of 1997.
And for Newbridge, the deal puts its name in the spotlight. The relatively little-known fund has been on an Asian shopping spree, buying an electronics business from Astra Indonesia and Haitai Beverage from the bankrupt Haitai Group of South Korea. This deal will significantly raise its visibility.

Hope From World Bank
WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (Bloomberg News) -- The World Bank, increasingly confident that South Korea's economy is on the mend, said it might guarantee bond sales next year by state-owned companies like the Korea Electric Power Corporation.
The bank is talking with the Korean Government about backing sales worth several hundred million dollars each, said Ram Aiyer, the World Bank's country director for South Korea. Aside from the utility, sales by the Korean Highway Corporation and a gas utility may also be guaranteed, Mr. Aiyer said.
A World Bank guarantee, first used for a bond sale by a Thai utility in October, could attract a larger group of investors than other South Korean issuers, including the Seoul Government, whose bonds are rated below investment grade. This would also cut Korean companies' borrowing costs, helping increase their earnings.

HEADLINE: 11 COUNTRIES TIE EUROPE TOGETHER IN ONE CURRENCY

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 31

 BODY:
Finance ministers from 11 countries celebrated New Year's Eve today by launching the euro as Europe's new single currency, the culmination of an effort first conceived in the 1950's as a means of unifying Europe and thus preventing another world war.
After years of preparation, the 11 countries locked in the exchange rates of their currencies to the euro, and thereby set the value at which euros will begin trading when financial markets open around the world on Monday. Based on these rates, the euro will be worth about $1.17. 
 In technical terms, today's action was perfunctory -- nothing more than plugging numbers into a formula. But in political and economic terms, it was far broader.
"We stand at the dawn of a new era in the integration of Europe," said Rudolf Edlinger, Austria's Finance Minister and chairman of today's meeting. "Forty years of inexorable striving toward integration has been crowned by the realization of economic and monetary union."
Today's fixing of exchange rates also kicked off a frenzied scramble by banks, stock exchanges and securities traders across Europe to adapt their computer systems between now and Monday morning.
And despite the celebrations, there were clear signs of continuing divisions over both economic policy and the levers of power. German officials demanded that the new European Central Bank, roughly the equivalent of the United States Federal Reserve Board, use monetary policy to help increase employment and not focus simply on fighting inflation -- a demand that has already created deep animosity among other countries' central bankers.
Euro notes and coins will not circulate until Jan. 1, 2002, but banks and stock exchanges must now carry out all non-cash transactions in euros.
In London's financial center, more than 30,000 people will work through the weekend to reprogram computers and trading systems on the basis of the currency values agreed upon today, though the pound is not part of the euro system. Across Europe, banks are converting their systems to offer euro-denominated bank accounts immediately for any customers who want them.
Though national currencies like the German mark and the French franc will remain in circulation until July 1, 2002, they will trade in lockstep to the euro until they phase out.
Today's action was necessary to set the relative values of participating countries' currencies. But the values have been more or less established since members of the new currency union yoked their monetary policies last spring. exchange rates have varied little.
"In the end, it turned out to be almost a formality, different from what many of us expected just a year ago," remarked Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands, the president of the European Central Bank.
To liven things up a bit, European officials capped off their formal action by launching hundreds of balloons with blue and yellow euro markings. Finance ministers also posed for pictures unpopping the ritual bottles of champagne, though some bottles proved so balky that several ministers turned red in the face as they wrestled with the corks.
Champagne aside, most of those here today focused on the great distance they had come, and predicted a Europe that would be bigger, stronger, more prosperous and peaceful when it used a single currency.
"Europe will now have the wherewithal to direct its own future," said Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission. "The euro is not an end in itself. It is an instrument for economic development, social development. And now it is up to us to use this instrument."
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French Finance Minister, said: "Today is clearly a historic day for the European enterprise. Europe will be strong, stronger than in the past, because it will speak with a single monetary voice."
But even today, there were signs of potential battles.
One hint came from Mr. Duisenberg, who was named president of the European Central Bank only after a bitter political fight last May between France and Germany. Mr. Duisenberg was favored by Helmut Kohl, then Chancellor of Germany. But President Jacques Chirac of France insisted on the head of the Bank of France, Jean-Claude Trichet.
Germany and French eventually made a deal under which Mr. Duisenberg would become president of the European bank, then "voluntarily" step down well before the end of his eight-year term. But in an interview published Wednesday in the French newspaper Le Monde, Mr. Duisenberg indicated he might not quit after all. He would not elaborate today.
Mr. Duisenberg's apparent new stance comes as many political leaders are pressing the European bank to focus more on stimulating growth. Under the Maastricht Treaty, which set the ground rules for the euro, the bank is supposed to focus exclusively on combating inflation.
Mr. Duisenberg has been an outspoken defender of that mandate, putting him on a collision course with Germany's new center-left Government and its Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine.
Mr. Lafontaine did not take part in today's ceremonies, pleading long-standing vacation plans. But his stand-in, Economics Minister Werner Muller, appealed for coordinated action among European countries to increase jobs -- with help from the new central bank.
"We must now score tangible successes in the areas of employment and growth," Mr. Muller said. "The European Central Bank facilitates this not only by fulfilling its responsibilities for stability. It can also, within the framework of its resources, target itself toward the support of growth and employment."
Mr. Muller also called for "coordinated" wage policies that "have a goal of greater employment success." That echoed Mr. Lafontaine's calls for European countries to avoid undercutting each other on labor costs.
Unity on economic policy will be difficult. In Britain, which is staying outside the currency union for at least the next year or two, some newspapers have demonized Mr. Lafontaine as a man who would force Britain to abandon its comparatively laissez-faire policies.
But Mr. Strauss-Kahn of France captured the thoughts of many here today, saying European countries would gain self-determination by having more strength in the face of global economic turbulence.
"My profound conviction," he said, "is that we will gain in sovereignty rather than losing it by sharing it with others."

HEADLINE: Cost of Stadium Worries Those Who Count on Aid

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 31

 BODY:
The Connecticut Council of Small Towns faxed the alarm to its 85 members late last week, contending that Gov. John G. Rowland was about to cut tens of millions of dollars in aid to municipalities in the two-year state budget he is to present in early February.
The bulletin suggested that the cost of building a football stadium for the New England Patriots was already coming home to roost, and begged mayors and selectmen to band together to "fend off the Governor's budget ax." 
 The Governor's office scoffed at the message, asserting that budget decisions would not be made until late January. But the fax, labeled "Breaking News," exposed a growing sense of foreboding among those who depend on state aid. Until the stadium came along, the towns, schools and a wide variety of social service programs stood to benefit from the windfall of a sizzling economy. Now, their advocates fear that a huge tab for the stadium could mean lean times elsewhere.
Depending on which legislator is doing the figuring, the stadium will cost the state at least $100 million and perhaps as much as $1 billion over the life of the 30-year lease, which the state legislature overwhelmingly approved during a special session two weeks ago. It is partly that uncertainty that has local governments, children's groups and others fretting about how tightly the state has tied its hands with what many people consider a generous offer to lure the National Football League team from the Boston region to downtown Hartford.
Dannel P. Malloy, the Mayor of Stamford, said the decision about the Patriots had been made so hastily that residents of his city and the towns near the New York border were left wondering what -- if any -- benefits the huge investment would have for them. "In this part of the state, the impact of the stadium is at the very least not understood, but is looked at with some fear and trepidation on the state's ability to fund other programs," he said.
But because the stadium is a pet project of both the Governor, who is a Republican, and the legislature's leaders, who are Democrats, Mayor Malloy and others who need favors in Hartford are reluctant to attack the deal, which they consider water over the dam. "It's an issue to be managed around, at this point," the Mayor said.
So it is the delicate issue of what taxpayers really gave up to get the Patriots that will help drive the state's political dialogue beginning on Wednesday, when the legislature will open its annual session and Governor Rowland will be inaugurated for a second term.
Some groups are already looking for ways to use the issue to their advantage. Janice M. Gruendel, the executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children, which focuses on issues like day care and health insurance, said the season's hot new term was "stadium guilt" -- a hope among some advocates that lawmakers would be more generous to social service programs as a way of compensating for what many see as a huge gift to the Patriots.
"Legislators were not all equally comfortable voting for the stadium, and when they voted for it, they knew the state had other needs," Ms. Gruendel said. "We believe the state has the capacity to make the same dollar choice for kids and families that it did for football."
The state's Lieutenant Governor, M. Jodi Rell, who was the Governor's running mate, said she recognized that the administration's critics would try to use the stadium issue against Mr. Rowland. But she said the stadium and other programs had "absolutely no correlation, and should not be confused."
"This may be an easy target, but it should not be a license for people to complain that their particular project is not being funded," she said. "It could be said about any other project. If someone didn't get a sewer project, did they point their finger and say, 'It's because you funded the University of Connecticut'?"
Although Connecticut will pay for most of the stadium by selling bonds, legislative leaders have agreed to use $100 million of this year's budget surplus as a down payment on the $375 million construction cost. Also, the legislature's Office of Fiscal Analysis estimates that interest on the bonds will cost $212 million over 30 years. A 10 percent tax on Patriots tickets will help pay the cost.
Linda L. Miller, the principal analyst at the Office of Fiscal Analysis, said the real cost might be in the other projects that cannot be undertaken because of the heavy debt that the stadium will put on the books of the state, whose credit rating is already below average because of its debt load. "If they have to do less bonding for other purposes because of the stadium, that means the stadium will be taking up money that could have been used for schools, prisons or whatever," she said.
Estimates of the state's surplus from this year's budget range from $350 million to $500 million, and many state supplicants had hoped that money would go toward their wish lists. For instance, the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, which represents cities and towns, has issued a study concluding that its members will need $2.8 billion over the next 25 years to improve waste-water treatment plants in order to meet new requirements intended to clean up Long Island Sound.
The group's president, John Weichsel, the Town Manager of Southington, said he also hoped that the boom would let the state upgrade its schools, pipes and roads.
Kevin B. Sullivan, the Senate President pro tempore and a strong supporter of the stadium, said that new programs would be financed if they made sense, but not to make up for money going to the Patriots. "I don't have stadium guilt," he said. "I have stadium pride."

HEADLINE: Wall Street's Banks Kept To Hierarchy During 1998

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
The finance industry had a turbulent year, with sharp swings in stock and bond markets and the spreading global financial crisis threatening America's long bull market. But in the end, major United States investment banks did more business and earned more money than ever, and the hierarchy of Wall Street banks remained as solid as the limestone portico of the New York Stock Exchange.
A robust first six months of the year and a racing finish compensated for the near shutdown of financial markets in the July-September quarter, according to statistics released yesterday by the Securities Data Company. Investment banks underwrote $1.82 trillion in new stocks and bonds, an increase of about 40 percent over 1997. 
 The underwriting docket was heavily skewed toward bonds this year, which rose 44 percent as companies and Government agencies took advantage of record-low interest rates. United States stock sales slumped almost 10 percent, with the market drying up in the second half of the year.
The ardor among companies worldwide to acquire one another grew to levels never seen before. Investment banks advised companies on mergers and acquisition deals valued at $2.5 trillion, up by almost half from 1997.
Over all, despite the shock induced by Russia's financial meltdown in August, many Wall Street firms are on course to earn as much or more than they did last year, when most firms set records. Bankers say they are now optimistic that the late summer scare -- and the layoffs that followed -- were more an aberration than a foreshadowing of tough times. But the optimism is subdued.
"We dodged a bullet," said Jeffrey Weiss, a managing director and the global head of fixed-income syndication at Lehman Brothers. "But there are still some unresolved issues in the world -- Brazil, Asia and Russia. Everyone is starting off a bit more cautious than we were last year."
The year's turmoil did not rock the rankings of top investment banks. Merrill Lynch & Company, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, Goldman, Sachs & Company, the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroupand Lehman Brothers earned the most fees and underwrote the most stocks and bonds, as they did in the previous year. But Merrill, Morgan and Goldman dominated the most lucrative investment banking businesses, including initial public offerings of stock and advising on mergers.
One-half of all first-time stock offerings by American companies last year were brought to market by Morgan, Merrill or Goldman. Even more impressive, those three investment banks advised one side or the other in 9 of every 10 mergers and acquisitions worldwide.
"The top three are continuing to pull away and gain market share," said Raphael Soifer, a brokerage industry analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman. "In tougher times, clients tend to gravitate to the bigger firms. That makes it tougher for their competitors to break into the super-bulge- bracket category."
Still, there were some warning signs even for the biggest firms. Investment banks continue to see their overall profit margins shrink. The fees they disclosed totaled $8.8 billion for the year, but the pace of increase, at 2.5 percent, slipped well behind the growth in underwriting. That reflects the running battle among banks to be part of big underwriting deals, with competition for market share sometimes eating into profits.
Indeed, the quarterly rankings of investment banks, known in the industry as the league tables, can be misleading. Bankers acknowledge privately that they lose money underwriting half to two-thirds of the high-grade bond issues they work on. They justify these loss leaders as good advertising and as a way to please big clients. Similarly, many of the top merger advisory deals require relatively little work and generate small fees, but can propel advisers high up the league tables.
Merrill Lynch retained its title as the high-volume underwriter of stocks and bonds, increasing its total market share to almost 17 percent from 16 percent the year before, with $356 billion in sales. Salomon Smith Barney was second, with $249 billion, including WorldCom Inc.'s $6 billion bond sale, the world's largest.
Merrill held its top spot despite falling into the red in the third quarter, largely because it suffered losses in emerging markets and n trading bonds. As a result, Merrill laid off nearly 5 percent of its work force.
"This year provided a test of sorts. But I think that even in the more difficult environment, our strengths showed through," Jeff Chandler, head of global debt syndication, said.
In mergers, Goldman dominated the advisory business worldwide -- and substantially increased its market share. Goldman advised on $960 billion in deals, or about 38 percent of all those announced. Merrill beat out Morgan Stanley, last year's No. 2, for the second spot. Merrill advised companies involved in 26 percent of all announced deals. Morgan Stanley had a role in just under 26 percent.
The market for initial public offerings cooled drastically this year, a direct result of global financial turmoil. The number of new companies brought to market in the United States fell to 372 from 630, and the value of those deals declined by about 15 percent from the previous year's levels.
The tougher market -- which hit technology and health care companies especially hard -- dislodged Goldman from its pedestal as the largest underwriter of new issues. Morgan Stanley took top billing, with a 21 percent market share. Morgan underwrote Conoco Inc.'s $4.4 billion public offering. Merrill was close behind and Goldman was third.
Other major firms solidified their leads in niche markets. Lehman, for example, has a commanding market share in mortgage- and asset-backed securities. It increased its slice of that market to 15 percent this year from 12.7 percent last year.
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. did likewise in the market for high-yield bonds, also known as junk bonds, which are considered the most lucrative part of the fixed-income business. The firm increased its share of that market to nearly 15 percent from 12 percent a year ago.

HEADLINE: Buses and Bets: A Way of Life;
Despite Crashes, the Ride Is Part of the Casino Outing

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Dec. 30

 BODY:
They are as different as the games they play.
They sit side by side on the motor coach rumbling down the Garden State Parkway, the 75-year-old widower who travels here to shoot craps all night, up to five times a week, and the 53-year-old woman with a Jamaican accent who dabbles in slots a few times a year on days off from her job sorting medical records at a local hospital. 
 There is Molly Kessert, 72, who likes to view her weekly trips to the jacks-or-better video poker machines as sport rather than addiction. And Annette Topolanski, 52, who plays pai gow poker because it's slow, taking all afternoon to drain her pockets.
And then there's Nick. He is on the bus four times a week from his home in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, to the poker room at the Taj Mahal, which feels like a private club as Scott, the dealer, shakes his hand, and Larry, the waiter, slaps his back.
"I like to play, win or lose," said Nick, a 59-year-old divorced man on disability who spoke on the condition that his last name not be used. "It doesn't make any difference. The reason is to kill time."
These are the day-trippers, lured by freebies and shuttled en masse down the asphalt ribbons of New Jersey's highways, where three similar buses filled with similar people crashed in separate accidents over the last week, killing eight and injuring dozens more. All three crashes are still being investigated.
Some driven by addiction, others by boredom, one in three visitors to Atlantic City arrives this way, with an average of 1,114 buses pouring into the resort daily, ferrying a total of 9,492,238 passengers through November 1998. Most are "line buses," like this one, which snakes through immigrant neighborhoods in Brooklyn, picking up people like Nick at bagel joints, smoke shops and candy stores before the morning commute and dropping them off way after dark.
With a scarce local population nearby but the big cities of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington all a day-trip away, Atlantic City relies more on the bus business than any other casino market. At the Taj, the stable of bus bays looks like the Port Authority terminal in Manhattan as the coaches line up nose to nose and a "greeter" from the casino hops aboard to give each passenger coupons, chips or coins.
"It's the mainstay, it's the basic market, it's America," said William N. Thompson, an economics professor who studies gambling at the University of Nevada. "Some of them become addicted, but I think they become addicted more to the bus ride and the socialization. It beats sitting at home and watching 'Oprah.' "
The casino-bus concept dates to 1957, when William F. Harrah arranged charters to Reno from 31 cities in California and Nevada. But it has been perfected in Atlantic City, where gambling was legalized in 1978 and casinos compete fiercely for the bus market, offering passengers free food, free taffy, even free money to get them to stop at their door first.
Nosher, a grimy convenience store at the corner of 82d Street and Flatlands Avenue in Brooklyn, offers tickets for at least a dozen different buses a day. On SGS Tours Bus No. 853 today, riders paid $22 round trip and could choose between getting off at the Sands, where they received $20, and the Taj Mahal, where they got $17. (Sometimes people take the $20 from the Sands and walk the seven blocks to the fancier Taj.) The drive each way, including half a dozen stops for pickups and drop-offs, took about three and a half hours; players got seven hours in the casino.
With tolls and gasoline, it is cheaper to ride the bus from New York to Atlantic City than to drive. Consider cataracts, which inhibit night driving, and speeding tickets, and the bus sounds convenient to would-be gamblers, especially the older ones. They even show movies on board. (Today, it was Ricki Lake in "Mrs. Winterbourne" on the way down and Robin Williams in "The Birdcage" for the trip home.)
"I used to drive, but I have a little heart condition, so I don't put stress on myself," said Sam Denino, who makes the trip about twice a month with his wife of 47 years, Millie. "You're at an age, you're over 60, you've got to get out of the house. You need a diversion. I can only garden so much. I can only fix the house so much."
Elderly retirees fill most of the seats on the Atlantic City buses. At 2 P.M. at the Taj, there is a line of older women waiting at the water fountain to take their pills. For lonely widows, the trips provide a much-needed day out, often including a walk in the fresh air of the Boardwalk. But what starts as an innocent hobby can easily become an addictive, savings-draining habit.
The crapshooter on Bus 853 spoke only on the condition that he not be named, and the embarrassment is not surprising. The 75-year-old widower started playing dice when Las Vegas first opened in the 1940's, once came home with $15,000 in his pocket and gifts for everybody. Today, he is up $1,000 at one point, but comes home $1,100 in the hole. He goes to Atlantic City a couple of times a month with the "kids" -- he has 4 children, 10 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren -- or his buddies from the Knights of Columbus. In between, he goes alone, on the bus, sometimes every single day.
"My trouble is I don't get up and walk away," he admitted. "I used to go to shows. I used to sleep overnight. Now, I get a room -- I don't sleep anyway. I'm downstairs playing while everyone else is up there."
Mrs. Kessert is much more upbeat about the situation, but she knows that she, too, may have a problem.
In the morning on the ride down, she talks of video poker as therapy -- stimulating, a little like playing bridge as you decide what to keep and what to toss. In the casino, as she pumps the quarters into the machine and punches the bright red "payout" button with gusto every time she gets two pairs, Mrs. Kessert is resigned to the monotony.
"Sometimes, you have to get up," she said as five hopelessly unmatched cards flashed onto the video screen. Then, three kings! Fifteen quarters jangled out.
"Sometimes," she added, "it doesn't pay to get up."
Later, after a meal of Maryland crab cakes, a baked potato and soup, complimentary because of her volume of play, Mrs. Kessert makes her way back to the bus, her bag $250 lighter, her smile only slightly so.
"I used to come every week," she sighed. "Maybe I'll take intermission one week. I think I am addicted. If I don't go that week, I don't feel good."
But for every Molly Kessert there is a Jim Lunenfeld, who talks more of the buffet at the Sands, where he can pile Peking duck, orecchiette and mac-and-cheese on the same plate, than of the gaming tables.
Mr. Lunenfeld, a teacher who visits the homes of emotionally and physically troubled students, is here with his 21-year-old son, Joel. They ate at the Sands, took a long walk on the Boardwalk, and each dropped $20 on the slots. Mr. Lunenfeld's friend, Peter Cruciata, also a teacher, lost $40 during about four hours playing poker.
"It's a one-day vacation, the cheapest one-day vacation you can have," said Mr. Cruciata, who learned to play poker in his native Italy at age 5, using buttons instead of chips. "Most of all, I play for fun. I don't bet my paycheck. I'm able to be objective: O.K., I'm down $50, kiss goodbye to the machine, kiss goodbye to the table. We don't have to lose it all."
Two sisters, Sylvia Anderson, 43, and Faye Glynn, 48, left their husbands at home and took the bus to Atlantic City for an overnight getaway. They played cards with each other in the hotel room, but, in the casino, dared only the machines.
"This is a nice little time for me to relax," Mrs. Anderson, who is a secretary for a dean at Brooklyn College, explained on the way home. "It's hectic at school. When I go home, it's hectic. I need to relax.
"When you win money," she said, "then you really relax."
Bus 853 was eerily empty today, with just a dozen of the 57 seats filled on the way to Atlantic City and four more on the way back to Brooklyn. Passengers and the veteran driver, Milton Hobbs, and company representatives figured it was partly because of the coming New Year's Eve holiday, a big night in casinos everywhere, and partly because of the grim weather forecast. But they knew, also, that the news of the accidents had most likely kept many away.
The deadly crash happened on Christmas Eve, when a bus run by the same company, SGS Tours, spun out of control and tumbled down an embankment, throwing passengers through the window. The driver has told the police that he swerved to avoid an icy patch, and investigators are also looking into mechanical problems with the bus and whether the driver was speeding.
The other two accidents came as a frightening coincidence, but were much less severe. A busload of 30 people from Chinatown on their way home from a concert by a Hong Kong entertainer ran into a tree last Sunday morning; the next day, a bus carrying 27 people to the casinos crashed into a bridge abutment off the Garden State Parkway.
"God should watch us," Mrs. Kessert said, to nobody in particular, as she got on the bus at about 8 this morning at a Manhattan Bagel in Canarsie.
As they cruised home, Mr. Denino pointed out the exit where the bus in the fatal crash went down a week before. Mr. Hobbs, the driver -- who has been ferrying busloads to Atlantic City since the casinos opened two decades ago -- made an announcement over the public address system wishing the injured, and the relatives of the dead, a peaceful New Year in their time of sadness.
In the darkness, the strangers sat side by side, nodding agreement and offering condolences. Then, impromptu, they fell silent for a moment.

Population Growth Seen As Sign of Good Times

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
The state's population grew slightly in the past year, and some analysts say the growth was evidence that Connecticut is bouncing back from the recession of the early 1990's.
The United States Census Bureau said the state's population increased by about 6,800 people, or 0.2 percent, from July 1, 1997, to last July 1. That was about double the previous year's population growth. Births outnumbered deaths by about 13,400. 
 Connecticut's population growth was modest compared with the rest of the nation, and even the rest of New England, which grew by 0.4 percent between 1997 and 1998.
At an estimated 3.3 million people, Connecticut's population in July 1998, was about 13,000 people short of the state's population in 1990, according to the Census Bureau.
"It's nice to see the growth and it's a confirmation of what we see about us, that the economy is doing well," said William A. McEachern, a professor of economics at the University of Connecticut.
The Census Bureau estimates that the state's population dropped by about 25,000 people in the early 1990's. Stagnant business growth forced thousands to move to other parts of the country to find work.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
In Quiet Corners, a Rhapsody for the Eyes and Soul

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
In terms of material things, there's no place like New York and no time like the Christmas holidays. The rituals of buying, giving and getting are pronounced here, and phase two -- returning, exchanging and sale-hopping -- can be even more intense. Add to this the movements of people heading for the city's major blockbuster art exhibitions in their final days, and you've got object-oriented human gridlock of unparalleled proportions. Right now it feels like the whole world is here on a class trip.
If your eyes need respite from looking at things with price tags or you simply want an esthetic experience that doesn't threaten life and limb, there's hope. Even at this time of year, the city is rife with relatively quiet, empty places to contemplate outstanding works of art and related visual phenomena, places slightly or way off the beaten path -- be they the less-popular galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the city's only indoor Earthwork (Walter De Maria's "New York Earth Room" in SoHo) or the great scale model of New York City at the Queens Museum of Art. 
 Here is a series of mini-pilgrimages to overlooked or out-of-the-way places or objects, a kind of spa tour for the eyes and soul. Most of the sights are worlds unto themselves, little universes that the viewer can inhabit physically or mentally. Several are small enclosed spaces, dense with some form of artistry, that envelop the visitor like a mud bath or a sauna. Others are single objects, usually exquisite and small, that encourage fantasy and projection and whose benefits resemble those of a skilled scalp massage.
The tour moves through space and time, and so through quite a bit of New York history. Not every stop offers a pedigreed masterpiece or even an artwork, although many do. Others contain glimpses of material culture, anonymously made functional objects with fascinating histories of their own. And this is merely a sampling; there are hundreds of candidates for this tour. When it comes to viewing opportunities that cost next to nothing, New York truly is the city that never stops giving.
 
The Cloisters
 Start with a topographical and cultural high point: the Cloisters, a branch of the Metropolitan dedicated to the art and architecture of Europe of the Middle Ages that is in Fort Tryon Park, near Manhattan's northern tip. It's easier to get to than anyone remembers. Take the A subway train to 190th Street, and go up to Fort Washington Avenue on an elevator that is something of an environmental artwork itself because the man who operates it regularly has lined it with images of kittens. From there either take the M-4 bus to its last stop, the Cloisters' front door, or enjoy the 10- to 15-minute walk through the park.
Cobbled together from the ruins of several French Romanesque and Gothic churches and monasteries, the Cloisters may be New York City's premier world removed. Its very structure is an architectural history lesson. Its contents survey medieval art forms from stone-carving all the way up the chart of refinement. (Note the columns in the 11th-century Cloister of St.-Guilhem-le-Desert, carved to resemble flowing water.)
Quite a bit off the chart is the reliquary room, or Treasury, on the building's lower level: a glowing treasure box of illuminated manuscripts, silver and gold liturgical vessels and, perhaps best of all, a rotating selection of nearly two dozen ivories dating from the 9th to the 14th centuries.
These tiny carvings bristle with religious fervor, elaborate narratives and formal inventiveness. Several of the earliest and most striking are small Carolingian plaques that were the chief form of sculptural expression during the time of Charlemagne and reflect the Classical revival that he initiated after 800. The Classical concerns for creating a strong spatial reality and using flowing drapery to achieve a naturalistic sense of the body are especially evident in the figures and castle in "Plaque With Emmaus Scenes." The plaque's outer border of flattened flower and bird forms reflects the persistence of barbaric anti-classical tendencies that Charlemagne sought to eliminate.
The largest and most famous of the ivories is the 12th-century altar cross that may have come from the Abbey of Bury St. Edmonds in eastern England. Its medallions and terminals represent scenes from the sacrifice of Christ with breathtaking delicacy, but the most memorable form to contemporary eyes may be the cross itself. Marked with the nail holes of Jesus' missing body, it doubles as a tree of life. Its rounded trunk is regularly punctuated with bilateral buds ready to send branches (and Christianity) out in every direction. The back of the cross portrays one means of dissemination: carvings of 18 prophets holding texts form a sinuous spiral, suggestive of growth.
Noteworthy among the other wonders here is the "Monkey Cup," an enamel vessel from 15th-century Burgundy. Its lush blue exterior is an orderly riot of mischievous monkeys, their sleeping human prey and curling vines; its interior, a Surrealistic hunting scene dominated by clumps of golden trees on mesa-like hills. The label spells out an illustrious provenance: Piero de Medici, the Earls of Arundel and J. P. Morgan.
 
Museum of the City
Of New York
 It seems appropriate to follow the sweeping, historically rich other-worldliness of the Cloisters with the diminutive, personal escapism of Carrie Stettheimer's doll house in the Toys Gallery of the Museum of the City of New York.
From the late 1920's to the early 1940's, the three Stettheimer sisters presided over one of New York's most sparkling cultural salons, playing hostess to everyone who was anyone, especially where art was concerned. While Florine made fanciful group portraits of their circle and Ettie wrote novels, Carrie worked most of her life creating a doll house homage to the Stettheimer residence in the Alwyn Court on West 58th Street.
The result, a lavish little mansion shown on the verge of a Christmas soiree, is an early example of assemblage art rich with wry commentary. It employs such modern art techniques as photo collage (the foyer) and cut-paper collage (the child's bedroom). It contrasts decorating and artistic styles: the formal Louis XIV salon against the red-trimmed, proto-Vreeland sitting room; the traditional chintz guest bedroom (inhabited in this instance by dolls of Alice B. Toklas and Gertrude Stein) against the high-ceilinged central gallery with miniature modern artworks by such Stettheimer regulars as Marcel Duchamp and Gaston Lachaise. Along with Edward Steichen, Pavel Tchelitchew, Baroness de Meyer, Virgil Thomson and Henry McBride, these artists are represented by dolls made in the 1970's by a curator at the museum who was completely in sync with the Stett heimers' sensibility.
 
Metropolitan Museum of Art
 The Metropolitan Museum may be breaking attendance records at the moment, but it's still the league leader when it comes to reasonably deserted corners. Outstanding among these in terms of esthetic intimacy and visual-pounds-per-inch may be the tiny, piercingly exquisite "Gubbio Studiolo," the 12-by-17-foot 15th-century Italian wood intarsia room that was originally commissioned by Duke Federico da Montefeltro. Acquired by the Met in 1939 and displayed until 1967, it underwent a meticulous 10-year restoration and was finally reinstalled in 1996.
A fusion of the arts of painting and cabinetmaking executed in a palette of contrasting woods, this extraordinary chamber is in many ways a portrait of the Duke. Here he could contemplate pictorial symbols of his military prowess (armor, helmet and dagger) and his intellectual interests (musical instruments, books by Euclid, drafting tools). These objects sometimes overflow their niches, spilling onto the benches lining the paneled room. As interesting as their elaborate iconography is the sheer bravura. Every form in sight is a triumph of trompe l'oeil illusion that is continually undermined by the declarative artifice and flatness of the means of illusion, which is wood and only wood.
For esthetic intimacy on a grand scale at the Met, there's the 17,000-square-foot Henry R. Luce Center for the Study of American Art, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last month. Filled with row upon row of tall glass vitrines, the center is a library of Americana from Colonial times to the present. Its shelves are dense with displays of silver, glass, pewter, china, Redware pottery, stoneware, second-tier paintings in the museum's collection and, most of all, furniture.
These objects speak volumes. If you doubt that each era has a period look that reflects something of its soul, browse here. The course of American history, power and taste will not just flash before your eyes, it will be reiterated again and again, in medium after medium.
 
Whitney Museum Of American Art
 The Whitney might seem too small to have much that is untraveled or overlooked. Still, one can usually snatch a few moments of peace communing with Charles Simonds's 1981 "Dwelling" in the museum's stairwell. This unobtrusive permanent installation depicts a tiny adobe ruin nestled in swelling hills of red clay not unlike those that Georgia O'Keeffe liked to paint in New Mexico. Even people who know this sweet little sculpture, which evokes the American continent's first settlers, may not realize that it has two other parts. From the window on the landing just below "Dwelling," a similar ruin can be seen on the window ledge of a building across the street. Above, on the corner of the roof, a terra cotta bird keeps watch over the two tiny sites.
A second hideaway here is the small gallery devoted to the art of Alexander Calder, tucked beneath the museum's new fifth-floor permanent collection galleries. This room surveys the several sides of the artist's playful genius. His early wire masterpieces are here, "The Brass Family" of seven balancing acrobats and the "Circus" with its assembled acts. Sounds of the artist animating the "Circus" (on film) regularly fill the space. And there are several examples of the stabiles, mobiles and constellations of his maturity, their loyalties strictly divided between the forms of the real world and the pure abstractions of art and engineering.
 
New-York Historical Society
 If you can't get into the Museum of Natural History, which can resemble bedlam at this time of year, try the New-York Historical Society just across the street. It has a wonderful hands-on children's gallery that takes New York City's history and architecture as its subject. Until Jan. 10, a corridor gallery on the ground floor is devoted to the work -- primarily the large, ethereal, exquisitely detailed drawings -- of George B. Post, a prominent 19th-century architect whose existing designs include the New York Stock Exchange, City College, the Williamsburg Savings Bank and the Brooklyn Historical Society.
But the permanent attractions here are two small galleries on the society's second floor outfitted with moldings, a fireplace and a robustly Victorian carpet to approximate the painting gallery of Luman Reed. During the 1830's, this New York businessman and picture lover opened his collection, installed on the third floor of his house at 13 Greenwich Street, to the public. Reed collected European paintings, but his historical significance lies in his support of living American painters, notably Thomas Cole, founder of the Hudson River School.
The centerpiece of Reed's holdings, a large chunk of which his heirs gave to the society in the 1850's, is Cole's "Course of Empire," a five-painting allegorical cycle that the collector commissioned in 1835. Here the panoramic images are grouped around the fireplace, covering most of one wall.
At once campy and impassioned, these paintings trace the rise and fall of an eclectic ancient civilization (Rome, Athens, Pergamum). It seems loosely based on Poussin and Claude with turbulent weather reminiscent of Turner stirred in at the climax -- an invasion of bloodthirsty Viking-like barbarians. Despite the pictorial fireworks and the straining for universal truths, the cycle's progress from pastoral paradise to pastoral ruin may tell a simpler, more personal tale: that Cole's art returned inevitably to the natural landscape for its strength and inspiration.
 
Museum of American Folk Art
 Even the tiny Museum of American Folk Art, whose temporary home is little more than a glorified lobby, has a wonderful work of art that is easily overlooked: a radiant mural tenderly extracted from a New Hampshire house that is the backdrop in a vitrine for other objects. Painted in the first quarter of the 19th century and attributed to someone known only as the "Bear and Pears artist," it deserves a wall of its own. It depicts a tropical fantasy of coconut trees and undulating hills against a yellow sky, detailed with elephants and a row of red inhabitants.
 
Museum of Modern Art
 The Modern is not the quietest place this time of year, but grading on a curve, its design galleries qualify as relatively underpopulated. One of the most absorbing works here is the scale model of Frank Lloyd Wright's house "Fallingwater," cantilevered daringly over a burbling stream of textured plastic. Even when you're grown up, there's an inexplicable thrill in being larger than buildings. Models grant a degree of visual possession that real buildings rarely permit, enabling us to see their artistry in sharper outline. We appreciate instantly the dovetailing of "Fallingwater" with its rocky site, the economy of its materials (concrete, stone, metal, glass) and the sculptural brilliance of its structure. It simply projects from the rocks like a series of attenuated bureau drawers opening at right angles.
 
Morgan Library
 If the handsome exhibition of master drawings from the Pushkin and Hermitage Museums, which closes on Sunday, is overcrowded, you might head for J. P. Morgan's brocade-lined study, left pretty much as it was in the days when the financier kept the global economy in balance. The West Room, as it is called, is definitely another world, a period room of the first order and as much a self-portrait as Federico's "Studiolo." Although there are things to be seen here, the most interesting works -- a scattering of medieval objects -- are hard to see. There's also a lovely Perugino in one corner, and stern cameo portraits of Martin Luther and his wife by Lucas Cranach on a table. But it is the overall effect that remains most powerful. The need for focused, drop-dead beauty can be satisfied by returning to the landing just outside the study's door to study the imposing "Stavelot Triptych" from 12th-century Byzantium, glowing jewels and enamel-on-gold images.
 
Dia Center for the Arts
 Walter De Maria's "New York Earth Room" is also an enclosed world, as muffled and insulated as Morgan's study, but by entirely different means. Mr. De Maria's domesticated Earthwork, made in 1977 and opened to the public in 1980, is simply this: a large SoHo loft filled to the window sills with black earth, 140 tons of it. It is an outstanding example of the dematerialization of the art object and the rise of installation or environmental works that dominated the art of the late 1960's and early 70's. But its has roots deeper in the past; its power lies in both its absurdity and its familiarity. It is an instance of Surrealist contrast and displacement taken to extremes, Meret Oppenheim's fur-lined teacup multiplied to the nth power: the shock of the dark rough soil surrounded by smooth white walls in the middle of Manhattan is still delicious, after all these years. Yet it is also a piece of land, silent, solid, indifferent to the human presence, even if man-made, and profoundly comforting.
 
Brooklyn Museum of Art
 One of the quietest galleries in the Brooklyn Museum of Art is hiding in plain sight: the Great Hall, devoted to American Indian and pre-Columbian art and the art of the Pacific islands, which nearly every visitor to the museum passes through on the way to the back elevators, the cafe, the cafeteria or the spiffy new galleries of African art.
The hall, refurbished in 1965, has become dim and dusty in spots, but it contains some of the museum's greatest works, including a powerful little Olmec figure in deep green jade who holds a small scowling version of himself in his stiffly outstretched arms, and the cotton and wool mantle known as the Paracas Textile, a masterpiece of the Paracas/Nasca civilization of southern Peru (300 B.C.-A.D. 200), whose needle-knit borders are populated by a pantheon of extravagantly costumed and masked figures.
The displays contain clusters of wonderful things: Pomo baskets, fierce New Ireland masks, feathered headdresses from the Amazon and Ecuador. And there are isolated objects of supreme beauty: a white and black Zuni ceremonial bowl with a pair of kissing serpents circling its belly and a stepped lip that echoes the profile of pueblo dwellings, and a Northwest Indian clapper shaped like a halibut but animated by a haunting human face.
 
Queens Museum of Art
 It makes sense to end a condensed tour of some of New York's less obvious treasures with a compressed vision of the city itself. The only place for this is the "New York City Panorama," a scale model in an enormous gallery at the Queens Museum of Art in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Refurbished and updated four years ago, it accounts for every structure in New York City as of 1994. This Lilliputian metropolis can be circumnavigated on a sleek unobtrusive balcony that is floored in glass when necessary, over the outer reaches of the outer boroughs. Every few minutes the overhead lights go down and day changes to night.
Of course the model pales next to the real thing. Its night view is particularly dim compared with the blazing holiday radiance that stretches before the eye during a night landing at La Guardia Airport. But one of the great privileges of living in New York City is the exhilaration of flying over it to come home. The panorama allows you to relive that experience at your own pace, with all kinds of unscheduled stops and pauses. You can even retrace the points on this tour, starting with the Cloisters, a small, cruciform structure surrounded by green perched over Manhattan's northern gate.

HEADLINE: Euro Expected to Unleash Bull Market

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Euroka! That's the view of many investors looking forward to the debut in major financial markets on Monday of the euro, the single currency that now binds 11 European countries and promises to create a more unified economy in much of Europe.
Europe, which has emerged in the past couple of years from a long slump, should become an increasingly popular place to buy stocks and bonds, experts say. "The introduction of the euro will raise the profile of the region," said Erik B. Granade, an international portfolio manager for Invesco Capital Management in Atlanta. 
 As obstacles to trade and investment across borders have been broken down under the European Union's earlier campaign to build a single market roughly the size of the American economy, European companies have been scrambling to become more competitive. That has led to a whirl of merger activity, like the recent combination of Britain's Zeneca Group with Sweden's Astra, and a wave of restructurings.
As a result, over the last year, the stock prices of many large European companies have risen. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50, which is made up of 50 large European companies, gained 26 percent in 1998.
But many investment managers believe that the planned changes from adopting a single monetary policy for much of Europe will offer opportunities to profit for years to come. They believe Europe could see a period of prosperity not dissimilar to what occurred in the United States in the 1980's and 1990's from American corporate efforts to downsize and restructure themselves to become more competitive. "This can have very, very long legs," said George A. Murnaghan, an executive vice president for Rowe Price Fleming International in Baltimore.
Putnam Investments, the Boston mutual fund group, is also bullish on the prospects for European companies. While the return on capital achieved by American companies has drastically improved since the 1970's, the returns of companies in France, Italy and Germany have actually declined. "There is a tremendous gap that has opened up there," said Jonathan Francis, the head of global strategy for Putnam.
Most portfolio managers say the introduction of the euro will force investors to take a broader approach when selecting stocks. "There is going to be dramatic change in how they view things and how they operate," said Michael Gerding, an international portfolio manager for Founders Asset Management in Denver. While many managers, both in the United States and in Europe, often bought the shares of leading companies in different countries simply to lessen risk and enhance diversity, they will increasingly focus on choosing stocks in attractive industries and picking the best companies in all of Europe.
Take ENI S.p.A., a big Italian oil and gas company with broad interests elsewhere, which may have been overshadowed by British Petroleum and Royal Dutch/Shell. It could become a more popular holding for investors as the oil industry recovers and ENI, which is already included in major European baskets of stocks, becomes better known around the globe. "You are going to have so much focus on the big names," Mr. Gerding said.
Many portfolio managers say the companies that are poised to benefit most from this new emphasis on specific sectors and industries are also the ones that should prosper in a more pan-European environment: the large, multinational companies that most resemble the blue chips in the United States.
"If scale is increasingly important and the ability to operate in many different nations is important, I think it does favor large companies over small companies," said Mr. Murnaghan of Rowe Price Fleming.
But those companies are not necessarily located in the countries joining forces. As an example of the kind of company he favors, Mr. Murnaghan points to Nestle S.A., the giant Swiss food company. The company's executives "have positioned themselves very well to compete," he said. (Switzerland, which has rejected membership in the 15-nation European Union, will maintain its own Swiss franc and has no plans to join the 11-nation euro bloc in the foreseeable future.)
And smaller companies, which are successfully exploiting a niche, will also prosper. Mr. Gerding, for example, points to TelePizza S.A., a Spanish fast-food company that has managed to fend off many competitors. But he would avoid also-rans: companies that are the fourth or fifth largest player in their market.
Mr. Francis of Putnam Investments warned that investors would be making a mistake to blur the distinctions among the countries taking part in the euro, especially when buying Government bonds. Investors may currently be giving too much credit -- literally -- to Italy by failing to significantly differentiate in price its bonds from those of Germany or France. "In our view, the convergence of 10-year bonds has gone too far to justify some of the credit risks that would be there," he said.
The emergence of the euro is also expected to fuel the growth of the corporate bond market in Europe, according to N. Graham Allen, the chief fixed-income officer for Wells Capital Management in Los Angeles.
Still, some portfolio managers are approaching the enthusiasm over a unified Europe with caution. The euro countries may have their fair share of infighting as they struggle to operate under a common monetary policy that will no longer take account of differences in economic development.
"I don't give it great odds of being as effective as everyone thinks," said James W. Paulsen, the chief investment officer for Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis. But even more important, in Mr. Paulsen's view, is that any evolution of a truly united Europe is bound to take time. "It doesn't happen in a flash," he said. "It happens generationally."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Era May End For Floating Currencies

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

 BODY:
Last year's dominant economic story might be summed up this way: When currencies float, economies sink.
From Thailand to Russia, many nations' currencies floated when their exchange rates against the United States dollar collapsed, often under pressure from speculators. Then, without exception, those nations' economies sank. The failure of links, or pegs, to the dollar, the world's benchmark currency, made it harder for Russia and many Asian countries to repay foreign loans and contributed to severe recessions. 
 The currency-induced turmoil has shaken some core assumptions of modern economics.
For decades, the prevailing orthodoxy in monetary policy has favored floating exchange rates. Financial markets, not governments, should dictate the value of a currency, the thinking goes. Central banks should achieve policy objectives by raising or lowering interest rates to influence the market. Most major Western economies manage their currencies this way.
But one outcome of the global financial turmoil is that some economists are challenging that way of thinking, at least as it applies to smaller and less-developed countries.
The debate seems likely to heat up this year and could well lead to the most radical shifts in the way economies interact with one another since the system of fixed exchange rates broke down in the early 1970's.
In Latin America, Eastern Europe and parts of Asia, leading economists, businessmen and government officials are pondering the idea of effectively abandoning their independent currencies, strictly curtailing the powers of central banks and linking themselves to one or another of the world's major currencies, especially the dollar or the euro, as the modern equivalent of gold.
"I sense a growing feeling in Asia and Latin America, particularly, that floating rates are fine for the United States but not so good for small countries," said Merton H. Miller, an Nobel-prize-winning economist at the University of Chicago. "For many years, everybody in America thought floating exchange rates were the answer, but now there's a sense that this exacerbates the problem."
Mr. Miller has recently won converts to his long-held view that smaller countries should replace the central bank with a currency board, which in its pure form has none of the market-intervening powers of today's central banks. In this system, the country still issues currency, but the central bank by law agrees to exchange the currency at a preset rate for dollars or some other strong foreign currency. Money supply is dictated by the central bank's reserve of hard currency, meaning that the quantity of local currency fluctuates depending on how much foreign currency the country gathers through trade or investment.
A leading benefit of currency boards, proponents say, is to remove the power of central bankers who use money supply to manipulate their economies, often for political purposes.
"Currency sovereignty is the right to have stagnant growth because the central banks screw up all the time," said Rudiger Dornbusch, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "In this environment it is increasingly ridiculous to argue that every country must have its own central bank."
Today, only a handful of Governments, including those of Hong Kong, Argentina and Bulgaria, have currency boards, which were a common management tool for colonies in the British empire. Hong Kong and Argentina back their local currencies with United States dollars, while Bulgaria guarantees convertibility with the German mark at a fixed rate.
Though countries with currency boards have been affected by the same global turmoil that struck their neighbors -- Hong Kong's economy is in a deep recession -- the currency boards have so far survived. They have given the developing world a rare example of monetary stability. Hong Kong, Argentina and Bulgaria are widely seen as better positioned than their neighbors to rebound quickly, in part because outside investors have faith that if they invest in those nations they won't face the risk of devaluation before they get their money back.
Making money stable has been the greatest monetary challenge of the ages. Stable currencies promote trade and investment, which have become increasingly important drivers of economic growth in recent years. Historically, countries sought to make their currencies solid by stocking treasuries with gold, which prevailed as the monetary standard in the United States from the late 19th century until the Great Depression.
With the decline of classical economics in the 1930's and 40's, economists turned against the gold standard and promoted the creation of bigger and much more powerful central banks. Now the tide appears to be shifting again, in favor of smaller central banks and more rigid currency regimes.
One of the biggest contributors to that shift, of course, is European monetary union, which took effect yesterday. The 11 participating nations are replacing their currencies with a single currency, the euro, and a single central bank, a once unthinkable sacrifice of national monetary sovereignty in favor of a high-minded economic ideal.
"The euro is a great example of how the world is going to look," said Sebastian Edwards, a professor of international economics at the University of California at Los Angeles. "The euro itself will float against the dollar and other currencies, but member countries will have rigid exchange rates among themselves."
Indeed, many economists see the world eventually dividing into two or three currency zones, one ruled by the euro, one by the dollar and perhaps a third, farther in the future, that uses the Japanese yen or Chinese yuan as an anchor. Each smaller country in a region would either simply accept the benchmark currency as legal tender at home or adopt a currency board.
No one expects the transition, if it happens at all, to come overnight. The International Monetary Fund has favored the use of currency boards in some cases but discouraged them in others. Some leading economists argue strongly that free-floating currencies are still the best system. And many analysts agree that the leading enemy of monetary stability is not a genuine free float but currency alchemy, the kind of monetary distortion that may occur, for example, when a country tries to have the fixed exchange rates of a currency board but still gives its central bank power to manipulate exchange rates and money supply.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has warned against quick-fix solutions to fundamental problems in emerging markets, arguing that tinkering with currency regimes is no substitute for sound macroeconomic management.
"Many emerging-market economies have tried a number of technical devices: the fixed rate peg, varieties of crawling peg, currency boards and even dollarization," Mr. Greenspan said in a recent speech. "The success has been mixed. Where successful, they have been backed by sound policies."
Still, some economists say they would not be surprised if the move toward currency boards gathers momentum in coming months or years. Among the countries most likely to adopt them are Brazil, Mexico, Russia and Indonesia. The issue is being debated in all those countries.
Brazilian economists and politicians are considering whether to follow Argentina's lead by linking the real to the dollar, creating the core of a currency alliance that would tie those two countries together with Uruguay and Paraguay. A vocal group of Mexican economists and businessmen are pushing for the dollarization of the economy -- abandonment of the national currency altogether in favor of reliance on the American dollar -- though few see that outcome as imminent. Indonesia explored setting up a currency board last year, before the Suharto government collapsed, and the idea may be revived as the nation struggles to restore order to its economy. Russia is under pressure to take radical steps, including establishment of a currency board, to restore some credibility to the battered ruble.
Those nations would have to sacrifice sovereignty over areas of monetary management that were once considered purely national. But the lesson of the recent world turmoil may be that currency management is fundamentally international anyway.
"Remember that Germany and France had deep enmity extending back many years," Mr. Miller said. "They came together to form the core of the euro countries. Who's to say that Brazil and Argentina, or China and Japan, cannot resolve their grievances? I think that sooner or later they will realize that this is the way to go."

HEADLINE: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;
On Brink of Millennium, It Was Just Another Day

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Nothing ages faster than the ephemera of New Year's Eve. The discarded funny hats by dawn seem like ancient relics, the sequined gowns as odd as the discarded styles of some justifiably forgotten decade.
But even as friends put their heads on each other's shoulders and fell asleep on the subway, and others talked too fast so they could stay awake for just a few more minutes, the world moved ahead. The night before became nothing more than another night before. At the brink of day yesterday, if you asked just about anybody what they thought of being alive on the brink of a new century and millennium, they said it seemed pretty much like any other year. 
 "I don't think the next 100 years will be any different than the 100 years that came before," said John Bajrami, 41, who was fishing on the Coney Island Pier.
Then Mr. Bajrami appeared to change tacks. He said he thought technology would do amazing things, but that there would continue to be fewer and fewer fish. Once, he supported himself by selling fish he caught. His catch yesterday: "three lousy herring."
This was the kind of thing one heard again and again yesterday. People profess not to care about time's passage, then give clear evidence that they see their own lives as a voyage through time. Some think the world will become a crazier place as the millennium nears. Some foresee awesome improvements. Everybody seems to be paying attention.
 
Dawn of a New Day
 At the end of the pier stood Ron Rogers, a 28-year-old unemployed actor. He held a video camera, and was waiting for sunrise. It was cold and clear. The waves lapped rhythmically on the shore.
"After such a terrible year, I wanted to see the first sunrise," he said. "Things still look pure. I feel some type of hope." The millennium?
"Everybody is so worried that the world is going to end. The question is, what if it doesn't? What will you have done with your life?"
On the beach were five Buddhists, who had come to pray. They brought wine and food to give to their ancestors. "I am looking back on my life and where I have been," said Man Hee, a 34-year-old artist who lives in Greenwich Village. "I'm also looking ahead to where I'm going."
Just two blocks away, on West 15th Street near Surf Avenue, more than a half-dozen fire trucks could be seen. Their lights flashed white and red. Victor Estrada, 58, watched his apartment burn. He told of his cat, Simon, going under the bed. An asthmatic, Mr. Estrada could not breathe. He dived through a window and got out down the fire escape, leaving the cat.
"I don't care about me or where I live," Mr. Estrada said. "Man, what do I say to my cat?"
 
'Maybe This Year'
 Four blocks to the east, there is a luncheonette called The Islander. It is the kind of place where waitresses remember exactly what customers want. Jokes are familiar enough that they no longer need punch lines.
A customer told Wanda Feliciano, a waitress, about the fire. She hurried to the phone to call a friend who lived there. She was fine. The conversation turned to how the building had long been a crack haven. The click-click-click of a spatula on the grill was oddly comforting.
A subway conductor shuffled in, rubbing his eyes. "What a train," he said. "Everybody who could have vomited did."
Ms. Feliciano preferred to talk about her hopes for the new year. "The new year has got to bring peace," she said. "We've got to get rid of all the bombs and stop destroying people.
"Maybe this year they'll find a cure for AIDS and cancer and all those diseases," she said. "Everything's going to fall into place."
Oh, and one more thing. "I hate this job," she said, smiling mischievously at her boss.
On the counter were two discarded glittery top hats, as old as time.
 
Amid the Debris, a New Era
 In Times Square, little bits of confetti remained, though the mountains of the stuff had disappeared. The shattered glass of a cheap wine bottle was next to a Champagne magnum.
"There will be a lot of unexpected things happening this year," said Kenny Lever, 21, a student at Dowling College.
In 1899, Rutherford discovered alpha and beta waves, Freud wrote "The Interpretation of Dreams" and the Philippines demanded independence from the United States.
And 1999? "Last night marked the beginning of an era," said Kristy Bemis, 20, a college student from Utah in the Times Square subway station. "But we don't know what era."
Arthur P. Pommelle, who was in the same station, stressed the uncertainty, "I'll be honest with you," he said. "No one knows where we're headed."
Except perhaps the Vogue magazine now on the stands. It has dubbed 1999 the year of the accessory. "It's the little things that count," Vogue advised. "The hip-slung pouch, the sharp steel heel, the swinging sky-colored bag."
 
Meanwhile, the Daily Grind
 Mostly, people seemed eager to keep on keeping on. A visit to the Cub Room, a restaurant at 131 Sullivan Street in SoHo, found a number of employees who had worked until 3 or 4 A.M. at Thursday night's celebration, and were back at work Friday by 9 A.M. Perhaps a bit bleary eyed.
"I got three hours of sleep, and I feel great," said Cicely Brooks, 21, a waitress who had ridden four trains between the restaurant and her home in the Bronx within a six-hour span.
"I got one hour, and I feel wonderful," said Billy Johnson, a 36-year-old waiter.
Their boss, Gary Koenigsberg, was less Pollyannaish. "It's obviously not the most fun day of the year," he said.
But it beats living in Central Park in yesterday's frigid weather. At the park's lagoon, where Holden Caulfield in "The Catcher in the Rye" worried about what would happen to the ducks in the cold weather, a homeless man threw them bread.
He said his name was Khanbais Wadu and that he and his friends lived on a hill they called Holy Rock. He was waiting for a church group to bring him a sandwich and juice. He said he had hoped to hitch a ride to Florida with somebody coming here for the celebration, but he had slept through it.
Mr. Wadu said 1999 was going to be a year of abundant opportunity. "It's like a threshold of a different beginning," he said.

HEADLINE: For Oilfield Workers, Not the Best of Times

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

DATELINE: GILLETTE, Wyo.

 BODY:
As Tim Gimbel sees it from the double-wide trailer near here where he now spends his days, even working a drilling rig when it's 25 below beats a layoff. He will not have the money to build a garage this summer, so his wife, Laura, has at least two more winters of creeping an icy hundred yards uphill every morning to fetch her car from a shed as she leaves for her job as a secretary.
She often asks how soon her husband expects to be called back, or why he wants to remain a driller in the first place, and whether there aren't more dependable ways to make a living. "She's done everything but put her boots on and kick me out the door," Mr. Gimbel said. 
 Two weeks ago, he joined 600 others, out of 1,000, whom Caza Drilling, based in Denver, has sent to the unemployment offices over the last year. As oil prices sank, Caza, whose clients include George Fancher, went from running 30 rigs to 10 or 12.
Tom Schledwitz, Caza's operations manager, has seen the toll. It's not just the 21 of his own field people it takes to keep a rig running, he says, but also his office staff and 20 or so more at his suppliers and service companies. Oil deposits -- and, thus, the jobs -- in such a volatile business tend, perversely, to be in places where other options are few. "In Wyoming or Montana, farming and mining are about the only other industries," Mr. Schledwitz said.
Not everyone could see the romance of a grimy, dangerous job requiring seven straight days of 12-hour shifts, as likely to be 7 P.M. to 7 A.M. as the reverse. Not to mention living away from home with 10 or 12 others jammed into a single trailer.
But workers speak of oilfield labor, its highs and lows, almost the way addicts speak of drugs. Dale Shaffer, a Caza driller who lives in Thermopolis, near Casper, Wyo., said he once tried breaking his habit with a job indoors, in an oil pump shop. "I did that for two years and about went stark raving mad," he said.
Mr. Shaffer, 34, began as the lowliest of the roughnecks -- working the worm's corner, as they say -- digging ditches and doing other jobs nobody else would touch. As a driller, he supervises a crew of four, earning $600 to $700 a week.
Besides seeing his checks fall to less than half that on unemployment, Mr. Shaffer has to pay an extra $200 a month to keep his health insurance. With his wife, Karla, pregnant and due in March, insurance is essential.
The clothing store where his wife worked as a sales clerk has laid her off, too, while the closing of other local stores has killed her job prospects. "A lot of it is because of the oil business being so slow," Mr. Shaffer said. "People aren't out buying stuff. There really aren't jobs to be had."
Mr. Shaffer, laid off in mid-December, hopes to help friends who install carpeting or serve as roustabouts, driving trucks and delivering oilfield supplies. Having grown up on a Wyoming ranch, he has worked as a cowboy, too, but that paid only $12,000 a year. He won't be called back by Caza Drilling for at least three months, but he isn't complaining since others from his company have been waiting a year.
Mr. Gimbel, 45, might tide himself over by driving a bus to take miners and train operators to the coal mines. He knows he could then be called out at any hour, but he does not know the pay. "They've always got an ad in the newspaper," he said.
Mr. Gimbel admits he should have known better after seeing his father auction off his rigs and go out of business in an oil slump 12 years ago. His father's old shop is where Laura Gimbel now leaves her car. But even now, Mr. Gimbel focuses more on the $45,000 or $50,000 he can earn for a full year's work than on his $240 a week in unemployment.
Mr. Shaffer accepts that buying a home, instead of renting one, is now at least two years off. By then, the costs of his 16-year-old stepson's college could delay homebuying even more.
But whenever his stepson, Ryan, speaks of tracking his father into the oilfields right after high school, Mr. Shaffer tells him, "Get your education first."

HEADLINE: E*Trade Cut Option Price Just Before Stock Surged

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif., Jan. 1

 BODY:
E*Trade Group Inc., the No. 2 on-line broker, reduced the exercise price on employee stock options two weeks after its stock traded at a 21-month low and began a three-month surge that increased its price sixfold.
On Oct. 22, the company told employees they could trade in options carrying higher exercise prices for new ones at that day's closing price of $17, according to the company's annual report, filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 The company said options covering almost 3.5 million shares have since been "regranted" under the program.
E*Trade rose to a record $60.125 a share on Tuesday from an intraday low of $10 on Oct. 8. On Wednesday, the stock fell $9.3125, or 15 percent, to $50.8125, after dropping as low as $48.
Employees who took advantage of the lower-priced options had total paper gains of $117.7 million at Wednesday's close. More than two-thirds of E*Trade's 700 employees are eligible for stock options, which vest at a rate of 25 percent a year.
Employees who traded in their old options "start from ground zero, as if it was day one of the vesting period," said a company spokeswoman, Lisa Nash. "This decision was certainly not taken lightly."
The company did not specify the exercise price on options that were traded in by employees. According to its January 1998 proxy statement, the company's president, Christos Cotsakos, and four other senior executives received about 550,000 options at an average exercise price of $27.42 in July and August 1997.
Companies with volatile stocks should not reprice options when their share prices dip, said Graef Crystal, an executive compensation consultant. Doing so, he said, creates "a virtual money machine, an antigravity device."
On Oct. 8, two weeks before the options-adjustment program was instituted, shares of E*Trade and other on-line brokers, like the Charles Schwab Corporation and the Ameritrade Holding Corporation, closed at 52-week lows on concerns that the bull market in stocks would end because of economic crises in Russia, Japan and emerging markets.
Before Wednesday's decline, E*Trade shares rose for eight straight days on optimism about the company's financial results for the current quarter. Industry executives and analysts say on-line brokers' trading volume rose by more than one-third, largely because of heavy activity in Internet stocks.
In its annual report filing, the company, based in Palo Alto, also disclosed that it had invested $2 million in KAP Group, a company led by the founder and chairman of E*Trade, William Porter. That company is trying to establish an on-line options exchange. E*Trade invested another $15.3 million for a less than 20 percent stake in Critical Path, a provider of E-mail software to large Web sites.
E*Trade Group owns 42 percent of E*Trade Japan, its joint on-line trading venture with the Softbank Corporation, after making an $8 million investment, according to the filing.

HEADLINE: Soft Oil Prices Take Their Toll On Wildcatters

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

DATELINE: GILLETTE, Wyo.

 BODY:
Until late November, the shed next to one of George Fancher's wells here in northwestern Wyoming was alive around the clock with the chugging and hissing of pistons and pumps. They filtered water coming out of his well and injected clean water back in to keep the oil flowing.
A month later, the only sound was the low whir of a heater -- kept on to assure that in the subzero chill, the equipment did not freeze, crack and rupture. 
 After nearly three decades of running his own company, Mr. Fancher is taking part in the shutdown of vast swaths of the nation's oil industry. The lowest oil prices, adjusted for inflation, since before the 1973 oil crisis have forced him to idle wells, lay off workers and cut off many contractors who depend on him.
"This is the worst I've ever seen," Mr. Fancher said in a voice more gravelly than the road into here. "I've never seen prices go this low and stay this low for this length of time."
And Mr. Fancher is among the lucky, financially strong enough that he considers his production halt only temporary.
Low prices and foreign competition, which favor the Exxons and Mobils over the George Fanchers, are making the wildcatter an endangered species. Enshrined in fable for his enterprise and daring, the oilman in jeans and boots is giving way to the oilman in a suit.
Except for huge oilfields far offshore or in Alaska's wilds, major oil companies consider most of the United States too expensive or played out to bother with. As the oil giants shifted production abroad, they left independents to drill five of every six new wells, producing half the crude in the continental United States.
Exxon's planned acquisition of Mobil has only compounded many independents' sense of powerlessness. Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, was already insulated against lower prices, with higher earnings from refineries, chemical plants and gas stations balancing lower earnings from production. Exxon and Mobil see their deal as a way of cutting payrolls and costs even further.
But independents, devoted entirely to oil or natural gas production, are less able to ride out the cycles. They shut down more than 48,000 of the nation's 573,000 wells in the first half of 1998, and prices kept on falling. Now, when oil producers gather in Texas or Louisiana or Wyoming, they quietly speak of trying to form their own OPEC in the hope of pinching production and raising prices.
With the nation already importing half its oil, and domestic production falling, the independents see themselves as the bulwark against even greater foreign domination.
The exploration and production industry's payrolls fell to 314,000 in November, down about 25,000 from a year earlier. States like Wyoming have been hardest hit, as tax revenues that pay for schools, roads and health care dwindle. In other areas, from Louisiana and Texas to California, the oil bust has slowed or reversed the job growth enjoyed by the rest of the nation.
A robust national economy, however, has helped limit the damage. In Louisiana, welders and pipe fitters who lose oilfield jobs can often find new ones in the shipyards. Texas, the nation's largest oil producer, is so diversified that its predicament is how to spend a hefty budget surplus.
Though Wyoming might not seem like the center of the oil patch, oil is its lifeblood, natural gas its air, coal its very food. Just 100 miles or so south of Gillette lies Teapot Dome, the oilfield that in the 1920's became synonymous with scandal.
While Texas now has more jobs in high technology than in energy, Wyoming has little besides buried reserves and rising fears. "Everybody does like cheap gasoline prices, but Wyoming really suffers," said John Kennedy, a leading independent here who is shutting down his 125 or so wells one by one. As job losses mount and tax revenues decline, he added, "It's just a disaster looking for a moment to happen."
In December, a state commission with six legislators and five citizens appointed by the Governor recommended introducing Wyoming's first personal income tax. "If it's not going to be an income tax, it's going to be some rather Draconian cuts in the services we have," said Shelby Gerking, a committee member who teaches economics at the University of Wyoming in Laramie.
Gillette itself, population about 17,000, is the capital of the Powder River Basin, the nation's largest producer of coal. Strip-mining is so mechanized, though, that oil remains a larger local employer.
The area, a rolling, windswept prairie of sagebrush and grasses, is not the Wyoming of Yellowstone and the Tetons. "There's not a lot to do unless you're involved in the oil or mining business," Mr. Fancher said. "And sometimes not even then."
Much of Wyoming, like California, has the disadvantage of producing crude that is heavy and sour, or high in sulfur. Higher refinery costs mean lower prices at the wellhead. Prices of lower-grade crudes have fallen even more than the higher grades because of imports, with some American refineries switching from domestic supplies to cheaper Mexican and Venezuelan ones.
With oil trading recently at about $11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Mr. Fancher was getting $4 or less -- or $1 to $3 below his replacement cost.
Shutting down a well is still a tough decision. It costs $2,000 or $3,000 initially and then up to $1,000 a month for maintenance and inspections, which sometimes require snowmobiles.
Mr. Fancher, rugged and jut-jawed at 59, is a petroleum engineer and the son of a petroleum engineering professor. He still speaks of his chosen career in almost religious terms. "I had a dream and a vision," he said, looking over more of his wells where the stoic bobbing of his pump jacks had been halted. "I got to know some of those independents who were students of my dad. I was inspired by the challenge and the rewards." A dry hole can cost a wildcatter hundreds of thousands of dollars, while in good times a strike can pay millions.
Mr. Fancher has his office in Denver, where strong telecommunications and cable industries are cushioning some cutbacks in energy. Aboard the narrow 19-seat turboprop to Gillette that Mr. Fancher calls "the cigar," he began to describe how he had as many as 16 employees in the early 1980's.
"You're selling yourself short," said Fred Ronanjenko, an oilfield mechanic in the next row back. "I remember when you were keeping 40 people working. You were keeping the trucking outfits going. You were keeping the rig units going."
Having recently let about five employees go, at least temporarily, Mr. Fancher expected to have only four or five left in January. He drilled no new wells in 1998. The Energy Department's national rig count fell to 734 in October from more than 1,000 at the end of 1997.
James J. Hladky, president of Cyclone Drilling, says Mr. Fancher is no different from his other customers. "This is the first time in the 23 years I've been in business where I haven't had a rig running in the Powder Basin," he said at the Village Inn diner here, where Mr. Fancher and others gather at dawn.
With a sound balance sheet, nearly three decades of experience and 30 wells that can produce about 1,500 barrels of oil -- more than 60,000 gallons -- a day, Mr. Fancher was 23d among the state's 700 or so producers in 1996. Though he is more vulnerable than some independents with billions in annual revenues, he has always considered himself more secure than the tens of thousands of "strippers," or mom-and-pop oil companies with wells that produce 10 barrels a day or less.
While the strippers have been closing down for years, today's low prices have put much larger producers at risk. "This truly is an emergency," said George M. Yates, chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, whose own company, in Roswell, N.M., has shut down about a quarter of its wells. "At these prices hardly anything in the lower 48 onshore is economical. There was a Washington Post story on the hardships in Russia and Indonesia because of low oil prices. Nobody seems to know we are the second-largest producing country right here."
The Energy Department is studying whether to aid the independents by purchasing more oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But the independents' other perennial aid proposals, like new import tariffs, usually run into the arguments that low energy prices strengthen the economy and please every motorist.
One solution, from when oil prices crashed in the 1930's, was to send the Texas Rangers into West Texas to enforce a shutdown. Now, Mr. Fancher said, only labor unions can get away with strikes. "If we suggest to someone else that we organize and shut things down, we get threatened with Government action," Mr. Fancher said. "So we've got to be careful how we say things."
Mr. Fancher was alluding to a West Texas oilman, John D. Bell, who planned a 10-day production halt beginning Dec. 23. Then a lawyer for the Independent Petroleum Association of America advised Mr. Bell that, unlike the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, he was subject to antitrust laws.
"If a producer from Kermit, Tex., makes 20 barrels a day and violates antitrust measures, how in the world can Exxon and Mobil merge?" Mr. Bell recently said. "That isn't an antitrust violation, yet John Bell from Kermit, Tex., is? That's wild."
To publicize the small producers' plight, Mr. Bell is organizing a Jan. 18 Starving Oil Workers March at the State Capitol in Austin.
Some large independents with plenty of cash, like the Apache Corporation of Houston, say low prices and big mergers might present buying opportunities. As Jay Beach, the general manager of Key Energy Services Rocky Mountain, explained at his office in Gillette: "An independent can get oil out of the ground so much more cheaply than a major. For every meeting an independent has, they have to have 10 meetings and a policy decision."
Natural gas interests have helped some other large independents remain healthy. But not companies like Pioneer Natural Resources, based near Dallas, which borrowed heavily for a poorly timed acquisition binge, and now has to sell off properties and lay off employees.
Mr. Fancher has had better times of his own, which have left a chunky gold Rolex, its dial and case encrusted with diamonds, on his wrist. While hardly deprived now, Mr. Fancher has kept his 1992 Lexus a few years longer than usual, and this winter there will be no exploration of Hawaiian or Caribbean beaches.
Asked whether his family understood, he nodded. He has given his children interests in his wells. "They can see their checks go down," he said. "I don't have to tell them what the situation is."
But whenever oilmen gather in Gillette these days, that situation dominates the discussion to the end. "Come up and see me sometime," said Jim Rodgers, an oilfield service provider and another partner in some Fancher properties, as he rose from Mr. Fancher's breakfast table. "Especially when you have some wells to drill."

HEADLINE: Facing 'a Century of Opportunity on the Horizon'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the second inaugural address that Gov. George E. Pataki gave yesterday in Albany:
 
On the Spirit of the State
There's a spirit in New York today, and it runs strong. 
 It's the same spirit of courage that prompted Colonial farmers to lay down their plows and take up arms to confront and conquer the forces of tyranny on a farm near Saratoga.
It's the same spirit of hope that inspired immigrants, like my grandparents, to leave their homelands and endure the seas, knowing that the shadow of adversity would give way to a light that glows from a beacon hand in New York Harbor.
It's the same spirit of liberty that drove New Yorkers like Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass to dedicate their lives to the pursuit of justice. . . .
Four years ago, seeking to renew that spirit, we charted a bold new course for this state, a course driven by our determination to see that government remains the people's servant and not their master. Now we must commit ourselves to taking the next bold step in the direction of New York's destiny, which -- as one New Yorker expressed it -- was to create an atmosphere that is "responsive to every need of the people, and to the highest demands of that spirit which drives us onward and upward."
That New Yorker was Gov. Theodore Roosevelt, and he spoke those words 100 years ago to this very day as he delivered his inaugural address to the people of this great state.
 
On the Future
As we march boldly into the next century, we will confront new challenges and new opportunities.
Our ability to meet those challenges and seize those opportunities requires only that we believe in ourselves and the capacity for greatness that lies within each and every New Yorker.
If we have the courage to believe that, and we do, then New York is going to lead America, not just into a new millennium, but into a new age of discovery, innovation and prosperity, into a future brighter than even the most glorious days of our past.
That is New York's destiny. Today, we renew our claim to it.
 
A Statement of Beliefs
Four years ago, we said: "Cut taxes and return economic freedom to working families and they will strengthen our economy." . . .
Four years ago, we said: "Rein in the long arm of government, and the men and women of our business community will create jobs." . . .
In four years, we have done well. We have rekindled the spirit of New York. And for that we can be proud. But the progress that guides our destiny has only just begun.
Six days from now, I will ask the Legislature to build on that progress by reaffirming our allegiance to deeply held, core principles.
We believe in people, not bureaucracy.
We believe in raising hopes, not taxes.
We believe in protecting the rights of victims, not the rights of criminals.
We believe in big opportunities, not big government. . . .
With a century of opportunity on the horizon, we the people of New York must light the way to a brighter future for the nation and the world.

HEADLINE: Pataki, Starting His 2d Term, Sees State as Model for Nation

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 1

 BODY:
George Elmer Pataki began his second term as Governor today by declaring that his success in scaling back government had rekindled New York's spirit, saying that the strides of the last four years showed that the state was ready to lead the nation into the next century.
"We the people of New York must light the way to a brighter future," Mr. Pataki said in a 14-minute inaugural address that often had the feel of a civic-minded pep talk. 
 Mr. Pataki, 53, a Republican who rose from a childhood on a Peekskill farm to become the state's 53d Governor, outlined no new proposals in the speech and did not refer to his ambitions beyond Albany, which have been the subject of growing speculation since he easily won re-election in November.
But the tirelessly upbeat oratory suggested he was honing a theme he plans to expound while traveling the country: that his brand of Republicanism -- fiscally conservative, with little emphasis on divisive social issues -- had worked in New York, and would work elsewhere.
"We charted a bold new course for this state," he said, "a course driven by our determination to see that government remains the people's servant and not their master."
As he often does, he referred to his idol, Theodore Roosevelt, who was inaugurated Governor of New York 100 years ago today. Mr. Pataki noted that both he and Roosevelt stood "at the edge of a new century, which is spread out before us like an undiscovered land of promise." Roosevelt also was the last New York Republican to win the Presidency.
Mr. Pataki has declined to say whether he will run for President next year, insisting only that he has not ruled it out and saying that as leader of a large state, he wants to help set his party's agenda. In recent weeks, he has uncharacteristically lashed out at the Republicans in Congress. He has asserted that they have damaged the party by neglecting core issues, like cutting taxes, in their zeal to impeach President Clinton.
A Presidential bid could prove daunting for Mr. Pataki, because while his support for abortion rights and views on other social issues play well in New York, they put him in conflict with the conservatives who hold sway in Republican Presidential primaries in other states.
Though he did not detail his agenda for his second term today, he plans to use his State of the State Message on Wednesday and his budget message later this month to announce new proposals. They will include a budget that is to be considerably more austere than his election-year one, which raised spending at more than the rate of inflation.
At the ceremony in the Convention Center here, Mr. Pataki took the oath of office from the state's Chief Judge, Judith S. Kaye, while a 19-gun salute resounded in the piercing cold outside. Earlier, Judge Kaye swore in the new Lieutenant Governor, Mary O. Donohue, a former judge and prosecutor from upstate New York, who was recruited by Mr. Pataki to replace Betsy McCaughey Ross. Mr. Pataki had a long falling-out with Ms. McCaughey Ross. After he removed her from the re-election ticket, she became a Democrat, lost the party primary and ran against Mr. Pataki in the general election on the Liberal Party line.
The State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, and the new Attorney General, Eliot L. Spitzer, also took their oaths of office today.
Besides starting his second term, Mr. Pataki is now the most prominent Republican in the state, replacing his mentor, United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who was defeated for re-election in November. Mr. D'Amato had anointed Mr. Pataki, then an obscure State Senator, as the party's nominee for governor in 1994.
The D'Amato defeat capped a disappointing election for the Republicans. Dennis C. Vacco was ousted as Attorney General by Mr. Spitzer, a wealthy former assistant district attorney from Manhattan, and the party failed to pick up seats in the Legislature, despite spending heavily. That showing tarnished Mr. Pataki's victory over the Democratic nominee, Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker.
Mr. D'Amato sat in the front row during the inaugural ceremony, two rows in front of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican who spurned Mr. Pataki and endorsed the three-term Democratic incumbent, Mario M. Cuomo, in 1994, only to return to the fold in last fall's election and campaign for Mr. Pataki. Mr. Giuliani also has national aspirations, but publicly, he and Mr. Pataki say they get along. Privately, there is no affection between their camps.
Mr. Pataki's relatively short address today had little in common with his first in 1995, when he cited his upset victory over Mr. Cuomo as evidence that the public was angry with the state's condition. He attacked a "paid and pampered bureaucracy," pledging a smaller government, new work requirements for welfare recipients and tough criminal justice laws, including the death penalty, which Mr. Cuomo had blocked. He returned briefly to these issues today when he noted that he had followed through on his promises.
The tone of the speech was not the only difference. The inauguration this year was short and restrained, with none of the exuberance of 1995, when the Republicans held a weekend of parties to celebrate winning the governor's mansion for the first time in 20 years. About 2,100 people attended the swearing-in today, down from 13,000 in 1995.
The financing of the 1995 events turned into a major controversy of Mr. Pataki's first term when he refused to disclose which companies had made large donations to pay the cost. He later released some information after a court battle with the Democrats who control the State Assembly.
Mr. Pataki's campaign, as well as Mr. McCall's and Mr. Spitzer's, paid for this year's events.
Today, in addition to the swearing-in, Mr. Pataki attended an inaugural Mass at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, next to the Capitol, and held a reception at a hotel, with tickets costing $80.
In his speech, Mr. Pataki made no mention of the contrasts with his first inaugural. Instead, he concentrated on the inspirational, repeatedly returning to the idea that under his stewardship, New York's potential was limitless.
"We will keep our state moving forward," he said, "with policies that continue to fuel the passion, unleash the power and tap the vast reserves of strength, creativity and determination of New York's greatest resource: the spirit of our people."

Independent Oil Companies Suffer During Weak Market
Independent oil producers in the United States and the small companies that provide services to them have been hurt by low prices and foreign competition more than giants like Exxon and Mobil. Enshrined in fable for his enterprise and daring, the oilman in jeans and boots is giving way to the oilman in a suit. 
 Except for huge oilfields far offshore or in Alaska's wilds, major oil companies consider most of the United States too expensive or played out to bother with. Page A1.
 
For the fourth quarter, the contract drillers and oil-service companies, which do everything from making drill bits to flying the helicopters used to transport offshore workers, are expected to post falling earnings for the second quarter in a row. As oil prices languish at the lowest levels in more than a decade, contractors are taking rigs out of service as rents slide. C2.
 
China to Announce Debt Plan
The Chinese Government will soon announce how it plans to cover the debts of the nation's second-biggest financial company, which it closed in October, and the news for foreign bankers is likely to be bad. China closed the financial arm of the company, the Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation, because it could not repay more than $2 billion of foreign debt. All told, Gitic, as the company is known, owes an estimated $10 billion to foreign banks. C4.
 
Preparing for Euro's Market Debut
One day after 11 European countries christened the euro as their new currency, financial institutions across the Continent began the enormous job of reprogramming their electronic networks before markets reopen for business on Monday morning. A5.
 
Surge in Hong Kong Real Estate
People in Hong Kong, from first-time buyers to the big development companies, have been trying to decide whether the strong housing sales of November were a sign that the worst recession in a generation is nearly over, or whether the market only found a false bottom and will continue to drop if the economy keeps contracting. Sales have been driven, in part, by falling interest rates. C3.
 
Insurers Expect Small Gains
The nation's property and casualty insurers are expected to report slim profit gains for the fourth quarter because competition has kept a lid on premiums. The group, including Allstate, CNA Financial and the St. Paul Companies, is expected to report an average earnings increase of only 1 percent for the quarter, far below the 28 percent gain for all of 1997. C2.
 
Windfall for E*Trade Employees
E*Trade Group Inc., the No. 2 on-line broker, reduced the exercise price on employee stock options two weeks after its stock traded at a 21-month low and began a three-month surge that increased its price sixfold. Employees who took advantage of the lower-priced options had total paper gains of more than $100 million by this week. C4.

The market for initial public offerings cooled drastically in 1998, down 15 percent, to $36.8 billion, compared with $43.2 billion in 1997. But without new Internet stocks, it would have been a lot worse. Of the issues brought last year, the percentage of new Internet stocks rose each quarter, to a peak of 27.7 percent in the final three months of the year. For all of 1998, Wall Street priced 44 new Internet deals, raising a total of $2.7 billion. Graph plots number of initial public offerings in 1998

Group Sees Mixed Trend In Giving by Protestants

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
In the recessionary years of the early 1990's, some Protestant denominations faced budget shortfalls and were forced to downsize, cutting back staff at the national levels.
Such developments prompted a concern among some religious authorities about those denominations' financial futures. But in recent days, one organization that studies patterns of giving among Protestants has reported positive news -- although with limitations. 
 An annual survey of giving by members of 29 Protestant denominations has found that what they are putting into the collection plate, when measured as a percentage of their per capita income, has grown slightly for three consecutive years after falling for most of the previous 10.
The survey, by Empty Tomb Inc., a nonprofit organization dedicated to "Christian service and research," says members of those denominations increased their giving to about 2.6 percent of their disposable income in 1996, the last year for which statistics are available, from about 2.5 percent in 1994.
"We're cautiously optimistic," said Sylvia Ronsvalle, executive vice president of the organization, which is based in Champaign, Ill.
But Mrs. Ronsvalle said she was concerned that the proportion of members' money earmarked for purposes outside the local church (that is, money for seminaries, missionary work and other causes), had continued to decline, even as overall giving had risen.
The denominations included in the survey range from mainline Protestant bodies like the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the United Church of Christ to more conservative, evangelical denominations, like the Church of the Nazarene and the Southern Baptist Convention. The denominations account for about 29 million members in more than 100,000 congregations.
On average, members of the denominations gave $538 each in 1996, out of a per capita income of $20,840, as measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a branch of the Commerce Department. Of the total given, $453 went to the local congregation to pay for budget items ranging from clergy members' salaries to the cost of utilities and to such in-house charitable activities as soup kitchens and food pantries.
Through denominational financial statistics, Empty Tomb has kept track of giving by Protestants since 1968 and has seen a fairly steady decline since then, measured against per capita income. In its surveys, the organization has reported that church members gave slightly more than 3.1 percent of their disposable income in 1968. That fell to slightly less than 2.5 percent in 1992 and 1993, the organization reported.
Mrs. Ronsvalle, whose husband, John, is president of the organization, said she was particularly concerned with the gradual decline in the proportion of giving to "benevolences," causes beyond the local congregation. By Empty Tomb's calculations, church members gave about seven-tenths of 1 percent of their per capita income to such causes in 1968, but that has fallen to four-tenths of 1 percent in the 1990's.
"If the church were helping church members integrate their faith, you would expect to see different patterns in the way they spend money," Mrs. Ronsvalle said.

Hooters Chain, a Hit Elsewhere, Falters in Manhattan

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
As if more evidence were needed that Manhattan is not really part of America, consider this: The Hooters here is bankrupt.
Hooters, for those who have never ventured west of Hoboken, is a popular and fast-growing chain of restaurants known almost entirely for their waitresses, whom the company calls Hooters Girls. This is not because they look like owls. 
 A little more than a year ago, the first Hooters in Manhattan opened in a prime tourist area, on 56th Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway, a block away from the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood. There was a bit of a splash at the time; David Letterman featured the new restaurant on his show, ordering chicken wings to go for his studio audience one night.
But in November, the restaurant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which means all the people to whom it owes more than a million dollars are on hold while the management tries to figure out how to stop the red ink. The restaurant is not closed, but it is in financial peril, losing something like $30,000 a month, according to court papers.
Exactly what went wrong? Richard Yudenfriend, the local businessman who owns this particular Hooters restaurant, is tight-lipped, to say the least. "We intend to be around for a long time, and are hopeful this is a temporary situation," he said last week, adding only that he did not think the Hooters "concept," as they say in the restaurant business, was wrong for New York.
Whether that is the case is arguable, considering the scantily clad -- or not clad at all -- competition nearby.
Of course, New York can be a tough town for anyone who wants to open a restaurant, no matter what the concept. Persnickety customers, temperamental chefs, high rents, lots of regulations, nettlesome neighbors and loads of competition make restaurants among the most frequent visitors to the bankruptcy court at Bowling Green.
As for chain restaurants, which offer middle-of-the-road food at middling prices, New York probably has fewer per capita than any other big city in the United States, industry experts say. Even some of the more expensive theme restaurants, like the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood, have been faring poorly here.
In the case of Hooters, court documents and interviews with people involved in the restaurant tell a tale that hits all of those New York hot buttons: sex, food, money and real estate (not necessarily in that order).
Start with sex -- Hooters does. It has fought off government efforts to force it to hire male waiters, arguing that feminine, er, pulchritude is crucial to its business plan. This seems to be working elsewhere: the chain now has 232 restaurants, including 18 that opened in the last year. It is the sixth largest "casual dining" chain in the country, according to Technomic Inc., a leading restaurant consulting company.
Hooters Girls wear scooped-neck tank tops, push-up bras, very short orange shorts, white socks and sneakers (and flesh-toned tights, but don't tell the guys). The company describes the ideal Hooters Girl as a "cheerleader, surfer girl next door," though the ones featured in the company's calendars look more like Miss February.
The waitresses at the Hooters in Manhattan, however, do not. They are pretty and pleasant, but more Jones Beach than "Baywatch." At lunchtime recently, a table of young men clearly enjoyed flirting with their waitress. (Hooters Girls make most of their money from tips, and are encouraged to sit down with customers and chat.) But the smirking men became slack-jawed only when one of the many televisions ran a video of very buxom babes in bikinis.
Of course, men who are mainly interested in seeing female flesh can see a lot more of it at Flash Dancers (Topless Entertainment), say, or Legz Diamond's (All Nude), both of which are mere blocks away down Broadway. But Edward Droste, one of the men who founded Hooters in Florida in the 1980's, said such places are not competitors. "Hooters has never crossed over into that kind of arena," he said, adding that the restaurant is "a little safe haven."
The place looks like a combination fern bar and fraternity house: the blond paneled walls are covered with beer signs, pinup posters and fake traffic signs bearing slogans like "Double Curves."
As befits a restaurant whose slogan is, "Delightfully tacky, yet unrefined," the menu is written in a hokey, jokey style, as if the author were simultaneously channeling Hugh Hefner and Walt Disney. It boasts about the food, especially the "nearly world famous" chicken wings.
But customers do not seem convinced. In a recent survey for the magazine Restaurants and Institutions, consumers ranked Hooters 78th out of 90 chains in quality of food. As for what New Yorkers think, well, here's the 1999 Zagat Survey review: " 'Look but don't touch' applies both to the skimpily costumed staff and to the fried chain grub at the recent cholesterol-and-Lycra import; it's 'everything you've heard and less.' "
Of course, food is not likely to be the primary draw for the men who frequent Hooters -- and they are almost entirely men. Michael McNeil, vice president for marketing at Hooters of America, based in Atlanta, reports that nationally, 70 percent of the customers at Hooters are men, though it depends on the location and time of day. (Some Hooters have a children's menu.)
In Manhattan, almost all of the customers appear to be local men in their 20's rather than tourists. On a recent evening, they streamed into the place, paying a $3 cover charge to watch the waitresses compete in a bikini contest.
At lunch, however, things seem a lot slower. While nearby restaurants like the Brooklyn Diner and the Redeye Grill were jammed on a recent Thursday, only 50 or so people rattled around in Hooters, which seats 250.
That presents a particular problem for such a place, restaurant experts suggest, because its costs are high and its revenues are relatively low. Most of its entrees go for less than $10, and it serves only beer and wine, not hard liquor, which is more profitable. In court papers, Mr. Yudenfriend estimated that the restaurant would take in about $140,000 in December.
Meanwhile, there is a big nut to cover: The rent is almost $30,000 a month. And, because it is a franchise -- locally owned but part of a chain -- the restaurant must also pay about $10,000 a month in royalties to the mother ship in Atlanta. And all of that is before the payroll, food, taxes, insurance and interest payments on its loans. Total costs for December, Mr. Yudenfriend estimated, would be almost $173,000.
"Most franchises are still a volume business," said Jeffrey L. Bradach, a professor at Harvard Business School who has written a book called "Franchise Organizations" (Harvard Business School Press, 1998), which focuses on restaurants. "Because they don't have huge margins, they need people moving through the doors every hour of the day."
But the most important thing for a franchise, Professor Bradach said, is to match the concept of the restaurant to the demographics of the area.
Child-towing tourists do not seem to be flocking to Hooters. As for the locals, well, New York's service economy is unusually mixed, in terms of men and women working together, said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "I don't want to be harsh," he said, "but there are too many successful women in New York for men to be public about this. No professional male can come home and say, 'I went to Hooters.' "
Hooters executives say that the biggest problem for the Manhattan restaurant has been its location. The entrance and awning are in a little courtyard on the north side of 56th Street, and its signs are not very visible to anyone driving down Broadway or Seventh Avenue.
The interior of the restaurant needed a lot of work, said Mr. Droste, the Hooters founder, and "the operator got very much involved." As a result, he said, Mr. Yudenfriend may not have concentrated on "the promotional aspect we are famous for."
Some of Mr. Yudenfriend's backers, however, suggest that he did not get as much support from the home office as he might have expected, given that the Manhattan restaurant was supposed to be Hooters' marquee property. While Mr. Yudenfriend did have experience running a Hooters -- he took over the one on Staten Island in 1996 -- Manhattan is clearly a different market (for starters, the local Corvette club is not likely to hold meetings in the parking lot).
He has suffered some recent setbacks, according to papers his lawyer filed in court early last month. A manager resigned unexpectedly, the document says, and "Mr. Yudenfriend was mugged outside the Manhattan restaurant in the early morning of Dec. 1."
If Hooters of America does pull Mr. Yudenfriend's franchise, as it has threatened to do, that will not be the end of the restaurant chain's efforts here, Mr. McNeil said, adding, "Ultimately, we believe Manhattan needs, wants and deserves a Hooters restaurant."
But desire may not be enough. Expanding a chain from Atlanta to Birmingham is one thing, said Ron Paul, president of Technomic, the restaurant consulting firm. But New York City, he said, is something else.
"Don't be offended, but we tell clients that it's like going into an international location, in terms of culture, real estate, laws," Mr. Paul said. "It's very high risk to go into Manhattan."

HEADLINE: CLINTON PROPOSES A BUDGET INCREASE FOR THE MILITARY

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 1

 BODY:
Heeding warnings from the nation's military chiefs, President Clinton has decided to propose the first real increase in the Pentagon's budget in nearly a decade and the largest since the cold-war buildup of the mid-1980's, Administration and defense officials said.
Mr. Clinton's proposal, only the first step in a drawn-out process with Congress, would reverse years of dwindling resources after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It would address growing strains, the officials said, caused by aging weapons and increasing operations overseas, from Bosnia to Iraq. 
 The proposal represents a significant political shift for Mr. Clinton. A Democrat who has often had an uneasy relationship with the military, he came into office in the wake of the cold war, focused more on his domestic initiatives than on the military.
But in the face of growing complaints about military readiness, both from within the military and from Republicans, Mr. Clinton was persuaded to seek an increase of more than $4 billion in the military budget for the fiscal year 2000 and about $100 billion over the next six years. That is the first increase, discounting inflation, since 1991, when spending spiked slightly for the Persian Gulf war.
Mr. Clinton is expected to announce the increase in his weekly radio address on Saturday, and the early word of his plans appeared to be an effort to blunt a growing chorus of mostly Republican critics who say he has let the military erode. It is unclear, however, how he would pay for his proposals, setting the stage for what is sure to be an intense fight with the new Congress over military spending.
In the budget he will submit to Congress a month from today, Mr. Clinton plans to propose increasing spending for the Department of Defense to nearly $269 billion, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
While that is a modest net increase of just under 2 percent after inflation, Mr. Clinton has also agreed to let the department keep another $8 billion freed up as a result of lower-than-expected inflation and fuel prices, money that would normally be returned to the Treasury, they said.
Taken together, the Pentagon would have $12 billion in new money for the fiscal year that begins in October to spend on new equipment, spare parts and raises for the nation's soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. Over the next six years, Mr. Clinton's budget would propose additional spending of just above $100 billion. That would represent the most significant rise in military spending since the buildup by President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980's, although it is only two-thirds of what the military chiefs had said they wanted in an ideal world.
Next week the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, and the chiefs of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps are scheduled to appear before the Senate Committee on Armed Services. When they last appeared before the committee in September, they faced unusually hostile questioning over the military's readiness problems from Republicans, who accused them of having sugar-coated issues like pilot shortages and training cuts in a similar appearance earlier in the year. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is considering a run for President in 2000, said then that the chiefs were "not candid to this member in the problems and challenges that we faced."
Despite strict spending caps set by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, many Republicans have called for much larger increases in the Pentagon's budget, accusing Mr. Clinton of having let the military become "hollow" and the generals and admirals of not blowing the whistle.
Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, a Republican who leads the Senate's subcommittee on military readiness, reacted strongly when asked about Mr. Clinton's plan to increase spending now, saying Mr. Clinton was belatedly trying to head off Republican criticism that he had skimped on the military.
"He's personally responsible for the defamation of our defense system and our hollow forces," the Senator said. "The President is going to try to make it look like he's a pro-defense President. It's an outrage."
Administration officials dismiss the accusations. In interviews this week, they said Mr. Clinton's proposals reflected the reality of today's military. The armed services are doing more -- from flying over Kosovo to bombing Iraq -- while the jets, ships and other equipment bought during President Reagan's buildup have become old and need replacing or at least spare parts.
The officials refused to say exactly how Mr. Clinton would propose paying for the increase in military spending. He has already vowed not to spend the recent Federal surplus until he and Congress agree on a way to shore up the Social Security system, which is lurching toward insolvency.
And the Balanced Budget Act has placed strict caps on total discretionary spending, requiring that any increases be offset by reductions elsewhere. Mr. Clinton could propose to pay for new military spending by cutting other domestic programs, although he has not done so in the past and seems unlikely to now.
Instead, the Administration is expected to find or create new pots of money that could be used for new increases. One Administration official said Mr. Clinton would call for increases in both military and domestic programs when he outlines his budget priorities, beginning with the State of the Union address later this month.
For much of the last year, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and the service chiefs have been steadily trying to build a case for an increase.
Even though no threat on the scale of the Soviet Union has emerged to challenge the United States' supremacy, they have argued that the declining or flat budgets since the Reagan years have left the country spending less on the military as a portion of the total Federal budget -- now just under 15 percent -- than at any other time since World War II.
When Mr. Cohen asked the chiefs to list their budget priorities, they came back with requests for personnel and equipment that totaled $148 billion over the next six years, which Mr. Cohen cut back to $112 billion. Negotiations with Mr. Clinton's budget aides have since whittled that down to the roughly $100 billion figure.
"It's still short of what we needed," one uniformed officer said.
Nevertheless, most Pentagon officials interviewed this week sounded pleased. One senior officer said the $12 billion in the coming fiscal year and more than $100 billion over six years would go a long way toward shoring up the areas of the budget under the most strain.
"Their most critical needs could be covered with something over 100 billion," the officer said.
Of the $12 billion, about $2.5 billion would pay for raises and improved retirement benefits that Mr. Cohen and General Shelton announced last month. They have called for an across-the-board 4.4 percent raise for each of the nation's nearly 1.4 million troops. They have also proposed giving targeted raises for thousands of mid-career officers and noncommissioned officers, those most likely to be tempted away from service by a robust economy.
Another $2 billion would pay for the peacekeeping force in Bosnia, where 6,900 American troops are now serving. In previous budgets, the Administration has paid for that mission, now three years old, with "emergency" spending.
The rest of next year's increase would be divided among the four services and pay for a variety of things, including increased maintenance on bases, spare parts for aging trucks, ships and airplanes, and more fuel and munitions to use in training. There is also new money for recruiting and still more bonuses for Air Force and Navy pilots being aggressively courted by commercial airlines.
Only a small bit of the proposed increase in 2000 would pay for expensive new weapons, the officials said. But in future years, most of the increases would pay for this "modernization." The Air Force would be able to buy more of its new F-22 fighters, the Navy to build new ships and the Army to pay for new Comanche attack helicopters.
"This is not absolutely everything the services need," a Pentagon official said. "I think it meets more of them than not, though, and certainly the most high-priority needs."
But other officials in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill raised concerns. One official said it seemed that the Administration was committing itself to increases in the future -- after Mr. Clinton leaves office -- without yet identifying the way to pay for them. That could leave the Pentagon short of money down the road or saddle the Federal budget with new deficits.
"How that happens and we stay within the balanced-budget agreement is the difficulty in the whole process," said another Pentagon official, who was closely involved in shaping the budget. "I'm not sure I even know how they do that."

HEADLINE: Nature Ceded the Missouri to Man; Now Some Would Give It Back

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: NEBRASKA CITY, Neb.

 BODY:
Lewis and Clark would not know the Missouri River now.
The tumultuous water that taunted their canoes as they forged the way to the American West is docile now, domesticated. 
 The "confused jumble of savage-looking snags" that Mark Twain steered his steamboat through is now slick and sanitized. There is little left of the muddy water that Horace Greeley once said was like "thick milk porridge -- you could not discern an egg in a glass of it."
For 50 years now, the hand of man has tamed the Missouri River, damming it and diking it, choking off chutes and oxbows, streamlining and straitjacketing it into a channel for barges and a generally well-behaved feeding tube for the fertile farmland on its banks.
But big changes are coming to the Big Muddy. America's longest river, nearly 2,500 miles stretching from Three Forks, Mont., to St. Louis, is in the throes of an identity crisis.
After the withering drought of the late 1980's and the ferocious floods of 1993, the United States Army corps of Engineers, which essentially controls the river's flow, decided that it needed to re-evaluate its master plan.
The fracas over the river's future is fierce as environmental groups, farmers, barge operators, recreation boosters, hydroelectric utilities, Indian tribes and municipal leaders all try to make sure the river stays -- or becomes -- what they want it to be.
"Everybody would dearly love if we could come up with a recommendation that everyone could agree on," said Richard H. Opper, executive director of the Missouri River Basin Association, a coalition of the eight river-basin states and two dozen Indian tribes, which met to discuss the river in December.
Caught in the middle is the corps, which controls how much water is released from upstream reservoirs after each year's snow melt -- and when. It has the sometimes Sisyphean task of insuring there is enough water when and where needed, but not so much that it mutinies its banks.
The corps has issued a list of alternatives -- ways to adjust the ebb and flow of the Missouri -- aiming to make a decision later this year.
And that has unleashed a torrent of debate.
"I was saying for years there are really two things that the corps could not propose politically," Mr. Opper said. "One was keeping the current situation the same. The other was any sort of change."
Here in Nebraska City, an unpretentious, plain-vanilla Plains town about 400 miles upriver from where the Missouri dumps into the Mississippi just north of St. Louis, most of the conflicts are easy to see.
Farmers like John Crook, growing corn and soybeans on river-bottom land his great-grandfather staked out in 1878, want the Missouri to be even more reined in so their crops will not drown.
People like Ray Pinney, who manages the barge terminal here, want the water to stay swift and deep so towboats and barges can keep hauling fertilizer up from St. Louis and Kansas City and taking grain downriver at harvest time.
Chad Smith, who represents the environmental group American Rivers in this part of the country, and Gerald Mestl, a biologist with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, want the river to return, as much as possible, to its natural, free-flowing state. Decades of man-made management have destroyed miles of natural habitat, threatening the survival of many species and landing three -- the pallid sturgeon, the piping plover and the least tern -- on the endangered species list.
And Nancy Hoch, who heads the economic development corporation in this town of about 7,000 people, supports farming and business interests. But like leaders in other cities that once used the river as an industrial dumping ground, she also understands environmental concerns. After all, Nebraska City's claim to fame is as the home of the inventor of Arbor Day, and Ms. Hoch is promoting a Lewis and Clark interpretive center planned for 2004, the 200th anniversary of the explorers' Missouri River bonanza.
"I feel very strongly that the river does not belong to anyone," Ms. Hoch said. "It does not belong to the least tern. It does not belong to barge traffic. We need to balance the river."
But balance is hard to come by on a river that sculptures the country's midsection, draining about a sixth of the United States.
Farther north of Nebraska City, a booming hunting, fishing and boating industry wants to insure that the reservoirs do not lose too much water each year.
And up and down the Missouri are Indian tribes that have begun to assert claims to water rights along significant portions of the river, supported by a turn-of-the-century Supreme Court ruling. When they ultimately negotiate which water they will control, the tribes say they will use it for everything from irrigation to electricity to exporting it for sale.
"There's so many interests in the Missouri River Basin," said Richard Bad Moccasin, executive director of the tribes' organization, Mni Sose Intertribal Water Rights Coalition ("Mni" means "water" in the Lakota language, and "Sose," Mr. Bad Moccasin said, means "the way the Missouri used to be -- murky and muddy and wild and woolly.")
"I don't envy the Army Corps," Mr. Bad Moccasin said, "but, well, they created the monster -- trying to change that mighty Missouri."
Fifty years ago, concerned that the river would overrun some of the nation's richest farmland -- and eager for a public works project to employ the veterans of World War II -- the corps erected six dams on the Missouri, with reservoirs to hold the snow melt from South Dakota to Montana. Farther downstream, it narrowed a wide bramble of sandbars and side-channels into a single manicured canal with fast, deep water to satisfy towboats and barges plying between Sioux City and St. Louis. Dikes and levees were rigged up too, keeping the river in check and holding back the runoff that once muddied its waters.
"Some people," Mr. Opper said, "say it more closely resembles a plumbing system rather than a natural river."
The voices of those who say that have become stronger in recent years. Environmental groups, distressed that the loss of about a half-million acres of the river's habitat has threatened or endangered a fifth of the plant and animal species in and around the river, have been pressing for substantial changes.
Initially, American Rivers proposed ending all commercial navigation, saying it paled in economic significance to the river's environmental and recreational value. When that caused a firestorm of anger, the group suggested the corps change its policy of releasing a constant amount of water from the spring through the fall and instead release more water in the spring and less in the summer. That would create a "spring rise," which would act as a kind of aphrodisiac to fish, and in the summer would encourage the formation of sandbars, where birds like to nest.
To the navigation industry, that is a grave threat. It would ground barges and towboats when the river was low in the summer. While the Missouri's barge traffic has never been heavy and has diminished in the last 20 years -- the corps says 2 million tons of cargo a year travel on the Missouri compared with over 100 million tons on the Mississippi -- industry officials say it is important because it forces railroads to set competitive shipping prices.
Paul J. Werner, a vice president with American Waterways Operators, the barge industry trade association, said keeping the Missouri's water levels consistently high was also crucial for insuring the Mississippi River had enough water for navigation.
"The people that are suggesting that the only answer to the right hand's problem is to cut off the left," Mr. Werner said, "I think they are part of the problem."
Farmers, for their part, worry that a spring rise could cause flooding or make it impossible to drain fields in time for planting.
"If it's too wet to get a crop planted by the first of June, you're not farming this year," said Mr. Crook, who like many farmers here is reeling from the loss of some crops in recent years because wet weather has made the river unusually high.
Of course, weather anomalies like that have made the corps' choice even harder.
"The river changes and you need to change with it," said John Remus, a corps hydraulic engineer, standing on a riverbank near Nebraska City. "We're not going to be able to be as highhanded as we once were. We're going to have to listen to other people."
Mr. Opper, who in the last year has managed, with the help of professional mediators, to get sworn enemies to at least acknowledge one another's claims to the river, hopes the pressure of the corps' coming decision and the responsibilities imposed by the Endangered Species Act will force the groups to reach a consensus, even though "it will be a recommendation that nobody is completely happy with."
But one recent change on the river has so far not angered too many people.
The corps has begun buying up parcels of farmland along the banks, grafting them on to the river and converting them into wetlands that re-create a little bit of the old Missouri. The environmental groups approve, even if they consider it a drop in the bucket. And most navigators and farmers are not complaining, since the wetlands are walled off with rocks so they do not disturb the flow and depth of the main river channel.
The first of these, Hamburg Bend, created in 1996 just south of Nebraska City, is a chute carved from land so damaged by the 1993 flood that it became practically unfarmable.
On a recent tour in a flat-bottomed skiff, as a bald eagle and a blue heron flapped by, Mr. Mestl of the Game and Parks Commission pointed out the sandbars, slower, shallower water and tapered natural banks that attracted wildlife, including the speckled chub, the plains minnow and the catfish.
"Lewis and Clark called the Missouri a catfish river," Mr. Mestl said. And even though the wetlands are small consolation for environmentalists, he said, at least "people are starting to catch fish here."

HEADLINE: In City of Castro's Triumph, Most Still Back Him

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Jan. 1

 BODY:
It has been 40 years since Fidel Castro led his rebels into this seaside colonial city and declared the end of the Batista dictatorship from the balcony of city hall. For residents here, it has been 40 years of Communist rule, economic sacrifice and endless maneuvering in a cold war with the United States.
But as the city prepared for Mr. Castro's return tonight to give a speech commemorating the anniversary of the revolution, it was hard to find anyone on the streets here who would openly criticize the 72-year-old Cuban leader or his policies. 
 The town was dressed in propaganda. Cuban flags flew from balconies, and signs celebrating the "triumph of the revolution" could be seen in all the shop windows. "To be Cuban is a privilege and a pact with Fidel," one sign said.
In his speech here, President Castro described the moment of victory on Jan. 1, 1959, saying that "I felt for a moment a strange sense of emptiness" to leave behind the "hard, pure and healthy" life of a guerrilla to take over the leadership of Cuba.
"The people I lead are not the same people of that January first," he said, noting that 7 million of Cuba's 11 million inhabitants were born after the revolution. He said he was "not exactly the same man of that day, either."
But he said he still thought the same way and predicted that the capitalist system would fall. Referring to financial speculators, he said, "They have turned the planet into a giant casino."
In interviews earlier, several working-class people and veterans of the rebel army said they still supported Mr. Castro's long experiment with socialism, despite the economic hardships they have had to endure. Even with the economy in tatters, many said they have more opportunity now than they did before 1959, when a good education was out of reach for most poor people, especially those with black skin. Mr. Castro's supporters also blame the United States trade embargo and not the Castro Government for their economic woes.
"The blockade is a crime against Cuba -- Cubans never deserved this," said Ibrahim Salazar, a 63-year-old retired bus driver, who was waiting with friends near the main plaza where workers were setting the stage for Mr. Castro's speech.
He wore a frayed T-shirt commemorating the revolution's 30th anniversary. Mr. Salazar said he believed the revolution's major goals, like free education and health care, had been met. His son had become an engineer, something unthinkable for poor people 40 years ago.
"We can't lose faith," he said. "We have problems, but we are going to conquer them."
But others, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the country's economic fabric had been slowly unraveling since 1991, when Russia stopped subsidizing the economy with more than $4 billion in aid. Since then, Cuba has become a country where doctors make less than $30 a month and must moonlight as cab drivers for tourists to make ends meet and where some educated women with professional skills choose prostitution at resort hotels. The average monthly salary is 207 pesos, or about $10.
It is also a country that more than 1 million people have fled since Mr. Castro took over. Just last year, more than 450,000 applied for visas to the United States.
"This is a sort of Titanic," said a one resident of Santiago, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared arrest. "Everyone is trying to get a boat to leave."
He added: "The system doesn't work. At this moment money is the principle problem for everyone here. You need money to survive."
After four decades of Mr. Castro's socialist experiment, Cuba has become a paradox. With free education and health care, it has the highest literacy rate and the lowest infant mortality rate in Latin America. The average life expectancy is now 75.3 years, far above the 60 years in 1959. The number of university graduates per capita has quadrupled, and Cuban doctors have broken new ground in biotechnology and vaccines.
Yet Mr. Castro has failed to break the dependency on the sugar crop and tourism for hard-currency earnings -- twin factors that were blamed before the revolution for making Cuba an economic vassal of the United States. And the country is no more democratic than it was under Fulgencio Batista, the dictator who fled on Jan. 1, 1959.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Mr. Castro has reluctantly undertaken some market-oriented reforms. He has legalized the dollar and allowed some small-scale private business. He has also decentralized some of the state-owned industries.
But professionals like doctors, who continue to work are not doing it for the money.
"The living is not much, but we manage," said Dr. Juan Fernandez, a general practitioner, who says he makes about $30 a month. "I like my profession, and I'm dedicated to my work."
To his supporters, Mr. Castro remains the best hope for working-class people in Cuba. Even if he is an autocrat, several said, he is their autocrat, looking out for their interests.
Part of his appeal is rooted in history and nostalgia. Some of the older residents remember the New Year's Day morning in 1959 when Mr. Castro and his troops marched into town and announced the end of Mr. Batista's rule. There was jubilation in the streets, people singing and cheering for the end of the regime, which had used increasingly repressive measures in an effort to stanch the rebellion.
"We have lived through many assassinations, many tortures, and the life was impossible here," recalled Rafael Guillen, an accountant. "When Fidel came, it was as if we had been in great pain and someone had given us a painkiller."
"The new generation who didn't live through it cannot understand it," he added.
Others continue to support Mr. Castro because he has advanced equality for blacks and women. Fermin Reynoso, a 40-year-old driver, who is black, said that before Mr. Castro's takeover, blacks never had a chance of rising in society. Racism was pervasive then, he said.
But under Mr. Castro, Mr. Reynoso could have a military career. He served for nine years, fighting in Angola and Ethiopia, and retired as a lieutenant. Now he has a relatively good job, and his children have a chance at a college degree.
"The socialist system has given a lot of opportunities to all the blacks here," he said.
Rolando Segui, 83, is typical of many of the older people here who still support Mr. Castro. Like his father before him, Mr. Segui was a butcher in the 1950's.
"I had to become a butcher because there was no other work," he said. "I never had the opportunity to study."
He joined the rebellion, the July 26 Movement, and after Mr. Castro's victory, was rewarded with government jobs, first as a health inspector and later a housing inspector. He retired 10 years ago. Mr. Segui says he is still optimistic about the future. The abject poverty, illiteracy and sickness he witnessed in his youth no longer exists. Most important, he said, his grandchildren have a chance of rising in society.
"This is what we fought for," he said. "If you want to be a doctor, and you have the capacity to be a doctor, you can be a doctor."

Premier Denies Opposing Trial for 2 Khmer Rouge
Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia angrily denied opposing a trial for two high-ranking Khmer Rouge defectors. He also said he supported an investigation into the mass killings when the group controlled Cambodia in the 1970's. Responding to criticism for his statement that the defectors should be met with bouquets rather than handcuffs, Mr. Hun Sen said his first priority had been to secure peace and that the question of trials was the next order of business. A Khmer Rouge spokesman said any trial of Khmer Rouge leaders for the deaths of more than a million people between 1975 and 1979 should also include an examination of the American bombing of Cambodia during the Indochina war.

Cuba Celebrates the Revolution
Fidel Castro commemorated the 40th anniversary of the Cuban revolution with a speech in which he admitted that while he is "not exactly the same man" who led his guerrillas to victory, he still thought the same way, and he predicted that the capitalist system would fall. In interviews in the streets of Santiago de Cuba earlier in the day, it was hard to find anyone who would openly criticize the 72-year-old leader or his policies. A3

Pope John Paul II declared that the defense of human dignity forms the foundation of world peace, and he urged a rededication to the respect of individual human dignity at the end of a century often marked by its violation in war and violence. But he also noted that the century would be remembered for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by the infant United Nations in 1948. A4
 
Gearing Up for the Euro
Financial institutions across the Continent began the enormous job of reprogramming their electronic networks before markets reopen on Monday, to handle the conversion to the euro as the new currency for 11 European countries. A5
 
Many investors are looking forward to the debut of the euro in major financial markets, believing that the planned changes from adopting a single monetary policy for much of Europe will offer opportunities to profit for years to come. A5
 
Deadly Avalanche in Canada
An avalanche swept down on a New Year's celebration in an Inuit village in northern Quebec, killing at least 9 people and injuring 25 as it smashed through a wall, the police said. The toll could have been much worse. More than 400 people were at the event, in a school gym in the village, which is 950 miles northeast of Montreal. A6

President to Propose Boost in Pentagon Budget
President Clinton, responding to warnings from the nation's military chiefs, will propose the first real increase in the Pentagon's budget in nearly a decade and the largest since the cold war buildup of the mid-1980's, Administration and military officials said. Mr. Clinton will ask Congress to approve an increase of more than $4 billion in the military budget for the 2000 fiscal year and a rise of about $100 billion over the next six years. He is expected to announce the increase today. A1

President and Hillary Rodham Clinton fielded questions for more than hour on New Year's Eve at the annual Renaissance Weekend in South Carolina. None involved Mr. Clinton's impeachment. To some guests at the retreat, the Clintons appeared solemn and far less spirited and engaged than in the past. The President did not attend any seminars, preferring to play golf and spend time on the beach with his dog. A8
 
Fund-Raising Charges Pared
A Federal judge in Washington has dismissed much of the case against a Thai woman who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Democratic Party in the period leading up to the 1996 elections.

Gambling on a Name
Speculators are buying the rights to Internet addresses that they believe potential Presidential candidates may want. Each registration costs $70, but the speculators hope a campaign -- or a campaign's opponent -- will pay many times that to buy the name back. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is the most popular among the speculators, with at least 39 variations of his name registered. A7

HEADLINE: THE NEW EUROPE: United and Divided;
Shiny, Prosperous 'Euroland' Has Some Cracks in Facade

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: AACHEN, Germany

 BODY:
Europe has two faces, light and dark, and they are evident on Germany's western and eastern borders as the continent crowns four decades of integration with the adoption of a single currency, the euro.
Here in Aachen, which lay in ruins in 1945, borders have ceased to exist. It has become usual for people who work in this western German city to live in Belgium and play a weekly tennis match in the Netherlands. The sweet whiff of prosperity seeps from Italian shoe stores, Spanish tapas bars, French croissanteries and English pottery shops that line the pedestrian shopping areas on all sides of the borders. 
 "This used to be a border city, but no longer," said Hans Poth, a spokesman for the Aachen town council who lives in Belgium. "And once we have the euro, the last barriers will disappear."
But a few hundred miles to the east, in Gorlitz, crumbling facades testify to decades of Communist rule. The town is split into two halves, as it has been since 1945 when eastern districts fell into Poland as European borders were rearranged after World War II. A single bridge, clogged by long lines of traffic, links the German and Polish parts.
While Aachen's melting borders symbolize the growing unity of Western Europe, Gorlitz underlines the continuing division of the continent.
Rolf Karbaum, mayor of the German part of Gorlitz, gazed out over a disjointed vista of baroque homes built centuries ago by German burghers and apartment blocks left by Polish Communists. "Now we want to be one city again," he said. "But for that, we need Poland in the European Union and the euro as our currency on both sides of the river."
Aided by the United States, postwar Europe has risen from the ruins of 1945 and overcome seemingly perennial rivalries through a bold vision of union that has brought prosperity and peace to regions plagued for centuries by instability and bloodshed. The euro, a single currency for 290 million people that may in time challenge the dollar, symbolizes a colossal achievement.
Yet it falls short of the original vision of a federal Europe with a single currency at its heart. Through its 20-year gestation, the euro appears to have shifted from a political ideal to a more prosaic economic tool.
Europe, for the foreseeable future, seems set to remain a hybrid beast, using English as its lingua franca, running its monetary policy through a federal institution -- the European Central Bank in Frankfurt -- while control of most other instruments of government, including budgets, remains at the national level.
Whether such an arrangement -- a new experiment in historical terms -- is workable remains unclear. Projected slower European growth in 1999, dragged down by slumps in Asia and Latin America, will place added strain on the euro's inception.
Beyond the economics loom larger questions. With the Cold War's glue now gone, will the trans-Atlantic bond that buttressed European growth remain firm as "Euroland" takes form?
The 11 nations joining the euro have abandoned an important part of their sovereignty to the European Central Bank. That probably will dispose them toward finding multilateral solutions to world problems, while a wholly sovereign America may choose -- as recently in Iraq -- to take a unilateral view of its interests.
And does Europe still have the vitality and drive to overcome the many remaining divisions between its capitalist and former Communist halves, to fulfill Mr. Karbaum's wish of making his wounded Gorlitz whole again?
Voicing a sentiment common in France, which acutely feels an end-of-millennium intellectual malaise, Arnaud Jacomet, a French defense official, considers Europe "a tired continent, in late middle age, looking only for a comfortable retirement, with the United States as its eternal protector." In this vision, Europe may be content to rest on its laurels, leaving the formerly Communist, still impoverished states in its east on the outside looking in.
The 11 nations that have adopted the new currency carry formidable economic heft. They represent about 18 percent of the world's total output and account for about 20 percent of its exports. After the United States, Europe will be the world's second-largest trading area with a single currency.
The euro, if it is successful, will provide enhanced European capital markets, easier comparison of prices, improved competitiveness, convenience and the kind of stability that resisted any European contagion from Asian or South American crises in 1998.
Already, the tough fiscal and other criteria set for qualification for the euro have drawn countries like Spain, Italy and Portugal toward a low-inflation prosperity they have never previously known. The euro, and the 15-nation European Union in general, have amounted to a beneficent magnet.
Some day, many economists believe, the euro may even rival the dollar as a reserve currency, obliging the United States to abandon a central assumption: that its deficits will always be financed because the world wants dollars.
Norway, for example, is certain to take payment for oil exported to its European neighbors in euros rather than dollars, because it imports principally from European countries. Eastern European exporters may do the same.
"Taking a three-year view, the euro will present a serious challenge to the dollar," said David Hale, chief economist for the Chicago-based Zurich Group. "America may have to rethink its view of itself."
But challenging America in the ether of world financial markets is far from creating the unified political entity imagined by the founding fathers of European Union and very far from any European emancipation from American military tutelage.
 
The Dream
From War's Ashes, A Single Future
For generations, ever since Churchill spoke in 1946 of uniting Europe in "the sharing of its common inheritance" and Jean Monnet of France laid the first foundation stones of integration, many Europeans have dreamed of unity. Yet just as the euro is being introduced, the idea of Europe may have lost its galvanizing appeal.
A difficult decade in Europe has taken a heavy toll on the European ideal. Slow growth and high unemployment -- more than 10 percent in Germany, more than 11 percent in France -- have been widely equated with the budgetary rigors imposed as preparation for the new currency. In many places, Brussels has become a dirty word.
Although East Europeans still talk constantly of "joining Europe," seeing in this mantra the age-old vision that European unity could banish the continent's demons and bring peace, "Europe" has little or no resonance for the millions of young West Europeans touched by unemployment. No new, forward-looking message has been found to take its place.
Indeed the very words "idea" and "Europe" seem strangely paired because intellectual vitality appears to have migrated elsewhere, and with it the forces now changing the world.
Yves Thibault de Silguy is the European Union's top monetary official and an ardent promoter of the euro. For this energetic Frenchman, a Paris-to-Potsdam, Berlin-to-Barcelona currency may eventually make the nations that have opted to join "Euroland" more stable and robust.
But European patriotism -- hearts thumping, even stirring, before Europe's blue-and-gold flag? Forget it. A quick expansion eastward to embrace formerly communist Mitteleuropa? Not likely.
"We can never be an American melting pot, even with a single currency," Mr. de Silguy said. "People here are firmly attached to national ideas. They like to live in a big, open European market, but within their own language and culture. As for expansion eastward, we need to wait. You have to be a realist."
Such realism, however, is new at European headquarters. A few years ago, the dismissal of a United States of Europe -- especially by a Frenchman -- would have been viewed as Thatcherite Europhobia. For decades, the 15-nation European Union progressed precisely by being unrealistic. It embraced far-fetched dreams, like a single currency, and somehow staggered toward them.
But now, the boldness of a postwar European generation driven by the desire to banish bloodshed from the continent has given way to the pragmatism of a more pampered generation for whom America is at least as resonant as Europe.
This shift of ambition suggests that Europe will long remain what Norbert Walter, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank, calls "an economic giant and a political dwarf." While challenging American supremacy on the currency markets, the dwarf will still desire -- even require -- American military protection and, in times of crisis such as recent Balkan conflicts, strategic leadership.
"Nobody buys the federalist model in Brussels any more," said Andrew Moravcsik of Harvard's Center for European Studies. "As governments have started looking beyond the euro, at harmonizing foreign and defense policy, even at a common tax policy, they have seen that public opinion is just not with them."
In this climate, Mr. de Silguy and other officials said, the euro will not propel Europe toward political unity -- a common foreign and defense policy, a European army, the federal European government long seen by France as the best escape from American domination of Europe and by Germany as a refuge from a troublesome national identity.
"Right now, a shared defense, security and foreign policy looks unrealistic to me," Mr. de Silguy said.
In its absence, America, through NATO, will continue to bear the chief burden of Europe's defense. But already, debates on the future of the Alliance have been marked by differences over how "global" NATO should become and whether, as Europeans now argue, the organization should be bound in its missions by the United Nations Security Council.
Still, for now the alliance of interests binding Europe and the United States since the end of World War II has held. The success of this joint undertaking -- European integration under the umbrella of American security guarantees -- is evident in Aachen.
 
The Reality
A Hybrid Approach To Hard Problems
Once home to Charlemagne, who governed much of Western Europe from here in the 9th century, including modern France and Germany, Aachen was long disadvantaged by the proximity of the Belgian and Dutch borders -- barriers to trade and economic development that were as cumbersome as today's German-Polish border at Gorlitz.
But now, on the German-Dutch border, a unique project has begun. Called "Avantis," it is a 100-acre trans-border industrial zone that literally straddles the frontier. Dutch and German mail boxes, red and yellow, have already been placed side by side in an act of playful symbolism.
The project is complicated because Dutch and German taxes and regulations are different. But it is intended to feed off Aachen's renowned university of technology and engineering to create between 7,000 and 12,000 jobs in the high-tech sector. A brochure describes the project as a "European Science and Business Park" set in a "win-win situation."
That, in many ways, is a good summary of Europe today: A German-Dutch cross-border project with an English name and American jargon. Areas of prosperity in places long prone to instability abound. Alsace-Lorraine, and the French-Spanish border region between Perpignan and Barcelona are other examples.
"Peace and freedom are now taken for granted," said Jurgen Linden, the mayor of Aachen. "So we have to show our citizens that Europe has advantages by creating jobs in projects like these. With the euro, we can work on both sides of a border."
Not everyone is convinced. In the streets of Maastricht, the Dutch town where European leaders decided in 1991 to tear down trade barriers and adopt a single currency, Elisabeth Lubbers, a housewife, said the people of Europe were still different, and its nations too diverse, to accept the euro. "There will be trouble," she said, "and with Germany you never know."
That sentiment is not uncommon in Britain and has contributed to keeping the country out of the euro for now. Among the 18 million unemployed in Europe and the continent's "new poor," resentment against Europe is often virulent.
 
The Doubts
Nagging Suspicions About Path to Take
For most Europeans -- a clear majority, according to polls -- the euro is now seen as a logical extension of a successful experiment. What is not clear is whether the will exists to reach out from the relative comfort of today's western European society to take that experiment decisively further.
Some ideas do exist: the nomination of a "High Representative" to coordinate European foreign and security policy; a passage to majority voting on more European issues, seen as essential if Europe is not to become too unwieldy; a possible integration of the Western European Union, Europe's largely dormant defense arm, into the formal structures of the European Union.
But such steps -- known as "deepening" -- are controversial, because they may imply further compromises on national sovereignty.
They may also prove difficult because Germany and France, long the motors of European integration, have discovered other priorities. Germany has been absorbed with its costly unification and, of late, with an attempt to step out from the shadow of its past.
"Of course, we are all for a strengthening of Europe, but we no longer feel this is a historical obligation," said Bodo Hombach, minister of State at the Germany chancellery. "We want Europe, but not because we have to."
In practice, the new government of Social Democrats and Greens led by Gerhard Schroder has adopted almost Thatcherite tones in demanding a reduction in its huge contribution to the European budget. It has also suggested that candidates for European Union membership -- including Poland -- may have to wait a long time.
Across the Rhine, French politicians have been made acutely aware of the enduring appeal of nationalist slogans by the success of the National Front, and disgruntlement over unemployment has made any ringing appeals for united European governance tantamount to political suicide.
Until Europe works out these internal problems, it will not reach out to address the pressing needs of Gorlitz and all the once-Communist countries on its eastern flank. Already, with unemployment running at 21 percent in the area, many Germans complain about Poles coming to work illegally in Gorlitz.
"It took generations to resolve the French-German problem, and here tensions with Poland have been compounded by almost 50 years of Communism," said Mr. Karbaum, the Gorlitz mayor. "But this is an artificial border, and we have to overcome it, just as on Germany's western side."
Jreneusz Aniszkiewicz, the deputy mayor of Zgorzelec, as the Polish side of the town is known, agreed: "The economy can resolve everything today," he said.
The two men have a project: to rebuild Gorlitz's old bridge, destroyed by Allied bombing in 1945. But six years of negotiation have so far failed to resolve various difficulties and the two banks of the River Neisse -- no more than 30 yards apart -- remain unbridged in the center of town. The one existing bridge is on the outskirts.
"It is not easy," Mr. Karbaum said. "Young Germans say to me, we have no work, no hope, nothing to do, and you want to spend millions of euros on a bridge."

MAN FROM BABEL
By Eugene Jolas.
Edited by Andreas Kramer
and Rainer Rumold.
326 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $30. 
 "For the most part we were not interested in social problems, in economics or in any particular political complex. . . . We were the Romantics of the 20th century." So wrote Eugene Jolas of the cosmopolitan literary and artistic world he inhabited, observed and contributed to in the Paris of the 1920's.
Given the legacy of World War I and the tensions building in Europe at the time, the comment sounds arrogant and insular. Jolas seems nostalgic, not apologetic, about a period of willful blindness. Yet while it is true that nostalgia informs many moments in this memoir of an extraordinary life in an extraordinary time, Jolas was anything but a blind participant in events of the first half of the 20th century. The statement is a typically honest recollection by a person who did not forget the past or sentimentalize the future, but who by disposition, personal history and profession was an acute recorder of moods and events in rapidly shifting times.
Eugene Jolas was born in Union City, N.J., in 1894 of a German mother and a French father from Alsace-Lorraine. His parents returned to their native town of Forbach when Jolas was still an infant. He was raised in a bilingual family, educated in German at Roman Catholic schools and surrounded by French-speaking neighbors. Nothing in his eventful life seems to have marked him more than this early experience of a cultural and political border tense with instability and burdened by a history of conflicting allegiances and ideals. Even after he immigrated to America (he was a citizen by birth), he continued to associate the word "frontier" with a complex and fateful inheritance from the past rather than with opportunity and hope for the future.
Jolas returned to the United States at 15, lived with relatives and took odd jobs as a messenger in New York City. Despite low pay and hard living, he loved the variety and bustle of the city. Instead of two languages, he heard dozens. He relished the accents and atmosphere of Hell's Kitchen, Chinatown, Flatbush and Prospect Park. When he heard the story of another immigrant boy, Joseph Pulitzer, he decided to be a newspaperman. He wandered from city to city taking any tasks a paper would offer, and between jobs he slept on park benches, sharing hunger and stories with others out of work. There is something Dreiseresque in the cold chaotic whirl of Jolas's American city at the turn of the century, but there is nothing of Dreiser in Jolas's outlook. He sounds more like the Artful Dodger. Where others might fall into despair, he inevitably finds reason for hope and even a kind of irrepressible cheerfulness.
His first serious job was with a German-language newspaper in Pittsburgh. The teen-ager arrived hungry and alone in what at the time must have been one of America's least appealing cities: "I arrived in Pittsburgh on a cold, snowy February evening. The tall chimneys of the steel mills and glass factories pierced the sky. Blast furnaces belched soot and smoke. I felt exhilarated by the lurid cosmos, the cloudy world of industry, grandiose and Dantesque."
Since Jolas began writing his memoirs in the 30's and continued through World War II, it is possible that the older man casts a golden haze over the hardships of his youth. Still, his capacity not only for survival but also for taking genuine pleasure in the unexpected shifts of fate that might have defeated a more fragile psyche seems to have remained with him throughout his life. It is a trait that helped make him one of the outstanding journalists of his day and may have prevented his brooding American-French-German philosophical poetry from possessing the originality and authenticity of his English prose.
The writing, even in this unfinished memoir, will strike any reader. Jolas began dictating chapters to his wife, Maria, in the late 30's or early 40's and continued intermittently until his death in 1952. It was in the 1980's that Maria brought these papers to the attention of the editors of "Man From Babel," Andreas Kramer and Rainer Rumold.
Whatever else he was doing, Jolas also found time to write verse. His memoir is punctuated by samples of it. Strongly influenced by the German Romantics and the French avant-garde, as well as by Whitman and Hart Crane, he longed to universalize his incurable homesickness -- for Europe when he was in America, for America when he was in Europe -- and consequently his restless need to keep moving, which he considered "an immigrant neurosis." He was obsessed by language, and, like many of his generation, he borrowed Freudian terminology to label if not explain his inner conflicts, including the linguistic ones between the literary and the idiomatic, French and German, American slang and standard English. "Language became a neurosis," he writes at the outset as if to alert us to the pathology that will provide consistency to a life divided between continents and interrupted by two world wars.
If language was his neurosis, he turns it -- much as he did the sidewalks of New York, the smokestacks of Pittsburgh, the bordellos of Savannah -- to his advantage as a reporter. In the 20's he found himself writing for the Paris edition of The Chicago Tribune. He seemed to be everywhere in Paris at once -- in the right hotel lobby for the entrance of Gloria Swanson, in the right bar to overhear drunken conversations of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, in the right park to see Ernest Hemingway take his son for a walk: "He usually wore workman's clothes and was always most careful to avoid being taken for a literary man. . . . He seemed to have a preference for intermingling his vocabulary with strong four-letter words. Frequently, however, these gave the impression of being carefully calculated."
But Jolas was more than a literary gossip columnist. He was deeply interested in the esthetic avant-garde of the 20's; he was a defender of Dadaism and Surrealism and of any effort to break language and the arts away from the cliches of conventional light entertainment. Not long after his arrival in Paris, he was asked to take over from Ford Madox Ford the writing of The Tribune's literary column, "Rambles Through Literary Paris." During interviews and by attending readings, he met everyone -- James Joyce, Francois Mauriac, Andre Breton, Gertrude Stein, Sinclair Lewis, Andre Gide -- and quickly became not only an observer but an actor in the Paris scene.
His most important and influential contribution to the literary life of the times was his founding and editing of Transition, a journal dedicated to the publication of avant-garde works and, of equal importance to the trilingual Jolas, the exposure between the same covers of Continental, American and British experiments in language. In a manifesto published in the third issue in 1927, Jolas expressed himself with characteristic expansiveness: "We need new words, new abstractions, new hieroglyphics, new symbols, new myths."
One of the closest and most important of his many literary friends was Joyce, with whom Jolas shared a nostalgia for an impossible homeland and a fascination with the meeting and mingling of alien languages. Jolas became a defender of Joyce's radical linguistic experiments and published excerpts of "Work in Progress" (early fragments of "Finnegans Wake") in Transition. But he also came to know a side of Joyce few outside his closest circle of friends would ever see. He saw the lover of Italian opera; the introverted celebrity who refused to be interviewed but who could talk and sing into the night with those he trusted; the aloof literary giant who wished readers would be more appreciative of his humor (and said, "in riso veritas"); the grieving father tormented by his daughter's mental illness. Like all good reporters, Jolas could capture a personality in a moment and a phrase. Recalling an evening with Joyce in a Parisian restaurant, he noticed at a nearby table Picasso, Breton and Jacques Prevert. "Informed of their presence, Joyce did not look up."
Though Jolas's English was supple and fluent, some of his most pointed vignettes depend on what he considered untranslatable expressions. Whenever the French printer of "Work in Progress" heard that Joyce was about to send in yet another addition or correction, he threw up his hands and shouted, "Joyce, alors!" -- so often that it became for him all one name. When the Paris police booked several writers for an unruly clash between the Romantics and the Surrealists, Jolas loved the fact that the official charge was bagarre entre intellectuels. At the end of World War II, when Jolas was in Germany working for the Office of War Information, he encountered two Jewish brothers who had lost their father in Dachau; he quotes but deliberately does not translate their words to him: "Wir mochten nach Israel auswandern."
A gain and again, Jolas reveals not only his sharp eye and ready ear for a good story but also his sensitivity to human suffering and injustice. Having cheerfully rejected politics in the avant-garde carnival of literary Paris in the 20's, he, unlike many others of the time, did not lurch toward Fascism or Communism in the 30's. His experience of America had imprinted on him democratic longings and a tolerance for difference that he eventually saw to be in conflict with the idealized nationalism and racism of the German Romantic poets he had once so admired. When he returned to the frontier land of his parents to help establish a free press in postwar Germany, he faced not only the devastation of people, landscape and language but also a past poetic self that had been deaf to what the mature journalist took to be chillingly clear. "I found a definite predilection among the Romantics for the totalitarian state, for anti-Semitism and for . . . Pan-Germanic dementia."
It would be too simple to say that in Jolas's conflicted life the American journalist triumphed over the German poet, the modernist over the Romantic, the practical good-humored survivor over the melancholy dreamer. Outwardly this all seems to be true. Yet the poetry of abstract angst continued to be written. And there was a private, inner life -- marriage, children, his complex relationship to Roman Catholicism -- that is barely touched on in this action-packed memoir. Like so many modern expatriates, Jolas took on many attributes of a new world without ever letting go of the old. Finding Forbach, his ancestral home, in ruins in 1945, he wrote: "I realized that throughout my wandering life I had been in constant flight from this land of restless frontier-shifting. . . . And yet in the American world something had continued to live in me that was part of this medieval night."

 BODY:

THE HAUNTED WOOD
Soviet Espionage in America --
the Stalin Era.
By Allen Weinstein and
Alexander Vassiliev.
Illustrated. 402 pp. New York:
Random House. $30. 
 In December 1948, the legendary broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow went on the air to deplore the death of Laurence Duggan, a former State Department official seemingly hounded to suicide by the Communist-hunting House Un-American Activities Committee, whose members included Representative Richard M. Nixon. Murrow's outrage might have been tempered if he had possessed the information about Duggan that is revealed in "The Haunted Wood," by Allen Weinstein, the founder of the Center for Democracy in Washington and Moscow, and Aleksandr Vassiliev, a journalist and a K.G.B. alumnus.
While once-unimaginable collaborations among writers from opposing trenches in the cold war are not all that uncommon today, this work has a special power. During a two-year window of opportunity (or of lowered guard), Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, the successor to the Soviet Union's K.G.B., allowed the authors access to thousands of secret documents from the Stalin era. Much of what they found is not new -- and yet it is.
The experience of reading "The Haunted Wood" is rather like looking into the new edition of a book from which half the pages had previously been torn out. What emerges most sharply is proof of the guilt of certain Americans whose spying for the Soviet Union has been the subject of debate for over half a century. Laurence Duggan, for example, may have been driven to suicide by the HUAC Red hunters; but one document the authors unearthed in Moscow reveals how a Soviet defector was murdered to protect the identity of Duggan, whose espionage "take" in the 1930's occasionally went directly to Stalin.
Similarly with Alger Hiss. For decades, the truth about the Hiss-Whittaker Chambers case had been obscured by its symbolism. To both liberals and conservatives, as Weinstein and Vassiliev put it, "the protagonists assumed the status of icons in the demonologies and hagiographies of their opposing camps." In an earlier work, "Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case" (1978), Weinstein, possessing far less evidence than is now available, traced his odyssey from believing in Hiss's innocence to accepting his guilt as a Soviet agent. Now the most die-hard Hiss apologist will find it daunting to explain away a document the authors discovered in the K.G.B. files revealing that Hiss and his ring were awarded Soviet decorations for providing military information going back to 1935.
Indeed, the book consists in great part of swatches of actual quotation from the files of the K.G.B. and its predecessors during what the authors call the "golden age" of Soviet espionage (1933-45). The files document Soviet spying by Representative Samuel Dickstein of New York, so greedy that his handlers gave him the code name "Crook." The material from the file on Martha Dodd, the daughter of the American Ambassador to Germany in the 1930's, reads better than most spy thrillers: the beautiful and reckless Dodd, known socially to President and Mrs. Roosevelt, gave her all, sleeping with Nazis or whoever could provide useful intelligence to her Soviet spymasters.
Michael Straight, a wealthy American blue blood recruited for Soviet espionage at Cambridge University along with Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess, Harold (Kim) Philby and Anthony Blunt, went directly to an unwitting Roosevelt for help in wrangling a job that would position him conveniently for Soviet spying. Serving in America's own World War II intelligence agency, the Office of Strategic Services, and close to its chief, William J. (Wild Bill) Donovan, was Duncan Lee, a descendant of Gen. Robert E. Lee, and another Soviet recruit. Lee always denied the charge, yet a K.G.B. file reveals a Soviet agent boasting of Lee's value as a source, noting that all O.S.S. intelligence "from Europe and the rest of the world . . . comes through his hands." Still another file documents the Soviets' strategy to tap Lauchlin Currie, a top Roosevelt White House aide who became a source of intelligence to Moscow.
None of the foregoing names are new to accusations of espionage. But in the past many escaped opprobrium, shielded by the notion that they were victims of anti-Communist hysteria. The Weinstein-Vassiliev discoveries in the archives of the opposition camp tear away that shield.
All the above penetrations, however, pale before the all-time Soviet espionage triumph, the piercing of America's most zealously guarded secret of the war, the development of the atomic bomb -- fittingly code-named "Enormoz" by the Soviets. The activities of Klaus Fuchs, Harry Gold, David Greenglass, the Rosenbergs and many others have long been chronicled. What is new here is the view of their manipulation from the Soviet side and evidence of even deeper penetration of the Manhattan Project than previously suspected.
The authors found in the archives of the K.G.B. a virtual hemorrhage of Allied atomic secrets. An anonymous donor left a bundle of top secrets practically on the doorstep of the Soviet Consulate in New York. A still-unidentified "Tina," a Communist working for a British firm, revealed to the Soviets the metals used to make the bomb. "Fogel," the code name for an American who was never caught or identified, delivered to his controller plans for plants and equipment employed to construct the bomb. Another document reveals Soviet paranoia, with Moscow prodding its agents in the United States to work harder because the Americans intended "to maintain a complete monopoly on 'Enormoz' and to use the atomic bomb for aggressive purposes against us."
The K.G.B. archives further detail Moscow's nearly total control and orchestration of the failed worldwide public relations campaign to save Julius and Ethel Rosenberg from the electric chair for passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. And the authors' probing in Moscow finally lays to rest long-bruited suspicions about the loyalty of the scientific chief of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer. Files they found suggest that he was a "secret member" of the American Communist Party, and make clear that he was indeed a target of Soviet operatives -- Oppenheimer "represents a very large interest for us." Yet Weinstein and Vassiliev uncovered no shred of evidence that he ever spied for the Soviet Union.
The hardest part of these revelations to accept, at least for those of us who deplored the overzealous Red-hunting of the late 40's and early 50's, is that the hunt rested on more substance than we cared to admit, the phony posturing of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy aside. Still, one question lingers. What prompted so many privileged American intellectuals -- a Hiss, a Duggan, a Straight -- to become seemingly mesmerized servants of an authoritarian spy service? "Soviet intelligence files," the authors conclude, "document the mixture of accidental encounters, underlying ideological beliefs, romantic antifascist views and Soviet persistence." One finishes "The Haunted Wood" with a sense that the romantic antifascism, coupled with a romanticized Communism, produced a potent political narcotic. To be an economist for the Farm Security Administration might lack glamour, but to toil for the F.S.A. and also to be a spy! Now there was excitement, heightened by membership in "an elite . . . secretive club fighting for a noble ideal."
Of course, critics may charge that it is all a fraud. Could not the Russians have fabricated incriminating documents and then fed them to eager researchers? But to what end? Why would Russian intelligence operatives have concocted and buried these files until only the impossible-to-predict collapse of the Soviet Union brought them to light? Further supporting the validity of the documents is the fact that many of the messages in the K.G.B. archive were matched by the authors against outgoing messages that the Soviets radioed from the United States to Moscow during the war, transmissions intercepted and broken through an American code-cracking triumph called Venona.
It has been said that all World War II histories written before the revelation of Ultra, the British success in breaking German codes, are incomplete. The work of Weinstein, Vassiliev and their colleagues mining the Soviet lode begins to approach the significance of an Ultra. Histories of Soviet-American relations written without benefit of Soviet secret files now available are, to some degree, books with missing pages.

HEADLINE: Science Fiction

BYLINE: By Gerald Jonas 

 BODY:
Religion has always been a problem for science fiction writers. While they are occupationally biased toward rationality, their stock in trade is imagining plausible futures -- and no speculation about future societies can be complete without considering the evolution of current belief systems or the advent of entirely new religions. Yet few writers have taken this challenge seriously. When religion has not served merely as a symbol of irrational reaction, it has usually figured as window dressing -- a few hints of altered rituals or creeds to remind the reader that this is indeed "the future." Among the memorable exceptions: Walter M. Miller Jr.'s "Canticle for Leibowitz," James Blish's "Case of Conscience," Frank Herbert's "Dune" series, Gene Wolfe's multivolume "Book of the New Sun." Add to these Octavia E. Butler's PARABLE OF THE TALENTS (Seven Stories, $24.95), which continues and deepens the story she began five years ago in "Parable of the Sower."
Once again, the protagonist is Lauren Oya Olamina, a 21st-century prophet, born, she believes, to bring a new kind of truth to troubled times. Reeling from environmental, political, financial and military blows, American society is just barely surviving in the opening years of the next millennium. The revelation that Olamina feels called upon to share can be summed up in two sentences: "God is Change" and "The Destiny of Earthseed is to take root among the stars." "Earthseed" refers both to her new faith and to the small circle of believers she assembles through the force of her personality and her writings, which consist of aphoristic verses that couch revolutionary thoughts in deceptively simple words. 
 Butler's narrative skills are impressive. We follow the rise and fall of Earthseed's first communal home through a chorus of voices that jump around in time, giving us contrasting perspectives on the heartbreaking events that test the faith and will of the founding mother, her family and her adherents. Most remarkably, the ideas they espouse -- at the risk of their freedom and even their lives -- are presented with the respect they deserve. The tenets of Earthseed arise from a thought-provoking collaboration between the scientific and religious imaginations. As the founder's husband notes, "Olamina believes in a god that does not in the least love her." Conceding that Earthseed "isn't a very comforting belief system," Olamina achieves prophetic stature by insisting that in the long run the true test of a religion is whether the solace it offers conforms with the nature of the universe we live in.
Despite its provocative title, PLAYING GOD (Aspect/Warner, $22), by Sarah Zettel, disappoints, because the author fails to take her stated theme seriously enough. In two previous novels, "Reclamation" and "Fool's War," Zettel ranged across time and space with the bracing confidence of a latter-day Asimov or Heinlein. In "Playing God," she focuses on the fate of a single planet and, paradoxically, loses her way.
In a not-so-distant future, human beings have averted the destruction of the earth by splintering into competitive but mutually respectful political and economic entities called enclaves. A species of warlike aliens on a distant world has not been so lucky: after nearly destroying their ecosystem with biological and nuclear weapons, they find that their only hope for survival is a worldwide makeover proposed by Bioverse Incorporated Enclave. The project involves temporarily evacuating 1.3 billion aliens to giant orbiting spaceships, followed by "full-scale bioremediation efforts to clean the planet up after two centuries of extremely dirty warfare." As if that were not difficult enough, the aliens suffer "massive anaphylactic reactions" from close contact with humans, so attempts to keep the mutually murderous clans from killing each other on the spaceships must be supervised from afar.
The humans who devote themselves to this project must respect the alien culture while containing the aggressive tendencies inherent in it. I wish I could report that Zettel successfully dramatizes this problem. Unfortunately, she allows the situation to deteriorate into open conflict, which she then describes in prose that lacks the snap and conviction of her earlier books. Despite page after page of dutifully detailed description, I never got a clear picture of the aliens or their society. Even worse, I did not much care what happened to the humans whose efforts to "play god" give way, in the end, to all-too-predictable melodrama.
If you are unfamiliar with the work of Paul J. McAuley, his new collection of stories, THE INVISIBLE COUNTRY (Eos/Avon, paper, $13.50), provides a useful introduction to this engaging writer. The title story, set in a grim near-future London, is told in a noirish style that might be characterized as "bio-punk." A former professional biologist, McAuley conjures a world ravaged by global warming and a breakdown in social order exacerbated by the easy availability of intrusive biotechnology. In a convincing demonstration of his stylistic sleight of hand, he transmutes this nightmarish vision into a dream of utopia right under the reader's nose, so to speak.
Four of the nine stories in this collection evoke a future (also encountered in McAuley's novel "Fairyland") in which "dolls," gene-engineered humanoid creatures, serve as all-purpose slaves. By coming at this painful subject from the point of view of society's human outcasts, McAuley avoids the twin traps of facile moralizing and maudlin sentiment. Another story, "Recording Angel," shares setting and theme with McAuley's recent novel "Child of the River" and casts some light on the confusing background of that work, the first in a promised trilogy.
When I was 10 years old, I read a book entitled "Tom Swift and His Electric Elephant Gun." I can still remember the thrill generated by the technological wonder of a superweapon that allowed Tom to subdue a ponderous pachyderm without actually killing it. A similar sense of wonder animates the recent crop of computer-driven techno-thrillers, of which THE TERMINATION NODE (Del Rey/Ballantine, $24), by Lois H. Gresh and Robert Weinberg, is a suitably breathless example.
An evil mastermind is killing off computer hackers faster than you can say "delete." Only the skills of a superhacker, Judy Carmody, known to her on-line friends as "TerMight," can save the day -- not to mention the billions of dollars of electronic bank deposits about to vanish forever at the click of a mouse.
I would not venture a guess about whether this Internet-savvy collaboration will stir feelings of wonder in today's young readers. I can only report that the book's series of brutal murders raised not so much as a hair on the back of my neck, since the authors failed to breathe life into these victims before they were dispatched.

HEADLINE: Shaw in New York

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Garrison Keillor's review of "Writing New York" (Dec. 13), my colleague Phillip Lopate's omnium-gatherum of the reaction of writers -- both American and others, like the Englishman Stephen Graham -- to the city of New York, omits one extraordinary assessment by a British visitor of Irish extraction through the eyes of an equally eminent American on the literary scene. The stage is set by Edmund Wilson, who writes of the historic visit of George Bernard Shaw to New York in the depths of the Depression. Wilson's essay in The New Republic of April 26, 1933, recounts Shaw's address to a crowd of 3,500 at the old Metropolitan Opera House on April 11. Wilson describes in detail how "the straight black figure diminishes: It stands at the bottom of a gulf -- the immense well of the Metropolitan with its ugly and stale magnificence: the heavy tarnished gold of the proscenium arch, the gilt boxes lined with red plush and embellished with electric bulbs. . . . Tier upon tier of boxes drop down; balcony upon balcony. The tall slim figure behind the pulpit is all but drowned at the bottom." 
 But Shaw had another take on the splendor of the Met and the opulence of the crowd. Speaking, as he usually did, from his Socialist point of view, he finally came out with this conviction: "The splendor of this building had blinded me to the fact that the majority of my audience apparently belong to the unemployed." His remarks were greeted with a burst of applause from the highest balcony. He could not have known, Wilson concludes, that it was not the majority of the audience but a handful of radicals in the gallery, where the seats were only a dollar, who broke into spontaneous applause at his utterance.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Miami

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO; MIREYA NAVARRO is Miami bureau chief of The Times.

 BODY:
Miami, which is registering ever-increasing numbers of visitors, is undergoing a building boom that sometimes makes the area look like a giant construction site. Visitors will find new and renovated terminals at Miami International Airport and the Port of Miami, numerous restored hotels and other expansions.
In downtown Miami, a new arena for the Miami Heat pro basketball team is going up and expected to be completed by early 2000, by which time the National Basketball Association labor impasse may be over. After a renaissance of restored Art Deco hotels, Miami Beach last month welcomed the 800-room Loews Miami Beach Hotel. Not far away, the first convention hotel with African-American majority ownership, the 422-room Royal Palm Crowne Plaza Resort, is expected to be complete by January 2000. 
 These hotels could help Miami-Dade County capture some of the convention business that now goes to cities like Orlando. Others, including the Fontainebleau Hilton Resort and Towers, are undergoing multimillion-dollar face lifts.
A free shuttle service, the Electrowave, now operates along Washington Avenue in Miami Beach's South Beach section late into the night to transport revelers among hotels, restaurants and bars.
Visitors will also find a new annoyance throughout Miami: having to dial the 305 area code for local calls. To add to the confusion, the caller will not reach the intended party if a 1 is dialed first.
The big event this month, of course, is the return of the Super Bowl to Pro Player Stadium. The last Super Bowl held here, in 1995, brought 142,000 visitors (even though the stadium seats only 75,000 for the game) and more than $176 million, an economic bonanza that officials expect to be repeated or exceeded this year.
 
Events
Super Bowl XXXIII will kick off at Pro Player Stadium, 2269 Northwest 199th Street, on Jan. 31 at about 6:20 P.M. Tickets are sold out. (Some are allocated to National Football League teams, which distribute them, by lottery for example, to season ticket holders.) But plenty of activities surround the event. From Jan. 22 to 24, the west side parking area at Pro Player Stadium turns into an interactive theme park, with games, card shows and displays and National Football League stars. Tickets, $15 for adults and $10 for children under 12, are available through Ticketmaster, (305) 358-5885.
From Jan. 29 to 31, there will be free concerts, football memorabilia displays and interactive games that test football skills at Bayfront Park in downtown Miami from 11 A.M. until midnight. Information: Bayfront Park, (305) 358-7550. And also between Jan. 29 to 31 in Miami Beach, N.F.L. stars will mingle with fans at an N.F.L. Players Party on Ocean Drive between 20th and 22d Streets. Tickets are $12; a three-day pass is $25. For tickets: Ticketmaster, (305) 358-5885.
Visitors can step back to 15th-century Italy at an Italian Renaissance Festival from March 18 to 21, which will bring entertainment, an international food court and more than 200 costumed characters to the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, 3251 South Miami Avenue in Miami; (305) 250-9133, extension 3. Hours are 9:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $12, $6 ages 6 to 12. There is an extra charge of $3, $1 for children, to visit the sprawling mansion at the edge of Biscayne Bay, fashioned after the villas of the Veneto, and it is worth it.
Cowboys from around the country will converge at the 50th annual Homestead Championship Rodeo Feb. 5 to 7 at the Doc Demilly Rodeo Arena at Harris Field at the intersection of Highway 1 and Southwest 312th Street in Homestead. Seven championship events, including bull riding and steer wrestling, will be featured, and a parade is scheduled for Feb. 6 at 11 A.M. along Krome Avenue in Homestead. Tickets are $10 to $12, and $4 and $5 for children. Information: (305) 247-3515; on the Internet: www.homesteadrodeo .com.
Art Deco Weekend, Jan. 15 to 18 along Ocean Drive between 5th and 15th Streets in Miami Beach, (305) 672-2014, is an annual celebration of artifacts and antiques along the oceanfront strip of restaurants and bars in the Art Deco district. The event, for which the theme this year is Art Deco and Sports, features big band music and a children's play area between 10th and 12th Streets in Lummus Park. It runs from noon to 11 P.M. Jan. 15; 10 A.M. to 11 P.M. Jan. 16 and 17, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. on Jan. 18. The lecture schedule includes "Worldwide Origins of Art Deco" on Jan. 16 at noon and Art Deco architecture in Miami Beach on Jan. 17 at 1 P.M., both in the Ocean Front Auditorium. Admission is free. There will also be an Art Deco film festival Jan. 11 to 18.
The Nationsbank Coconut Grove Arts Festival Feb. 13 to 15 at South Bayshore Drive and McFarlane Road in Miami, (305) 447-0401, annually attracts more than 300 fine arts and crafts vendors, and you can browse amid a wide selection of food and music. Free admission.
From March 5 to 14, Miami celebrates its Hispanic heritage with a carnival that culminates with a 23-blocklong party known as the Calle Ocho Festival on March 14. Salsa bands spread out along Southwest 8th Street between 4th and 27th Avenues in Miami's Little Havana. Other events will include an eight-kilo meter run on March 5; a street festival in Coral Gables on March 7; a cooking contest on March 9, and a golf tournament on March 11 at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables. Information: (305) 644-8888.

HEADLINE: Don't Drive Without 'Roo Bars'

BYLINE: By TODD WOODY; TODD WOODY reports on the economics of the Internet for The Industry Standard.

 BODY:
WE first heard about Ningaloo on a balmy November evening after a day of swimming with bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, off Western Australia's outback coast, north of Perth.
Chatting with a local marine biologist as the sun disappeared into the Indian Ocean, my wife, Sarah, and I mentioned that we would be heading back to Perth the next morning. No, the biologist urged, don't leave without visiting Ningaloo Marine Park, a vast coral reef off the Northwest Cape, also known as the Cape Range Peninsula, some 300 miles to the north. The snorkeling, diving and marine life, he said, rivals that of the Great Barrier Reef, and the onshore Cape Range National Park is a wildlife wonderland, where kangaroos forage on white-sand beaches and the rare black-footed rock wallaby lives in granite outcrops. 
 Intrigued, we studied our well-worn map. After driving 1,000 miles from Albany, on the south coast, what was a few hundred more? We were on the second leg of a trek around Sarah's native land and we had grown to love the red, red earth and blue skies of Western Australia's northwest coast, where our distance from civilization could be measured in the rising price of gasoline and water.
The state of Western Australia is more than a quarter the size of the United States but has just 1.4 million residents, 90 percent of them in or near Perth, the capital. "This, mate, is the real Australia." my father-in-law is fond of telling me.
It didn't take long for us to reach a decision: we extended our rental car agreement and hit the road for Exmouth, the cape's main outpost and the gateway to Ningaloo. Exmouth sprang into existence in 1967 to serve an Australian-American naval communications base, the Harold E. Holt Naval Communication Station. Thanks to the cold war and the peninsula's isolated locale, the cape remained more or less undiscovered for decades. Most guidebooks devote only a line or two to Ningaloo and many Australians -- even in Western Australia -- confess that they have never heard of the place. When the base's operations were cut way back in the early 1990's, local residents turned to eco-tourism to keep Exmouth from becoming a ghost town.
The ghosts seemed to be winning as we rolled into the town of 2,400 on a blazing and breezy morning and turned into the Potshot Hotel Resort's nearly empty parking lot. (In Australia, just about every vacation accommodation, from backpacker camps to five-star hotels, calls itself a resort.)
Exmouth, on the windswept northeastern edge of the cape, was built for utility, not charm, and lodgings there tend to run toward the prosaic -- a place to rest one's head and refuel between adventures at the Ningaloo and Cape Range parks. After the rather surreal experience a few weeks earlier of taking in the ancient spirituality of Uluru (Ayers Rock) in the company of hundreds of foreign tourists bussed in from a nearby upscale resort, the simplicity of Exmouth was a relief.
Our comfortable two-bedroom apartment at the Potshot included a kitchen and patio with a barbecue. There were two big leather chairs and a dining room table in the living room. The bathroom had a shower and a utility sink for washing clothes and rinsing off snorkeling gear. The complex also has a pool, a hot tub and a restaurant.
We usually ate our meals at the apartment since most restaurants in Exmouth offer basic Aussie fish-and-chips fare. But food wasn't the point; there aren't many places in the world where you can go out to lunch and watch an emu -- a large, ostrichlike bird -- amble down the street.
We dropped off our belongings at the Potshot and drove to the tourist bureau a few blocks away. We had three things we wanted to do during our three-day stay: snorkel, see the endangered black-footed rock wallaby and watch the giant sea turtles lay their eggs. The tourist bureau representative, a young woman named Michelle, quickly arranged these activities while giving us the inside scoop on eco-tours.
Directing us toward a diving store, she bade us farewell with a piece of advice: don't drive at night. We would soon find out why.
We picked up snorkeling gear and a map of the best snorkeling areas at the Coral Coast Dive shop on the Harold E. Holt naval base. The facility, on the outskirts of town, is named for the Australian Prime Minister who mysteriously disappeared in 1967 while swimming in the ocean off Melbourne. With the cold war's end, parts of the base have been leased to businesses and some of the barracks now house backpackers.
Mornings are best for snorkeling -- the late afternoon winds make the ocean choppy -- and the next day we set off to explore Ningaloo Marine Park. We drove around the tip of the peninsula -- passing the huge transmitter towers built for the military that rise incongruously as much as 1,200 feet over the shore -- and into the 125,000-acre Cape Range National Park, about 15 miles to the south.
It is a stark and stunning landscape. The red earth and gray-green bush of the cape sweep into pearl-white sand dunes overlooking the aquamarine waters of the Indian Ocean. Emus grazed among the grasses, and red and gray kangaroos bounded across the range. As we walked on to Lakeside beach, a light gray kangaroo called a euro watched us from atop a sand dune, its ears swiveling like radar dishes.
The abundance of wildlife was the reason for Michelle's warning against night driving. Kangaroos are mainly nocturnal and a collision with one can be fatal. Hence, even a family station wagon looks like something out of a Mad Max movie, equipped with thick steel "roo bars" and high-intensity spotlights. We, on the other hand, were driving a tinny Ford Festiva, no match for a six-foot-tall great red kangaroo. Getting home by sunset seemed a good idea.
But those thoughts were far from our minds as we donned our snorkeling gear on an empty beach. We could see the main part of the reef, which runs 161 miles along the west coast of the cape, about 500 feet offshore. (In contrast, reaching the Great Barrier Reef can involve a 20-to-50-mile boat ride.)
After wading into the warm water, we only had to swim a few yards before we found ourselves hovering over magnificent coral gardens and "bombies" -- collections of coral encrusted rocks sheltering an incandescent array of blue, green and orange fish. Sea turtles glided by and manta rays skimmed the ocean floor.
Poking our heads out of the water, we noted that we were utterly alone. We found the same seclusion at other snorkeling spots along the peninsula.
Divers and snorkelers who venture out to Ningaloo's main reef may be rewarded with sightings of dolphins as well as dugongs -- marine mammals that are cousins of the South Florida manatee. Between March and May the star attraction is the giant whale shark, a gentle, plankton-eating fish that can grow to more than 50 feet.
At midday we returned to the Potshot to rest up for our turtle-watching expedition that evening. Between September and April the giant sea turtles come ashore to dig their nests and lay hundreds of eggs. At twilight, Les Player, the owner of Exmouth Eco Tours, and his 8-year-old son, Matthew, pulled up in a Toyota Land Cruiser, luxury transportation after our jolting journeys in the Ford Festiva. We picked up a British tourist at the naval base hostel, then drove toward Cape Range National Park. Les turned onto an unmarked dirt track and headed toward the beach. Turtle watching is a competitive business and guides fiercely guard the locations of their best viewing spots. Les told us to make ourselves comfortable behind a dune. Nesting turtles emerge from the ocean after dark and sometimes don't make an appearance until the wee hours of the morning.
WE waited in the inky blackness as shooting stars crossed the sky and the surf crashed. While Matthew pointed out the constellations, his father scouted for turtles. We were in luck. A green sea turtle had lumbered ashore and was making her way to the dunes.
Sea turtles are a protected species and it's illegal in Australia, as in many other countries, to interfere with their nesting. So, Les escorted us one at a time, crawling on hands and knees, closer to the turtle. He used an infrared flashlight that wouldn't disturb her as she dug.
Les explained that the 200-pound turtle was at least 40 to 50 years old -- the age when females begin reproducing. The turtle methodically dug a hole in the sand with her flippers. We returned to our hiding spot and waited. It can take a turtle two hours to dig a nest and begin laying eggs.
But after an hour and a half of labor, the turtle realized that the sand was too dry to keep the nest intact and abandoned the effort, trying again in a new spot. That nest collapsed, too. We crept closer and watched the apparently exhausted turtle shuffle down the beach and slip into the ocean.
We weren't the only ones watching turtles that night. As we walked back to the Land Cruiser, Les pointed out the glowing green eyes of a red fox that had been waiting to dig up the nest and snatch the eggs. Foxes, introduced by British colonists in the 19th century, have devastated much of Australia's native wildlife.
After a break for coffee, tea and homemade cookies -- "bickies," in local parlance -- we drove to another beach to watch turtles. On the road back to Exmouth after midnight, we ran a gantlet of grazing kangaroos -- dozens of them -- as they jumped in front of the car, confused by the headlights, forcing Les to take evasive action.
The next day we set out for Yardie Creek, 50 miles from Exmouth on the southern end of the cape. We were in search of the black-footed rock wallaby. As the paved road gave out and we began a bone-jarring ride along a rutted track, we longed for Les's Land Cruiser (guidebooks wisely urge using four-wheel-drive vehicles on the road). But our snail's pace gave us a close-up view of goannas -- large, fierce-looking lizards -- and scores of normally skittish kangaroos escaping the midday heat under roadside bushes.
At Yardie Creek we boarded a a 30-passenger motorboat. As we and half a dozen other sightseers cruised through a gorge enclosed on three sides by rugged walls of red rock, the captain, Neil (Macca) McGregor, pointed to a ledge high above the creek. Peering down at us was a rock wallaby and a joey, the baby peeking out of its mom's pouch.
A mini-kangaroo, the delicate charcoal-gray wallaby spends its days in the crevices and outcrops of Yardie Creek, emerging occasionally to feed in the bush above. But the proliferation of foxes has devastated it, and only a few scattered groups survive.
As we rounded a bend, Macca, who assists biologists by keeping count of the rock wallabies at Yardie Creek, spotted the body of one keeled over in the shallows. We went ashore and checked to see if there were any signs of predation. But it appeared that the wallaby had fallen into the creek and drowned.
Driving back to Exmouth, we saw Macca's four-wheel-drive parked on the side of the road. He was a few yards in the bush, peering intently into a small pool of water that seeped out of a rock basin. A finger-sized white fish, a blind gudgeon, wriggled around in the water. The fish had no eyes, Macca explained, and is found only at Cape Range.
The conversation took a philosophical turn. He talked about the growing pressure in Exmouth to build big resorts. He confided his fears that small eco-tourism operations like his would be overrun and the fragile environment of Ningaloo and Cape Range ruined.
We shared his concerns. And as dusk began to fall and the kangaroos emerged for their suppers, we decided to postpone the next part of our journey and spend some more time in this rugged paradise.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Packing Relief For Health Woes

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
MEDICAL preparations for trips to exotic places must include a visit to a doctor or travel clinic for inoculations and advice. But even trips to more conventional places like a spa in California or your cousin's cabin in Colorado should involve gathering items for first aid or other health problems that might arise.
For many, this counsel is redundant. Some of my best friends are hypochondriacs, and I do travel with them. I scoff when they climb aboard with Merck Manuals bulging in their pockets, carrying a first-aid kit that's the size of a carpenter's toolbox. 
 But while they may be hypochondriacs, I am absolutely a hypocrite. If anything goes wrong, that kit is the first thing we rip open: for sealed sterile pads to wipe wounds, small bandages for blisters, something for diarrhea, elastic bandages, instant cold packs and a variety of other items not always easily found, particularly in the back country.
If you are the one forced to carry it, the medical kit should contain the essentials and little more. Liquids weigh a lot, so one-shot containers of antiseptics are just fine. Be sure you have enough rinse for contact lenses. Factory-sealed containers raise fewer questions at customs frontiers than repacked pills or ointments. If a group is going to be together the whole time, a collective kit is a luggage economy. But be sure you have your own extra pair of eyeglasses.
 
Extra Prescription Copies
The most important parts of the medical kit for anyone with a chronic condition, and that means many people over 60, are hospital records and extra copies of all prescriptions, written not for trademark names but for generic names, and thus useful in pharmacies everywhere.
Dr. Martin S. Wolfe counsels the State Department on its employees' travel needs as well as directing a travel clinic in Washington. He says the first priority is gathering information to guide a doctor who may have to treat you for the first time: X-rays or electrocardiograms, for example. Part of this information-gathering is an examination of health insurance policies and medical evacuation coverage, he says. A record should be made of all essential numbers, with telephone and fax for your primary-care doctor or organization. All this should be in carry-on bags.
The new edition of "Health Hints for the Tropics," edited by Dr. Wolfe and published by the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, contains a practical list for a medical kit. Although intended for tropical travel, the list can be amended for all sorts of trips. (Ordering information for the book is given below.)
The list is particularly helpful in providing generic names for products as well as trade names, which may be virtually all anyone remembers: for example, dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). These over-the-counter items may be hard to find under United States trade names.
Among the nonprescription items listed in the booklet are first-aid materials, Ace bandages, tincture of benzoin, dental floss and traveler's dental kit, extra glasses or contact lenses, hearing-aid batteries, thermometer, pocketknife, itch or sunburn medicine, Burow's solution (for skin inflammation), sunscreen, insect repellant, a mosquito net with the repellant permethrin, a water purification device, oral rehydration salts for use in diarrhea, foot powder, analgesics, antiseptics, laxatives, antidiarrheals, motion-sickness medicine, throat lozenges, antihistamines, antacids, infant feeding materials, birth-control devices, multi-vitamins and a Sawyer extractor pump for snake and insect bites.
The tropical-medicine group's list does not include two items I consider useful. One is an instant cold pack. These light 5-by-4 1/2-inch plastic packs of ammonium nitrate and water become ice-cold when pounded or massaged. Activated, they are so cold they are not supposed to be applied longer than 20 minutes because of the danger of frostbite. Once activated, the packs cannot be used again safely. They can be bought in pharmacies or from sports specialty shops.
As Disposable Cold Packs, they are available from Chinook Medical Gear, Post Office Box 1736, Edwards, Colo. 81632, (800) 766-1365, which sells three for $3.95 or 10 for $11.95, plus postage. This company has a catalogue of kits and individual items. On the Web, the address is www.chinookmed.com.
My other choice qualifies as first aid the same way that parents of young children define "emergency" when they pull up the car in areas marked "emergency parking only." This item is called Brief Relief. It is a zip-shut plastic pouch, with interior funnel, that contains a material that congeals urine to an odorless gel. For obvious reasons, they are favored by winter tent-campers. These are sold in the latest Magellan's catalogue in a four pack for $9.85, plus shipping. Magellan's, 110 West Sola Street, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93101; (800) 962-4943.
In addition to the $5 "Health Hints" booklet, which has 54 pages packed with information, the Society of Tropical Medicine has just issued the 1998 edition of its directory of specialists in tropical medicine, parasites and travelers' health. People preparing for travel who want a reference to a specialist pre- or post-travel can find one here; the names of practitioners and clinics are cross-referenced by state and town.
This book is free to those who send a 9-by-12 envelope with $1.70 postage (for United States addresses). For the booklet and the directory, send a check for $6.70 and the unstamped envelope to: American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 60 Revere Drive, Suite 500, Northbrook, Ill. 60062; www.astmh.org on the Web.
 
Hard-to-Find Books
Right now two reliable, inexpensive publications for travelers are scarce or out of print, so the tropical-medicine booklets may be the best game in town. The Federal Centers for Disease Control's "Health Information for International Travel," in its most recent edition, 1996-97, is in modest supply at the Government Printing Office. The new edition is due sometime in May, in a new format. The old one costs $20 from the Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D.C. 20402, where it is publication 017-023-00197-3. It can also be found at www.cdc.gov. The nonprofit International Society of Travel Medicine's Clinic Directory is now out of print, and the organization is seeking sponsorship for a new edition.
The Shell Oil Company, as part of an auto-safety campaign, has urged that all cars contain a first-aid kit with the following: bandages, adhesive tape, scissors, blankets, latex gloves, a mouth guard (for artificial respiration), flashlights, flares and reflectors, plus change for a pay telephone.
Shell has also published a series of booklets: "Crash Course, Simple Tips That Could Help Save Lives," "Driving Dangers" and "Kids in the Car." The simple tips are worth keeping in the car. Among other things, they give a quick explanation of artificial respiration steps for those who have not taken an E.M.S. course. These booklets are available free at Shell stations, by calling (800) 376-0200 or, on the Web, through www.countonshell.com.

 BODY:

Literary Paris
 Q. I will be going to Paris and would appreciate information on the location of the salon that Natalie Clifford Barney had there earlier in this century. Is the salon or studio a place that can be visited? -- Maria E. Hopewell, Dallas
 A. It was at 20 Rue Jacob, in the sixth arrondissement, that Barney, an American expatriate and writer, conducted a salon every Friday, attracting a galaxy of literary and intellectual lights. Among them were Djuna Barnes, Sylvia Beach, Colette, Hilda Doolittle, Janet Flanner, Andre Gide, Gertrude Stein and William Carlos Williams. 
 The salon met for more than 50 years (except during the two world wars) until about the early 1960's, according to Karla Jay, director of Women's and Gender Studies at Pace University in New York. The Rue Jacob building, near the Place Furstenburg, is landmarked but not open to the public. In the garden there's a small temple, with Doric columns, that bears the inscription "A l'Amitie" ("To Friendship").
Born to an Ohio family of great wealth, Barney moved to Paris as a student and pursued her interest in French culture, writing primarily in French. She died in 1972 and is buried in the ninth division of the Passy cemetery. Also buried at Passy is Renee Vivien, an expatriate poet from Britain who was among Barney's loves. Another was Romaine Brooks, whose paintings include some of Barney.
The sixth arrondissement is rich in literary connections. If you set out on your own, you will find the maps and descriptions in Noel Riley Fitch's "Walks in Hemingway's Paris" valuable. (It was reissued by St. Martin's Press in 1997 and is $10.95.) If you prefer a guided tour, one possibility is Bohemian Paris, run by Siren's Song Tours, 5 Rue du Parc, 93389 Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, France; (33-1) 48.26.62.15, fax (33-1) 48.21.41.69. Web site: www.onecity .com/paris.
The tours, conducted by Gentry Lane, are available daily by appointment. They take about two and a half hours, cover a mile and a half on the Left Bank and are limited to six people. On the itinerary are cafes frequented by Hemingway and Modigliani, the residences of Modigliani, the composer George Antheil and James Joyce and the studios of Man Ray, Picasso and Brassai. Cost: $36 each, at 5.5 francs to the dollar.
By way of background, you may want to read Shari Benstock's "Women of the Left Bank: Paris, 1900-1940" (University of Texas Press) and Ms. Jay's book "The Amazon and the Page: Natalie Clifford Barney and Renee Vivien" (Indiana University Press). A site on the Internet devoted to Barney and her era -- run by Paula L. DiTallo, who describes herself as an Atlanta software engineer with a love for literature -- is home.sprynet.com/ sprynet/ditallop/natalieb.htm.
 
Rugby World Cup
 Q. We would like to attend the Rugby World Cup this year. How can we get tickets, especially to the championship matches, and do you have suggestions for lodging? Is there hooliganism as there is at soccer matches? -- Andrew J. Schiavoni, Bronx, N.Y.
 A. Competing in the Rugby World Cup, scheduled to be played in Britain and France from Oct. 1 to Nov. 6, are 20 teams divided into five groups. The official source for tour packages is Gullivers Sports Travel, which takes the minimalist approach: Fans handle their own air travel.
The closer the date of the final games, the more nights of accommodation one must buy. So fans who want to follow the initial progress of a single team, or what is called "follow the flag," get two nights' lodging in the Dublin area. The cost, $695 to $895, is based on double occupancy and includes two breakfasts; a seat at the opening game and ceremonies on Oct. 1 at the new 72,500-seat Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, and seats at three games played by a single team.
A package that offers a ticket to the quarterfinal in Paris or Edinburgh is $699 to $799. It includes three nights at a three-star hotel and three breakfasts.
Fans who want tickets to the last four games -- the two semifinals, the playoff and the final -- getnine nights in London at $3,245 to $4,895. The package covers breakfast daily and, except for those choosing the economy level lodgings, bus transportation to and from the games.
Whichever package you choose, there is no guarantee as to the category of ticket you get. Information: Gullivers Sports Travel, 973 Vale Terrace, Vista, Calif. 92084; (760) 941-7323, fax (760) 941-2997.
A Rugby World Cup spectator's guide is available from the British Tourist Authority by mail; call (800) 462-2748. It includes tour suggestions plus a listing of places to stay and agencies handling accommodations.
Asked about rowdiness, Ed Hagerty, editor and publisher of Rugby magazine, cited this adage: Rugby is a ruffians' game played by gentlemen; soccer is a gentlemen's game played by ruffians. He noted that after a game, competing teams socialized in what is known as "the third half."
 
Indonesia's Haze
 Q. We are considering a tour that will include Indonesia but are concerned that it could be spoiled by haze from the forest fires. Can you hazard a guess as to the chances of clear conditions in February and March? And what about the outlook for Myanmar and Thailand? -- John B. Hebard, Sutton, Vt.
 A. The drought of El Nino and the haze created by forest fires are history -- for now, anyway. "Definitely pack your umbrella," says Bill Patzert, a research oceangrapher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. He reports that there are no fires and no smog over Indonesia or Southeast Asia; in fact, in December, there were heavy rains. On average, Jakarta, for example, has 11.8 inches of rain in February and 8.6 in March.
The Topex-Poseidon satellite, a French-American project, measures the height of the sea surface. As the surface heats up, the sea level rises, which in turn promotes conditions that produce rainfall. That is exactly what is happening now: At year's end, the sea level was 7.8 inches above normal in the western Pacific, Mr. Patzert said.
As for Myanmar and Thailand, a National Centers for Environmental Prediction model suggests that temperatures may be a bit higher than usual -- it's normally in the low 70's to low 90's in Bangkok -- and that the precipitation will not differ from the norm, which is eight-tenths of an inch in February and 1.4 inches in March.

Asian Economic Woes Hurt Canadian Tourism

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
THE cartoon colors that Japanese tourists seem to favor in ski suits -- orange, pink and shiny silver -- may not be missed on Canadian ski slopes this winter, but the extravagant spending habits that Japanese tourists used to bring with them certainly will be.
Since the spread of Asian economic flu through Japan and other Pacific countries over the past year, Canadian tourism has been hit hard. By October the number of Asian tourists had dropped by 19.7 percent across Canada. And except for unusual attractions like the Aurora Borealis and the house on Prince Edward Island that was the inspiration for "Anne of Green Gables," Canadian tourism destinations have lost some of their biggest spenders. 
 "They have traditionally been very generous visitors," Rod Harris, the president of Tourism British Columbia, said of Japanese tourists. "It's a source of great concern."
British Columbia has done slightly better than the rest of Canada in luring Asian tourists despite the economic slowdown that has crippled the once mighty economies of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. So far this year, Asian visits to British Columbia are down 17 percent.
Asian tourists often stop in Vancouver or Victoria, two major West Coast cities with large Asian populations. Mr. Harris said that while fewer Asian visitors are taking extravagant cross-country tours, many continue to make the trip to the nearest destination in Canada, which is British Columbia.
Since Asian visitors make up 33 percent of overseas visitors to Canada who stay for at least a night, the decline represents a loss of about $78 million in the first six months of this year alone, according to the Canadian Tourism Commission.
The sharpest drops are in the number of visitors from South Korea, down almost 60 percent, and mainland China, off almost 25 percent. The decline in Japanese tourists is less steep, 16 percent, but it hurts more because Japanese are the largest single group of Asian visitors to Canada and the ones who spend the most money.
"It's definitely having an impact," said John C. Olsthoorn, a spokesman for the Canadian Tourism Commission. "Fortunately, the increase in American tourists has helped buffer the drop."
A significant weakening of the Canadian dollar this year has made traveling north a bargain for Americans, who can expect an exchange rate of from $1.45 to $1.50 Canadian for every American dollar. American overnight visits to Canada in the first 10 months of 1998 totaled 13.3 million, a 10.6 percent increase over the same period in 1997.
"That has more than compensated for the erosion in visitors from the Asia-Pacific region," said Mr. Harris of British Columbia, referring to the influx of Americans. He said that Americans from border states who hop in their cars and drive to Vancouver or the ski slopes at Whistler do not spend as much as the rich Japanese tourists, but there are many more of them.
"The absolute size of the U.S. market is far larger than any other of our other international markets," he said, "so when the number of U.S. tourists grows, even though some of it is short-haul visits, the overall effect is very positive."
Asian visitors to some specialized Canadian sights are driven by dreams rather than costs and will come despite economic conditions. Kathie Adam, general manager of the Northern Frontier Visitors' Association, a Government tourism office in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, said she hasn't noticed any decline in the number of Asian tourists planning to come to see the Aurora Borealis.
Perhaps the most specialized Canadian destination for Asian tourists is Prince Edward Island, the home of Lucy Maud Montgomery, the author of "Anne of Green Gables." For more than a decade, Japanese girls have been fascinated by the freckle-faced Anne, and a visit to the house in Cavendish that inspired the book has become a once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage.
"What we have here is a niche market for people who really have an interest in Anne," said Bob Brammer, owner of Prince Edward Tours, an agency that specializes in Japanese tourists.
Mr. Brammer said his agency has handled about 5,000 tourists in the last 12 months, a decline of only 3 to 5 percent, despite current economic conditions. "I had one lady who said she had been saving for close to 10 years," he said. "For many, it's a lifelong dream."
Mr. Brammer said Japanese tourists used to want to see all of Canada, starting with British Columbia and working east to Banff National Park, Toronto, Niagara Falls and the city of Quebec before arriving at Prince Edward Island. "Now they land in Atlantic Canada or the United States before heading here," he said. "It's cheaper."

Not So Fast!

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
It's relatively easy to find a label for a policy that involves the promise of action. Both "Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!" and the more temperate "Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick" carried messages of stern forewarning. Policy slogans beginning with Remember, with their pledges of vengeance, had a good run in wartime, with the outrages to be recalled ranging from the Alamo to the Maine to Pearl Harbor.
 More recently, containment was George Kennan's somewhat more sobersided contribution to cold-war foreign-policy nomenclature, followed by the Clinton Administration's engagement. These offered a sense of quiet but resolute policy action. 
 What do you label a policy that does not appeal to jingoism, adventurism, interventionism -- or, indeed, commit you to any reaction whatever? Many statesmen find much in a philosophy that eschews escalation, arguing instead, "Don't just do something -- stand there."
 That was the challenge that faced Strobe Talbott, Deputy Secretary of State, as he sought a catch phrase to define the Clinton Administration's foreign policy in a multipolar but uni-superpower world. As a former correspondent and columnist for Time magazine, Talbott knew that a diplomatic word or phrase had to be conceived in quietude, preferably before an academic audience, and then be allowed to develop slowly over the months. Any more pretentious unveiling, or capitalization, would alert the legion of carping critics to strangle the label in its crib.
 On Sept. 19, 1997, he offered his conception to Stanford University: "We need to make sure we have a policy toward Russia that contains an indispensable feature: strategic patience. That means a policy not just for coping with the issue or the crisis of the moment or the week or even of the season, or for getting through the next summit meeting; rather it means a policy for the next century."
 Few combinations of words are now wholly original. Strategic patience had been used two weeks earlier by a corporate executive, Jim Maxmin, in an article for Industry Week; a year before that, in "The Good Guys," a book by Jules Bonavolonta and Brian Duffy, the phrase was used to describe the F.B.I. plan to infiltrate major Mafia families to conduct long-term investigations. Earlier hits can be made in databases covering fields from music to the military.
 But after Talbott slipped his diplomatic usage into the bulrushes, the Senate's authority on foreign affairs, Richard Lugar, picked it up in a January 1998 Harvard speech. "American policy toward Russia must contain a healthy dose of strategic patience," he said, accepting the Talbott definition, but adding that it was today "particularly susceptible to Russian nonperformance."
 By November, the conceiver was ready to incubate the phrase in a speech subtitle. In "Gogol's Troika: The Case for Strategic Patience in a Time of Troubles," Talbott -- whose enthusiastic support of Boris Yeltsin has been tempered by disappointment -- returned to Stanford to say, "The policy that flows from realism is one of strategic patience and persistence." Lest he be accused of departing from previous policy, he added, "That means continuing engagement." After he reworked his thoughtful speech for The Economist, his phrase was picked up by his former colleagues at Time.
 Because White House speech writers have chosen no Clinton Doctrine or catch phrase of their own and are not really married to engagement, Talbott's personal, long-suffering, tactical patience has paid off: his phrase is in play.
 On what linguistic structure is this coinage bottomed? (As Henry Kissinger once shouted at a football referee who had just made an egregious interference call against a Redskins cornerback, "On vot theory?")
 The use of an active modifier to qualify a noun that justifies not rushing into action has a grand history in diplomatic rhetoric. President Grover Cleveland, criticizing the seizure of Hawaii by the United States in 1893, wrote, "There seemed to arise. . .the precise opportunity for which he was watchfully waiting." Twenty years later, President Woodrow Wilson picked up that alliterative phrase and, refusing to be drawn into a war with Mexico, elevated it to policy status: "We shall not, I believe, be obliged to alter our policy of watchful waiting." The stern watchful gave a monitoring, almost monitory, cast to the feeble waiting.
 This built on the tradition begun in 1791 by Sir James Mackintosh, an historian and Member of Parliament, in "Vindiciae Gallicae," a response to Edmund Burke's criticism of the French Revolution. "The Commons, faithful to their system," wrote Mackintosh, "remained in a wise and masterly inactivity.. . ." That phrase resounded among all who wanted to do little or nothing, and was soon followed by his equally stirring "disciplined inaction."
 No ringing refutations or derisive slogans have yet met Secretary Talbott's sophisticated essay into the field of semi-oxymoronic phrase making. We will just have to let the dust settle. But those sensitive to the technique soon noted another, similar construction that offered a corollary to strategic patience. A White House spokesman seeking to substitute censure for impeachment used a highly active adverb to give backbone to a passive participle: "Officials publicly indicated more interest than before," reported The Washington Post, "saying they were aggressively listening.. . . "
 
COMPULSIVE COMPELLING
 "We've made a compulsive, a compelling case," opined Henry Hyde, House Judiciary chairman. Which did he mean?
 Both words are rooted in the Latin pellere, "to drive." Compel is "to drive forcefully," impel is "to drive with moral pressure" and propel is "to drive forward." Although compelling and compulsive are usually taken to be synonyms, the meanings of the two adjectives are differentiating usefully.
 Compulsive, which still means "having the power to compel," is being overtaken by its secondary meaning, "under the psychological coercion of obsession." One of these days, psychiatrists will adopt the verb compulse.
 Meanwhile, compelling (though its root of compel still means "to force" or "to urge irresistibly") is more often being used to mean "driving toward a conclusion or action by cogent argument."
 Chairman Hyde meant compelling, I hope.

HEADLINE: THE LIVES THEY LIVED: Marvin E. Wolfgang;
Charting the Devious Mind

BYLINE: By James Q. Wilson; James Q. Wilson is the author of "Moral Judgment" and "The Moral Sense."

 BODY:
Studying crime is much harder than studying the economy. Criminals conceal their behavior; only a fraction of all crimes lead to an arrest; some, but not all, convicted offenders are imprisoned.
 The hardest way to study crime is also the best way -- go out and look at what individuals do. That is what Marvin Wolfgang did. He did it so well that much of what everybody really knows about crime comes from his research. 
 Everybody knows that in many murders the victim started the quarrel that led to his death. Before 1958, when Wolfgang published "Patterns of Criminal Homicide," a detailed examination of nearly 600 Philadelphia murders, people didn't know that.
 Everybody knows that a few chronic offenders commit most serious crimes. Before 1972, when Wolfgang and his associates published "Delinquency in a Birth Cohort," a careful scrutiny of the arrest histories of 10,000 Philadelphia boys, people didn't know that.
 This individual focus gave a new direction to criminology and saved the field, I think, from becoming a small branch of economics or sociology. Wolfgang's study was the first to look at all boys born in a certain year and thus was the first to tell us the crime pattern for every 18-year-old in Philadelphia. If data about real individuals had not been gathered, we would still be trying to understand crime by correlating inaccurate unemployment rates with even more inaccurate crime rates for states or nations.
 By making us think about individuals, Wolfgang set the stage for the next major development in criminology -- finding out why individuals behave as they do. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, criminology was a branch of medicine, and so scholars were quite ready to consider biological as well as social explanations for crime. But then Hitler arrived and the issue of racism clouded the discussion, helping to put an end to any explanation for crime other than a purely environmental one. People must not differ in any important way, some people said, otherwise some people will be thought inferior to others. Therefore, all crime must have a social cause.
 As a result, many scholars became preoccupied with describing how high unemployment rates or social oppression explained crime. These things do matter, but they are not the whole story.
 When Wolfgang looked at individual arrest rates, he did so with the firm conviction that criminology had to be an interdisciplinary activity in which all sources of human behavior should be explored. In his Philadelphia study, he showed that most serious offenders had lower I.Q. scores than the nonoffenders. Because I.Q. is largely inherited, something in addition to social factors was obviously at work.
 Since the Wolfgang study, there have been many studies of I.Q. and crime, all finding more or less the same connection. No one is quite certain how to explain this, but the search for other constitutional factors continues. These days, we also know that high-rate offenders are more likely than nonoffenders to be impulsive, to have slower heart rates, to have lower levels of certain neurotransmitters (like serotonin) and to have difficulty metabolizing manganese and perhaps other minerals.
 Wolfgang rarely drew sharp policy conclusions, but I'm certain he would say that crime involves a complex interaction between neurobiological and social factors. He was a careful scholar and a modest man. When he died, he was hard at work, on a longitudinal study of crime in China.

How 20 Artists Treat the Human Body 20 Different Ways

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
AN exhibition called "Extensions" focuses exclusively on representations of the human body in recent art. The show, a bristling and entertaining spectacle, is at the Joseloff Gallery at the University of Hartford in West Hartford through Jan. 17.
What's winning about what the gallery director, Zina Davis, has assembled is that it isn't about anything but how 20 artists treat the human body. Ms. Davis made sure she chose 20 different ways to keep viewers on their toes. The pleasure of the show is one's own body circumnavigating the large gallery space encountering several alluring limned and sculptured kindred spirits, even though there is a distinct lack of spirituality in the show. 
 While several currently hot artists are included, the show gets a kind of ballast from the presence of well-known artists from an earlier generation. These include Alice Neel (1900-1984), known for unconventionally posed full-figure portraits.
Philip Pearlstein's large investigations of the nude, with the head cut off by the frame to emphasize the body, used to impress because of their starkness. But lately, paradoxically, Mr. Pearlstein has included exotic items from his extensive collection of folk art as props, objects that seem more live than the models.
Holograms were very much in vogue during the 1980's, but are used rarely now. Harriet Kasdin-Silver, who was born in 1925, puts the mysterious science of holography to its best use. Her human updating of the neolithic "Venus of Willendorf," one of the earliest images of the body ever found, is at once grotesque and beautiful.
Leon Golub, born in 1922, had his acme in the 1980's with large, graphic images of torture during wartime. His more recent work, such as "Like Yeah" is more ambiguous; it gains interest through the juxtaposition of live figures, skeletons and animals against a backdrop of graffiti.
Ida Applebroog, born in 1929, made herself into an influential artist in the 1980's with her composite works featuring very sympathetic characters from everyday life often encountering the horrors of life. The two works here feature surgeons.
Bruce Nauman, though born in 1941, still has a youthful and flamboyant approach to his art. Ms. Davis, however, has gone back 30 years and picked a 1968 videotape, "Walking With Contrapposto." This is an attitude often seen in antique painting of the figure twisted on its axis so that the arms and shoulders are unaligned with the rest of the body. To promenade that way is a feat but Mr. Nauman performs it amusingly, as if he were another Chaplin.
Among younger artists there is a prevalent urge to explore parts of the body usually regarded as taboo. Sue Williams does this with abandon. From a distance her paintings seem stylized versions of Abstract Expressionism, but they are really concatenations of body parts the likes of which were imagined in an earlier era by Hieronymous Bosch.
Kiki Smith often provides a shock, but an opposite sensation, deflation, is the result of her paper sculpture of a dismembered man, painted a screaming red, hanging on the wall in parts and with the head on the floor. The piece has an aura of absolute emptiness.
Christopher Cairns's corpse-like bronze figure that seems to melt into the floor is reminiscent of one of those neolithic mummies found in a glacier, so the feeling is more one of awe than of the shudder of death.
And even though Magdalena Abakanowicz's 12 standing figures of burlap and resin have no heads, she manages to make them seem very vital as they disturb.
The surprises in the exhibition are from artists who come from outside the United States, all with outsized works; two are gigantic.
Marlene Dumas is a South African living in Amsterdam, a situation reflected in a grid of rather fragile portraits of people in her homeland made with ink on paper; occasionally she uses multiple sheets of paper for a collage effect. The aggregate is called "Rejects." The faces she draws are rudimentary yet she records particular gestures and nuances of expression with great sympathy.
Jenny Saville from England has painted an immense portrait of a back, the kind of luxurious back the French painter Ingres would have seized upon. The portrait is 11 feet high and the female subject's buttocks rest on the bottom edge. Her nose is squashed by the frame on the right side. She might be trapped but she is a cascade of paint, interrupted only by a mole, which makes her something to revere.
"Three Large Men," by Stephan Balkenhol from Germany, is what it purports to be. The figures, each 13 feet tall, seem to be hewed from poplar trees and the uniform texture of rough chisel marks distinguishes them. They're painted minimally in white shirts and black pants, and differ only slightly in their stances. They seem distant relatives of Michelangelo's "David," but are marvelous as paeans to ordinariness.
"Extensions" is at the Joseloff Gallery of the University of Hartford through Jan. 17.

Dentist on the Airwaves, Sound Bites and All

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER 

 BODY:
HARVEY PASSES was on grin patrol. Not that checking out smiles is unusual for a dentist, particularly a cosmetic specialist. But Dr. Passes was holding neither a drill nor a toothbrush.
Standing in front of Barney's at the Americana at Manhasset, a microphone in his hand, a stack of business cards in his pocket, Dr. Passes was cajoling shoppers to play candid camera. And the more embarrassed they were, the more they smiled. 
 "Excuse me," he said to Carolyn Keith, a homemaker from Garden City. "Would you like to be on television? You should be. All you have to do is smile."
"Welcome to Tooth or Consequences," he said, as she beamed into the video camera held by a Cablevision cameraman, Mitch Brown. "Look at that smile. Big smile. Oh, come on, beautiful smile."
Dr. Passes, of North Hills, host of the only oral health talk show in the New York metropolitan area, was searching for Long Island's best smiles.
On the air for the past year, his half-hour dental program, broadcast five times weekly on local origination Channels 44, 25, 80 and 27, features local and national experts in air-abrasive technology, endodontics, oral pathology, implants and dentistry for the developmentally disabled.
"When you meet someone for the first time," he said, rolling through his opening segment, "what is the first thing that you look at? Their ears? Their chin? Their hair? No, it's their eyes." And the second thing you look at? "Their smile," he said. "Some say that the eyes are the door to the mind. The smile is the gateway to the heart. Through the eyes when you meet someone you get a sense of what they are thinking. But when they smile, you get a sense of what they are feeling."
What Dr. Passes doesn't want patients to feel is pain. Or fear of going to the dentist. When he's doing plastodontics and sculpturing teeth with a laser, he sings. While scraping plaque, he cracks jokes. Anything, said Dr. Passes, who formerly ran a dental phobia clinic and taught biofeedback and hypnosis, to distract patients from their anxiety.
Before attending dental school, Dr. Passes, 49, was a stand-up comedian and professional folk-rock singer. Had a contract with Columbia Records, performed all over the nation. Never got over it. Loves being in front of the camera. But he also encourages patients to ignore the high-speed suction tubes he's sticking in their mouths and sing along.
In 1991, Dr. Passes helped developed a dental laser. He was co-founder of the international Academy of Laser Dentistry, does hi-tech research and has lectured across North America.
"We're increasing the dental I.Q. of the public," said Dr. Passes, one of 2,557 dentists in the Nassau and Suffolk County dental societies.
"They don't have to go into Manhattan to get top people," he said. "Dentistry is not what you believe it has been. Dentistry is going into the third millennium. We have incredible technology."
Among the latest developments are pain-free injections that deliver Novocaine through a computer. Drill-free, noise-free fillings fix children's teeth with a thin stream of aluminum oxide powder shot into cavities at five times the speed of sound. With digital visiography, X-rays are taken via computer, transmitting barely a trace of radiation. And the cost of implant dentistry has been halved, making it affordable for the elderly to have a third set of teeth.
"Should I spit my gum out?" asked Allyson Mayo of Roslyn, facing the camera. Ruth Steinberg, a homemaker from Great Neck, worried about lipstick on her teeth. Two-year-old Devin Hakimian just screamed when her mother, Debbie, tried to remove a pacifier from her mouth.
A smile that shows teeth, Dr. Passes continued, as he pointed out a passer-by's grin, subliminally and subconsciously shows openness, warmth of spirit and generosity.
"These are the messages that come across without saying one word," he said. "Six percent of our communication is with our words. Ninety-four percent is with our bodies. You can say so much without saying one word, with a smile." Not everyone has a beautiful grin, admitted Dr. Passes, who has sported white porcelain veneers ever since a patient told him he couldn't touch her teeth until he fixed his own chipped, widely spaced, very yellowed set.
"Clearly, some people have dynamite smiles and some don't," he said. "When there is too much gum in a smile, it becomes a bit of a turnoff. People do want to see your teeth, but they don't want to see your insides."
Too much teeth doesn't work either. "You wind up being Mr. Ed," he said, referring to the talking television horse.
What is Long Island's greatest resource?
"Some say it's our wonderful beaches, maybe it's this fantastic economy," said the dentist.
"When you look into our eyes, you see the eyes of a savvy New Yorker. But when you see our smile, you see the warmth, the generosity of small-town individuals. And that's the smile that comes from the heart."
 
On Hold
Being put on hold on a telephone call is one of life's little annoyances. Waiting in silent desperation or being linked to musical static while you're waiting for your party to return can be aggravating. Except to Dave Goldberg, whose baritone voice is at the other end of the line for more than 2,000 Long Island companies.
Mr. Goldberg, 31, creates "on hold' messages. He knows that his recordings are on target when, instead of hanging up, callers ask to be put back into the waiting pattern.
"The average on hold time in the United States is two minutes per call," Mr. Goldberg said, adding that most phone calls result in being put on hold twice.
Working out of his five-year-old Digital Waterworx company office in Plainview, Mr. Goldberg invents customized scenarios, sometimes running more than half an hour depending on how long his customers keep their clients waiting, and records them in 30- to 60-second segments.
"It's fun," said Mr. Goldberg, who charges $450 per Infohold recording. "Ultimately it makes the person's time on hold feel shorter. My goal is to pacify the clients. If they call and they are irate and they have to be put on hold, maybe they'll get distracted and listen to what's on there."
This is not your typical groan-eliciting, "All our customer service agents are busy now." Instead, using the broadcast voice he honed playing disk jockey at bar mitzvahs and sweet 16 parties, Mr. Goldberg simulates a radio station broadcasting from outer space for a themed restaurant. Trucks backing down a loading dock make a garment distributor sound busy.
Trivia questions with giveaway prizes for the right answers keep callers hanging.
Call Stephen DiNapoli at DiNapoli Plumbing Supplies in Garden City Park and win a portable compact disk player for figuring out how many gallons of water an average slow dripping faucet leaks a year. So far, Mr. DiNapoli said, nobody has figured it out.
Some of the more progressive messages, Mr. Goldberg said, are for dentists, who keep patients from hanging up with buzz about the latest intra-oral cameras and reasons not to go through life with a chipped tooth.
"If you are on hold for 30 seconds listening to silence, the perception is that it's much longer," Mr. Goldberg said. "Having music from the radio on the phone is illegal. You're re-broadcasting copyrighted material." Besides, he said, callers may end up listening to competitors' ads.
"It's hard enough to get people to call your company," he said. "Once you have them you want to retain them. Companies typically spend 85 percent of their advertising budget to get people to call their company yet they spend about 4 percent of their budget to keep the customer."
When not on the phone, Mr. Goldberg, who started playing classical piano at age 5 and publishing songs at 8, composes radio jingles for local companies. That's his voice announcing the specials at Dairy Barn, Bagel Boss and Five Town Toyota. He studied communications and music merchandising at Hofstra University, but attributes his creative streak to his grandfather, a sign painter.
Recently, Mr. Goldberg recorded an audio business card that fits into a cassette player, but not a wallet, for a professional networker, Steven Krauser of Port Washington, who schmoozes with 13 different business groups for a living. For Hal Gold, owner of Black Gold Systems Corporation, a telephone sales and installation company in Farmingdale, Mr. Goldberg fabricated a trivia quiz:
"Who invented the telegraph -- not the telephone -- and was it in the year 1844, 1899 or 1911?" Mr. Goldberg began. "Answer it correctly and you'll win the grand prize: an all expenses paid luxurious romantic getaway to beautiful Yaphank! We'll be right back with the answer. You keep thinking!"
 
An Update
Larry Wallach, the lion rescuer and wild animal specialist mentioned in this space three weeks ago, has lost his bid to create a special society for the protection of wildlife and exotic animals in Nassau County.
The decision, on Dec. 21 by Judge Jerald S. Carter, determined that although Mr. Wallach was not entitled to the status of Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, with its associated law-enforcement powers, he could still promote and advance the humane treatment of lions, tigers, bears and other exotic creatures.
"There is no reason advanced why Mr. Wallach and his organization cannot work in coordination with the local, state and Federal law-enforcement agencies, when required," Judge Carter wrote, "to pursue the stated organizational purpose of protecting wildlife and exotic animals from cruel and inhuman treatment and to encourage kindness and humanity in the treatment of wildlife and exotic animals."
Although it dismissed his petition, the court applauded Mr. Wallach for expending much time, energy and personal funds toward the protection of wildlife and urged him to continue his good work.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property / Westchester;
Big Corporate Shifts Raise Office Vacancies to 18%

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
WHILE surrounding office markets thrived last year, Westchester County's -- tied to large corporations -- ended with a higher vacancy rate than in 1997, leading some brokers to wonder what it would take to turn the market around.
The county had a vacancy rate of 18 percent, up from 16.5 percent in 1997, according to Insignia/ESG, a commercial brokerage. And in the White Plains market, which is the county's business hub, the rate hovered at 30 percent, up from 28.3 percent a year earlier, making the city one of the worst-performing office markets in the country. 
 "Even if we start doing deals in Westchester, which we aren't, it can take about a year from the signing of the deal to the actual occupancy of buildings," said John Goodkind, executive managing director of Newmark's Connecticut/Westchester office. "That's very concerning to me."
Mr. Goodkind said that, although Westchester traditionally lagged Bergen County in New Jersey and Fairfield County in Connecticut, where vacancy rates stand at 8 and 11 percent, respectively, "the situation is getting worse instead of better."
Pointing to a lack of available space in Manhattan, Mr. Goodkind said that Westchester's inability to attract tenants was "disturbing at this point." He added: "New York City is outpacing itself. It should be the beginning of a trend of companies relocating from Manhattan. Why hasn't it happened in Westchester?"
The answer is multifaceted, reflecting, in part, some of the county's inherent problems as well as bad luck, several brokers and other interested observers say.
"The vacancy numbers reflect a continuation of corporate reductions and move-outs where companies have left a significant amount of space," said Martin S. Berger, a founder of the Robert Martin Company, a large developer of office space in the county. "It just so happened that Westchester's companies, particularly I.B.M., were more adversely affected by economic downturns than were those in other communities."
Westchester's heavy reliance on large companies, relative to other communities, exacerbated the problem, said Frank Tomasulo, an executive vice president with CB Richard Ellis's Westchester office. "On a proportional basis, Westchester was dominated by these large users, like I.B.M. and AT&T," he said. "So when the market changed, it was harder to change with it."
Much of the vacancy in the county is attributable to a handful of properties, primarily in White Plains. And if as While Plains goes, so goes Westchester, the news is not hopeful.
The county's hub has been severely jolted in recent years by several major corporate consolidations, primarily by I.B.M. and Nynex. And this trend is continuing with more recent arrivals, such as Nine West, the women's shoe manufacturer, and Oxford Health Plans, both of which are returning large blocks of space to the market.
THE rise in White Plains's vacancy rate to 30 percent is due primarily to the return to the market of the former Kraft Foods headquarters building, with more than 600,000 square feet. "The higher vacancy we're seeing now has a great deal to do with the Kraft facility alone," said Maureen O'Boyle, a director with Cushman & Wakefield, which is marketing the space.
"The Westchester market is small enough -- with about 23 million square feet of space -- that a return of that size can really make an impact," Mr. Tomasulo added. "It can affect vacancy by about 2 1/2 to 3 percentage points."
On a positive note, several of the vacant buildings, including the Kraft complex, are being renovated and repositioned to take advantage of the current market. The Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation, a Manhattan-based developer, bought the Kraft building in 1997 and hired the architect Philip Johnson to design new facades and help break the building up for smaller users.
The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company plans to spend $20 million renovating 445 Hamilton Avenue, a 360,000-square-foot building in White Plains that has been vacant since Prodigy moved out at the end of 1997.
And one of the most problematic buildings in White Plains, 360 Hamilton Avenue, which has been vacant since I.B.M. abandoned it in 1989, is undergoing a $30 million renovation.
Its new owner, the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, a Long Island real estate investment trust, had tried to market the building as is, planning to renovate once it secured a major tenant. But Reckson abandoned that strategy and is gutting the 360,000-square-foot building, revamping its systems and repositioning it from a single-tenant to a multitenant building.
Westchester's buildings are generally older than those in Fairfield and Bergen Counties, a disadvantage, according to Ms. O'Boyle. But the upside is that Westchester is the only market outside of Manhattan in the area that can accommodate the large corporate user. "Those large blocks of space just aren't available in the other markets," Ms. O'Boyle said.
The large user, however, is no longer a major factor in the marketplace. Insignia/ ESG's year-end report shows that 73 percent of all deals in Westchester last year were for 5,000 square feet or less and only 3 percent were for more than 50,000 square feet.
"People look at an 18 percent vacancy and say, 'What happened to Westchester?,' " said Michael Klein, an executive director with Insignia. "Well, it's not getting the large user out of Manhattan anymore. The size of the average tenant now is around 6,500 square feet. However, if you took out the large blocks of space, Westchester would, I think, look like a healthy market."
An example of that is Eastridge Properties, whose 16 buildings along Westchester Avenue contain two million square feet. It caters to small and mid-size tenants and is now 95 percent occupied, said Michael Ziatyk, Eastridge's managing director. "While we're doing well, the high vacancy in the county casts a negative pall which tenants try to use against you," he said.
Westchester is not the only market not getting the large user, according to Mr. Klein. "Fairfield and others aren't getting them either, but they're not as adversely affected by it," he said. "The problem is that companies are increasingly staying in Manhattan. It's got a better quality of life. And for some companies, it's important to have a presence in Manhattan."
The uncertainty of the economy has also played a part in Westchester's misfortunes, according to John McCarthy, a principal of McCarthy-O'Callaghan, a commercial brokerage in White Plains. "It's kind of a delayed reaction. Ever since August really, there's been this wait-and-see attitude on the part of tenants," he said. "I think we'll start to see some movement by the beginning of the year."

HEADLINE: ART / ARCHITECTURE;
From the 15th Century, A Tale of Two Cultures

BYLINE: By KAY LARSON; Kay Larson is an art critic who practices Zen.

 BODY:
IT'S magical. I left 15th-century Tibet, took an elevator up one floor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and stepped into the Netherlands: same century, different universe. In the exquisite "From Van Eyck to Breughel: Early Netherlandish Painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art," Christian Europe opens its eyes to the Renaissance. In "Sacred Visions: Early Paintings from Central Tibet," spiritual splendor and flowing Buddhist cosmology inhabit the main-floor galleries off the sculpture hall. Two cultures at opposite poles of the 15th century -- neither knowing of the other -- are housed, 500 years later, under the same roof. The metaphor seems inescapable. East and West are no longer twain. So why not ask what these two handsome exhibitions, on view through Jan. 17, can tell us about the worlds that gave them birth?
Despite the ubiquitous presence of the Dalai Lama and his monks, and the release of films like Martin Scorsese's "Kundun," Tibetan Buddhism remains impenetrably exotic for most of us (unless, like Richard Gere and Philip Glass, you are one of the growing numbers of serious Western practitioners). In "Sacred Visions," the closed door of Tibetan culture cracks open another notch. The cataclysm that has killed a million Tibetans and all but wiped out Tibet's monasteries has sent its spiritual images -- in pristine condition because they were preserved for up to a millennium in closed temple rooms -- on clandestine pilgrimages to the West. The shock of seeing them at the Met is immense. It's as if chunks of the Sistine Ceiling had begun to appear in Asian museums. The Met's catalogue steers clear of awkward questions about how these magnificent pictures got to Western collections. But we can be sure that only a cultural apocalypse of unimaginable dimensions would have pried them out of their stewards' hands. 
 So how do 15th-century Asia and Europe speak to one another? In many respects, effortlessly. "From van Eyck to Breughel" -- which airs some of the staggering wealth of the Metropolitan's collections -- opens with an "Annunciation" attributed to Petrus Christus. One of the most beautiful themes in Western art, an Annunciation depicts the ordinary world permeated by mysteries, the body made luminous by Spirit. Here, cloaked in the blue gown of heaven, Mary stands in the doorway of a freshly built church, a bit of symbolic architecture that signfies the birth of Christianity. Alighting before her in a verdant garden is a gorgeously gowned angel, the agent of transformation, who shuttles between material and immaterial realms.
Buddhism also includes a mystical conception, in which the Buddha's mother, Queen Maya, is impregnated through her right side by a holy elephant -- the human body acknowledging kinship with all beings. But the scene is a minor element in Tibetan painting, which is fundamentally concerned with the spiritual architecture of the universe. Tibetan painting is a map of the mind, a guide for meditations. Its basic form is the mandala: a symbolic palace for a deity, akin to the medieval western artist's City of God.
SOMETIMES the mandala is viewed from above, like the floor plan of a mansion. The Met's show includes several of these: spectacular, intricately detailed squares within circles, shimmering in a mosaic of red, yellow, blue, green, white. When Tibetan monks build their ornate sand mandalas, grain by colored grain, they use these floor plans, which have courtyards, gates, doorways, and an inner sanctum or altar.
Most of the paintings in the Met, however, show the mandala in elevation, as though we were arriving to visit the deity, who sits in an arch or portico on a sacred lotus throne. In one exquisite version owned by the Cleveland Museum of Art, "Green Tara" -- an olive-skinned goddess with a gentle smile -- sways gracefully in a filigreed grotto capped with delicate floral greenery.
In West and East, the religious artist's job is to bring the immaterial down to earth so that ordinary people can identify with spiritually extraordinary beings. Tibetan deities are known by their attributes, just as saints and angels are in the West. Elegant Manjushri, epitomizing wisdom, wields his great sword to cut the karmic bonds that tie us to suffering. Radiant Avalokiteshvara, embodying compassion, opens her 1,000 arms and hands to give mystical help wherever she is needed. (Tara is one of her manifestations.) The fierce Achala summons the psychological forces that help the meditator penetrate obscuring clouds of ego. More than 1,000 years before Freud, Buddhism proposed a model of the psyche that viewed nightmares as expressions of deluded minds, to be swept away by wisdom and compassion.
In other equally profound respects, 15th-century Tibet and the Netherlands are worlds apart. The West, still witch-obsessed, was just beginning to emerge from its medieval nightmares, epitomized by the hellish visions of Hieronymous Bosch and the horned mutant beasts that cluster around St. Anthony the Hermit in the Met's splendid altarpiece "The Penitence of St. Jerome." Damnation and salvation -- envisioned in a diptych by van Eyck, across the room from the Petrus Christus "Annunciation" -- were two inseparable realities.
"From van Eyck to Breughel" documents the changing cultural climate that we call the Renaissance. Artists began inserting breathing space -- the human body's perspective -- into the claustrophobic medieval schematic. The dawning of the Age of Reason gave new importance to individual faces. Although artists made Mary, Christ and the angels generic, they often painted ordinary men and women as recognizable characters borrowed from Netherlandish parlors and back streets. The most vivid realism is reserved for high clergy and layman donors -- the people paying the bills.
The Renaissance, argues the historian Lisa Jardine in her recent book "Worldly Goods," was driven mainly by market economics. In Ms. Jardine's radically materialist reading, trade and the emerging spirit of capitalism created a new reality of robber barons, venture capitalists, commodity dealers and bankers. Free trade was a guarantor of and spur to the free flow of ideas. A new "esthetic of expenditure" -- a "blurring of boundaries between piety and vanity," in her view -- filled Renaissance painting with luxury goods. Art works as shelter magazines: the 15th century turns out to look just like us.
Ms. Jardine may be reading the past through the filter of the present. Renaissance art took its faith for granted. In a stunning room at the Met filled with portraits, not all the sitters are rich, and even the obviously wealthy are radiant with reverence. Is van Eyck's painting of the wedding of the Arnolfinis a "celebration of ownership," as Ms. Jardine speculates? Or are we reducing all human qualities to market factors?
The West went on to create the greatest mercantile society the world has ever known. Tibet, locked in its high mountain land and populated by nomads and farmers, had no such option. The new ideas that swept through its courts from the seventh through the 12th centuries -- brought by famed traveling teachers -- came from spiritual centers in eastern India, site of the Buddha's enlightenment. By the time Mongol invasions wiped out Indian Buddhism in the 13th century, Tibet's flourishing monastic culture had established itself as the height of intellectual life throughout the region.
Tibetan painting doesn't evolve in the Western way. Its artists were monks; a display of individual ego would have been anathema. Nor does Tibetan monastic life and culture change much. After its renaissance, Tibet sheltered and perfected its spiritual mission, rejecting the outside world, secure in its time capsule, until the Chinese invasion in 1949.
Walking between these two exhibitions -- and using a hefty dose of hindsight -- I was struck that the seeds of Tibet's annihilation are visible in "From van Eyck to Breughel." Western materialism, in its dialectical Maoist version, fueled the Chinese invasion. In the mind of Karl Marx, that son of the Enlightenment, the material world is the only reality, so economics is fundamental. Class struggle, he said, is the only true human relationship; all else is false consciousness. As a pale-faced Mao hisses to the Dalai Lama in "Kundun": "Religion is poison . . . the opiate of the people."
The Dalai Lama has often said that one's enemies are one's best teachers. Certainly one's enemies give a brutally frank portrait of one's strengths and weaknesses. But maybe the Chinese should think twice about consequences. Dialectical materialism is erasing Tibetan Buddhism in its homeland but also dispersing it throughout the West. Two extremes -- Tibetan indifference to worldly things and Western obsession with them -- are meeting on common ground. And China is seeding the world with its own nemesis.
Amazing what an elevator ride can reveal.

HEADLINE: The View From/Ten Thousand Villages;
Hand-Made Craft Items From Around the World

BYLINE: By MIMI G. SOMMER 

 BODY:
IT is a special event when handcrafts from around the world not only appear on the Internet but also land on the doorstep of a nearby boutique.
And that is the service provided by Ten Thousand Villages, a shop at 1054 Chapel Street in New Haven, part of a national network of stores run by Mennonites, who use the proceeds to help people in developing countries. 
 In the New Haven shop -- the second to open in Connecticut (the first was in West Hartford) -- are sequined ornaments from Calcutta, banana raffia and muhugu wood sculptures from Kenya and exotic papers from Bangladesh.
More than 200 Ten Thousand Villages stores can be found in the United States and Canada, all with handmade inventories from more than 100 artisan cooperatives in largely rural and poor areas of 30 countries: Vietnam, Pakistan, Peru, Mexico, Chile, Kenya, Bangladesh and India among them.
The retail network is an arm of the Mennonite Central Committee, which has its headquarters in Akron, Pa. The Mennonites, Christians who believe in pacifism and in the separation of church and state, also believe in actively working to improve the quality of life in developing countries.
Prices paid for handcrafts are based on the locale's economic customs. Store prices reflect a markup that covers overhead. For each boutique, there are two paid staff members, a manager and assistant manager as well as volunteers.
The relationship between the retail world and the cooperatives means a living wage for the artisans and their families, the opportunity for people of different faiths to work together and the chance to keep artistic traditions alive. The handmade gifts and the stories behind their making offer customers lessons in cultural geography.
Why the name, Ten Thousand Villages? Mennonites cite Mahatma Gandhi as the inspiration: "I have believed and repeated times without number that India is not to be found in its few cities, but in the villages. We have hardly ever paused to inquire if these folks get sufficient to eat and clothe themselves with."
The network of retail stores was set up 53 years ago by Edna Ruth Byler, an embroiderer and member of the religious group's central committee. On a visit to Puerto Rico in 1946, she purchased needlework to sell to friends and neighbors at home. The idea mushroomed.
Liz Rider, manager of the Ten Thousand Villages store in New Haven describes her domain as a bazaar with the sights, sounds, and scents of a bustling marketplace. Indeed, on a recent visit, an intricately woven Nicaraguan ivory cotton hammock-turned-canopy floated above handcrafted merchandise of many colors. In one corner, rolls of textured gift-wrapping papers, embedded with leaves, ferns and flowers are displayed, all from Bangladesh. The paper is made from scraps of jute and water hyacinth weed. In an explanatory video, colorfully garbed women laboriously stir pulp ingredients in vats that seem to dwarf them.
Miss Rider explained that in many countries, women's handiwork is significant because women are often the sole supporters of their families. The Ashirwad cooperative in Calcutta (an exception to the village sites in that it is in a big city), produces sequined felt ornaments, kites and wall hangings -- all to win women independence and sufficient income to sustain and educate their families.
Jewelry makers from Taxco in Mexico produce pins, earrings, and necklaces from shell and silver. Videos, telling artisans' stories are available for viewing in the store.
In the shop, a sound like the rush of rain and sand can be heard. Someone is twirling a rain stick, a cactus that has been hollowed out, filled with seeds and spines, and sealed. The item comes from a cooperative in Chile.
The majority of items are made with an eye to environmental preservation. Kenyan woodcarvers, for example, are now using faster maturing woods, like jacaranda and muhugu, for creating animal figures. (Teak and ebony not only cost a great deal but the trees that provide the wood also require new protections if they are to renew themselves.
Prices at Ten Thousand Villages start at 50 cents (for a jute ring) and rise to $3,500 (for a wood giraffe from Kenya). Miss Rider said that all the products in the store are inspected and tested for safety. Toys are lead-free, as are ceramic wares.
In the shop on a recent visit was Marilyn Valenti, of New Haven, who bought an Indian silk scarf for $16.95. "It's beautiful," she said, as well as admitting to a longtime interest in handmade things from around the world.
And Tom Carberry, a Yale student from Tennessee, was buying a gift for a friend. "I'm a big fan of Epcot Center," he said. "But the things I like to get there are all here."

HEADLINE: Old Mill Town Has New Bustle, Thanks to Antiques

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
AT the start of the 1990's, Putnam, in the northeast corner of the state, was a prime example of an old mill town slowly dying. Its population was less than it had been at mid-century and since then had suffered through two catastrophic events, one natural, one manmade. The first was the great flood of the mid-1950's when the Quinebaug River leaped its banks and destroyed some 200 homes. The second was the post-World War II economic disaster, when textile companies that had fueled the economy of eastern Connecticut for generations started moving South because it was cheaper and warmer there.
The business district -- centered around the intersection of Main Street and Route 44 -- was a place of mercantile ghosts. National companies including Grant's and Montgomery Ward and local ones like Bugbee, a department store since 1880, were gone, leaving their names on buildings like tombstone markers. "Fifty percent of downtown was vacant," says Mayor Daniel S. Rovero, recalling the worst of times for his town. "And three of the six mills were totally empty." There was no question that if something didn't happen for the better, Putnam would continue to spiral downward. It would be, in the words of the Mayor, "unfortunately like lot of other towns today, lots of littering, lots of empty buildings." 
 But something did happen in Putnam. Over the brief time of Mr. Rovero's tenure as Mayor -- he is currently in the middle of his fourth two-year term -- Putnam has gone from one more old mill town rooted in an age that has long since passed to a new life predicated on, of all things, antiques.
"Now we call it the antiques center of New England," says Mayor Rovero.
Whatever it is called -- another popular description is "Putnam Is Antiques" -- there is no question that the town, population now about 9,000, is a heartening example of one that went from down to up dramatically and with one good idea.
Today, downtown Putnam, which basically is one big block, is occupied by antique stores or complementary businesses like crafts, framing and book stores, as well as six restaurants ranging in offerings from pizza and hamburgers to the upscale Vine Bistro where roasted rack of New Zealand spring lamb, "finished with the sauce of the moment," is available.
The antiques establishments vary from the Antiques Marketplace, which rents out space to 250 dealers, to the Putnam Antiques Exchange, which deals in "architectural elements" -- including an outdoor fountain of Italian marble or even an entire old barber shop -- to smaller establishments like Mrs. Bridge's Pantry, which specializes in items from the British Isles, with a nice cup of tea thrown in.
Not one shop in the cluster of some two dozen at the key intersection is vacant, Mayor Rovero says. "If someone moves out, someone else moves right in."
Particularly on weekends, the center of town is a bustling place, people scurrying around, into one building, then out, and into another. A big -- and free -- parking lot next to the old Victorian railroad station, is usually filled up, or close to it.
On weekdays, many of the cars have out-of-state plates. Greg Renshaw, who owns Putnam Antiques Exchange, says these cars are mostly owned by dealers trading with the Putnam dealers.
A major spinoff from the success of the antiques center, Mayor Rovero says, is that all six old mills in the town are now occupied -- for offices, storage, even for more antique stores, a situation quite unlike mills in some other Eastern Connecticut towns that have no present uses and are unheated and untended and slowly rotting away.
And yes, Putnam does have a Walmart, the traditional main foe of old town centers. It also has a KMart and a Super Shop & Shop, all in a mall away from the center. "The mall and the center complement each other here," says the Mayor.
The happy circumstance of an occupied, and taxpaying, town center and tax money from the mall have led to a new town-sponsored two-mile walk along the Quinebaug River. The walk helps to encourage visitors to make a full day out in Putnam when they go antiquing, says Putnam's civic economic development director, Elizabeth Murphy.
Another civic benefit is that the Bradley Playhouse, in the antiques district, has been resurrected. The Bradley was born as a vaudeville house in 1905, Ms. Murphy says. It eventually became a movie house, but was shut down in 1980. Now it is the Theater of Northeastern Connecticut and presents six productions each year. The first this year was "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof." The final was "A Christmas Carol" last month.
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the renaissance of Putnam is that in an era of town planners, economic surveys, viability studies and Federal and state aid, the town had none of the above.
Mayor Rovero, as the chief elected officer of Putnam, might be forgiven for taking a bit of credit for the revival. But, in a most unpolitical manner, he does not. The business people in the antiques district are responsible for rehabilitation of the area, he says. "None of them asked for special breaks," he said. "They did most of the work on their own and they did a great job."
The move to antiques, which he supported once it got started, was inspired by Jerry Cohen.
"Jerry Cohen is the king of Putnam," says David Hellman, proprietor of the Corner Cafe. "He had a certain vision."
So who is Jerry Cohen?
He is a native New Yorker who went to Oakland, Calif., and established a good business dealing in arts and crafts and furniture of the last century. Ten years ago, as he explains it, he and his wife, after the birth of their first son, decided to move back East to be near their families.
They settled in Woodstock and one day he came across the old Bugbee building in nearby Putnam, smack in the middle of what had once been a thriving commercial center.
"It was a grand old department store built in 1880 and I fell in love with it," he says. He had some money from the sale of his store in California and decided to buy it.
"I was thrilled but on the day of the closing a banker looked me in the eye and said, 'We appreciate you buying the building but why buy in a ghost town like Putnam?' "
The closing was in October 1990. For a year, Mr. Cohen says, he kept the building closed while he had it brought back to the grandeur of the past, with some modern refinements like good lighting and heating. "We took away 100 years of bad renovations, windows boarded up, dropped ceilings."
Occasionally someone would drop in with an opinion of the work in progress and its future. "Are you out of your mind? This isn't Boston. You must be losing your marbles."
In November 1991 the building was reopened as the Antiques Marketplace. Mr. Cohen's idea had been to lease out most of the 26,000 square feet of space to small dealers. Almost immediately, he knew he had guessed right.
"Within 90 days we rented every space," he said, "and every dealer said, 'This is a phenomenal place.' And then other dealers started coming in with tape measures and cameras. We broke the mold of the antique mall as a musty old warehouse with showcases made out of two-by-four pine boards."
The Marketplace is not a great revenue producer for him, Mr. Cohen adds, and he does not regard it as his living because he also kept the business he brought from California.
"It's really a labor of love." he says of the Putnam business. In the section of the building he retained for himself, "We do $1.6 million in business a year, and we net $15,000."
But the old building remains very important to him. "I have 250 dealers here and I have a paternal feeling toward them," he said.
And he is proud that his effort, in less than a decade, has attracted so many businesses around it, to a little downtown that was a short time ago considered near to dead.
"I think people feel better about their town," he said. "In the past, when you asked them about it, they would just look at you. Now they say what a great little place this is."

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
A YEAR from today, the so-called millennium bug computer time bomb will have exploded, and if the experts are correct, our microprocessor-dependent society will be experiencing the greatest collective headache in history.
Computer chips, billions of them, are responsible for the operation of everything from strategic nuclear weapons to supermarket doors, and when the calendar flips over from 1999 to 2000, an unknown number of them will no longer be able to recognize the date, resulting in various degrees of failure. In fact, some glitches are already occurring. Some are amusing, as in the case of the nonagenarian gentleman who received a notice to report for kindergarten orientation. Others are far more ominous. If you thought El Nino was bad, just wait. 
 Annoyance ahead, or Gotterdammerung? "The simple answer is nobody knows," said George Scott, a professor of management information systems at the University of Connecticut. "The other answer is it is a real problem."
Hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent by the state, local governments and businesses in Connecticut to prepare for Y2K, the ubiquitous abbreviation for Year 2000. While the state government, many local governments and many businesses are well prepared to deal with it -- as well prepared as is possible, that is -- a good number are not.
Individuals have been warned to be prepared, as well, by taking a few common-sense preventive measures. Edward J. Deak, a professor of economics at Fairfield University who testified before a United States Senate subcommittee hearing on the problem last February, said the ordinary person would definitely notice the effects, but he laughed at concerns that it would be the end of the world. "For the average person, it will be annoying but not a financial disaster," Dr. Deak said.
Others on the Y2K battle's front lines were similarly reassuring. "Most people will experience inconveniences here and there, depending on who they're connected to electronically," said Peter Sullivan, the project leader for the state government's Year 2000 preparations.
"Most automobiles will not be affected," he added. "That's good news." Because most cars nowadays have computer chips in them that regulate the engines, there were fears of massive car die-outs after the calendar turned.
Experts said the average citizen should spend 1999 compiling an inventory of any property for which ownership is recorded electronically, such as investment portfolios and bank accounts, and have reliable records fully updated as of Dec. 31, 1999. Similarly, having copies of bill payments and tax returns is a wise precaution. Anyone receiving pension or government benefit checks should keep records of them, too.
That way, Dr. Deak said, if a computer makes a mistake, a person has a starting point for reconstructing his or her holdings and liabilities, and proof for claims and payments.
"I would have a little extra cash on hand, just in case," said Mr. Sullivan. "Not a lot. Just in case there's a problem with cash machines and credit cards."
The state's Department of Information Technology has a Web site that offers advice for businesses and local governments on how to prepare for the bite of the millennium bug, and Mr. Sullivan said he plans to add information for individuals.
But home computers are presumably less vulnerable than large mainframe machines that keep government and business records, because most are already "Year 2000 compliant," meaning that their microprocessors and software have been designed to recognize the date change. All Macintosh computers are presumed safe, but not all of those with Microsoft's Windows operating systems, especially older machines.
"If you have an old 386 system from 10 years ago you probably have a problem," Dr. Deak said.
Software for Windows that can be used to test one's computer can be downloaded off the Internet or bought in stores. Dr. Deak warned against setting a computer's clock ahead, to the end of the year to test it, because if there is a problem it could corrupt programs and files stored on it.
Besides the processing glitches that may occur, there is also the enormous cost of fixing millions of computers -- not to mention the torrent of lawsuits that may result. Dr. Deak said the most reliable estimate he has heard is that the technical work will cost the world's economy a $1 trillion, and $600 billion beyond that for liability claims.
"I don't look at somebody suing me," he said, but he might have to sue a bank if it lost track of his money.
That doesn't mean that a widespread bank failure is imminent, however. "What we're hearing is that banks are about as well prepared as anyone," said Roberta Burntower, a spokeswoman for People's Bank. She said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has required banks to make their computers Year 2000-compliant, and has inspected them to assure they have done so.
Aside from the huge known costs of compliance, Dr. Scott noted, a hidden cost is that of deferred improvements and repairs. For local government that might mean increasing class sizes in schools and putting off neighborhood improvements. For the state it might mean the depletion of the budget surplus without any improvement in services and make tax cuts impossible. For businesses it will surely mean that improvements or new ventures that could have increased profits won't be done.
The state legislature has appropriated $95 million for fixing the state's computer systems, with millions more coming out of different departmental budgets, and Mr. Sullivan said the Department of Information Technology would ask for more money in the next year's budget. He said the latest estimate is that it will cost state taxpayers $147 million, barring unexpected glitches, which he said are virtually inevitable.
All the state's 40,000 desktop computers have had to be tested, and those that fail either replaced or repaired.
The state's computer systems have been triaged into those considered mission critical systems -- the 50 systems with the highest performance priority, including child-support enforcement and pension benefits; those for which remediation can be delayed because no one's life or welfare depends on them, and those that either cannot be tested at all or can't be made compliant and tested in time.
Eleven states, including Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont, were unable to meet a Federal Labor Department deadline for having their unemployment benefit system compliant by the end of 1998. This is a problem because the period for receiving benefits will now extend into 2000, and their computers may refuse to pay legitimate claims. Connecticut was expected to meet the deadline, but had not done so by late in December.
Mr. Sullivan said contingency plans have been developed for all the bureaucratic functions that depend on computers. The state has set March 31 as the deadline for the completion of testing of its 50 highest-priority computer systems.
The state and the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities are concerned that some local governments may have waited too long or lack the resources to meet the challenges of Y2K. There are fears of malfunctioning traffic lights, disorganized town offices, and even raw sewage spills.
According to the conference's spokesman, Kevin Maloney, as of last August, 40 percent of the towns had made no effort at all, and only 9 percent had done any contingency planning.
Mr. Maloney says he believes many towns are still behind. He said his organization would ask the state legislature to authorize the use of money from its municipal capital improvement program to help towns pay for Y2K repairs.
A few communities are well along, however. Hartford began working on the problem four years ago and expects to have all its systems fixed and tested by the summer. "Having the ability of hindsight, I guess we made the right decision," said Albert Ouellette, Hartford's director of information services.
One of the most ominous parts of the problem involves what are known as embedded computer chips. These are microprocessors that are date-dependent, but often do not provide any evidence of their existence. A substantial number of microwave ovens, or example, may stop working when the calendar turns, as may security alarm systems, heating systems, traffic lights and pollution control equipment.
While the failure to reheat leftovers may be annoying, however, it is hardly of the same significance as millions of tons of raw sewage fouling rivers and Long Island Sound.
Mr. Maloney said there aren't any reliable estimates of how much it will cost Connecticut's 169 municipalities to fix their computers. Stonington, relatively small, has estimated its cost at $250,000, and many other communities expect to spend more than $1 million each.
On top of that there are the legal liability costs in case, for example, someone's house burns down because fire engines aren't dispatched. Probably most maddening about the millennium computer bug is the amount of uncertainty.
"Nobody can tell you with 100 percent certainty what's going to happen with computer systems," said Dr. Deak.
The prudent are expecting the unexpected. Mr. Ouellette said Hartford has contingency plans on how to deal with the effects of its neighboring communities' problems.
"Worst case, the power goes out," he said. "We've been there and done that, haven't we?"
But what does he expect to happen? "Something less than that," Mr. Ouellette said.

HEADLINE: To Burnish the Loop, Chicago Turns to Live Theater

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
IN an effort to revive the downtown Loop commercial district as an entertainment area and add a substantial new tourist attraction, Chicago is betting heavily on live theater.
The centerpiece of the plan is a theater district along Randolph Street that includes the newly renovated Oriental Theater as well as two projects that are currently under way -- restoring the historic Palace Theater and building a two-theater complex for the Goodman Theater, the city's oldest and largest nonprofit ensemble. 
 In addition, the city recently finished an elaborate streetscape improvement project along eight blocks of Randolph Street. It includes new sidewalks and streetlights as well as colorful banners and signs ballyhooing the district.
Over all, the city has put about $60 million into the project, much in the form of tax-increment financing.
"The idea is to make the Loop a 24-hour neighborhood, and we think theaters will do that," said Christopher Hill, the city's Planning Commissioner.
"When everything is in place, people will be buying upwards of 15,000 tickets a day on Randolph Street," said Daniel P. Coffey, president of Daniel P. Coffey & Associates, the architecture firm that is renovating the Palace Theater. Mr. Coffey's firm also did the Oriental Theater, which reopened this fall.
The theater district is the crest of a sudden wave of new live-theater development downtown.
Two other theaters -- the Chicago Theater on State Street and the Arie Crown Theater at the McCormick Place convention center -- were recently renovated. A third project, construction of a home for the nonprofit Shakespeare Repertory Theater, is under way at the nearby Navy Pier.
Many of the downtown projects are partnerships that involve both private developers and the theater companies or managers and producers that will eventually be the tenants. An example is the renovation of the Palace, which is part of a hotel and office building that dates from 1926.
The entire complex was acquired early last year by Pal/Met Venture, a real estate partnership of the developer Michael Moyer and the VanKampen family. The hotel -- formerly the Bismarck and now called the Allegro -- reopened earlier this year. The Palace, a 2,350-seat former vaudeville house that has been closed many years, will follow this summer, and the office building sometime in 2000. The total cost of the project is $75 million, including $21.5 million for the theater. Fox Theatricals, the Palace's tenant, is putting up $4 million, and the whole project received $17.6 million in tax increment financing from the city.
Fox is a locally based production firm that began in the early 1980's and has been a major player in the Off-Loop theater scene, the Chicago parallel to Off Broadway. The company has also done several productions on Broadway, including the current musical "Jekyll & Hyde."
Fox has the theater for 98 years. "We structured it as two 49-year leases," said Michael Leavitt, executive producer of Fox. "Effectively, it's like owning the building."
Mr. Leavitt said the Palace would be used for Fox productions as well as for touring Broadway shows. "We've designed the house so that it can hold just about any production," he said. "We've expanded the stage depth to 45 feet and added three loading docks. It's very presenter friendly."
The other two projects under way are the Goodman and the Shakespeare Repertory.
The Goodman, which occupies a half block at Randolph and Dearborn streets, has been in the works many years. Its cost is $44 million, of which $18.8 million is coming from the city. The rest is being raised in a fund-raising campaign. Half the site is vacant; the other half is occupied by two small historic theaters, the Harris and the Selwyn.
The Selwyn is being renovated into a 400-seat studio theater, while all but the Beaux-Arts facade of the Harris has been torn down. The rest of the project consists of a new 800-seat main auditorium as well as a lobby and administrative space. The complex will also include about 50,000 square feet of rentable retail space on three levels.
Part of the site was once occupied by the Garrick Theater, which was designed by Louis Sullivan in 1892. The theater was razed in the 1960's over the protests of preservationists and eventually replaced with a parking lot.
According to Roche Schulfer, managing director of the Goodman, the theater will own the building and have a 99-year lease on the land. The architects for the project, which is expected to be finished in the fall of 2000, are Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects of Toronto and Decker Legge Kemp Architecture of Chicago.
THE Shakespeare Repertory project is the final piece of the redevelopment of Navy Pier, which began several years ago. The pier, which extends into Lake Michigan, is just northeast of the Loop and has been turned into an urban amusement park with numerous shops and restaurants.
The pier is controlled by the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, which has proposed several plans over the years to bring live theater to the Pier before signing a deal with the Shakespeare company in 1997.
Shakespeare Repertory, which was founded 12 years ago but has never had a permanent home, is Chicago's third-largest nonprofit theater.
The new complex, which will open next fall, will have a 550-seat main auditorium and a 350-seat studio theater. The cost is $26 million. In exchange for a 90-year lease, Shakespeare Repertory is putting up $12 million.
"It's a perfect model of the public and private sectors working together," said Criss Henderson, executive director of Shakespeare Repertory. "Metropolitan Pier is building the shell, and we're doing the interior."
When the dust finally settles at the turn of the century, Chicago will have added 10,000 live theater seats downtown on an existing base of about 15,000 seats.
According to the League of Chicago Theaters, a trade group that runs several half-price ticket booths downtown, the Chicago area currently has about 54,000 live theater seats.
Can the city support the new activity? It depends on whom you talk to. There is little consensus, even among theater professionals.
N EW theaters coming on line do not scare me," said Dulcie Gilmore, general manager of the Oriental Theater, which is also known as the Ford Center for the Performing Arts and is owned and managed by Livent. "What scares me is the availability of product. It's almost totally tied to what gets produced in New York. If New York dries up, it's a problem."
"If you talk to performing-arts centers anywhere in the country that rely on blockbuster Broadway shows, you can hear the panic in their voices," said Douglas Kridler, president of the Columbus Association of Performing Arts, based in Columbus, Ohio, which recently took over the Chicago Theater. "I don't think Broadway is going to go into free fall, but there is a drought in mega-musicals."
Mr. Kridler added that the Chicago plans to sidestep this problem with a booking philosophy that stresses "a wide variety of arts and entertainment events," including theater, dance, music and, possibly, film.
Others, however, see it differently. "If you pick up the weekend entertainment section in New York, how many good or great plays are being presented at any one time? It's a lot more than three or four," said Robert Wislow, chairman of U.S. Equities Realty, a real estate firm that worked with the city to devise the plan for the theater district. "Up until now, Chicago has never had the houses to support this level of activity. Now we do. I don't really understand what we're worried about."

HEADLINE: Clearing the Tracks for Penn Station III

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
AFTER six years of pushing and pulling, negotiators believe they have arrived at a workable division of the General Post Office in Manhattan, allowing it to remain a hub of mail service even as it is transformed into a new version of the lost Pennsylvania Station.
The Postal Service and the Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation are now talking about how to share the building rather than how to partition it. The distinction is more than semantic. 
 Instead of searching for a sharp line demarcating post office from train station, the designers have found ways in which passenger movement and mail handling can overlap in the massive neo-Classical structure, known formally as the James A. Farley Building.
"We've mixed and marbleized the cake," said Robert A. Peck, the Federal Commissioner of Public Buildings, after a meeting Dec. 21 at which agreement was reached on the general layout of the building.
With the agreement in hand, the architects and engineers can now begin a detailed redesign of the space within the 1.4 million-square-foot Farley Building. In broad outline, it will have these features:
The main entrances for Amtrak passengers will be on 31st and 33d Streets, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. Driveways on both streets will lead to a 300-foot ticketing hall -- as long as the main waiting room of the original Pennsylvania Station.
Passengers arriving on foot will be able to use entrances under the niches on either side of the grand Eighth Avenue staircase. The window-service postal lobby at the top of those stairs will remain. (See you there April 15, 2003.)
Passengers arriving on the Eighth Avenue subway will be able to enter the Farley Building on an extension of the Long Island Rail Road's West End Concourse. Those arriving on the Seventh Avenue line would come through the existing Penn Station, which will remain in use by New Jersey Transit and the L.I.R.R.
From the ticketing hall, passengers will proceed into a 160-by-205-foot atrium on the Eighth Avenue side of the building, at the base of which will be a terraced series of three concourses cascading down to the train platforms, some of which will be visible through skylights. The platforms, which already extend westward from the existing station, will be reached by stairway, escalator or elevator.
"You'll actually be able to see the trains as you're waiting," said David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, part of the team redesigning the space in the building.
No one involved in the project presumes to say that this concourse will make New Yorkers forget the glory of McKim, Mead & White's original, which was torn down in the early 1960's. But they are quick to note that it will share the quality of bringing daylight and visibility down to track level.
More than esthetics are served by this gesture. It will make it easy for travelers -- particularly those arriving at the station for the first time -- to orient themselves, unlike the current maze, which is closer to a hamster run than a great train shed.
Taking its cue from airports, Amtrak will build pre-boarding lounges on the intermediate concourse level for intercity trains. Commuters will use the lower concourse.
Pennsylvania Station would also become an important destination for air travelers early in the next century, on completion of rail lines planned to link Newark International Airport to Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains and Kennedy International Airport to the Long Island Rail Road.
Just how much the Farley Building project will cost has yet to be determined, since the detailed design work is only now beginning. Earlier estimates put the price tag at $315 million. Officials hope to open the new station in December 2002.
To accommodate the ticketing hall, the Postal Service will move many of its truck docks into a new space below grade on the Ninth Avenue end of the building, reached by ramps paralleling 31st and 33d Streets. To free up the interior courtyard for use as a concourse, the Postal Service will move the letter-carrier sorting stations into workrooms on the Ninth Avenue side.
"What's key is a phasing plan that will allow postal operations to continue," said Rudy Umscheid, vice president of facilities at the Postal Service. "We don't want to compromise mail service during construction. And we don't want to compromise the potential for mail service in the future."
Having said that, he added, "Everyone wants this project to be successful."
FOR their part, state officials have temporarily set aside the idea of building 200,000 square feet of retail space as part of the station, which was proposed to help finance the project. "The short-term compromise will help us achieve a greater development in the future," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the redevelopment agency and its corporate parent, the Empire State Development Corporation. Among other things, that compromise helped pave the way for the Dec. 21 accord.
"It means we are definitely going to move forward," Mr. Gargano said.
Six years have already passed since a plan was first announced to improve Amtrak's passenger areas by building a new concourse in the General Post Office.
"It occurred to me that there was a monumental building that kind of looked like a station right above the platforms," recalled Fred Bartoli, the manager of high-speed rail and facility programs in Amtrak's Metropolitan Division.
What made the idea so appealing was that it offered a kind of redemption for the demolition of the original station. "You don't get a second chance like this often," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
Designed by McKim, Mead & White, the Farley Building opened in 1914 as a companion piece to the station. A Ninth Avenue annex was added in 1935. Above a portico of tree-sized Corinthian columns is inscribed the famous "Neither snow nor rain" motto. The Farley Building was one of the earliest designated landmarks, protected by a law that had been prompted in part by the demolition of the station across the street.
In retrospect, the inscription was a bit of a warning sign. Postal officials are quite attached to the Farley Building; not only because it has vast work floors and dozens of truck bays but because it is a national cynosure, the grandest of the grand old post offices. Some families have worked in the building for two or three generations.
Because it was moving some operations out of Farley to the Morgan General Mail Facility annex at Ninth Avenue and 29th Street, the Postal Service had subscribed nominally to the station expansion plan from the outset. But the path from generalities to specifics turned out to be tortuous.
POSTAL officials were offended by what they regarded as cavalier incursions into their space by people who had no idea how a post office operated. And they resented implications that the General Post Office was inefficient or unnecessary.
"It probably wasn't being utilized to its fullest efficiency," Mr. Umscheid said, "but the fact is that there has been a growth in mail volume and services over time."
Meanwhile, economic development officials and civic leaders were growing impatient with what they saw as bureaucratic intransigence impeding the conversion of an antiquated structure into an urban dynamo.
"Postal Service bureaucrats go, well, they go postal when the plan is mentioned," said a 1997 editorial in The Daily News, whose offices are near the Farley Building.
By late 1997, horns were locked. The Postal Service insisted it could not give up more than one quarter of the Farley Building (350,000 square feet) and the redevelopment agency insisted it would need half.
The Municipal Art Society went so far as to propose emptying Farley of all postal operations except the service windows on Eighth Avenue and turning it into a station, civic center, postal museum and mall.
The White House dispatched Mr. Peck, of the Federal Public Buildings Service, to broker a compromise. "Shuttle diplomacy wasn't working," he said. "It was more like long-range shelling."
In August, the Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation designated an architectural and engineering team headed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Parsons Brinckerhoff, with Castro-Blanco Piscioneri & Associates, Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates and Ove Arup & Partners.
A joint management committee was also formed that month, bringing postal officials and state officials to the same table. "There is a different tone now," Mr. Peck said. "They're fully committed."
Both sides credit the architects with helping them find the common ground necessary to apportion the building. "S.O.M. has been key in putting on their wisdom-of-Solomon hats," Mr. Umscheid said.
Marilyn Jordan Taylor, a partner in the Skidmore firm, likened the process to solving a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, made easier to solve because "a lot of people in the post office rolled up their sleeves and were ready to take a fresh look."
One big piece of the puzzle was the truck docks on the ground floor, which an earlier redevelopment plan had proposed to eliminate in favor of a pedestrian arcade. "Without the docks, the building has no functional value," said David Eales, the manager of realty assets for the Postal Service.
John D. T. Gerber, senior vice president of the redevelopment corporation, said there was a "great deal of competition" for the ground-floor space.
The solution involves the construction of new loading docks below grade, while keeping some supplemental docks on the ground floor level for extra-long tractor-trailer trucks that could not make a sharp turn on the ramps. Reducing the area of the ground-floor docks will permit construction of a grand ticketing hall.
For the time being, at least, the Postal Service will not be ceding more than 350,000 square feet, although it acknowledges that it may be possible to move other operations out of the Farley Building over time.
"Our plans describe a project of independent utility that we can begin very shortly," said Alexandros E. Washburn, president of the redevelopment corporation. "That doesn't preclude us from weighing options for the eventual reuse of the entire Farley Building.
"Postal operations seem to me more and more a form of transportation," he said. "And what we are basically trying to do is improve transportation for New York City."
An advocacy group called the Committee for Better Transit fears that the Farley concourses may create as many problems as they solve. Among their concerns is that moving Amtrak across Eighth Avenue will make it harder to reach from the Sixth and Seventh Avenue subways, leading in turn to more taxi and auto trips, thereby worsening traffic and air pollution.
Amtrak also has concerns about the mid-block ticketing hall. "It has to look like a main entrance," Mr. Bartoli said. At the same time, it cannot compete too strongly with the renowned Eighth Avenue facade.
The railroad expects some back-and-forth over the arrangement of ticket counters and the location of stairways, elevators and escalators. But it is generally satisfied with the plans drawn up by the redevelopment corporation, Mr. Bartoli said.
Walter R. Ernst, the general manager of Amtrak's Metropolitan Division, recalled that the project could be traced to a need, recognized a decade ago, for better access to the platforms below and more waiting room in the station above. "When the Farley project is completed," he said, "you'll have greatly improved vertical circulation."
"Everybody needs to deal with the problem of making Penn Station better able to handle significant peaking levels of passengers," Mr. Ernst said. Designed for a steady flow of intercity trains through the day, the station was not equipped to handle waves of commuter trains discharging or boarding more than 1,000 passengers at once.
OTHER projects have been undertaken to improve conditions.
* The Long Island Rail Road, which operates 542 of the 882 trains that run through the station every weekday, completed a $190 million renovation in 1994. Designed by TAMS, it includes a new central corridor, a new vaulted ceiling for the connecting corridor and more platform access. A 90-foot-high entrance structure on 34th Street, by R. M. Kliment & Frances Halsband Architects, restored some small sense of the station as an important gateway. The L.I.R.R. also built the West End Concourse to Tracks 13 through 21.
* New Jersey Transit, which operates 219 trains daily, has begun a $105 million waiting room and East End Concourse, to open in 2001. A steel canopy over the concourse, leading to Tracks 1 through 12, is meant to evoke somewhat the look of the old station. The architects are Sverdrup & Parcel.
* Amtrak, which operates 121 trains daily, has begun a $37.5 million renovation of the existing concourse, including three new escalators and a waiting area for passengers boarding the high-speed trains that are to begin running along the Northeast Corridor later this year. The architects are Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum.
All but invisible to passengers is another critical improvement, the $100 million upgrade to a switching and signaling system that was essentially unchanged since the station opened in 1910.
The work done by five control towers in Manhattan and Long Island City, Queens, has been consolidated in a computerized operating "theater" at the Claytor-Scannell Control Center at Ninth Avenue and 31st Street, a joint venture between Amtrak and the L.I.R.R. It opened in 1994.
Dispatchers work at consoles in front of a 70-foot-long illuminated board that shows the position of every train coming into or out of Pennsylvania Station, from Morrisville, Pa., to New Rochelle, N.Y.
Impressive as this center is, it would not be enough in itself. "Whatever is done to improve the signal system goes for nought," Mr. Ernst said, "if you can't deliver people and get them off the platforms quickly."

HEADLINE: Newspapers That Speak In Tongues

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: BASKING RIDGE

 BODY:
IN a blue colonial on a quiet street in this Somerset County suburb, the last 10 days of the month are always hectic for Dr. Arturo Roberts. That's when, and where, he publishes a monthly newspaper called Ninnau.
Although the masthead says it is "The North American Welsh Newspaper," its readers are also to be found in Wales and other Welsh enclaves including Patagonia in Argentina where Dr. Roberts was born and grew up. (Ninnau, pronounced NIN-eye, means "We also" in Welsh.) 
 Dr. Roberts, a physician who worked for many years in the pharmaceutical industry, created Ninnau in 1975 because he felt there was a need for a "means of communication among people in the Welsh community worldwide." And he has been editing and publishing it ever since with the help of his family.
"This is a hobby," said Dr. Roberts, noting that circulation and advertising revenues barely cover expenses. "This is a labor of love."
His newspaper, which has a circulation of 3,500, is one of many throughout New Jersey that try to address the concerns of specific nationalities in a state whose immigrant population is the fifth largest in the nation.
Some are long-established papers such as The Italian Tribune News in Newark (1931), The Post Eagle in Clifton (1962), and The Slovak Catholic Falcon in Passaic (1911). Others reflect newer waves of immigration, like The New Jersey China Times in Edison (1995) and Tiranga in New Jersey in Rahway(1998), for the Indian population.
Perhaps the most vibrant journalism right now is the Latino press, with more than a dozen newspapers competing for readers including Continental News Weekly, El Especial, El Extra, Mensaje, La Tribuna, and La Voz.
"These little newspapers provide havens in a heartless world," said Sig Gissler, a professor at the Columbia University School of Journalism and former editor of The Milwaukee Journal. "There's news about their old country and news about their new community that they often can't get in the mainstream press."
Professor Gissler, who teaches a course called "Race and Ethnicity in the New Urban American," added, "I call these heartbeat publications. They try to maintain the heartbeat of their culture."
Just before World War I, there were 1,300 foreign-language newspapers being published in the United States, almost 40 percent of them in German. As each new nationality arrived, other papers sprung up. By mid-century, restrictive immigration laws and depression had caused the number to dwindle to about 120 German publications, 13 of them dailies, and 100 other foreign-language dailies.
Today, the Gale Directory of Publications and Broadcast Media lists 237 foreign-language newspapers and 210 such magazines in the United States. (Those figures do not take into account either the Jewish press or black publications.)
The exact number published in New Jersey is difficult to determine, but a review of Gale's, Editor & Publisher Yearbook, and telephone data banks indicates there are at least 30. The papers range from humble shoppers distributed free to substantial publications with large paid circulations and national and local advertising.
The advertising can be just as important as the news, both to the papers' survival and to the communities they serve. It helps ethnic businesses that cannot afford to advertise in the mainstream press reach out to customers and it provides direct access to lucrative markets for nonethnic businesses. For example, nationwide "the Latino market has over $300 billion in purchasing power and is way over 28 million strong," said Ralph Ortiz of the Hudson Advertising Group.
Just because a newspaper is small or is given away, he added, its influence is not to be scorned.
"Some of these papers are free, but they have great influence in the civic, the political and religious affairs of the community," Mr. Ortiz said.
Barbara Straus Reed, an associate professor of journalism at Rutgers University, said the new ethnic papers do what such papers have always done: speak out when the minority culture sees its rights threatened, as well as teach the language and customs of the new country. They also help transmit the community's heritage by publishing profiles of successful immigrants and highlighting celebrations.
"Those are very important events for whole communities intergenerationally to bond together," she said. "The paper serves as a central source for doing that."
Here is a look at some of the papers that reach out from New Jersey to readers from around the world:
 
140 Years in German
The Freie Zeitung, possibly the oldest ethnic newspaper published in New Jersey and the only German-language paper published in the state today, began in 1858 in Newark and continued as a daily until 1932, when it went weekly.
The current editor and publisher, Eberhard Schweizer, a German-born toolmaker who owns the M.S. Tool Company in Kennilworth, bought the paper in 1963 as a kind of gift for his stepfather, Helmut Heimsch.
"My stepfather worked for the newspaper as a part-time sports editor," Mr. Schweizer recalled. "When the publisher died, I bought the paper so my stepfather could have a full-time job."
After Mr. Heimsch's death in 1978, a number of German organizations encouraged Mr. Schweizer to continue the paper and he has, often subsidizing it out of his own pocket. It is now published out of his tool company by three employees and has 6,000 subscribers along the East Coast.
Asked about the paper's greatest accomplishment, Mr. Schweizer said: "That we are able to keep the newspaper going. It is not an easy task because there are not that many immigrants coming to this country because of the immigration law the way it is, and we have older readers who moved or passed away."
 
Two for Ukrainians
The Ukrainian National Association, a fraternal organization in Parsippany, publishes two papers: Svoboda Ukrainian Weekly, which is written in the Ukrainian language, and The Ukrainian Weekly, an English-language cousin. Each has a circulation of about 7,500 in the United States and Canada.
Svoboda started as a daily in Jersey City in 1893 but last July it became a weekly, according to Roma Hadzewycz, editor-in-chief of the Ukrainian Weekly.
Her own paper began in 1933; much of its early coverage was devoted to a famine in the Ukraine that was not being reported by the mainstream press.
In October 1997, the association moved its newspapers from its 15-story headquarters on Exchange Place to a smaller building in Morris County for economic reasons and to follow its readers to the suburbs.
Ms. Hadzewycz, 43, who was born in the United States, began work in 1977 at the Ukrainian Weekly part-time while studying for her master's degree in journalism at New York University.
"I love this job," she said. "I love this community. Every week I see the results of my efforts and every week I feel I've given something back to my community. I feel the paper is needed and I'm doing a service."
 
Portuguese Competition
Luso Americano, a Portuguese-language paper published in the Ironbound section of Newark, was founded in 1928 but subsequently declined. It was taken over and revived in 1939 by Vasco Jardim, an immigrant from Madeira who had worked as a journalist in New Bedford, Mass.
His son, Ed Jardim, a retired copy editor of the New York Daily News Magazine, recalls his parents scrambling to make ends meet, running a print shop and doing other jobs. "My father did travel," he said. "My mother did insurance."
On Mr. Jardim's retirement, his son-in-law, Antonio Matinho, an engineer by training who had worked at the paper since 1960, assumed control and is director and editor in chief. His wife, Natalie, Vasco Jardim's daughter, is managing editor. Their son, Paul, 32, is general manager, and another son, David, 30, is production manager.
Luso Americano publishes twice a week, averages 72 pages, sells for 50 cents and has 35,000 circulation, primarily in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. It also sends 300 copies to Portugal and Brazil. It employs 21 people, including 7 editors and reporters and has 44 correspondents throughout the United States.
"We pride ourselves on opening up the opportunities for people to make up their own minds," Mr. Matinho said.
The Portuguese Post, which considers itself Luso Americano's main competition, was started in 1987 by a group of Portuguese businessmen and is owned now by Antonio Seabra, an entrepreneur who runs a number of supermarkets and restaurants.
The paper, a weekly, averages about 56 pages, sells for 50 cents and has a circulation of 10,000, according to Lisa Coelho, a spokesperson for the Seabra Group.
Pedro Bento, the 26-year-old editor, said that Luso Americano was too much a part of the establishment and that his newspaper was more likely to stir things up.
"We're more aggressive," said Mr. Bento, who has a staff of six.
The Post is affiliated with a cable television channel, RTP-USA, with which it shares quarters in the Ironbound. RTP, which is part of the Seabra Group, stands for Radio Television Portugal and serves the Portuguese and Brazilian communities in New Jersey. For an average of 11 hours a day, it broadcasts programming from Portugal augmented by community programs, including a public affairs program moderated by Mr. Bento.
RTP-USA says it serves 130,000 viewers in 14 New Jersey communities, including Newark with 36,000 viewers and Elizabeth with 24,000, and is planning an expansion to 29 others.
 
For Cubans and Others
La Tribuna, the oldest Spanish-language newspaper published in New Jersey, was founded in Newark in 1962 by a Cuban immigrant, Carlos Vidot, for Cubans who moved here after the Bay of Pigs invasion.
Ruth Molenaar, who had been publishing a real-estate magazine, bought La Tribuna in 1988. Published in Union City, it comes out twice a month and has a circulation of 53,000 in Hudson, Bergen, Essex and Passaic Counties. It also has readers in Manhattan, Miami, California, Texas and Puerto Rico.
Ms. Molenaar, who was born of a Dutch father and Dominican mother and grew up in Aruba, said her readers included Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Colombians, Ecuadoreans and Peruvians.
When the mayor of Union City put planters along Bergenline Avenue, La Tribuna said the money would have been better spent cleaning the streets. Another editorial argued that nationality groups, not the city, should clean up after their parades.
"We don't use the newspaper to insult anyone," Ms. Molenaar said. "We don't use inappropriate language, and we have been in business for 36 years without missing an edition and that's quite an accomplishment."
 
The Filipino Express
The Filipino Express, an English-language weekly, was established in 1986 after the Marcos regime fell, because its founder, Lito Gajilan, wanted to make sure Filipino-Americans were receiving news from the Phillipines.
The newspaper, which has three full-time employees, including Mr. Gajilan's daughter Arlyn, who is managing editor, is operated out of RTA Travel in Jersey City, the agency Mr. Gajilan established in 1983.
The paper, which sells for a dollar, has a nationwide circulation of 19,000. About 6,500 papers are sold in New Jersey, 4,900 in New York and 3,500 in California. Other readers -- a lot of other readers -- visit the paper's Web site (www.filipinoexpress.com), which was set up in 1996.
"When we first set up our Web site we received a lot of good comment," he said. "Some 340,000 people looked at the Web site, people all around the world. That's pretty good for a small ethnic newspaper."
Mr. Gajilan runs editorials and columns that do not shy away from criticizing Filipine or American officials, and in the paper's early years, he said, he received a number of threats.
"I just continued, even though a lot of money comes from my own pocket, just so the paper would survive," Mr. Gajilan said. "You prove something, that your paper is always there every week."
 
Today, for Italians
When 23 Newspaper Guild employees were dismissed for going on strike in 1988 by Il Progresso, the leading Italian newspaper at the time, they pooled their resources and started their own newspaper, America Oggi.
"We tried to scratch up $5,000 each," said Andrea Mantineo, former managing editor of Il Progresso and now America Oggi's editor and president. "We worked for free for about five months using the small credit line we could get."
Il Progresso went out of business, but America Oggi (Oggi means today) now has a circulation of 45,000. Mr. Mantineo said it is the only Italian-language paper outside Italy that publishes daily.
The paper, published in Westwood, has 40 employees, sells for $1 daily and $1.50 Sunday. Thirty-five percent of its readers live in New Jersey, 40 percent in New York.
"We're not making a profit," Mr. Mantineo said. "We are surviving in that we have been growing slowly but surely. "We feel we do something very important for them. You can feel from the number of calls and letters we get that we provide something they can't find anywhere else."
 
Giving Indians an Outlet
Tiranga means "Tricolor," a reference to the Indian flag, which is red, white and green. "Tiranga in New Jersey" is an English-language newspaper for Asian Indians that was begun last August.
It was born because Joe Renna, an Italian-American graphics designer who owns Rentec Design Studio in Rahway, wanted to place an ad for a computer operator in an Indian newspaper but he couldn't find one. Instead he placed an ad in The Star Ledger for a partner to help start his own paper.
Responding was Nitin Gurjar of Jersey City, an accountant who had come to the United States in 1989 and was working as quality control officer for a pharmaceutical company when he saw the ad.
With Mr. Gurjar as publisher, specializing in circulation and advertising, Mr. Renna as production coordinator, and Bob Rixon, a poet, writer and radio personality (WFMU-FM 91.1) as copy editor, the newspaper is being published out of the Rentec studio.
Each month 20,000 copies are distributed without charge in towns with large concentrations of Indians, including Jersey City, Passaic, Elizabeth, Edison and Woodbridge.
Mr. Gurjar said his major goal was to provide information about his diverse culture and help his readers adjust to their new country. "The main thing," he said, "is to help out my community."
 
Welsh, and Family
In the Roberts home in Basking Ridge, Dr. Roberts was saying that there were more than two million people in the United States who claim Welsh ancestry, with some living in New Jersey but many in New York State, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
With him was his wife, Olga, who handles advertising and circulation for Ninnau, and a son, Arthur Jr., a research associate at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School who designed a computer program to keep track of circulation.
Dr. Roberts does not pay contributors but the articles come in from all over the world. He edits the articles and sends them by E-mail to his daughter, Mair, in Florida who designs the pages and E-mails them back. The pages then go to a printer in Denville. The annual subscription price is $20.
He has made no money but received many awards from Welsh organizations, including induction into a prestigious group in Wales, the Circle of Bards.
"Most of the recognition has come to me but the one who deserves it is Olga," he said.
Asked what her title is, she replied, "What is my title? I can't remember. I think it is the managing editor." Everyone laughed.
When asked what he did, Arthur Jr. said, "What is my title, Dad?"
"He doesn't have a title," Dr. Roberts said. And then, speaking about his son, but by extension everyone who labors in the ethnic press for their community, he added, "But he is very indispensable."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER WEST SIDE;
At the Helm, After 22 Years

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
Stephan Russo was 25 and unemployed in 1976, and had just returned from a Peace Corps assignment in Colombia when Goddard Riverside Community Center offered him a job as a youth organizer. He had no idea that taking the job would mean spending almost half his life there, so far.
"I don't think then I thought I was going to be running the organization," he said recently, sitting at his desk in the office of Goddard's executive director. 
 Except for a brief stint in New York City government, Mr. Russo has spent 22 years ascending the organizational ladder, rising from director of the youth center to program director for all Goddard projects to associate director. When Bernie Wohl, the longtime executive director, decided to depart last year, a national search for a new leader led the center's board to its own backyard. Mr. Russo took the helm of the center, which is on Columbus Avenue near 88th Street, on Dec. 1.
"Stephan represents a continuation because he started with Goddard, he grew up with Goddard, and he is very much a product of the values that a place like Goddard represents," said Elaine M. Postley, president of the board.
Behind that choice is a judgment. "We did not feel the agency needed to change course with a new director, because we didn't want to fix something that wasn't broken," said Daniel Siff, chairman of the board's search committee.
Still, Mr. Russo has plenty to do. "Part of the challenge, quite frankly, in 1999 is to keep going what we have going," he said. Mr. Wohl was a skilled fund-raiser with good connections, and Mr. Russo needs to continue that work.
The new executive director also needs money for one of his major goals: reviving some of the programs that Goddard has lost because of cutbacks in some public and private financing in recent years. The center had to sell two camps in upstate New York, which were used for programs for inner-city children and for older people, for example. It also halted cultural events, like its summer concert series.
Mr. Russo wants to bring some of Goddard's successes to other neighborhoods. Goddard is now teaching two groups in the Bronx, the Mosholu Montefiore Community Center and New Settlement Apartments, to replicate Goddard's college counseling program, the Options Center.
Mr. Russo was an assistant commissioner in the city's Department of Homeless Services for two and a half years. That experience shows in his plans. He hopes to develop more low-income housing on the Upper West Side. One possible project is the conversion of Columbia Studios, an S.R.O. hotel on 83d Street, into housing for low-income adults.
Then comes his proposal to work more closely with neighborhood schools.
"I guess that I'll have to prioritize," he said with the giddy laugh of a 25-year-old recruit. NINA SIEGAL

HEADLINE: Homework Bound

BYLINE: By Michael Winerip; Michael Winerip is a senior staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
Heidi Lehman was always an academic achiever. She finished high school a year early, went through college in three and a half years and then earned a law degree. But nothing in those 18 1/2 years of formal education prepared the 36-year-old lawyer for her daughter Carly's first-grade homework.
 "The teachers said it should take just 20 minutes," Ms. Lehman recalled. "Right! These are little kids -- they get frustrated, they're tired, they're working hard all day in school. It'd stretch out for an hour, easy. We'd have tears, screaming, kicking the table. Then there'd be lots of hugs and kisses and I'd say, 'Don't do it, Carly. It's not worth it.' I never had homework myself in elementary school. Carly would scream, 'I have to do it, Mom!' " 
 And if Carly didn't do it? Shame and scorn. The mother has saved Carly's first spelling test from first grade with the words unable to spell at this time written in large letters at the top by the teacher. First graders in Millburn, N.J., don't just have regular spelling lists for homework; they also get a challenge list and a superchallenge list.
 "We're told only the boys and girls who want to do it should do it," Ms. Lehman said. "Is that pressure or what?" Among the first-grade superchallenge words: "experiment," "observation," "measuring."
 "First grade!" Ms. Lehman said. "And there are kids who can do this. You say to yourself, 'Is that natural or not?' "
 Carly survived first grade, is now a third grader and has grown used to the homework life. One recent day, she came home from school at 3:05, hoisted her backpack onto the kitchen table and by 3:10 was doing her homework. "You want a snack?" her Mom asked. "You want to watch a little TV first?"
 "Mom," Carly said. "I have to do my homework!"
 "Carly has a notebook for all her homework assignments," Ms. Lehman said. "I don't remember being so organized like this at this age -- they have to be organized!"
 Ms. Lehman is right when it comes to measuring the gross tonnage of today's homework: American schools are giving more and more to younger and younger children. A national survey by the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan showed that in 1981 6- to 8-year-olds spent an average of 44 minutes a week on homework (about 9 minutes a school night). By 1997, homework for first to third graders had nearly tripled, to 123 minutes a week (or 25 minutes a night).
 While Millburn has long been a high-powered suburban district, ranking at the top of national academic surveys, it has not always been a heavy homework district. Pat Romano is one of the first-grade teachers at Deerfield Elementary School in Millburn assigning the alleged 20 minutes of homework each night. But in the 1970's, when Ms. Romano's two children attended elementary school in Millburn, they had no homework until fifth or sixth grade, she said. And they did just fine: her son graduated from Brown University in engineering; her daughter got a master's degree from Johns Hopkins University. So it seemed natural to ask her, "Do you really think it's necessary for first graders to have so much homework?"
 "I could say a lot," Ms. Romano said, "but I don't want to comment." She felt that mandatory homework was too controversial to discuss on the record.
 Martin Burne, the principal of Deerfield, said the school really has no choice -- it must assign homework. "This is what's demanded to stay competitive in a global market," he said. "There's a feeling that somehow all of this extra work and early discipline builds up to give us an edge in standardized testing." But there is a trade-off, he acknowledged. "To do this, we are taking away some of the years of adolescence and childhood."
 For her part, Ms. Lehman keeps wondering if this generation of little children will burn out by high school. She remembers a second-grade homework assignment that required Carly to pick a country and write a report on it. Then parents were invited to school to hear the reports and sample foods from the various countries. "This kid did his report on France," Ms. Lehman said. "Then he put it down and said, 'I did a second report on another country.' My reaction was, 'Would you just shut up!' "
 There is an assumption that the trend today to give more homework sooner is a return to traditional values, but that is not the case. As Brian Gill and Steven Schlossman pointed out in their 1996 article in the American Journal of Education, for much of this century leading educators have deplored assigning homework at a young age. As early as the 1890's, a muckraking doctor, Joseph Mayer Rice, attacked the homework "spelling grind."
 "Is it not our duty to save the child from this grind?" he wrote in 1897.
 In 1900, the Commissioner of Education, William Torrey Harris, testified before Congress that there should be no homework before age 12. In the 20 years before World War I, The Ladies' Home Journal led a national crusade against homework. Teachers wrote the magazine to thank the editor, Edward Bok, for speaking out, saying they were afraid if they criticized mandatory homework practices they would lose their jobs. Newspapers like The New York Times editorialized against homework, and in 1930, the American Child Health Association classified homework as a form of child labor. During the 1920's and 30's, New York City public schools banned homework until fourth grade; San Diego banned it through eighth grade; and Sacramento had a prohibition on elementary-school homework for 45 years, until 1961. In extreme cases, homework was seen as causing crooked spines, night terrors and nervous breakdowns in children. "Drill and kill," they called it.
 But whenever the nation has felt an external threat, said Mr. Gill, a researcher at the Rand Institute in Santa Monica, Calif., educators have manned the barricades by piling on homework. Homework grew in popularity in the 50's, after the Russians launched Sputnik, and continued in favor until the late 60's, but lost ground in the anti-Vietnam counterculture years. Then, in the early 80's, with the American economy in recession, the Japanese in ascent and the publication of the study "A Nation at Risk," maintaining that our educational system was lagging behind other industrialized nations', homework returned to fashion and has kept its popularity right through the global economy years.
 In these last 15 years, the biggest increase in homework has fallen mainly on the youngest citizens; at the high-school level, homework has stayed fairly constant. University of Michigan researchers have found that the amount of homework the typical high-school senior does has remained virtually unchanged since 1976 -- between six and seven hours a week.
 Once the pendulum swings one way, it takes a long time to reverse direction, but there are signs that heaping on homework for young children is taking its toll, at least in the supercharged suburban districts. Dee Shepherd-Look, a psychologist with a family practice in suburban Los Angeles, said that in her 28 years as a therapist she has never treated so many young children for homework-related anxieties. It started 10 years ago, she said, but has become pronounced in the last five.
 "I see a lot of school phobias," she said. "I just got off the phone with the mother of a 9-year-old who's a wreck because he can't remember his Shakespeare lines."
 Dr. Shepherd-Look does not blame the schools. "I think it's the parents who push the schools," she said, adding that more parents are working longer hours, they are on call in the evenings and weekends for their jobs and they are doing the same thing to their children.
 I had a 5-year-old, she didn't want to go to school," Dr. Shepherd-Look added. "But it wasn't just school -- every day she had some different activity after school. They are what I call resume kids."
 This generation's parents are caught in a trap of their own making: they are pushing their children and their schools to be more competitive, even as they have less time to help with homework and activities.
 Picking up on the homework angst, Newsweek did a cover story last spring headlined "Why Homework Doesn't Help." The article was based in part on the research of Harris Cooper of the University of Missouri, considered a leading homework scholar. In 1989, Dr. Cooper did a landmark survey of more than 100 homework studies and concluded that, while children who do substantial amounts of homework perform better on standardized tests at the junior-high and high-school level, it does not seem to make a difference for elementary-age students.
 "For elementary-school students, the effect of homework on achievement is trivial, if it exists at all," Dr. Cooper concluded.
 This would be of great comfort, of course, to all those overwrought parents of young children tormented by superchallenge words, but others question his theory. If scores on standardized tests are going to be used to measure performance -- and such testing has never been more important in American society than it is today -- the proper headline, sadly, may be "Why Homework Does Matter."
 Joyce Epstein, a professor of education at Johns Hopkins University and also a leading expert on homework, has done studies showing that elementary-school homework improves school performance. She also suspects it improves performance on standardized tests. And it may be that Carol Huntsinger, an education professor at the College of Lake County in suburban Chicago, has produced a new study that demonstrates just that.
 In the mid-1980's, Dr. Huntsinger was running a nursery school in an upper-middle-class North Shore suburb. She noticed how parents of her Chinese-American students began formal home study earlier than Euro-American parents did. This was not just creative play; this was sitting at the kitchen table each night doing exercises in phonics and math. And so she devised a research project contrasting the home-study habits of 40 well-educated Chinese-American North Shore families with the habits of 40 similarly prosperous Euro-American families. The typical Chinese-American parents came to this country from Taiwan in their early 20's to attend graduate school, became citizens and had children here. All Euro-American parents, except one, were American-born.
 Dr. Huntsinger did her first assessment of the children in the early 90's, when they were in pre-kindergarten or in kindergarten, and has revisited the families every two years since. The Chinese-Americans, she found, brought the cultural practice of doing more homework earlier from their native land.
 Olivia Hsiao, a chemist born in Taiwan, would sit with her 4-year-old son, Ronald, each night doing exercises she had devised. She taught numbers and then moved on to addition and subtraction by using objects like playing cards and dice. Before Ronald was in first grade, Ms. Hsiao spent 10 to 15 minutes a day with him on math and the same on phonics. "He'd count with his fingers and toes," she recalled. "One time I gave him a problem, the answer was more than 10 -- he had to take off his shoes, his fingers weren't enough."
 Before first grade, the Chinese-American children were spending an average of 54 minutes a day in this formal home study, while Euro-Americans spent 6 minutes. The difference continued as the children got older and the homework was provided by schools. At first and second grade, the Chinese-American families averaged 31 minutes on homework versus 11 for the Euro-Americans.
 The result was a substantial difference in standardized test results, Dr. Huntsinger found. Typically in math, the Chinese-Americans scored a grade level ahead of the Euro-Americans. But the effect of the home-study habits was even more substantial regarding tests measuring English vocabulary skills. Typically, the Chinese-American children started behind -- their parents spoke Chinese at home. But Dr. Huntsinger found that parents did things like assign an extra 15 English vocabulary words to master each week. Over time it got results. While the children were a year behind the Euro-Americans on the English test in kindergarten, they were a year ahead by fourth grade.
 Nor does Dr. Huntsinger think the results can be explained by ethnic differences. There were a few Euro-American families who had a similar approach to homework, and their children had test results similar to the Chinese-Americans'.
 Dr. Cooper has not seen this new study, but says that the Chinese-American kindergartners were not technically doing homework because the parents were initiating it. But Dr. Huntsinger countered that American schools could give such exercises for homework at this earlier age, if that were society's priority.
 And while this may sound like cruel and unusual punishment for little people, consider that 20 years ago it would have seemed equally harsh to assign first graders homework. Today it is standard practice.
The more homework is assigned at an earlier age, the more the parent is forced to get involved. "The kids are supposed to do it on their own," Ms. Lehman of Millburn said. "Then they come home with pages of homework sheets with instructions that are full of huge words."
 As Karen Sokoloff, a Millburn parent of two elementary-school children, said: "They don't just disappear into their rooms to emerge an hour later with everything done, their backpacks zipped up. My husband, Andy, and I split up -- I say, 'You take Eric, I'll take David.' " Ms. Sokoloff's least favorite homework was second-grade spelling; the children were supposed to write the words three times, using a different-colored marker every time. "They'd have 20, 25 words, picking up the marker, putting it down, picking up the marker," she said. "It was torture to watch."
 So-called creative homework may be even worse. Foods from around the world -- you think second graders are cooking up those Hungarian goulashes? All over America at this moment, mothers are frantically digging through old shoe boxes to find nine photos of their child, one from each year, so they can begin their third grader's time-line project.
 But what of the boy or girl who doesn't have that support at home? The more important that homework becomes in school, the more a child can fall behind. Etta Kralovec, the director of teacher education at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine, worked on a state-financed study there in the early 90's, interviewing dropouts about why they quit school. She was amazed that every single person in her survey mentioned the inability to keep up with homework as a major factor. "These were children from poor families who got no help at home," Ms. Kralovec said. "They fell farther and farther behind until they gave up and dropped out."
 Shawn Courchene, 23, was one of those students interviewed in the survey. He now lives in Oklahoma, where he works in a coffee factory. Growing up, he said, his father didn't live with the family, and his mother didn't have time to help. "She was too busy or she was working," he said. "There's no one you can ask questions. You can't get the answers you need." By sixth grade, he said, he was lost. "To hide it, I turned myself into a class clown. Teachers felt I was a lost cause."
 To make up for such inequities, Ms. Kralovec proposes getting rid of homework altogether, and she is writing a book, "Clearing the Kitchen Table: Homework and the American Dream," with that message. Sounding very much like the reformers from the first half of this century, she complains that homework creates a long workday for children, robs them of playtime and cuts into important creative time with the family.
 Given the highly competitive spirit of the nation at this moment, however, Americans may not be ready for such a radical change.
 But there are efforts under way to counter some of these inequities. Dr. Epstein of Johns Hopkins has developed a series of interactive homework assignments with clearly written instructions for parents and children. The worksheets are meant to insure the tasks can actually be done by a child, and they are being used in schools nationwide. Other school systems have returned to a popular 1930's reform -- supervised study within school. Children who may not get support at home are given help with their homework at school.
 In Quincy, Mass., a blue-collar suburb of Boston, middle schools have before- and after-school programs where children get homework assistance from local college students volunteering their time. Teachers like Eileen Sadof in Quincy are aware that many of her students won't get help at home, so she often starts homework projects in class. Ms. Sadof, who teaches English at Broad Meadows Middle School, said: "I tell them, 'You can have free reading time now.' They think they're taking advantage of me, but a lot don't have a quiet place at home to read. I'm just trying to hook them on the book in class so they'll be more likely to find a way to do it at home on their own."
 The Baltimore schools are applying this approach even earlier. Eight elementary schools have a three-hour after-school program geared to helping children with their homework and preparing them for the state standardized tests. At Dr. Bernard Harris Elementary, a school where 90 percent of the children receive free lunches, nearly half the students attend the after-school program. It is costly to run, $135,000 a year, which mainly pays the salaries of the 14 teachers who spend the extra three hours at school each day.
 The program is highly structured; an hour is spent doing a creative project (during a recent session, Claude Morris, a third grader, correctly calculated that it would take 8 centimeters of root-beer soda to make ice cream in an ice cream float, float); an hour of club time (for geography, reading or board games); and a half-hour reviewing homework. At the homework session, the teacher, Denise Norfleet, had the children go over that night's reading assignment, a story about Violet Hill Whyte, Baltimore's first African-American police officer.
 "Do I want you guessing?" Ms. Norfleet said at one point. "Where do you go for the answer?"
 "Back to the story!" they called out.
 Mary Brown, who has custody of her grandson Christopher, says the program has been a godsend. It is divided into three sessions a year. "Last year, he took one," she said. "This year, we're going to take all three."
 Christopher smiled. "Good news," he said.
 The Baltimore program has melded two of the major trends in American education today -- more homework and more standardized testing. At Dr. Bernard Harris, there is no subtlety about it -- teachers are now spending the entire school year teaching for the standardized tests: the California Achievement Tests that the children are given each fall, and the Maryland School Performance Assessment Program, or MSPAP, test they take in the spring. There are lists of MSPAP vocabulary words posted in all the classrooms, along with lists of MSPAP test hints. And weekly homework packets have been written specifically to drill the children on what is on each test. The homework packets geared for the California test require the children to answer questions by filling in the right bubble, just as they will have to do on the actual test. The MSPAP homework uses MSPAP vocabulary words.
 "I have MSPAP on the brain," said Mae Williams, a Baltimore third-grade teacher. "But their scores went up this last time, so it's worth it."
 There are many ways to measure a successful school -- the creativity of the students, their happiness, their hunger to learn new things, their love for reading. But at this point in American history, the most important measure, the one that gets printed in all the newspapers, the one that individual schools and entire school districts are measured by and all the politicians talk about, is performance on standardized tests. And as long as that is true, those backpacks are likely to be full each night starting in grade 1 and maybe earlier.
 What the pendulum will swing back on homework is certain, but to change things it will likely take a major cultural shift impossible to envision right now.
 Concerned that the Millburn schools were giving too much homework too soon, a parents' group helped pay to fly Dr. Cooper, the University of Missouri expert, to New Jersey in October. Dr. Cooper explained to 150 parents and teachers that little children have a limited attention span, and he recommended just 10 minutes of homework a night starting in first grade and adding 10 minutes to that time each year after, through high school.
 "If it's a different type of community," he said, meaning a high-pressured suburban district, "I would raise it to 15 minutes."
 Dr. Cooper has found that despite his recommendations, most suburbs don't lighten their homework load after he visits, and, indeed, Deerfield Elementary still assigns the alleged 20 minutes of homework to its first graders. Parents in places like Millburn may feel in their hearts that their children have too much homework, but as long as everyone else is doing it, there's pressure to do it.
 When Phyllis Catz, the assistant superintendent of Millburn schools, was asked during an interview whether she felt elementary students had too much homework in her district, she said no, that it built good study habits and discipline for future years.
 "Of course," said Dr. Catz, who has been an educator for 35 years, "if you talked to me in the 1970's, I'd have given you a different answer."

"Parental Guidance Suggested"
A recent study at the College of Lake County in Grayslake, Ill., monitored 40 children of European descent and 40 children of Chinese descent. All were from upper-middle-class families, but the Chinese children spent more time on homework. In math, the Chinese-American children performed better; in vocabulary, they lagged behind until fourth grade. (English was a second language in their homes.) Test results were measured by grade-level or by age-level ability. Chart highlights results of the study. (pg. 40)

Stress Test

BYLINE: By Jacques Steinberg

 BODY:
Among the epidemics spreading from one school district to the next in recent years has been the compulsion to test. By the time they were ready to graduate to sixth grade last June, New York City fifth graders had taken eight standardized tests over the previous 14 months; this year's fourth-grade reading test, to be given statewide next week, will take three days to administer. In Chicago, pupils took 12 standardized tests from the winter of third grade through the spring of fourth grade. And President Clinton's proposed national tests in fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math, while tabled by Congress for further study, still loom.
 Seeking to pick apart this trend for anxious parents and children, two professors at Teachers College at Columbia University --Peter W. Cookson Jr. and Joshua Halberstam -- have written A Parent's Guide to Standardized Tests in School: How to Improve Your Child's Chances for Success (Learning Express). The new book presents test-taking strategies and sample questions for widely used tests like the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, the Stanford Achievement Test and the Terra Nova (though not the S.A.T.). 
 After school one recent afternoon, the authors spoke of the testing craze and its impact.
 Why are students being subjected to so much testing?
 Dr. Cookson: It has a lot to do with the accountability movement. The idea of holding schools accountable for kids' achievement has almost become accepted wisdom in American education. There is a sense that if we can measure kids' achievement we can have a pretty good idea of whether they are learning or not. That's an open question.
 I think the testing industry can be lucrative for some people, so they push a lot of these tests. And, lastly, I would say it's grown because it gives the public some measure -- rightly or wrongly, and that's a good question -- of how to think about schools.
 Was there not this demand for accountability several decades ago?
 Dr. Cookson: No, I don't think the schools were held accountable in the same way. I am not sure schools were worse, either. We didn't think about education that way. But with the changes in the economy -- the idea that we're a knowledge economy -- the pressure to measure this knowledge has increased.
 Dr. Halberstam: Parents may have had a better sense a generation ago of how their kids were doing. They were home more. You had at least one parent in the house. There is a general sense out there that parents don't have much control over their kids' lives. It's really important to them to know that the education of their kids is up to par.
 How important are these tests in terms of shaping children's futures and academic careers?
 Dr. Cookson: If schools use these tests basically for diagnostic purposes, they might actually be able to identify learning problems that individual kids have, and that would be good, especially over a period of time.
 The other positive side would be that it does give a school a sense of where they are at, with grade inflation and all the subjective factors going into education. Testing does tell you something about the nature of the academic climate at a particular school.
 What may not be great about this is that you cannot funnel an education through a number. We need to become much more sophisticated about these results so they don't become sports scores. Also, it's a pretty battering experience for a kid who might be having difficulty with a subject -- or who might be creative, or who might think differently -- to constantly get back the message that you are not good enough. Most of these tests are not going to make you think in ways that, as adults, you might think of as important.
 Since these tests are not optional for most students, what can parents do, what can kids do, to reduce the stress?
 Dr. Halberstam: You don't want the kid, and you don't want the parent, to think this is trivial. It's not. On the other hand, it's just a test. You don't want this child's whole self-image to be pinned on it. More important, parents look at these scores and decide whether their kids are smart or not. Some kids are not good test-takers. But some just don't know the techniques. That can be learned.
 First of all, figure out your child's learning style. This will be different for different ages. Some kids are better learners by listening, some kids are better by reading. Sometimes, they can mouth the words if they are listeners.
 For kids who have never taken these tests, for young kids, they have to learn that this test will be like nothing they have ever taken before.
 Their teacher, who they love and is so kind and sweet, is going to say, Pencils down! and mean it. They are not going to be able to raise their hands and say, Just another minute, I need time to finish. You have to explain to them what a standardized test is. One of the things that's very important is to do some sample tests with them in testing conditions.
 What's most critical, though, is that you can't prepare for one single test. The real story is to get parents to learn how to make education part of their lives. It is clear that parental involvement in a child's education makes a significant difference.
 For example, if you are cooking with your child, do the math: we have three more guests, we have to triple the amount of salt. Your kid's driving with you, well, why don't you let him be the navigator, draw a map of where you are going.
 One other thing we suggest here is to pull the plug on the TV. The one piece of data that is clear is that watching too much television is a disaster.
 What steps should parents of disabled children take in advance?
 Dr. Cookson: The parents of kids who are handicapped have a lot of rights here, and they ought to learn those rights. These kids have rights to take these tests timed, untimed, and under special circumstances. Secondly, the school and the parent probably have to make a special effort, assuming it's not just physical, but that there are emotional and mental issues as well, to create test conditions that the kids can succeed in. Interpretations of these tests have to be very sensitively and delicately handled.
 When you look at the layering of tests on top of one another -- particularly for third, fourth and fifth graders -- should we be wary? Do we need to test so much?
 Dr. Halberstam: Psychologically, people like to be tested. Look at magazines. Every women's magazine has, Here's a test to find out if you are a good lover. We're a whole culture based on these quick answers. And so we think this is right for kids. We don't see the damage. We're probably hurting a lot of kids along the way.
 On the other hand, we do need some accountability, so we are in this mess.

Bidding for a BID on a Resurrected Avenue

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
Efforts to create a business improvement district on Columbus Avenue date from 1992, when the avenue was recovering from the economic recession of the late 80's. In 1994 came the start of a two-year street reconstruction project that crippled business for the boutiques, specialty shops and restaurants.
But with the avenue now on the upswing, a group of property owners and merchants are again pushing for a BID, from 67th to 82d Street. They say it would attract shoppers and allow for the hiring of people to pick up trash, care for sidewalk trees and do general maintenance. 
 The owners and merchants, with the help of an independent consultant, have put together a one-year proposal for a BID with an annual budget of $208,000, to come from a $32-per-linear-foot assessment on owners of commercial storefronts. A task force appointed by Community Board 7 passed the proposal, and the full board is to vote Tuesday on whether to recommend that the city's Department of Business Services submit it to the Department of City Planning.
Opponents say they fear that a BID would homogenize the look of the avenue, ignore suggestions from Columbus Avenue residents, and privatize sanitation and security so much that the city would reduce public services.
The chairman of Board 7's transportation committee, Barry Rosenberg, complained that the BID would only "mall-ify" Columbus Avenue and cause more bureaucracy for merchants. Mr. Rosenberg, whose wife owns Soutine, a bakery on West 70th Street, warned that property owners would pass the assessment on to merchants in the form of rent increases and that the BID might raise real estate values, thereby attracting big chain stores to replace the smaller mom-and-pop shops that define the avenue.
But Hope Cohen, a co-chairwoman of Board 7's task force, called the BID's proposed role "innocuous enough that it's really like a merchants' association."
And Melanie Radley, another task force member, said the BID would help protect the avenue's small-town quality. The proposal calls for the BID to be run by a board made up of property owners and merchants, which Ms. Radley said would improve relations and help prevent owners from selling or renting to large franchises. "Since we're all liberals on the West Side, there's a natural distrust of BID's and a sense they're not accountable to the public," Ms. Radley said, "but this one seems to have a lot of support, and it has met our requirements."
The consultant to the proposed BID, Carvel Moore, said 194 of the 201 merchants between 67th and 82d Streets favored a BID.
Doug Griebel, a co-owner of City Grill, on Columbus near 72d Street, said a BID's marketing efforts would help return the avenue to prosperity. "It would get the word out that we're back," he said. "Until last year, you had road signs and radio stations telling people to avoid Columbus Avenue." COREY KILGANNON

Trouble, A Desk Away

BYLINE: By MICHELLE COTTLE; Michelle Cottle is a Washington writer.

 BODY:

Q. Recently, my boss of seven years and I moved from our old office to a separate company he owns. One of my new co-workers is constantly complaining, ridiculing my boss (to whom I am devoted) and speaking loudly during personal calls -- which I can't avoid hearing because our desks are just 15 feet apart. This woman has been with the company for five years, and everyone else seems to think she is great. I am civil toward her, but my patience is wearing thin. Should I talk to my boss or to the human resources department about her behavior? Or should I try another approach?
 
A. You are not in third grade, and your co-worker is not a schoolyard bully who keeps stealing your lunch money. As such, tattling should not be part of your plan.
Marcia Reynolds, career coach and owner of Covisioning, a leadership training firm in Phoenix, says you should approach your colleague directly with your concerns. Going over her head, she said, will damage your relationship further. "When you go to the boss, it's like going to the principal," she warned. 
 Laurie Kalman, president of Performance First, a consulting firm in Branford, Conn., agreed. "This woman is your peer," she said. "Call her on her behavior."
But aim to be diplomatic, at least at first. As the new kid on the block, you don't want to start by picking a fight with a popular employee.
First, take some deep breaths and try to understand what is driving her behavior, Ms. Reynolds suggested. Perhaps the woman feels threatened by your boss's -- and your -- arrival, she said.
According to conventional wisdom, the first line of defense against change is denial, but Ms. Reynolds disagreed. The first step, she said, is complaining. "We often complain when what's really going on is we're frightened," she said.
She suggested that you try initiating a friendly conversation.
"Tell her, 'You know, it's been hard for me to move, but I bet it's really hard for you to have a new boss here,' " she advised.
Of course, your co-worker may be oblivious to the impact of her behavior, Ms. Kalman said, perhaps because she acts this way all the time and no one has ever told her so.
Delicately, let her know that you consider her chatter inappropriate, Ms. Reynolds said. For example, if she rants on the phone about a problem, go to her and say, "I hear you're having trouble in this area, and I'm wondering if I could help."
If diplomacy fails and you conclude that this woman is, indeed, trying to drive you mad, be direct -- though still as pleasant as possible. When a co-worker becomes disruptive, Ms. Kalman said, "it's time to say: Get a clue," though she added that the nice approach would be to tell her you're finding it difficult to come into work each day and listen to all her negative energy.
If nothing else, your co-worker should respect you for not running to the principal at the first sign of trouble.

Sitting Pretty With Zero Down

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

 BODY:
LAST summer, Robert Cramer asked his financial adviser to sell about $250,000 in stock so he could make a down payment on a million-dollar triplex in Malibu, Calif.
Mr. Cramer, a lawyer, was no stranger to the mortgage process; at the time, he owned five properties. But this time, his adviser talked him into taking out an innovative mortgage that allowed him to use stock as collateral without putting a penny down on the house. For the deal to pay off financially, the stock's return would have to match or exceed the 7 1/8 percent interest he would have paid on a down payment. But it was a gamble he was willing to take. 
 "It's been highly favorable in my situation," he said.
The mortgage, offered by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, goes by the name of Flex Source. Other firms offer this type of stock-backed mortgage, but it isn't for everybody, assuredly not the faint of heart. With a Flex Source mortgage, home buyers must place securities equal to 39 percent of the purchase price or appraised value in a brokerage account; if the market plunges, they must add to the portfolio so its value never dips below 33 percent of the purchase price.
The plan has advantages: Because they are not selling shares to raise a down payment, buyers avoid paying capital-gains taxes, and they can hope for big gains if the bull market continues. "Historically the stock market makes you money," noted Margaret R. Klein, a Morgan Stanley associate vice president and Mr. Cramer's financial adviser.
But as the Dow bobs up and down, a homeowner's fortunes can bob with it. Mr. Cramer paid $965,000 for his oceanfront home, so he had to put up stock valued at $377,000, Ms. Klein said. To play it safe, he placed $400,000 worth in the account.
It wasn't safe enough. In the 60 days running up to his Sept. 30 closing, the market fell sharply and he had to add $89,000. Since then, stocks have surged, and he has made up that amount -- plus $68,500.
"How attracted you are to this kind of deal is going to depend on what you want to get from your investment, and on the economy on down the road," said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a financial publisher in Butler, N.J. "If you think we're going into a period of slow growth and poor profits, this may not be the time to get into this."
Analysts say people nearing retirement or those who prefer traditional mortgages -- in order to build equity in their homes -- should probably stay away from stock-backed mortgages, while aggressive investors might want to consider them.
Merrill Lynch is credited with developing this form of 100 percent home financing. About seven years ago, it introduced Parent Power, a program that allowed parents, grandparents or other sponsors to pledge securities in lieu of a down payment to help first-time home buyers. Parent Power became so popular that Merrill created an offshoot, called Mortgage 100, that enabled individuals to buy their own homes.
In many traditional mortgages, home buyers pay 20 percent down to avoid buying personal mortgage insurance. On a $300,000 house, this would be $60,000. While a down payment helps reduce the monthly payment, financial advisers recommend looking at how much that money would earn if it was invested. The nothing-down loan is a wash if the money grows at the same rate as the interest rate on the mortgage. Using the above example, with a fixed 7 percent interest rate, Merrill Lynch calculates the break-even point over seven years to be $89,400. If the money returned 10 percent, it would grow to $120,500, leaving the homeowners $31,100 richer than if they made a down payment. But if the money returned 5 percent, it would grow to just $85,100, $4,300 short.
Gary Schatsky, a fee-only financial adviser and lawyer in Manhattan, cautions against rushing into 100 percent financing. "The reasonable argument for why to do this is you can't afford the tax bite," he said. But other options might accomplish the same goal, he said, such as simply borrowing against your stock account and using the proceeds as a down payment.
"Caution, caution, caution," he said. "It sounds convenient, but the cost might well be too expensive for many."
Mr. Gumbinger said this sort of financing has grown as the stock market has surged but has remained "a specialty niche."
"The bottom line," he said, "is if you don't think you can afford to lose, then you probably shouldn't gamble."

Chart: "In Lieu of A Down Payment"
A new kind of mortgage lets you use stock as collateral, rather than making a down payment. For you to break even, the stock's return must equal the interest rate on the loan. Here is how the numbers work if you skip the traditional 20 percent down payment on a $300,000 mortgage at 7 percent, and instead invest the $60,000 in stock.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
The JointIs Still Jumping, But the Floor Is Shaking

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THESE feel like such good times. People have jobs. Their pay is rising in many cases. The stock they own is gaining in value, and so are their homes. They spend rather freely, and as the weeks pass they feel less threatened by the economic turmoil elsewhere in the world. So it is hard to get people to focus on the precarious underpinnings, right here at home, of these boom times.
One of the shaky supports is business debt. Everyone knows that consumers have borrowed up to their chins, a worry in its own right. But now comes word from the Federal Reserve, which tabulates this sort of data, that companies have also been piling up debt, though with less fanfare. Just as consumers have done, business borrowers have bet on a strong economy to give them enough income to make their monthly installment payments. Lately, however, business debt has grown faster than profits. 
 "We are all getting caught up in euphoria, and a lot of good things are happening in this economy," said James Glassman, a senior economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. "But you are never far from vulnerability, and business debt is now one of the vulnerable areas."
Business debt, which includes the obligations of all types of business except banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions, stood at $5.13 trillion on Sept. 30. That is a big number even for the big American economy. And it keeps rising. While profit growth was weakening in the third quarter, business debt was rising at a 10.4 percent annual rate, the fastest since the start of the economic expansion nearly eight years ago.
 THE stock market makes all this debt seem unalarming. That's because stock prices are rising even faster than debt, so a company's borrowings do not look high relative to its total market value. Such illusions help to explain how an on-line retailer, Amazon.com, its stock price soaring, had little trouble borrowing $275 million last spring through a junk-bond offering, even though Amazon's earnings -- the wherewithal to repay this debt -- were zero. For similar reasons, millions of Americans who own stock feel comfortable borrowing faster than their incomes rise.
"Corporate balance sheets look fine," said William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs, "as long as you focus your eye on debt as a ratio of the market value of a company's stock. But when you look at debt as a percentage of book value -- the actual value of a company's equipment, buildings and other assets -- it makes you sort of nervous."
There does not seem much danger of widespread defaults today, a contrast to the late 1980's, when shaky real estate lending accounted for much of the run-up in business debt. Interest rates are considerably lower now, making the repayment of loans less burdensome. And if defaults come, the nation's lenders, particularly banks, are in better financial shape to weather trouble.
But not since the 1920's has the stock market played so big a role in an American economic boom. And that is what makes rising business debt so worrisome, though the public is paying little heed to the connection.
 THE economic expansion of the 1990's is largely built on borrowed money, as Wynne Godley, an economist at the Jerome Levy Institute, has argued in various studies. Just as huge deficit spending by government financed the expansion in the 1980's, deficit spending by consumers and, especially, businesses has carried the economy in this decade.
Companies have borrowed to pay for capital investment, a big source of economic growth. They have borrowed to stockpile merchandise awaiting sale. They have borrowed to finance mergers. And companies have gone hundreds of millions of dollars into debt to buy back their own stocks and give share prices a boost. "For those who think the boom can continue, you really have to postulate that these borrowing flows will continue to rise at the old pace," Mr. Godley said.
But how can they? Business has gone from repaying debt at an annual rate of $150 billion in 1991, as the last recession ended, to borrowing at an annual rate of $522 billion in this year's third quarter -- a swing of nearly $700 billion. Profits are no longer sufficient to keep adding to debt at that rate. And as business cuts back, the economy will inevitably slow.
That's where the stock market complicates matters. The slowing economy will eventually bring down stock prices; as they fall, the ratio of business debt to equity will rise, alarming borrowers and lenders, who will then cut back debt even more.
Consumers will probably go through a similar process: If their stock-market wealth evaporates, they, too, will become more reluctant borrowers -- and an orderly slowdown in the national economy could turn into a rout.
It may never happen that way. The American economy is amazingly resilient, and some wonderful event, or series of events, may save the day. But it's a realistic scenario, one that ought to dampen the current euphoria, and in doing so make the future less dangerous.

HEADLINE: DaimlerChrysler Hopes Green Will Be Red-Hot

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
SO far, alternative fuel vehicles have tended to be commuter cars so underpowered that they can barely keep up with expressway traffic. But DaimlerChrysler is to present four concept vehicles today that run on something other than gasoline, yet have plenty of horsepower.
"Alternative fuel vehicles tend to be focused on emissions and fuel economy at the expense of performance," Bernard Robertson, vice president of engineering technologies at DaimlerChrysler, said recently. "But we can't identify any interest for something green or fuel efficient that is boring, unresponsive and unsatisfying." 
 The four Chrysler concepts range from a sports car to a luxury truck:
 
DODGE CHARGER -- The four-door Charger borrows its shape from 60's muscle cars, and it has a 325-horsepower supercharged V8 engine that displaces 4.6 liters. But it runs on compressed natural gas and meets California's ultra-low-emission standards.
 
CHRYSLER CITADEL -- Hybrid vehicles are the next big wave in the auto industry, and the Citadel is a hybrid on several levels. It has the foundation of the Chrysler 300M sport sedan; the ground clearance and all-wheel-drive ability of a sport utility, and the capacity and sliding power doors of a minivan.
The Citadel is also a hybrid in that it draws power from two sources. A 253-horsepower gasoline V6 propels the rear wheels; electricity from electric motors drives the front wheels and adds 70 more horsepower.
 
DODGE POWER WAGON -- The name and some of the styling touches come from Dodge's original 1946 workhorse, but the huge engine is out of the 21st century. The turbo-charged, direct-injection diesel displaces 7.2 liters, and it serves as platform for new diesel technology -- a strength of the German half of DaimlerChrysler.
The aluminum-body Power Wagon, its bed lined with blond European ash wood, also has many luxury amenities, and its styling may offer clues about the next design of the Dodge Ram pickup.

JEEP COMMANDER -- This design study has the rugged, head-to-the-woods look of a Jeep, but is intended to have minimal impact on the environment. In theory, the Commander could carry a mechanism to produce hydrogen for fuel cells, which would generate electricity for power. Emissions would be only water. MICHELLE KREBS

Surprise! Even The Boss Has a Heart

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Who would have thought it? Bosses, those storied ogres who stereotypically withhold raises, tear up expense accounts and send out pink slips on Christmas Eve, can actually have hearts of mush. The softies among them help finance vacations, give Cupid a hand and spring to the aid of the distressed. So next time you see a boss, honk -- or at least smile.
"In the 80's, I had a one-in-a-million boss who performed an extraordinary act of kindness," writes C. M. Barnhart of Manhattan. 
 When it appeared that Ms. Barnhart would not have enough money to take a long-anticipated vacation in Greece, the boss gave her a check for one-third of the trip's cost.
But that wasn't all.
"When I was about to leave on vacation, he handed me a roll of drachmas for extra spending money," Ms. Barnhart writes. "No strings; it just pleased him to make sure I would have a great vacation."
Ruth Messineo of Clifton, N.J., recalls how her supervisor approached her with a brochure in hand.
"Here's a present for you," the boss said. The flier described a conference on remedial reading -- Mrs. Messineo's field of expertise -- to be held in the Southern city where her daughter and family had settled recently.
Ms. Messineo writes: "I was able to spend five days in a lovely hotel, attend an informative conference and visit with my loved ones with all expenses paid."
"Several years ago I was diagnosed with 'incurable' cancer at its most advanced stages," writes Kenny Moore of Totowa, N.J., a manager of human resources for Keyspan Energy in Brooklyn. So Mr. Moore underwent a year of experimental treatment at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., consisting of aggressive chemotherapy followed by full-body radiation.
Though he had held his job for just two years, his boss was unequivocal in his reaction: "Go do what you need to do. We'll cover for you when you can't come to work."
Mr. Moore writes: "For the next year, I lived the harrowing experience which has become commonplace for cancer victims. Some days I was barely able to come to work; other days I could barely walk."
The company never wavered in its support, and the treatment worked. "Eleven years later, I'm still cancer-free," he says. And still grateful.
"Over the years, I've had several opportunities to work elsewhere," he says. "While the money may have been better, I have stayed. I continue to feel honored to work for a company whose corporate values support both the business needs as well as the human needs of its employees."
Toni Heidrich of Convent Station, N.J., is a partner in a 15-person accounting firm. Most of the employees are under 30 and are trying to save money for their future.
When one of Ms. Heidrich's colleagues decided to marry, everyone in the firm was invited to his wedding. But the event would be out of state -- not within driving distance.
When the firm's managing partner learned that the cost of air fare and lodging was going to keeping many employees from attending, he offered to pay for tickets, accommodations and food for each employee and a companion.
Ms. Heidrich writes, "Ten people ended up attending and were happy to be able to share our friend's special day."
One Friday night in 1982, when Ben Suntag of Pomona, N.Y., was working for Western Union as an engineer, he received a phone call from his sister in Los Angeles. Their father had been struck by a car and was in a coma.
Mr. Suntag flew immediately to California to be at his father's bedside. Early the next week, he talked with his boss, Harry Halpert, back in New York. Mr. Halpert told him to spend as much time with his father as he needed -- then to fly to the company's office in San Francisco to do some work. That way, he said, he could justify reimbursing Mr. Suntag's return flight.
When Mr. Suntag returned to New York two weeks later, he was summoned to the office of his boss's boss, John Doherty. Paying for his one-way fare back home was just not right, Mr. Doherty said; instead, he insisted on paying for the round trip. Moreover, since Mr. Suntag had visited the San Francisco office, he had obviously been to the West Coast "on business" and would receive full salary for his time away.
Though his father never recovered from his injuries, Mr. Suntag writes, "there was some happiness in knowing that a big company like Western Union and two great bosses like Harry Halpert and John Doherty could make a difference."
In 1996, when Heiko Spallek came to Philadelphia from the former East Germany to become an assistant professor at Temple University's School of Dentistry, one of his most difficult tasks was overcoming his poor English.
Enter Prof. Titus Schleyer, the chairman of the Department of Dental Informatics. To help Dr. Spallek master the language, he offered some unusual motivational tools: a notebook and stickers that depicted cartoon characters and the like.
Into the notebook went the phrases that Dr. Spallek struggled with most. When he used a phrase correctly, Professor Schleyer rewarded him with a sticker. When he mastered the expression, he received a sticker in the shape of a star.
At the department's Christmas party in 1997, one year and 600 stickers after the training sessions began, Professor Schleyer awarded Dr. Spallek a certificate for successful completion of the "Dental Informatics Linguistics Program."
Dr. Spallek says the framed certificate decorates his office wall. "My boss," he writes, "managed to pull me through a major challenge in my life."

Playing 'The Price Is Right' With Windows

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
IF the Microsoft Corporation is the predatory monopolist that the Government claims it is, why isn't the price of its monopoly product -- its industry-standard Windows operating system -- higher?
That question is a central focus of a new study of Microsoft and the Government's antitrust suit against the company by Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Mr. Hall helped draw up the Justice Department's 1995 consent decree with Microsoft. 
 The 48-page paper, "National Policy on Microsoft: A Neutral Perspective," written with Mr. Hall's son, Chris Hall, an independent software developer, is being published this week and will be available on the Internet at www.netecon.com.
The paper says the Government's evidence puts it on solid ground in challenging some of Microsoft's contracts as violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which condemns contracts that restrain trade. In an interview, Mr. Hall pointed in particular to Microsoft's pacts with America Online and other Internet service providers. These contracts require the service providers to guarantee that 75 percent or more of their customers use Microsoft's browser software, crimping the opportunity for its main rival in the browser market, Netscape Communications. For a company with so much market power, a clause like that "shows that Microsoft really does push the limits," Mr. Hall said.
On the pro-Microsoft side of the ledger, the Halls find little merit in the march of Government witnesses confidently proclaiming that operating systems and browsers are distinct products, and that Microsoft fused them only to squelch competition. "Given the complete malleability of software," the authors wrote, "this is a debate at about the intellectual level of trying to decide if the Gulf of Mexico is part of the Atlantic Ocean."
The Halls' paper focuses most sharply on the contentious subject of Windows pricing. They say "the low price of Windows looks nothing like a monopoly price," amounting as it does to less than 5 percent of the total price of a personal computer.
The "low" price of Windows is a theme that will be forcefully presented by Richard Schmalensee, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, when he takes the stand as a witness for Microsoft. Mr. Schmalensee has been making the argument since the early 1990's, when he prepared a paper expounding the low-price thesis for the Federal Trade Commission, which investigated Microsoft before the Justice Department did.
The Windows-pricing issue is crucial to the outcome of the case and, if the Government wins, to the remedies it can seek from the court. A narrow victory under Section 1 of the Sherman Act would probably yield merely a court order that Microsoft must make its contracts less restrictive. The Justice Department did not sue Microsoft to accomplish so little.
But to win a broader, Section 2 victory, the Government must prove, among other things, that Microsoft has a monopoly, that its exclusionary conduct against potential rivals like Netscape has a "dangerous probability" of preventing a challenge to its monopoly and that its conduct has caused substantial harm to consumers. Only then will stronger remedies -- including, perhaps, breaking up Microsoft -- move onto the agenda.
 TO try to show gouging of consumers, the Government produced in court an internal Microsoft document showing that from 1990 to 1996 the average price it charged personal-computer makers for licensing Windows rose to $49.40 from $19.03. Its share of the PC's total price grew fivefold, to 2.5 percent.
The Justice Department also produced an E-mail written on Dec. 16, 1997, by Joachim Kempin, a senior Microsoft executive, to William H. Gates, the chairman, and other company executives on the subject of Windows prices charged to PC makers. "While we have increased our prices over the last 10 years," Mr. Kempin wrote, "other component prices have come down and continue to come down."
The Justice Department says Microsoft's ability to raise Windows prices is strong evidence that the company is overcharging. The Halls are not convinced. Given Windows' 250 million users and market share of more than 90 percent, the authors wrote, PC makers would want it even if it cost "twice or even 10 times as much."
Microsoft contends that the Windows price is restrained by a sense that some competitive threat, though not yet in sight, is behind the next corner -- a fearful perspective that is all over parts of the December 1997 memo. In it, Mr. Kempin wrote that a big manufacturer like Compaq Computer, or a coalition of PC makers, could finance development of a competing operating system. Or, he wrote, if the chip maker Intel enters "our business, it will get ugly." (Compaq, incidentally, is sending an executive to testify in Microsoft's defense.)
For his part, Mr. Hall does not believe that the seemingly low price of Windows is explained by competition, real or feared. Instead, he suggests that the Windows price is part of Microsoft's broader strategy of making Windows PC's as cheap as possible, hooking new users and making them steady repeat buyers, not only of future generations of Windows but also of higher-priced Microsoft products like its Office suite of word processing, spreadsheet and data base software.
"The Government has to make an argument as to why Microsoft keeps the price of Windows low as part of its monopoly strategy, which harms consumers over all," Mr. Hall said. "It's possible, but the Government hasn't done it yet."

HEADLINE: The New Faces of Retirement

BYLINE: By ERIC HUBLER 

 BODY:
AS an elder-law attorney in the resort town of Truth or Consequences, N.M., John C. Wheeler can't help but spend most of his time thinking about retirement. Retirees come from all over the Southwest to have him draw up wills and estate plans, so they can feel secure about spending decades doing little but soaking in the hot springs of T. or C., as it's known; boating in nearby Elephant Butte Lake, or roaming the country in recreational vehicles.
"At least half the people I see do the conventional thing" in retirement, Mr. Wheeler said. "They play golf -- at least the men do -- they travel, and they work in the yard." Others see retirement as an opportunity to nurture a hobby -- the most popular seems to be restoring and showing off old cars. 
 But there is one person who stands out in Mr. Wheeler's mind as epitomizing a healthy, productive retirement: himself.
Mr. Wheeler, 65, had been living and practicing law in Albuquerque. But, disenchanted with the city as it was transformed by growth, he found himself spending more and more time at his mobile home on the Elephant Butte lakefront. "I began to like it so much that I said, "I've got a license to practice law all over the state, I've got a clientele that comes back to me repeatedly, I have a kind of perpetual-motion practice at this point and I really don't have to go out and hustle work.' "
So he made a change: "I have an Albuquerque telephone number that call-forwards to T. or C., and I'm leading the kind of life I want to lead."
Mr. Wheeler has cut back his workweek to 30 hours, from 60. "I work when I want to," he said. "And that's my retirement, or my semiretirement. I don't think I'll ever fully quit." When he isn't working, he spends much of his time four-wheeling into the hills around town until he reaches the ends of the old mining roads; then he gets out and hikes.
"Exploring is what I personally like to do," Mr. Wheeler said. "There's a lot of mountains that haven't been climbed yet."
Whether that observation is taken literally or figuratively, a growing number of retirees clearly agree with it. Retirement today does not necessarily mean disappearing into an endless sunset of golf, fishing or bridge, or sinking into a recliner, never to be creative again. Nor does it mean working until a formal retirement age and then stopping abruptly. Rather, among the growing numbers of older people healthy enough to have choices, the dividing line between the working years and the retirement years is growing fuzzier.
"The retirement age, which once stood at 65, is being dismantled brick by brick," said John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm in Chicago.
"The explosion of jobs and ways of working that are other than full-time, 9-to-5 kinds of arrangements," he said, has "allowed many people to achieve a balance in their lives that is so much more healthy and beneficial spiritually and emotionally and physically than just hitting the wall at a certain age and going from being a hard-working, very involved worker to not doing anything, which was just devastating to many people."
Today's new breed of retiree never really retires -- and the choice to remain active is made out of passion, more than the need to pay the bills.
Statistics only hint at the change, which has been difficult to document with evidence other than the anecdotal. In 1987, 11.1 percent of Americans age 65 or older were in the work force, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A decade later, that number had grown to 12.2 percent.
But if baby boomers' expectations are to be believed, the life of leisure will hold ever less appeal for retirees. In a Roper survey last year for the American Association of Retired Persons, 80 percent of 2,001 boomers ages 33 to 52 said they planned to continue working during retirement, whether for fun or out of a feeling of necessity or both.
"I think this business of retiring at a certain age and sitting around the house is never going to happen again," said Joan Kelly, manager of business partnerships in the A.A.R.P.'s economic security and work issues department. Calling that phenomenon "a freak thing," she attributed it to changing life expectancies since an official retirement age of 65 was set when Social Security was created in 1936. Based on how many retirement years could be expected for the average person, retiring at 65 then was the equivalent of retiring at 79 today.
Who represents this new face of retirement? Following are profiles of Americans who, like Mr. Wheeler, are in the vanguard of a generation revitalized, both emotionally and professionally, after being liberated from the obligations of a life organized around work. Some are alumni of New Directions, a Wilton, Conn., consulting firm that, for $15,000 and up, helps clients -- mainly high-ranking corporate officers -- find what it calls a "portfolio of opportunity" to fill the years after full-time employment. Others have figured out for themselves that the end of a job doesn't mean the end of the line.
But all would probably endorse an observation made by Mr. Wheeler -- a perspective gleaned from years of counseling retirees. "I'm more than ever convinced," he said, "that people who only relax and do not continue to engage the mind start losing it."
 
From Executive to Angel
So close, yet so far. Robert E. Ray found himself in that position after 27 years at the Gillette Corporation. He had risen steadily at the company and wanted to go all the way to the top. But at 54, he saw that there were four people ahead of him in the race to become chief executive.
He interviewed for chief-executive jobs elsewhere but didn't connect with one, so he took early retirement in 1990, planning to play more tennis and do more skiing and mountain biking. But he found that having fun full-time was boring.
"What I'm doing now is not precisely what I'd envisioned eight years ago," said Mr. Ray, now 62. "I have kind of a three-part life."
Those parts, in addition to sports, are charity work and playing business angel, by investing in fledgling companies.
Mr. Ray's story offers evidence that leaving a full-time job can pay off financially as well as emotionally. His investments in companies in their beginning stages bring in about as much money as he made at Gillette. There were early stakes, for example, in Duracraft, a maker of small space heaters, humidifiers, fans and vaporizers in Southborough, Mass., that is now a part of Honeywell Inc., and in Microfridge, a Sharon, Mass., marketer of South Korean-made refrigerator-microwave oven units that is now part of the Mac-Gray Corporation.
Mr. Ray also helped found a homeless shelter in Boston and is now its chairman. He works on two other programs for the homeless and consults without pay for other nonprofit groups. And he still has plenty of time left for his beloved tennis tournaments and other outdoor activities; he and his wife, Sandra, recently returned from a visit to the national parks of southern Utah.
"This works out to be a nice kind of balanced life," Mr. Ray said. "I don't sit down each day and say, 'One and a half days I'm going to do this.' It kinds of unfolds. Last Thursday, for example, I played tennis in the morning, then met in the afternoon with a company I'm thinking of investing in. Then the next day I went hiking with a buddy of mine."
Dividing his time and energy this way provides "a good, broad exposure to the world," Mr. Ray said. "The variety makes it not boring at all."
 
The Joy of Three-Day Weeks
In 1971, in his early 30's, Bill Price seemed on the cusp of fame and fortune when his novel, "The Potlatch Run," was published. "It did moderately well, and the movies were interested in it -- for 10 or 15 minutes," Mr. Price explained.
He scraped by for a few years as a freelance editor, but by 1980, he said, "I decided to go back to work -- or, to go to work -- and make a living." He joined McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, as a secretary, and moved up the administrative side of the company to become a communications manager, editing and writing for the company's in-house magazine and occasionally traveling to research articles.
A taste of freedom can be hard to forget, though, and by the summer of 1997, Mr. Price was chafing. "I was on an interview trip in Spain," he recalled. "I sat down at one of the sidewalk cafes and said, 'What do I want to do with the rest of my life?' I was approaching 59. That's when I said, 'I'd like to have more time for myself.' "
He asked to work three days a week instead of five. At many companies, that might have seemed an extraordinary accommodation, but it was viewed favorably at McKinsey, where part-time arrangements are common among the company's consultants as they approach retirement.
Mr. Price switched to the schedule last January and quickly discovered an unexpected benefit: Taking a mere three days of vacation time now meant having 11 consecutive days off.
"My income dropped 40 percent, but my stress level dropped more," he said. "I no longer have the sense that my responsibilities are crucial to the success of the communications department. Important, yes; crucial, no. One of the tricks to making this kind of decision is not to be confused about those two words."
Mr. Price's wife had died of breast cancer two years earlier, and though he said the loss did not influence his career decision, it is clear that the thought of leaving the world without spending as much time as possible with family weighed heavily on him. He shares his house in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, with a divorced daughter, his 8-year-old granddaughter, the daughter's fiance and the fiance's 9-year-old son.
Having the kids around is "delightful," Mr. Price said. "I just taught my granddaughter how to play chess," he said, "and I'm teaching them how to lose at poker."
Indeed, the children figure prominently in a poetic goal that Mr. Price has set for himself. He has a country house in the Berkshires and recently bought an antique Flexible Flyer sled that seats three. "I intend," he said, "to wear it out in my lifetime."
 
Private Sector to Public
David T. Kearns came to know a lot of executives in a decades-long career, first in sales and marketing at I.B.M. and then as a leader for nearly 20 years at Xerox, and he was befuddled by what some of them did the moment they went off the payroll. "By golly, when they retired, they retired -- completely," he said. "They play golf and travel and so forth."
Mr. Kearns knew he would be retiring as chairman and chief executive of Xerox in 1990, at age 60, because a succession plan said so. For him, however, retirement has proved to be an opportunity to delve ever deeper into education issues, which had become important to him as a result of two dozen business trips to Japan in the days when Japanese schools were first being seen as better than their American counterparts.
Just a few months after Mr. Kearns stepped down at Xerox, he received an invitation from Lamar Alexander, newly appointed as Secretary of Education by President George Bush, to become a deputy secretary. "A lot of my friends couldn't figure out why I was going, but I liked it," Mr. Kearns said. "Had the President been re-elected, I would have stayed."
By the will of the people, rather than by design this time, Mr. Kearns found himself out of office for the second time in two years. He was also rapidly losing his eyesight because of a tumor behind his eyes. Yet he went to Harvard University to teach at the school of education for several years.
Now nearly completely blind, Mr. Kearns can read his own writing only if he uses a big crayon. But with the help of a personal assistant, he is still working. Based in an office that Xerox provides for him in Stamford, Conn., he is chairman of a nonprofit organization called the New American Schools Development Corporation, which seeks changes in education, and he is working on his second book about education. He and his wife, Shirley, spend some time in Florida, but have no plans to live there year-round.
"I fill up my time pretty well," Mr. Kearns said.
 
Busy on a Modest Budget
The experience of Gladys Stewart shows that being of modest means does not have to crush a desire to live fully in old age.
"After I retired, I said I was going to sleep all day," said Mrs. Stewart, 77, who lives in the Bronx. Who could blame her, after she had worked three decades as a practical nurse? But doing nothing turned out to be the one thing she couldn't do.
"Since I retired, what have I done? Oh, boy!" Mrs. Stewart said, before launching into a laundry list of activities.
She is the guardian for one sister, who lives with her, and visits another sister in a nursing home several times a month. She takes a 90-year-old neighbor shopping and a 99-year-old neighbor to the doctor. She attends A.A.R.P. and N.A.A.C.P. meetings, exercises at the local senior center and is a member of the women's guild at her church. Her 31-year-old son, a stockbroker, is separated from his wife and has moved back in -- and guess who ends up cleaning his room?
After retiring in 1976, Mrs. Stewart worked part-time to save for some home improvements and was almost too successful. She started with private-duty nursing -- caring for a single patient in the patient's home -- but the client died after a few months. Then she worked part-time in a nursing home. "I did that about six months," she recalled. "Then finally the supervisor said to me, 'Stewart, if I live to be your age and look as well as you look, I would not stop working.' She asked me to join the staff full time. I said: 'That's your cup of tea, not mine. Retirement means retirement.' "
She was serious about it this time and has not done any paid work since. Mrs. Stewart and her husband, James, a World War II munitions worker turned maintenance man, both collect city pensions and Social Security -- "which keeps you two cents from begging," she said. Mr. Stewart, 76, puts his handyman skills to use volunteering at their church and working part-time at Macy's; he cleans rugs on the side.
Nor is this the first time that Mrs. Stewart has rejected a life of leisure. When the Stewarts married, in 1944, he was making enough money building bombs in Connecticut that she could afford to be -- indeed, was expected to be -- a lady of leisure. "After we got married," she said, "I went to every theater there was at that time -- the Strand, the Roxy -- I just had a good time."
But she soon made a choice that continues to define her life to this day: "I said, 'This is not for me.' "
 
Hoping to Change the World
Many people take advantage of retirement to increase their commitment to charitable projects in their communities. For Richard Stegeman, a retired contract engineer for NASA, that community is the planet Earth.
Years ago, Mr. Stegeman, a mechanical engineer, observed that most solar power-generation equipment was too complex to be maintained where it was needed most, in developing countries. For 15 years, he dreamed of making a solar engine so low-tech that it could be built and maintained at remote sites.
His work on the engine remained a mad-scientist hobby until one day last year, when he was at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., watching live televised pictures of Africa from a shuttle mission, and had a sudden realization. "It was time for me to act," he said. "I was definitely on the wrong side of the clouds."
Mr. Stegeman, now 65, had remained single until he was 56 and had never bothered saving much money. He and his wife, Linda Frazee Stegeman, a psychotherapist, took a hard look at their finances and concluded that he really should not leave his job.
He did anyway, and they moved from Maryland to Arizona, in part to be near Mrs. Stegeman's daughter and in part for the sunny skies he needed for his experiments. "The worst-case scenario is, we won't go to jail and we won't starve to death," Mr. Stegeman said, recalling their deliberations. "So we said, 'O.K., let's do it.' "
His retirement account is fast losing altitude, but Mr. Stegeman nonetheless is forming a nonprofit corporation to manufacture and market his engine. He hopes to soon be able to pay himself a salary.
A prototype of the engine -- dubbed Water Heart by a physician friend because of its resemblance to a human heart -- sits in the third bay of the couple's three-car garage. It is an adaptation of the atmosphere engine, a predecessor to the steam engine that was abandoned because of its inefficiency, but which is viable, Mr. Stegeman believes, with the sun as its energy source.
Instead of boiling large quantities of water, the engine heats just enough to create a pressure differential that moves a piston. It only puts out 1.5 horsepower, but that is enough to irrigate a field. The only byproduct is distilled water.
If successful, the Water Heart could help provide nourishing food and clean water to people who could otherwise die for lack of them. But the project is already saving one spirit: Mr. Stegeman's. It has also attracted like-minded engineers and humanitarians interested in working with him.
"I just can't cloister myself in front of the computer or in the shop for very long" without going "nuts," he said.
And he would love to extend the same rescue line to others. "The ideal for me," he said, "would be to bump into some retired guy who has a lot of time on his hands and would get all turned on by this and just want to help me."

Millionaires Increase By the Thousands

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
The number of millionaires in New Jersey nearly tripled in three years, from 3,000 in 1993 to 8,000 in 1996, according an analysis of the 3.4 million 1996 state tax returns filed by residents. The analysis was released by the state Department of the Treasury last week.
The number of people making more than $50,000 a year increased by 12.7 percent during that same period for a total of 1,053,000. The average income for those making between $10,000 and $1 million, an average that eliminates the very richest and poorest from the calculations, rose from $54,780 in 1993 to $60,662 in 1996, or about 11 percent. 
 Investment income during those three years increased by 75 percent while income from wages increased by 15 percent, according to the analysis.
In 1996, 280,000 taxpayers were removed from the tax roles when the minimum income required to pay state taxes increased from $3,000 to $7,500.
The numbers reflect a healthy state economy and an increase in investments, according to Dan Emmer, a Treasury Department spokesman. "The wealthy are not becoming more so at the expense of the poor," he said. "All economic data indicate that the rich may be getting richer, but so too are the other classes."

HEADLINE: Not Lifelong Soldiers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
President Clinton's support for raising military pensions (front page, Dec. 27) as a way of retaining seasoned soldiers, ignores changes in American society. 
 Just as young people no longer expect or prefer to join General Motors or AT&T after graduation and work there until retirement, they join the military to serve and learn skills and move on.
Raising pensions will not handcuff soldiers to their careers. They will still move on. The country benefits as skilled workers move from the tax-spending to the taxpaying side of the economy.
Instead of raising pensions, we should increase training for soldiers to induce them to work where they do not want to work.

Squeezed by Life, a Barkeep Squeezes Back

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Ernie has had only one aspiration in his 55 years of his living. He wanted his very own saloon. And except for a couple years (centuries?) working for the post office, running bars has been his life. He specializes in what he calls "upper-low class" cocktail lounges in Times Square and Hell's Kitchen.
His business philosophy is based on the premise that $2 is plenty to charge for a pint of beer. But he is not incapable of innovation: he installed an automatic teller machine at Rudy's at 627 9th Avenue, one of the two 9th Avenue saloons he actively manages. The other joint aspires to be the first "themed dive bar." Located at (tk), it is called Swine on Nine and features outlandish oil paintings of all manner of pig, from fearsome porkers breathing fire to sweet-smiling sows garlanded with roses. Favored customers, meaning females, get free pink piggy banks. 
 Ernie's forte is ironies calculated to appeal to people whose lives have been a smidge less than perfect. He gives customers nicknames like Big Pete, Penthouse Charlie, Phone Guy or Cowboy, and they seem tickled just to be noticed. As for himself, he throws an annual party on the day his wife (tk) years ago left him for a better man. He knows he was better because his ex-mother-in-law told him.
Ernie is about to move to the next level. Apalled by the cleaning up of the Times Square area and scared silly of Disney, this inveterate gin slinger is striking back with what he considers an incredibly shrewd gambit, thank you very much. He is opening a juice bar. "You've got to go with the flow, right?," Ernie growled in his patented John Wayne imitation. "The flow isn't what it used to be. The flow is what's here today and is coming tomorrow."
The portly flow master paused for emphasis. "The future is health food jerkoffs."
Here is the deal. Starting in February, Swine on Nine will open two hours earlier at 6 A.M. as an emporium of freshly squeezed juices -- carrot, spinach, celery, wheat grass (yes, wheat grass), papaya and more, but mainly carrot. "Everybody loves carrot juice," said Ernie who claims to have tried it. In fact, he has already paid $650 for a huge carrot sign. The price will be $1.50 for a pint of juice. (Or $1 for 10 ounces to go.) There will also be doughnuts at 50 cents each and good strong coffee. A further attraction is that the bar, being a bar and being small enough (less than 35 seats, not counting stools), is a legal venue for smoking.
"There's no where on 9th Avenue you can sit down and smoke a cigarette and drink a cup of coffee," he said.
Sucking on a filterless Pall Mall, Ernie explained the angles of vegetable and fruit juices in his office, the fourth stool from the end at Swine. He is clearly a man who can multi-task. While conversing, he adds seasoning to the chicken soup (Campbell's) that the bar gives away. He offers a woman customer a free weekend in the Poconos and she refuses, as always. An unemployed man Ernie has hired to pull a red Radio Flyer wagon with a huge pig sign round and round Midtown stumbles in. Ernie gives him a Coke, a pep talk and a $10 bill and sends him back out. Bernard, an elegantly spoken 83-year-old patron, sidles up and mentions he needs $100. Ernie peels five twenties from his wad.
"The only way he wouldn't pay me back is if he dies," Ernie said."Ain't nobody dying on purpose."
Back to juice. He has purchased two $2,000 juice machines and is having new sinks installed. He will buy all his veggies across the street from Carl Mazzella's big produce outlet. Yes, people can add booze to their juice, but only after 8 A.M when alcohol goes on sale. By noon, he reckons, juice sales will evaporate as liquid lunchers straggle in.
Ernie's brainstorms are not always awesomely perspicacious. His purchase of many small radios and scattering them about Swine so people could experience last fall's World Series the old-fashioned way was a dud. (He abhors televisions in bars.) But in handling liquids -- of whatever nature -- he feels on firm ground. That means no illusions.
"The carrot juicers are still going to die on the same day they were always going to die," he said. "Only they'll probably have orange skin."
His own future? Ernie looks at the skyscrapers, 45-screen movie theaters, wax museums and $6-a-pint ersatz pubs sprouting around him and dreams of retiring to a mobile home in Florida. "I will be happy living with trailer park trash similar to myself," he said.
One difference. Ernie may be the piece of trash who became rich from a Hell's Kitchen juice bar.

Smart Bombs, Dumb Sanctions

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq

 BODY:
FROM the terrace of his home on the outskirts of Baghdad, a carpet dealer named Ziad al-Kadhimi watched the mid-December bombing while sipping a fruit drink.
"It broke some windows in our house, but we saw it more or less as a show," Mr. al-Kadhimi said. "Bombing is nothing. Maybe it hits a few military buildings, but it doesn't really affect ordinary people. The sanctions hurt a hundred times more." 
 In much of the outside world, the American-led bombing campaigns against Iraq that have been launched periodically since the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991 are viewed as devastating though perhaps necessary assaults. Many Westerners assume that when this country is not being bombed, it enjoys relative tranquillity.
Iraqis assert just the opposite. They say that bombings are increasingly precise and all but harmless to civilians, while economic sanctions devastate their entire society.
The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq eight years ago as part of an effort to force President Saddam Hussein to curb his weapons development program, compensate Kuwaitis for his 1990 invasion of their country, and loosen his despotic rule.
As in some other places where sanctions have been imposed, they do not appear to have had much of the desired political effect. Some diplomats say they are steadily weakening Mr. Hussein by showing senior officials and clan leaders that Iraq faces only hardship as long as he is in power.
Others are dubious.
What seems clear, however, is that the sanctions have plunged this once-prosperous country into poverty, and in the process created deepening anti-Western and especially anti-American sentiment.
The Clinton Administration, which is the principal backer of sanctions, has vowed to use its veto in the United Nations Security Council to prevent them from being lifted. It has not, however, ruled out supporting expansion of a United Nations program under which Iraq is allowed to sell limited amounts of oil and use part of the income to buy food and medicine.
American officials fear that lifting sanctions would allow the Iraqi Government to import an array of products it would use to rebuild its arsenal. They point to Iraq's invasion of Iran in 1980 and of Kuwait in 1990 as evidence that Mr. Hussein's regime is incurably aggressive and untrustworthy.
Officials in Washington pride themselves on the pains they have taken to assure that American bombs hit only military targets in Iraq, and to keep civilian casualties to an absolute minimum. But at the same time, they assert that the sanctions, which probably kill more civilians each month than bombs have killed since 1991, are a regrettable necessity.
It is not surprising, therefore, that many people here and elsewhere are increasingly cynical about American claims that the United States has no desire to hurt ordinary Iraqis. Because of tight censorship, Iraqis know nothing about President Hussein's purchases of luxury items for his palaces over the last few years. They are acutely aware, however, of their daily hardships, and unhesitatingly blame them on the United States and President Clinton.
Whether the human cost of sanctions is worth what they may accomplish in curbing or changing the Iraqi regime is being hotly debated at the United Nations and in many world capitals. Russia, France and China, together with several Arab countries, have called for new approaches that could lead to lifting or relaxation of the sanctions.
United Nations humanitarian workers here are among the most outspoken critics. Their last chief, Denis J. Halliday, resigned his post in protest three months ago and said sanctions "are starving to death 6,000 Iraqi infants every month, ignoring the human rights of ordinary Iraqis and turning a whole generation against the West."
IN his Baghdad office last week, Farid Zarif, deputy director of the United Nations humanitarian aid program here, held up a pencil as an example of items that may not be imported under sanctions.
"We are told that pencils are forbidden because carbon could be extracted from them that might be used to coat airplanes and make them invisible to radar," Mr. Zarif said. "I am not a military expert, but I find it very disturbing that because of this objection, we cannot give pencils to Iraqi schoolchildren."
The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, told the Security Council in March that despite the oil-for-food program, which was launched in 1996, about one-fourth of Iraqi children are now malnourished. The program does not provide Iraqis with protein- and vitamin-rich foods such as milk, fruit, vegetables, eggs or meat.
A United Nations report issued in April concluded that the sanctions "have had a devastating effect on the majority of the Iraqi people." According to the report, 40,000 more children and 50,000 more adults now die each year in Iraqi hospitals than died before the sanctions were imposed. Rates of polio, diphtheria, tuberculosis, malaria and viral hepatitis were said to have sharply increased.
Aid workers like Michel Nahhal, a Lebanese national who has been living in Baghdad for seven years as a representative of the Middle East Council of Churches, say they see United Nations statistics vividly translated into daily life.
"Sanctions are the severest thing that can happen to a country," Mr. Nahhal said. "Here in Iraq, the industrial sector is at a standstill. Agriculture is collapsing because no fertilizers can be imported and there is no electricity to power irrigation pumps. The biggest employer was the oil sector, and that has all but disappeared. Health conditions are terrible because there are no pumps to flush the sewage pipes and not enough trucks to pick up garbage. You see children playing in sewage with no shoes and no shirts.
"People are trying to survive, trying to make ends meet. It's very hard on them. They do whatever they can. There is a lot of prostitution. Boys are prostituting themselves at a very young age. A few bombs landing on military bases every couple of years is nothing compared to this."
For ordinary Iraqis, sanctions have meant an almost surreal descent into a poverty they believe they do not deserve.
"First I sold my television, then my furniture, then my car, then my house," said Mohammed Abdul Razaq, a retired office worker. "Everything that I built up over a lifetime is gone. A bomb is something you hear far away, or at worst, it kills you in a second. Sanctions kill you every day."

HEADLINE: The World: Dissonance;
In China, So Many Liberties, So Little Freedom

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
LAST week, while governments and the press abroad dwelled on the harsh sentences meted out to Chinese dissidents, exuberant middle-class couples crowded into the newly opened Ikea warehouse store here, snapping up stylish, modestly priced furniture and housewares.
As the Chinese and American Governments sparred over human rights, moviegoers rushed to see the season's hit, "Be There or Be Square," a romantic comedy filmed in Los Angeles that affectionately caricatures the United States and the Chinese who go there to seek their fortunes. 
 Among ordinary Chinese people, it would seem, the current crackdown on democracy activists has registered only faintly, if at all. Ask even well-educated professionals what they think about people like Xu Wenli or Wang Youcai, two of the four democracy advocates who received prison terms of a decade or more, and they are apt to call them brave but stupid men who sacrificed themselves with no chance of success. Many Chinese are bewildered by all the attention outsiders give these cases, asserting, as one lawyer did, that "these things just have no affect on our daily lives now."
It's not that people are entirely unaware of the virtues of free speech and politics. But they know that while there is little room for dissent these days, they can pursue exciting new options in their own lives. Many of them just assume that the society will eventually have to liberalize. The biggest threat to their personal freedoms, many say, would be a souring of Chinese-American relations that might strengthen conservative forces here.
Though audiences are streaming to see "Be There or Be Square" for a good laugh rather than for a sociology lesson, the movie's popularity and themes are revealing. The film, which is directed by Feng Xiaogang, deftly plays on Chinese stereotypes about America and about themselves, and viewers are sophisticated enough to see past the caricatures.
The image of Los Angeles is horrid: Robbers lurk around every corner and wide-eyed immigrants at first seem destined for drudgery or jail. But as the two main characters zoom about in their cars, have amusing encounters with the police and create their own niches, the essential, refreshing freedom of California shines through.
The male lead, played by the comic actor Ge You, is an appealing but shiftless man who has spent a decade living in a trailer, selling other Chinese immigrants everything from dubious insurance policies to graveyard plots. When the female lead, played by Xu Fan, arrives in town, pretty but penniless, he warns her that there is good news and bad news about America.
"Go back to China," he says. "This is a terrible place."
"O.K., so what is the good news?" she asks.
"That was the good news," he replies. Then: "Do you want to work as a stripper?"
She declines the offer and after years of perseverance she achieves a decent living in the promised land and, of course, the two fall in love. America is a land of opportunity after all.
Americans here sometimes have a hard time understanding how many Chinese can simultaneously appreciate the freedom of the West -- a growing number of professionals have studied in the United States -- and readily dismiss the dissidents as foolish idealists. The vast majority feel they are finally getting a chance to savor freedom in their personal lives and work, and they want to enjoy the fruits of modern society. The last thing most of them want is upheaval.
Unlike most Chinese, dissidents like Xu Wenli are devoting their lives to an abstract cause. The late philosopher Isaiah Berlin famously said there are two types of intellectuals, the foxes who know many things and the hedgehogs who know one big thing. Mr. Xu and many of his colleagues in the democracy movement are hedgehogs, with their minds focused laserlike on their quest and a determination that transcends bravery.
Mr. Xu has already spent 12 years in prison and he assumed, when he started speaking out again this year, that he would probably be imprisoned again. In the face of repeated warnings and detentions, he stepped up the organization of a new political party and other activities to promote freedom.
And what did he talk about after his sham trial on Dec. 22, when he was granted a final half-hour with his wife before starting a 13-year prison sentence? "He said that the charge of subverting state power made no sense," his wife later said in an interview.
"He said it was legally irrational because state power comes from the citizens," she said as she recounted, proudly, the detailed legal and political analysis her husband gave her in their final minutes together. He told her his prison term would give him time to "think things over very calmly and reflect on what has happened and what should be done." He did, before he was finished, express concern about their daughter and tell his wife -- a remarkably dedicated person in her own right -- to look after her health.
IN interviews, some of the veteran dissidents sound almost robotic ticking off their latest analysis of the global forces and domestic politics that affect the democracy movement. But the analysis is often brilliant, and the monotone reflects minds that are wholly concentrated.
What sustains these dissidents is an article of faith: that freedom of speech and association is central to the good of a modern society. If a single idea drives them, it is a big idea, however pushed aside it is in today's China.
As many citizens and even Government officials will tell you, Chinese today can think what they want and say what they want so long as they do not organize against the Communist Party. First-time visitors, having read about repression here, are often surprised at how ordinary things appear: lively newspapers and magazines, fast-paced television news programs and endless commercials for cosmetics and electronic gear. Severe repression singles out a small number of people, and most of the rest accept the Party's limits, with little apparent pain.
Harder to gauge is the cost to people in terms of cynicism and even moral corrosion of blanking out certain kinds of thoughts; of mouthing hackneyed party phrases in some settings while speaking one's true mind in others, and of taking it for granted that all news is subtly crafted to serve the interests of the Communists.
It may be true that social evolution, propelled by economic and technical change, will eventually bring a free and democratic China, though there is no sign this will happen any time soon. In the meantime people like Xu Wenli and Wei Jingsheng, who is now in exile in the United States after spending much of his adult life in prison, will keep pushing as they can. Only time will tell whether their countrymen will some day honor them for their persistence, and their suffering.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Storm Warning;
The Coming Crime Wave Is Washed Up

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
IN 1994, when a small but influential group of criminologists and politicians began fixing their gaze on the end of the 20th century, they saw a crime storm on the horizon, one teeming with a new breed of superpredators who would soon be reaching their teens.
According to their forecasts, the storm should have hit by now. Instead, the sky has been clearing. 
 For example, the rate of homicides committed by 14- to 17-year-olds, which leapt from 10 per 100,000 in 1985 to 30.2 in 1993, has gone down every year since, to 16.5 in 1997, said James Alan Fox, dean of the college of criminal justice at Northeastern University.
Moreover, statistics released by the Justice Department last week indicated that robberies by offenders of all ages fell a staggering 17 percent in 1997, continuing the seven-year drop in violent crime that followed the crime surge of the 1980's. That drop, criminologists say, is being driven by the falloff in the crack market and by concerted efforts by police departments across the country to seize handguns from juveniles, among other causes.
But that's not exactly what Professor Fox -- along with James Q. Wilson of U.C.L.A., John J. DiIulio Jr. of Princeton University, and Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, the chairman of the House subcommittee on crime -- foresaw in their crystal balls several years ago. In November 1995, for example, Mr. DiIulio, a professor of politics and public affairs, suggested that a dip in crime, already perceptible then, was "the lull before the crime storm."
But if that was the case, said Franklin E. Zimring, a professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley, who was skeptical of such forecasts, "We should have our umbrellas open right now."
Professor Wilson of U.C.L.A., who doesn't recall using a weather analogy but did firmly predict rising youth crime, is more blunt than Professor Zimring.
"So far, it clearly hasn't happened," he said. "This is a good indication of what little all of us know about criminology."
At the heart of the pessimistic predictions was a historical fact: teen-agers commit a lot of crimes. Therefore, it seemed to follow, more teen-agers would mean more crime.
While it is not too late for the doomsday prognostications to come true, given that they were projected from now through 2010 and beyond, it's worth examining why they have not held so far.
Perhaps the most exaggerated factor underpinning the anticipated youth crime wave has been demographics. In January 1996, the Council on Crime in America, an organization of prosecutors and law-enforcement experts, issued a report compiled by Professor DiIulio describing violent crime as a "ticking time bomb" that would go off as the number of teen-agers soared in the coming few years.
But Professor Zimring contends that too much has been made of the anticipated boom in the adolescent population. Consider that the number of Americans aged 14 to 24 is expected to grow about one percent a year from 1995 to 2010 -- from 40.1 million to almost 47 million -- a total increase of about 16 percent. By comparison, the growth in adolescents during the baby boom, from 1960 to 1975, was 50 percent, he said.
Though the correlation between increases in the juvenile population and a rise in violent crime has been regarded as conventional wisdom, the link has hardly proven strong in recent years.
During the five years that the homicide rate among teen-age offenders has been falling, the population of adolescents has already begun to rise. And when the homicide rate among adolescents was spiking in the early 1990's, the adolescent population was flat.
Mr. Wilson, a professor emeritus in the school of management at U.C.L.A. who has written extensively about crime, now says that in foreseeing a youth crime wave, he may have focused too much on population increases at the expense of intangibles like "the perception of young people about the costs and benefits of crime."
Though rates of violent crime have been influenced by a host of more quantifiable factors -- the availability of guns, the growth in the economy, the expansion of crime-prevention programs -- Professor Zimring says he is uncomfortable with trying to predict the criminal potential of someone who may be just a toddler now, if born at all.
"What's been weird has been this single focus: we're only interested in kids four years old now and how many kids they're going to shoot," he said.
Howard Snyder, director of systems research for the National Center for Juvenile Justice in Pittsburgh, a longtime skeptic about the predicted crime wave, thinks many people, especially politicians, have an incentive to be pessimistic.
"People naturally have this pessimism about what's going to happen, especially with kids," he said. "If you predict the future's going to be terrible, you're in a win-win situation. If it does happen, you were right. If it doesn't, your raising the flag of concern helped turn it around."
He said the gloomy oratory has already "changed the nature of juvenile justice," by enabling many states to pass laws that make it easier to try and imprison youthful offenders as adults.
Mr. DiIulio, one of the most vocal prophets of the coming storm, did not return telephone calls last week. But Professor Fox of Northeastern, whose analysis Mr. DiIulio has cited, says that a number of signs remain ominous.
He projects, for example, that growth in the population of black males -- those 14 to 17 years old, as well as to 18 to 24 -- will grow at a steeper rate than their white male counterparts during the first two decades of the 21st century. And if history holds, he said, young blacks will be responsible for a disproportionate share of violent crimes when compared to whites.
He suggests further that the rate of homicides committed by youths 14 to 17 years old -- 16.5 per 100,000 in 1997 -- while nearly half of what it was in 1993, remains nearly double the 20-year low of 8.5 in 1984.
Does that mean that Professor Fox continues to see bad weather on the horizon, as he did so clearly three years ago?
"We may indeed see a resurgence in youth violence," Professor Fox said. "I say 'may.' I didn't say 'will.' "

For Managed Care, Free-Market Shock

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
WHEN the Prudential Insurance Company of America decided last month to sell its health-care operations to Aetna Inc., it was the latest example of a company that could not make money caring for sick people. Despite Prudential's best efforts, the business, mostly in managed care, had lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Prudential finally gave up.
The last few years have proved enormously difficult for many of the businesses created to capture the vast sums flowing through the nation's health-care system -- now more than $1 trillion each year. In particular, companies designed to oversee the delivery of care, like H.M.O.'s and groups of doctors' practices, are struggling. 
 The majority of H.M.O.'s lost money in 1997, accumulating nearly $800 million in losses, according to Weiss Ratings Inc., a Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., company that tracks insurers. Several, including such former industry standouts as Oxford Health Plans and UnitedHealth Group, formerly United HealthCare, reported sizable losses in 1998, and a shakeout is underway among the companies that manage doctors' practices.
Offering some discipline and an entrepreneurial approach, these enterprises had promised to deliver health care much more efficiently than some of the traditional players like Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans -- many of which are nonprofit -- or independently functioning doctors. Investors would share in the savings, they claimed, and the public would benefit from a respite from the relentless climb in health-care costs.
But a real debate is emerging over whether these businesses can wring more efficiencies out of the system and therefore make money over the long haul. While they prospered by taking advantage of easy one-time savings, like the use of their clout to get doctors and hospitals to accept less to provide care, their fat profits could prove ephemeral in the face of medical costs that they, too, cannot control.
"In the short term you can make money," said Howard S. Berliner, the chair of health services and management policy at the New School for Social Research in New York. "In the long term, you can't."
Having rejected costly old-style medical insurance and Clinton Administration proposals for Government-supervised health care, the nation has embraced profit-making managed care companies as the solution to rising medical costs. The failure of these companies to work out their problems is more than just bad news for investors; it raises doubts about the theory that managed care, left to the forces of the free market, would, within a few years, distribute resources effectively and keep costs down.
If the companies simply keep raising premiums, the Government or business or the consumer will eventually object. Cutting back on services by limiting benefits or refusing to provide certain kinds of care is proving equally unpalatable.
Even some of the optimists from Wall Street, who tend to be true believers about the power of the free market, say that while the H.M.O.'s have achieved tremendous savings, they have not demonstrated that they can achieve efficiencies that come from knowing which drugs or treatments work best.
"They figured out how to take costs out of the system, but they need to take care to the next level," said Mary Anne Citrino, a managing director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. who specializes in health care.
WITH profits at many of these companies scarce, investors have fled the stocks. The number of health-care service companies going public dwindled last year to the lowest level in a decade, according to Securities Data Company in Newark, N.J., and the amount of capital the new companies raised from the public this year is only a fourth of the amount raised in 1995.
To be sure, plenty of people -- the executives running these companies, for example, and the vast majority of physicians -- continue to make very good livings. UnitedHealth's chief executive, William W. McGuire, for example, made about $10 million, including the value of his stock options, in 1997, according to Graef Crystal, a compensation expert. Even Oxford's debacle could prove lucrative to its founder, Stephen F. Wiggins, who got a $9-million severance package when he resigned as chairman early last year. That package is currently under review by the company.
But many of these businesses appear to be running out of opportunities. After several profitable years during which premiums were kept in check, H.M.O.'s seem to be no match for the inexorable rise in medical costs. Oxford, whose rapid growth got the better of it, has accumulated about $900 million in net losses over the last 12 months because it underestimated the cost of delivering care and failed to charge enough for its popular plans. The company has sharply raised its prices at the risk of losing some of its members.
UnitedHealth, which is considered among the best managed in the industry, misjudged how expensive it would be to provide care to the elderly under the Government's Medicare program. The company reported a $565-million net loss in August and rapidly scaled back its efforts. Even an old hand like Kaiser Permanente, a nonprofit pioneer, is losing hundreds of millions of dollars because demand for care is increasing and it can do little to check the rising cost of drugs and medical technology.
While many of the managed-care companies were able to significantly raise their premiums for 1999, they may never be as profitable as they were five years ago. And the public's willingness to accept higher prices may be short-lived if people begin to believe that there is not enough money to go around to insure that care remains affordable.
"The cold reality began to dawn on people in the system: Saving money for employers and making money comes at the expense of public access to doctors, hospitals and services," said Arnold S. Relman, a physician who was the former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine.
Other attempts to cut costs by being more efficient have also foundered. When H.M.O.'s and other insurers forced doctors to accept less money for their services, there was little room for the companies that buy and manage doctors' practices to make money. Many of these companies discovered that their doctors simply could not deliver care as cheaply as had been expected. FPA Medical Management of Miami filed for bankruptcy protection in July because it was losing money on many of its doctors' contracts, and MedPartners Inc. of Birmingham, Ala., the largest of these companies, announced last November that it would leave the business because it could not figure out how to deliver care cheaply enough.
And most H.M.O.'s are losing money on Medicare patients, according to Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. When the Government decided to sharply limit Medicare payments to managed-care plans beginning in 1999, dozens of H.M.O.'s either abandoned or scaled back their services. Some 400,000 Medicare patients are being dropped.
Critics of the current system say it has never offered an economic incentive to care for sick people. Because the insurers do not spread the risk of caring for the sick over the entire population, and are not paid more when they provide more care, the companies can only thrive by covering those who are healthiest.
"Unless you have a health-care system designed to encourage health plans to treat the sick, and not compete purely on cost, there will be no winners," said Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Rights Center, a New York consumer group.
Half of all the elderly could not get health insurance in 1965, before Medicare, because private insurers would not cover them or made their policies unaffordable, she said.
T HE proponents of the profit-making companies believe it is only a matter of time before business will find a way to make sense of the nation's health-care system. But companies will first need to develop the kind of monitoring systems necessary to know exactly how care is being delivered and what kind of care is, in fact, most effective, according to Ms. Citrino. Now, she said, it is like banking before the development of automatic teller machines.
Others doubt whether the businesses will ever succeed, especially if they attempt to provide care for everyone, including those who cannot afford it.
"If I were a Wall Street analyst," said Dr. Relman."I would have a no-buy recommendation on them all."

If You're Tired of the Same Old Grind, It's Time to Bone Up on Your Pushtu

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE DOWNES 

 BODY:
WHAT better moment than the dawn of a new year to start scanning the horizon for a new job, a new career, a new life?
Sooner or later nearly everybody fantasizes about a fresh beginning. Even the smartest and most accomplished -- executives and academics, government ministers and department heads -- must occasionally find themselves wondering what color their parachutes are. 
 It may be hard to picture the power elite in their pajamas, sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee and a pencil, ready to circle the want ads and massage the resume before taking it down to Kinko's to be photocopied on vellum stock.
But it must happen, if the following job postings in recent issues of The Economist are any guide. Why The Economist? With offices in 19 cities around the world, and its focus on the what's-really-important -- politics and money -- the magazine is what every plugged-in global villager is reading. If you were looking to hire a weapons of mass destruction research fellow, where else would you advertise?
For many ads the requirements are -- to put it mildly -- obscure, with the pool of ideal candidates on the planet probably totaling, oh, seven people. The jobs are real, though, demonstrating that even globe-trotting wonks and power brokers scan the want ads, and that the most prestigious-sounding positions can somehow go begging for applicants.
The ads suggest strongly, too, that after ants, bureaucrats rule the Earth.

HEADLINE: As Ethnic Pride Rises, Rhinoplasty Takes a Nose Dive

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
THERE was a time not so long ago when the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital on East 64th Street was as chic a destination for Christmas vacation as St. Barts or Telluride.
That is where many teen-aged girls would disappear during school holidays to get the ethnic bumps on their noses smoothed out. So crowded were the operating rooms at this time of year, recalled Dr. Gerald H. Pitman, a plastic surgeon, that he would set out 20 sets of rhinoplasty instruments in the morning and run out before the day was done. 
 But the crowd is thinning.
In the midst of an explosion in cosmetic surgery, the number of nose jobs has dropped significantly. While the total number of cosmetic procedures increased 76 percent, to 697,000 from 395,000, between 1992 and 1996, the numbers of rhinoplasties, as they are known, fell 8 percent, to 46,000 from 50,000. And the decline was probably steeper between the 1990's and the 1970's, experts say, although no statistics are available before this decade.
The reasons are partly cultural and partly economic, according to plastic surgeons who have watched the evolution of a procedure that was once a benchmark in a young girl's life, especially among Jewish teen-agers.. "It was the thing to do," said Dr. H George Brennan, who practices in Southern California. "You had your bat mitzvah and you got your nose done."
The heyday for nose jobs, experts agree, was in the 60's and early 70's, when the post-war baby boomers were teen-agers. Parents of Jewish ancestry who knew first-hand of the Nazi atrocities were ever on the alert for stirrings of anti-semitism.
They wanted their own children spared discrimination. And to them, that meant fitting inconspicuously into the Protestant mainstream. "Jewish parents at that time didn't want their children to look Jewish," said Dr. James L. Baker Jr., who practices outside Orlando, Fla. "They feared a stigma left from the war."
The physical characteristic that most set Jews apart was their noses, and so legions of teen-agers, usually girls, had them fixed. The technology was primitive compared to today's and so the results, through the 1970's, had a cookie-cutter similarity -- little ski-jump noses with the bony bridge scooped away.
But that was O.K. with the patients. "Everybody wanted to look like a shiksa," said Dr. Thomas D. Rees, a retired plastic surgeon who trained many of the high-priced doctors at work today along Park Ave.
The leading practitioner back then was Dr. Howard Diamond of Manhattan, renowned for standardizing what had been a hit-or-miss operation. "Every girl on Long Island had a Diamond nose," said Dr. George J. Beraka, who said he can still pick them out on women now deep into middle-age.
But fashion was changing. Ethnic looks were coming into style. In the mid-70's, black models appeared for the first time on the covers of Glamour and Vogue. Blondes were not the only ones having fun. Lana Turner and Betty Grable were replaced by Barbra Streisand (who was afraid to have a nose job for fear it would change her voice) and Cher (who eventually had her nose fixed, along with many other body parts.)
Now, doctors say, their patients want to maintain their ethnic individuality, perhaps with slight refinement. Where once the button nose was the rage, women these days beg for a "natural" look. "They're not trying to erase their ethnic background anymore," said Dr. Darrick E. Antell, a Park Avenue surgeon.
Dr. Christopher Nanni of Brooklyn agreed: "There's a much broader definition of beauty. Not everyone needs to look like Barbie." Dr. Nanni noted that the preoccupation has shifted to flat stomachs and wrinkle-free faces. "It's youth they're looking for, not certain facial features."
Another factor in the decline of nose jobs, doctors say, is the new health care economics. In the old days, insurance plans covered the procedure if a patient complained of breathing difficulties. Now, insurers do not docilely accept that a cosmetic operation costing between $3,000 and $8,000 is necessary for a deviated septum. "They fight and fight," Dr. Pitman said, and many middle-class families are "reluctant to spend the college money."
The statistics available on rhinoplasty do not distinguish between primary and secondary surgeries, the return trips to the operating room to fix what was done before. Dr. Antell said he sees older women who have tired of their cute little ski-slope noses and "want to turn the clock back" and look like real people. He complies, transplanting cartilage from the septum to give them back the bump they once hated.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
When, and If, Impeachment Meets Wall Street

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS the Senate returns to Washington this week to begin an impeachment trial of the President, the airwaves and Op-Ed pages are filled with prophecies of doom. A year of scandal and partisanship on a scale unseen in a generation has, it is said, left the capital adrift and the President paralyzed no matter how the Senators vote. The White House rarely misses a chance to exploit that worry, warning darkly about how a prolonged trial, much less the removal of a President, could unravel this Age of Prosperity.
Two hundred and fifty miles north, on Wall Street, life looks different. The Dow's party goes on. It ended the year well above 9,000, after a plunge in September and October that now seems like nothing worse than a terrifying bungee-jump that punctuated a delightful vacation. No one is sure exactly what brought it back -- maybe Alan Greenspan's interest rate cuts, maybe new money for the International Monetary Fund, maybe the hope that 18 months of global chaos is morphing into something more manageable. 
 Sure, there are still anxieties about profits, deflation, slow growth and the gnawing sense that whatever afflicted Asia and Russia is simply in remission.
But impeachment? No problem.
Somewhere in the intersection of those views -- Washington's certainty that what's happening here matters to the Government's ability to manage the nation and its economy, and the markets' view that the political wars and moral arguments here are irrelevant -- lies a dynamic that seems bound to define 1999.
It is a well-proven maxim that in good times, countries can thrive even when their governments are paralyzed. Japan is perhaps the premiere example: In the 1980's, Japanese industrialists boasted that the weakness of the Japanese state was one secret of their success.
But the experience of the past few years in Japan, Russia, Asia and Latin America suggests that once things go awry, a distracted or weak government can make things worse.
That may explain why Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, a man who has lived in both worlds, went out of his way last week to portray Mr. Clinton as a President in full, remarkably undistracted by the prospect of an imminent trial.
"I've seen him a lot lately, and when he comes into our meetings he is fully there," Mr. Rubin said. "He is remarkably focused on what is happening."
Whether the President is engaged or depressed, consumed with his fate or determined to turn his mind to other things, the question remains: Are there unforeseen dangers emanating from the ugliness of the past year? It is hard to tell, especially at a moment when it is unclear whether Mr. Clinton's trial in the Senate will be long, or as many suggested last week, could move quickly to the question of censure. But the issue hardly goes away when the trial ends. Will the legacy of partisanship end any chance of working out a deal on Social Security or the range of other issues on the national agenda? Or, as many moderates in both parties argue, will there be a drive to get something done, anything that would enable incumbents to go to the voters with something more to show than a vote on Bill Clinton's behavior?
Conventional wisdom in Washington, which has been wrong at virtually every turn in this melodrama, sides with the gridlock scenarios.
On Wall Street, at least for now, gridlock sounds fine. More than a few top executives say that a Congress consumed with impeachment is a Congress too distracted to raise taxes or think up new ways to spend money.
But that is mostly loose cocktail party talk, the kind of bravado born of good times. Government action never seems more useless than when interest rates and unemployment are hovering near 30-year lows, when budgets are in balance, when crime is down and Internet stocks are trading at levels that seem to defy logic.
J UST remember September and October, a time of terror in the markets, when it seemed as if Asia's troubles and Russia's default had arrived on America's doorstep.
The almost-crash of '98 prompted muted talk of a global recession and fears that the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, a huge hedge fund, presaged big trouble. The big question was: What was Washington going to do, and how quickly was it going to do it?
It turned out that Washington acted pretty fast. Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, came through with three interest-rate cuts. Mr. Clinton gave speech after speech urging other nations to focus on growth and forget about inflation fears, and they cut rates, too. A scared Congress approved new financing for the International Monetary Fund. The Fed coordinated a private sector bailout of Long-Term Capital Management. Things settled down, defying Washington's expectations.
Those were largely actions that the Federal Reserve and the executive branch could execute by themselves. What no one yet knows is whether Washington's immersion in the impeachment, the culture wars and the positioning for supremacy at the polls could distract it from more politically difficult steps needed to sustain America's boom.
History, an uncertain guide, suggests that the risk is real.
Andrew Johnson's impeachment in 1868 led to an era of weak government and, the next year, a Black Friday in which a major Wall Street firm sought to corner the market for all gold in the country outside the Treasury. International trade, which was settled in gold at the time, briefly came to a halt. The next 20 years were marked by forgettable Presidents and a succession of panics and scandals.
But as David Donald, the Harvard historian of the Civil War and Reconstruction eras, said in an interview recently, what happened in America in the 1860's and 1870's "didn't radiate out into the world, except to confirm the European view that America is a barbarous and uncouth nation." Nor did the economic events beyond Americas borders require swift or decisive action in Washington. "This time," he said, "it could be different."
In fact, there is plenty of evidence around the world in recent years that political distraction in one country can affect the wealth of other nations. Japan is the most conspicuous example.
The Japanese in the late 1980's not only thought they were on top of the world, they thought the chaos in their own Government barely mattered. Bribery scandals and the political power struggles that in 1993 resulted in the ouster of the Liberal Democrats after 35 years of increasingly corrupt rule, all seemed like a side show to an economic miracle.
In retrospect, it is clear that Japan was like a car that had run out of gas, but had so much momentum that the passengers didn't notice until the scenery stopped moving.
POLITICIANS didn't notice even then; they raised taxes, making a bad situation worse. They ignored a trillion dollars in bad debts, hoping a market upturn would make it all go away. It didn't.
The story was similar in Thailand, South Korea and especially Russia, where American officials were warning President Boris N. Yeltsin two years ago that a free-market economy did not mean that the Government had no power to regulate.
"One thing is clear from the financial crises," said Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund. "Weak governments have a terrible time putting together sensible decisions, and rallying market confidence."
But he quickly noted that the United States appears to be different, because the independence of the Federal Reserve and market confidence in the competence of the Treasury mean that "the system seems to work even when it might superficially appear to be immobilized. It is relevant to Russia and to the Asians and certainly to Japan." The United States, Mr. Fischer said, is different. "It seems to work even when it would appear immobilized."
How well the United States responds to any imminent economic shocks amid impeachment and its aftermath depends, of course, on how markets, consumers and world economies weather the next few months. If the Internet-stock bubble is pricked, if the bailout of Brazil goes bad, if Russia dissolves or China slows, if another hedge fund crashes, politics and prosperity are bound to cross paths.
Michael Beschloss, the Presidential historian, wonders whether President Nixon might have responded differently to the energy crisis if Watergate had not erupted at the same moment.
"We now know how much Nixon was distracted -- that he was spending 70 to 80 percent of his time on Watergate," Mr. Beschloss said. "If you need to convince Congress and the public that the moment has come to make a sacrifice, that's when credibility suddenly becomes important."

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I could identify with "Free Spirits at the Family Table" (Preludes, Dec. 20), which discussed holiday conversations about finances. 
 As an unemployed actor doing temp work in New York for the last several years, I know all about the syndrome. In fact, most of my younger nieces and nephews earn more than me and seem to always ask the impossible-to-answer questions about my work; it seems they haven't a clue about the financial end of it.
Many people think actors are wealthy if they've done any film work at all, because of residuals and the like. For the vast majority of us, however, nothing could be further from the truth.

HEADLINE: Mr. Pataki's New Year Challenge

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki of New York must be looking at 1999 with particular curiosity. Mr. Pataki was sworn in for a second term on New Year's Day, following a comfortable re-election victory last November. The state's economy is still strong and the upcoming legislative season does not seem to hold any dramatic challenges.
But Mr. Pataki has never been a politician who likes to nest in a safe place. His risk tolerance is very high for a New York elected official, his career marked by an eagerness to move up the ladder even if it meant taking a chance. If the Governor could look into a crystal ball and see a long stretch of serene prosperity that left him still occupying his current job in 2004, he might be disappointed. 
 If Mr. Pataki has national ambitions, however, he needs to bulk up his reputation for substance. He has a good record as an environmentalist and a tax-cutter, but the woods are full of ambitious Republican governors, many of them even better vote-getters with stronger records for innovation. This year offers Mr. Pataki the chance to prove that he has the strength and will to put forth his own path-breaking agenda.
The Governor can do this by tackling New York's scandalous campaign-finance system. As a recent Times story by Clifford Levy pointed out, the campaign-finance regulations that do exist are riven with loopholes and enforced by an understaffed bureaucracy. During his recent campaign, Mr. Pataki declared the status quo "dreadful" and promised major, though undefined, reform.
It is time for the Governor to show his hand and make his proposals. State Comptroller Carl McCall has already said he will offer a series of reforms, including public financing for campaigns, a ban on the monster loophole called "soft money" and restrictions on campaign contributions by people doing business with the state. But the reality of politics in New York is that for real reform to succeed, it must be championed by a Republican like Mr. Pataki, since it is the Republican Party that has been the chief obstacle to change.
Mr. Pataki knows better than anyone in New York what a wreck the state's political system is. The Legislature is perpetually divided between a Republican Senate and Democratic Assembly, and most members are in seats so safe they are virtual lifetime sinecures. The legislators respond mainly to the importuning of lobbyists who control campaign contributions, not the public. None of those things will change until the flow of money through the state's porous campaign-finance regulations stops.
The Republican Party in New York is struggling right now. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, its leader and heart, lost his re-election bid. Mr. Pataki is not only the logical head of the state's Republican forces, he is now the only member of his party, other than the Lieutenant Governor, holding statewide office. This is the right time for him to direct his party and his state in a different direction, toward a political world in which policy is no longer made on the basis of campaign donations.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 30

 BODY:
American officials are casting their nets wide to find a credible opposition leader or perhaps a figurehead who might lead Iraq after Saddam Hussein, meeting even with a man who would be king.
During the recent American and British bombing of Iraq, State Department and Pentagon officials met with Sharif Ali bin al-Hussein, the 42-year-old heir to the throne of a short-lived modern Iraqi monarchy that ended 40 years ago. 
 Mr. Ali, who leads the Constitutional Monarchy Movement, survived a revolution in 1958 that toppled his cousin, the last King, Faisal II. The King was killed, along with the Crown Prince, Abdullah. Mr. Ali, then only 2 years old, was taken out of Iraq by his parents, both of whom were also related to the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
Mr. Ali's grandfather, the Emir of Mecca, was the uncle of Iraq's first modern King, Faisal I, who had been handed the throne of Iraq by the British in 1921.
Britain, given a mandate to rule Iraq after the collapse of the Turkish Ottoman Empire in World War I, quickly set about establishing a parliamentary system in Iraq (also short-lived) and decided to crown it with a constitutional monarchy. This, after all, was Mesopotamia, home to the some of the greatest monarchies of ancient history.
Mr. Ali, whose family went to Lebanon from Iraq and who now lives in London, commands only a small movement, other Iraqi exiles say. But he thinks nonetheless that the idea of a constitutional monarchy still has resonance in Iraq.
"The Iraqi monarchy would be a symbol around which all parts of Iraq would be able to rally because we're not based on any single constituency, nor are we a political party," Mr. Ali said in an interview. "What we look forward to is establishing democratic institutions that would guarantee that all players in politics would be able to participate as they wish."
Mr. Ali, whose education was largely Western, has produced a plan for a future Iraq that he calls a National Covenant. It would restore an Islamic monarchy pledged to protect the human rights of followers of all religions and create a free-market economic system, a multiparty democracy and an independent judiciary.
"It was the monarchy that achieved independence for Iraq from the League of Nations mandate," he said. "Iraq was the first Arab nation to have independence. The legacy of the monarchs compared to the republics that followed -- all of them dictatorships -- have made people much more aware of the positive roles of the monarchy."
For the moment, Mr. Ali said, he sees his mission as helping to bring a fractured exile opposition together.
"The opposition is united on the goals of removing Saddam Hussein and his regime and of bringing him to justice in front of an international tribunal," he said. "What we have to do is to make our efforts more coordinated and more cooperative. The political environment is there."
Mr. Ali said he left Washington believing that the Clinton Administration is serious about giving the Iraqi opposition substantial help, but he agrees with other exiles that the job of removing Mr. Hussein will have to be done by Iraqis inside Iraq. And they, Mr. Ali said, have often had unrealistic expectations about how much the United States and Britain can or will do for them.
History is littered with broken American promises to Iraqis, particularly to the Kurds in the north and Shiites in the south, whose uprisings Washington often encouraged and then stood back and watched be crushed.
"When President Clinton says that he is looking forward to the day of a new regime in Iraq, it is very encouraging to the opposition to know that the only superpower in the world is now willing to help to establish a democratic regime in Iraq," Mr. Ali said.
"Most Iraqis are in the opposition, basically," he said. "From even the highest echelons, they are looking for a way out."
But he said he remains wary.
"The Iraqi people have the ability to overthrow the regime but they need to know that if they carried this out, they would have the support of the international community and that obstacles wouldn't be put in their path," he said.

Some Quietly Take Pleasure in N.B.A.'s Pain

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
People in baseball wouldn't wish their 1994 experience on their worst enemy, but David Stern isn't their worst enemy.
As the National Basketball Association enters its do-or-die week, baseball officials know the feeling. But all they did was kill the World Series for the first time in 90 years. Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, is on the brink of wiping out an entire season. If he and the team owners take that fatal step, they will go from history of one sort to history of another, from having been the only league never to have lost a game to a work stoppage to being the only league ever to lose a whole season. 
 No one in baseball will say it publicly, but some officials have acknowledged privately that they have enjoyed watching Stern plummet from one stage toward the other. The perfect commissioner of the perfect league could use some soiling, they have long felt, and now, even if a jury-rigged season is salvaged, the stains will be indelible.
Major League Baseball has an economic stake in the N.B.A.'s problems as well. The N.B.A. has been perceived in recent years as the sport of the moment. Sports fans do not have unlimited money to spend, so if more becomes available to spend on tickets to baseball games or on baseball merchandise, so much the better for major league teams, which desperately seek increased revenue.
As a labor dispute, the N.B.A.'s problem is no different from the one baseball endured in 1994. It's all about the division of revenue between owners and players. The only difference is that the baseball dispute prompted the players to strike, while the basketball fight resulted in an owners' lockout.
In 1994, the players walked out Aug. 12, and after a few more futile bargaining sessions, Bud Selig, then the acting baseball commissioner, set Sept. 9 as the day on which the rest of the season and the World Series would be canceled if no agreement was reached.
The day before the deadline, the union presented a new proposal to the owners centered on a tax that would be levied on the revenues and the payrolls of the 16 higher-revenue clubs. More than a year later, it was a luxury tax on the five highest payrolls that brought an end to the dispute.
On the day before the deadline, however, the owners' negotiators rejected the tax plan, sticking instead to their quest for a salary cap. As a footnote to baseball labor history, one member of the seven-person contingent that presented the new proposal to management was Kevin Brown, who recently became the sport's highest-paid player and whose $105 million contract should put the Los Angeles Dodgers firmly in the tax-paying group.
Selig let the Sept. 9 deadline pass. Five more days went by before the owners voted by 26-2 to cancel the rest of the season and the World Series.
Stern has set Thursday as the N.B.A. deadline. If the two sides have no agreement, he has said, he will recommend to the owners that they call off the season. Taking an even harder position, going into the weekend the commissioner had refused to meet with union officials to receive their latest proposal.
The union responded by saying no meeting, no proposal. But details were leaked to reporters, so the league knew the union was willing to place a cap of $15 million on individual player salaries. No such limit exists in any major sports league.
In recent weeks, Stern has lobbied heavily with the players, twice mailing them details of league proposals and urging the union to allow the players to vote on the league's latest proposal. Even more aggressively, he has called the union's 19-player negotiating committee a runaway group that is holding the rest of the players hostage, has accused some agents of destructively influencing negotiations and has suggested that players who express opposing views are disciplined by the union.
David Falk, Stern's No. 1 target among the agents, has said Stern's words and actions are those of a desperate man. Indeed, an outsider watching and listening to the commissioner could reasonably conclude that he is desperate to save the season his lockout has jeopardized and wants the players to rescue him.
Although there has been more noise than substance to the complaints about agents' influence on the talks, in the baseball strike, three agents were instrumental in helping lay the groundwork for an agreement.
The basketball union's use of a negotiating committee, for which it has been criticized, is routine. In each baseball labor negotiation, the union's executive board has appointed a negotiating committee that has had the authority to make a deal. The dissenting comments of a handful of rank-and-file players do not demand a major change in the committee's position.
Nor is there any reason for a union to listen to a commissioner when he calls for a vote of the membership. These negotiations have been far different from those of 1995, when Stern had a friendlier union head, Simon Gourdine, to bargain with.
If the season is canceled, the N.B.A. and the players face a risk of unknown proportions. Once the season is lost, the incentive for an agreement lessens greatly and positions harden. After the World Series went down in 1994, negotiators did not meet for two months, and it took a judge's ruling, not collective bargaining, to enable the 1995 season to begin.
If the N.B.A. does not have a 1998-99 season, no one can guarantee 1999-2000.
 
 
You've Been Traded, Son
 Bob Boone remembers the time Al Campanis, then the Los Angeles Dodgers' general manager, traded his own son, Jimmy, to the Kansas City Royals. Boone never thought he would have a similar experience.
"It's a strange emotional feeling," Boone said. "I've had the opportunity in the course of my career to do some pretty unusual things and be around some special things. I never had the opportunity to trade your kid. It's pretty unique."
As a member of the Cincinnati Reds' front office, Boone participated in the November trade that sent his son Bret Boone to the Atlanta Braves for Denny Neagle. Did Bob, a former major league catcher, feel any guilt?
"No, I'm pretty analytical," he said. "My wife is a little upset at me. I tend to look at things and say what's the best for all parties here. This is a good deal for him. He lives right by the complex in spring training. He doesn't have to move. He and his wife are building a home in Orlando. When he goes on the road, if she wants to go home, it's an easy plane flight."
Bret Boone was the Reds' second baseman. His younger brother, Aaron, could be the Reds' third baseman next season. "Aaron's his own man," their father said. "He and his brother are very good friends. You don't like to see your friend leave, but it'll have no effect on him."
Boone the elder is not completely void of feelings when he watches his sons play. Explaining that he looks at them from two perspectives, father and baseball appraiser, Boone said: "I probably get a little more nervous for them when they're in situations. 'Come on, you gotta get a hit here, show off a little.' I managed against Bret a couple years in the coast league and I coached him when I was a bench coach in '94.
"I've been around it more than most. I don't know if it's easier, but you get used to it. You get used to watching them with a daddy's eye and a professional eye. My job is to evaluate, so you have to be analytical."
 
 
When $15 Million Isn't Enough
 If a pitcher is paid $15 million a year, he should reasonably be expected to be one of the best pitchers in the league, certainly among the top five. But the Dodgers apparently don't think $15 million is enough for Kevin Brown. His contract calls for award bonuses, including for his placement in the Cy Young award voting. If he finishes as low as fifth, he receives $50,000.
That $15 million a year isn't enough for other expenditures, either. Much has been made of the 12 round-trip flights in a private jet for his family to selected games -- he will make enough to buy his own plane -- but the Dodgers will also pay for ground transportation and eight premium season tickets.
The Dodgers are not alone in their eagerness to force unnecessary bonuses and payments on players. Along with $13 million a year, the Mets will give Mike Piazza bonuses for certain awards and the use of a luxury box at Shea Stadium for regular-season and post-season games.
On top of his $13.1 million a year and award bonuses, Randy Johnson has the use of a luxury box at the Arizona Diamondbacks' park and also gets two season tickets for the Phoenix Suns of the N.B.A., if they ever play. The Baltimore Orioles aren't giving Albert Belle tickets for basketball games, their games or plane flights, but they will give him $1 million on top of his $13 million salary if he wins the most valuable player award. If he finishes 10th in the voting, he gets $125,000.
Somehow, Bernie Williams missed out in his $12.5 million-a-year contract with the Yankees. No plane flights, no luxury box, no bonuses for being 12th in the m.v.p. voting. Just his salary.

HEADLINE: Sale of Lavish Hotel, Four Seasons, Is Mired in a Legal Fight

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Four Seasons, whose lavish rooms and panoramic views of the New York skyline make it one of the world's most expensive hotels, is not an easy sell.
That is not to say the sleek 52-story hotel, on 57th Street east of Madison Avenue, has trouble filling its 370 rooms, where the limestone, onyx and beechwood interiors feature bedside switches that operate the window blinds and bathrooms with color televisions and tubs that fill in 60 seconds. 
 But only two years after buying the Four Seasons -- where the 3,000-square-foot presidential suite goes for $10,000 a night -- a Hong Kong company that now needs to sell the prized hotel to pay mounting debts finds itself unable to do so.
The company, Lai Sun Hotels, recently became ensnared in a legal battle with Gene E. Phillips, a Dallas real estate operator, and a company he controls, American Realty Trust.
Mr. Phillips, who said in court that he signed a purchase deal with Lai Sun, has brought the sales effort to a virtual halt, even as three other wealthy buyers are clamoring to snap up the hotel.
It is only the latest evidence that New York real estate is not for the fainthearted.
"New York is perceived as the capital of the world and the Four Seasons is one of the top hotels in the city," said Daniel Lesser, senior director of the hotel group at Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate broker. "But in New York, real estate deals can be a full-contact sport."
With a financial crisis sweeping Hong Kong and much of Asia, Lai Sun has been forced to raise cash by selling the Four Seasons, as well as the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles. The Four Seasons, which has no connection to the Four Seasons restaurant in New York, is considered a world-class trophy by hoteliers. It has the highest average room rates in the country, at more than $600 a night.
Lai Sun owns a 50 percent stake in the hotel through a complex web of foreign companies that, according to the lawsuit, were set up to avoid income taxes, a not uncommon real estate practice. The other owners are also based in Hong Kong, and real estate executives say that each one has tried to tinker with the deal.
"They're not able to speak as a unified group," said one real estate banker who negotiated unsuccessfully with Lai Sun in the past.
American Realty Trust contends in a lawsuit filed earlier this month in New York State Supreme Court that it made a $2 million down payment and signed a letter of intent in October to buy the Four Seasons for $270 million, $80 million more than Lai Sun paid forit in 1996.
But instead of closing on the deal in November, the lawsuit says, Lai Sun fraudulently used the offer "as a stalking horse to generate other offers for the hotel." American Realty is seeking $80 million in damages and an injunction barring Lai Sun from selling the hotel to anyone else.
In response to American Realty's complaints, the lawsuit says, Lai Sun promised to abide by the preliminary deal but then demanded an additional $15 million down payment, which the Dallas company rejected.
Real estate executives and rival bidders said that in November and December at least three other investment groups, including Apollo Real Estate Advisers, reviewed financial documents in what is referred to as the war room at the Four Seasons and were interested in buying the hotel. Several real estate bankers complained that American Realty tied up the hotel and then tried, unsuccessfully, to secure financing for the acquisition. Lawyers for both American Realty and Lai Sun in New York declined comment.
Mr. Phillips, whose family trust is the largest single shareholder of American Realty, once headed the Southmark Corporation, a large real estate company that fell into bankruptcy court in 1989 after losing $1 billion in nine months. Angry investors waged a legal war against him that continues to this day. Still, companies controlled by Mr. Phillips bought many of Southmark's assets at bargain prices.
Hotel analysts contend that the longer it takes to sell the Four Seasons in New York, the less money Lai Sun will make on the deal. They said that the market in New York had peaked, with sale prices having retreated since the spring.
In April, Strategic Hotel Properties of Chicago walked away from a deal to buy the Four Seasons for $370 million, or about $1 million a room. Five months later, American Realty signed a letter of intent to buy the hotel for $730,000 a room.
"This hotel should have been sold a year ago," said Arthur Adler, a partner at the Sonnenblick-Goldman Corporation, a real estate investment bank. "It's a little bit tougher now."

HEADLINE: A Rural Town Takes On Obstacles to Internet Ties

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: NORTH ADAMS, Mass., Dec. 30

 BODY:
Even unimaginative futurists predict that some not-so-distant day, geography will barely matter. Humanity's web of electronic connections will trump it utterly. That will be particularly nice for isolated spots like this long-depressed former mill and factory town, cupped in the Berkshire Mountains in the remotest corner of Massachusetts.
But here is the transitional rub: Sometimes the places that most need to overcome geography have the hardest time doing it, because they are handicapped by their distance from the nearest access point to the long-distance carriers that offer Internet connections. 
 In other words, words used by members of Berkshire Connect, a task force formed by local civic and business leaders with state help to address the problem, high-speed Internet connections like T-1 lines are too expensive here. Connections often cost double, triple or more what a user would pay in Boston or Springfield, Mass., because of the distance-sensitive telephone charges to reach the far-off big carrier.
Telephone companies say that with the region's sparse population, local demand is not sufficient to justify laying new lines that would cut the cost. So the electronic road to the rest of the world can sometimes seem as annoyingly narrow as the winding local Mohawk Trail.
That hinders the region's hopes, just beginning to be realized, of replacing its dead mills with engines of the new information economy: high-tech start-ups, new media businesses and other companies that project their presence on the Internet.
Berkshire County is not alone in its problem, said Donald Dubendorf, a Williamstown lawyer and head of Berkshire Connect's action committee. "Lots of rural counties find themselves disconnected and presenting too small a demand profile" to prompt telephone companies to improve and thus cheapen Internet connections, Mr. Dubendorf said. "There are parallels in history -- rural electrification in the 30's, 40's and 50's."
Mr. Dubendorf also found a parallel in history for what Berkshire Connect is trying to do: the cooperatives that Western farmers formed when the new intercontinental railroads asked too much to bring their goods to market. They pooled their produce and sought ways to buy or build railroad spurs, he said.
About a century later, Berkshire Connect appears about to settle on information-age equivalents of the farmers' tactics. The group is about to issue business and technological plans, and members say they are expected to involve some laying of fiber optic cable. In a very 90's economic development tactic, the group is expected to call for drawing the millions needed from public and private money.
For decades, Berkshire County residents have been at odds over improving road connections to the Massachusetts Turnpike. With no consensus over routes, nothing has been done. But, task force members say, there is no not-in-my-back-yard attitude about better telephone lines. Everyone seems to want them.
Especially two forces: a handful of tech upstarts, most of whom have come from Williams College and into Williamstown, down the road from here, in the last five years; and the high-tech Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, scheduled to open in May in North Adams.
The young founders of Tripod, one of the most visited sites on the Web, do not complain about the high telephone rates. The machines that handle their Internet traffic are based in New Jersey anyway, at a company that specializes in baby-sitting for such servers. And the higher connection cost for their Williamstown office is offset by their rent on a sprawling former factory floor: $2.50 a square foot. Per year.
Bought by Lycos last year for $58 million, Tripod is not hampered by connection costs and has been increasing its staff from 40 last year to 80 now, to perhaps 150 by the end of the fiscal year, said Bo Peabody, 27, Tripod's president.
Still, said Kara Berklich, 26, Tripod's director for communications, it is cheering on the push for better connections because one of its goals is to help bring jobs to the region.
Matthew C. Harris, a classmate of Mr. Peabody and Ms. Berklich at Williams and a venture capitalist who seeks to lure more information-age companies to the region, said the price of Internet connection was not a deal breaker when he tried to bring companies here, but it was a liability.
"The problem is for marketing, that it labels us a backwater," said Mr. Harris, managing director of The Berkshires Capital Investors in Williamstown.
It is a disadvantage, Mr. Harris said, of about the same magnitude as high property or electricity costs. He said he tried to counter it by saying, "You're going to pay more than in Boston, but your rent will be 10 percent what it would be there, and your salaries 20 percent lower because cost of living is lower."
The problem looks more serious in neighboring North Adams at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. Known hereabouts as "MASS MoCA," the institution will offer performing arts as well as exhibitions, and aims to be a "creative campus" with an emphasis on the intersection of art and technology.
The museum already offers a technology center that allows people to use computers and take courses on them free; it also plans to rent offices in its 700,000-square-foot abandoned mill complex to technology-related companies.
It plans to offer prospective tenants as "smart" a building as possible, with video teleconferencing and more. But to do that now would cost an estimated $35,000 a month, more than twice what it would cost in Boston, said Brett McDowell, the museum's information and media technology director. "If Berkshire Connect succeeds in building its own line, the cost would be the same as Boston or New York."
For now, when a company reaches the point that it needs a T-1 line here, Mr. McDowell said, its manager often ends up protesting: "You're telling me that just to access the Internet at the rates I need is five times more expensive than my rent?" That, Mr. McDowell said, "is when the six-man new media company moves to Boston."
One MASS MoCA tenant, Kleiser-Walczak Construction, a film special-effects and animation company, pays about $7,000 a month to keep in touch with its other offices in New York and Hollywood, said its president, Jeff Kleiser.
"To be here, we have to pay the price," Mr. Kleiser said. Still, he added, the price brings admission to a "once-in-a-lifetime experience:" watching the museum and economic changes help North Adams metamorphose "from a post-industrial wasteland to a new high-tech-connected art community."

HEADLINE: THE NEW EUROPE: United and Divided;
Shiny, Properous 'Euroland' Has Some Cracks in Facade

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: AACHEN, Germany

 BODY:
Europe has two faces, light and dark, and they are evident on Germany's western and eastern borders as the continent crowns four decades of integration with the adoption of a single currency, the euro.
Here in Aachen, which lay in ruins in 1945, borders have ceased to exist. It has become usual for people who work in this western German city to live in Belgium and play a weekly tennis match in the Netherlands. The sweet whiff of prosperity seeps from Italian shoe stores, Spanish tapas bars, French croissanteries and English pottery shops that line the pedestrian shopping areas on all sides of the borders. 
 "This used to be a border city, but no longer," said Hans Poth, a spokesman for the Aachen town council who lives in Belgium. "And once we have the euro, the last barriers will disappear."
But a few hundred miles to the east, in Gorlitz, crumbling facades testify to decades of Communist rule. The town is split into two halves, as it has been since 1945 when eastern districts fell into Poland as European borders were rearranged after World War II. A single bridge, clogged by long lines of traffic, links the German and Polish parts.
While Aachen's melting borders symbolize the growing unity of Western Europe, Gorlitz underlines the continuing division of the continent.
Rolf Karbaum, mayor of the German part of Gorlitz, gazed out over a disjointed vista of baroque homes built centuries ago by German burghers and apartment blocks left by Polish Communists. "Now we want to be one city again," he said. "But for that, we need Poland in the European Union and the euro as our currency on both sides of the river."
Aided by the United States, postwar Europe has risen from the ruins of 1945 and overcome seemingly perennial rivalries through a bold vision of union that has brought prosperity and peace to regions plagued for centuries by instability and bloodshed. The euro, a single currency for 290 million people that may in time challenge the dollar, symbolizes a colossal achievement.
Yet it falls short of the original vision of a federal Europe with a single currency at its heart. Through its 20-year gestation, the euro appears to have shifted from a political ideal to a more prosaic economic tool.
Europe, for the foreseeable future, seems set to remain a hybrid beast, using English as its lingua franca, running its monetary policy through a federal institution -- the European Central Bank in Frankfurt -- while control of most other instruments of government, including budgets, remains at the national level.
Whether such an arrangement -- a new experiment in historical terms -- is workable remains unclear. Projected slower European growth in 1999, dragged down by slumps in Asia and Latin America, will place added strain on the euro's inception.
Beyond the economics loom larger questions. With the Cold War's glue now gone, will the trans-Atlantic bond that buttressed European growth remain firm as "Euroland" takes form?
The 11 nations joining the euro have abandoned an important part of their sovereignty to the European Central Bank. That probably will dispose them toward finding multilateral solutions to world problems, while a wholly sovereign America may choose -- as recently in Iraq -- to take a unilateral view of its interests.
And does Europe still have the vitality and drive to overcome the many remaining divisions between its capitalist and former Communist halves, to fulfill Mr. Karbaum's wish of making his wounded Gorlitz whole again?
Voicing a sentiment common in France, which acutely feels an end-of-millennium intellectual malaise, Arnaud Jacomet, a French defense official, considers Europe "a tired continent, in late middle age, looking only for a comfortable retirement, with the United States as its eternal protector." In this vision, Europe may be content to rest on its laurels, leaving the formerly Communist, still impoverished states in its east on the outside looking in.
The 11 nations that have adopted the new currency carry formidable economic heft. They represent about 18 percent of the world's total output and account for about 20 percent of its exports. After the United States, Europe will be the world's second-largest trading area with a single currency.
The euro, if it is successful, will provide enhanced European capital markets, easier comparison of prices, improved competitiveness, convenience and the kind of stability that resisted any European contagion from Asian or South American crises in 1998.
Already, the tough fiscal and other criteria set for qualification for the euro have drawn countries like Spain, Italy and Portugal toward a low-inflation prosperity they have never previously known. The euro, and the 15-nation European Union in general, have amounted to a beneficent magnet.
Some day, many economists believe, the euro may even rival the dollar as a reserve currency, obliging the United States to abandon a central assumption: that its deficits will always be financed because the world wants dollars.
Norway, for example, is certain to take payment for oil exported to its European neighbors in euros rather than dollars, because it imports principally from European countries. Eastern European exporters may do the same.
"Taking a three-year view, the euro will present a serious challenge to the dollar," said David Hale, chief economist for the Chicago-based Zurich Group. "America may have to rethink its view of itself."
But challenging America in the ether of world financial markets is far from creating the unified political entity imagined by the founding fathers of European Union and very far from any European emancipation from American military tutelage.
 
The Dream
From War's Ashes, A Single Future
For generations, ever since Churchill spoke in 1946 of uniting Europe in "the sharing of its common inheritance" and Jean Monnet of France laid the first foundation stones of integration, many Europeans have dreamed of unity. Yet just as the euro is being introduced, the idea of Europe may have lost its galvanizing appeal.
A difficult decade in Europe has taken a heavy toll on the European ideal. Slow growth and high unemployment -- more than 10 percent in Germany, more than 11 percent in France -- have been widely equated with the budgetary rigors imposed as preparation for the new currency. In many places, Brussels has become a dirty word.
Although East Europeans still talk constantly of "joining Europe," seeing in this mantra the age-old vision that European unity could banish the continent's demons and bring peace, "Europe" has little or no resonance for the millions of young West Europeans touched by unemployment. No new, forward-looking message has been found to take its place.
Indeed the very words "idea" and "Europe" seem strangely paired because intellectual vitality appears to have migrated elsewhere, and with it the forces now changing the world.
Yves Thibault de Silguy is the European Union's top monetary official and an ardent promoter of the euro. For this energetic Frenchman, a Paris-to-Potsdam, Berlin-to-Barcelona currency may eventually make the nations that have opted to join "Euroland" more stable and robust.
But European patriotism -- hearts thumping, even stirring, before Europe's blue-and-gold flag? Forget it. A quick expansion eastward to embrace formerly communist Mitteleuropa? Not likely.
"We can never be an American melting pot, even with a single currency," Mr. de Silguy said. "People here are firmly attached to national ideas. They like to live in a big, open European market, but within their own language and culture. As for expansion eastward, we need to wait. You have to be a realist."
Such realism, however, is new at European headquarters. A few years ago, the dismissal of a United States of Europe -- especially by a Frenchman -- would have been viewed as Thatcherite Europhobia. For decades, the 15-nation European Union progressed precisely by being unrealistic. It embraced far-fetched dreams, like a single currency, and somehow staggered toward them.
But now, the boldness of a postwar European generation driven by the desire to banish bloodshed from the continent has given way to the pragmatism of a more pampered generation for whom America is at least as resonant as Europe.
This shift of ambition suggests that Europe will long remain what Norbert Walter, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank, calls "an economic giant and a political dwarf." While challenging American supremacy on the currency markets, the dwarf will still desire -- even require -- American military protection and, in times of crisis such as recent Balkan conflicts, strategic leadership.
"Nobody buys the federalist model in Brussels any more," said Andrew Moravcsik of Harvard's Center for European Studies. "As governments have started looking beyond the euro, at harmonizing foreign and defense policy, even at a common tax policy, they have seen that public opinion is just not with them."
In this climate, Mr. de Silguy and other officials said, the euro will not propel Europe toward political unity -- a common foreign and defense policy, a European army, the federal European government long seen by France as the best escape from American domination of Europe and by Germany as a refuge from a troublesome national identity.
"Right now, a shared defense, security and foreign policy looks unrealistic to me," Mr. de Silguy said.
In its absence, America, through NATO, will continue to bear the chief burden of Europe's defense. But already, debates on the future of the Alliance have been marked by differences over how "global" NATO should become and whether, as Europeans now argue, the organization should be bound in its missions by the United Nations Security Council.
Still, for now the alliance of interests binding Europe and the United States since the end of World War II has held. The success of this joint undertaking -- European integration under the umbrella of American security guarantees -- is evident in Aachen.
 
The Reality
A Hybrid Approach To Hard Problems
Once home to Charlemagne, who governed much of Western Europe from here in the 9th century, including modern France and Germany, Aachen was long disadvantaged by the proximity of the Belgian and Dutch borders -- barriers to trade and economic development that were as cumbersome as today's German-Polish border at Gorlitz.
But now, on the German-Dutch border, a unique project has begun. Called "Avantis," it is a 100-acre trans-border industrial zone that literally straddles the frontier. Dutch and German mail boxes, red and yellow, have already been placed side by side in an act of playful symbolism.
The project is complicated because Dutch and German taxes and regulations are different. But it is intended to feed off Aachen's renowned university of technology and engineering to create between 7,000 and 12,000 jobs in the high-tech sector. A brochure describes the project as a "European Science and Business Park" set in a "win-win situation."
That, in many ways, is a good summary of Europe today: A German-Dutch cross-border project with an English name and American jargon. Areas of prosperity in places long prone to instability abound. Alsace-Lorraine, and the French-Spanish border region between Perpignan and Barcelona are other examples.
"Peace and freedom are now taken for granted," said Jurgen Linden, the mayor of Aachen. "So we have to show our citizens that Europe has advantages by creating jobs in projects like these. With the euro, we can work on both sides of a border."
Not everyone is convinced. In the streets of Maastricht, the Dutch town where European leaders decided in 1991 to tear down trade barriers and adopt a single currency, Elisabeth Lubbers, a housewife, said the people of Europe were still different, and its nations too diverse, to accept the euro. "There will be trouble," she said, "and with Germany you never know."
That sentiment is not uncommon in Britain and has contributed to keeping the country out of the euro for now. Among the 18 million unemployed in Europe and the continent's "new poor," resentment against Europe is often virulent.
 
The Doubts
Nagging Suspicions About Path to Take
For most Europeans -- a clear majority, according to polls -- the euro is now seen as a logical extension of a successful experiment. What is not clear is whether the will exists to reach out from the relative comfort of today's western European society to take that experiment decisively further.
Some ideas do exist: the nomination of a "High Representative" to coordinate European foreign and security policy; a passage to majority voting on more European issues, seen as essential if Europe is not to become too unwieldy; a possible integration of the Western European Union, Europe's largely dormant defense arm, into the formal structures of the European Union.
But such steps -- known as "deepening" -- are controversial, because they may imply further compromises on national sovereignty.
They may also prove difficult because Germany and France, long the motors of European integration, have discovered other priorities. Germany has been absorbed with its costly unification and, of late, with an attempt to step out from the shadow of its past.
"Of course, we are all for a strengthening of Europe, but we no longer feel this is a historical obligation," said Bodo Hombach, minister of State at the Germany chancellery. "We want Europe, but not because we have to."
In practice, the new government of Social Democrats and Greens led by Gerhard Schroder has adopted almost Thatcherite tones in demanding a reduction in its huge contribution to the European budget. It has also suggested that candidates for European Union membership -- including Poland -- may have to wait a long time.
Across the Rhine, French politicians have been made acutely aware of the enduring appeal of nationalist slogans by the success of the National Front, and disgruntlement over unemployment has made any ringing appeals for united European governance tantamount to political suicide.
Until Europe works out these internal problems, it will not reach out to address the pressing needs of Gorlitz and all the once-Communist countries on its eastern flank. Already, with unemployment running at 21 percent in the area, many Germans complain about Poles coming to work illegally in Gorlitz.
"It took generations to resolve the French-German problem, and here tensions with Poland have been compounded by almost 50 years of Communism," said Mr. Karbaum, the Gorlitz mayor. "But this is an artificial border, and we have to overcome it, just as on Germany's western side."
Jreneusz Aniszkiewicz, the deputy mayor of Zgorzelec, as the Polish side of the town is known, agreed: "The economy can resolve everything today," he said.
The two men have a project: to rebuild Gorlitz's old bridge, destroyed by Allied bombing in 1945. But six years of negotiation have so far failed to resolve various difficulties and the two banks of the River Neisse -- no more than 30 yards apart -- remain unbridged in the center of town. The one existing bridge is on the outskirts.
"It is not easy," Mr. Karbaum said. "Young Germans say to me, we have no work, no hope, nothing to do, and you want to spend millions of euros on a bridge."

HEADLINE: David Duke Heads North to Raise Money for House Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., Jan. 2

 BODY:
Seeking donations from an audience sympathetic to his view that too many Federal policies favor blacks, Jews and other minorities over whites, David Duke arrived in the Washington area today to drum up support for his latest political endeavor.
Mr. Duke is the first Republican to declare his candidacy for the House seat being vacated by Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, who announced his intention to resign soon after he was selected to succeed Newt Gingrich as House Speaker. Mr. Duke brought along a stack of volumes of his new autobiography, "My Awakening," and told a crowd of about 100 here that he would become the first person in Congress "to stand up openly and proudly" to defend the rights of Christian whites. 
 "I need you to make a sacrifice economically," he said, pitching the book at $35 each, or four for $100, autographed, of course. "If we can get just one person in Congress, it will be like opening the floodgates. It could change this country overnight."
Bashing diversity as a destructive force in the country, he concluded his hourlong speech by saying, "If we lose European-Americans, we lose America."
Fears that American culture is overly influenced by blacks and other minorities through immigration policies, and that Jews have taken control of the Federal Government, have been central themes of Mr. Duke's world view for many years.
As a Ku Klux Klan leader in the 1970's, he made his points in white robes and at demonstrations. More recently, he has taken the more genteel path of business suits and electoral politics. He served one term in the Louisiana House of Representatives before losing a 1990 United States Senate race to J. Bennett Johnston. He also lost the 1991 Louisiana governor's race to Edwin W. Edwards. In 1996, he finished fourth in a field of nine in an open primary for the Senate seat now held by Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat.
After Mr. Livingston decided to resign, acknowledging several extramarital affairs, Mr. Duke, 48, jumped into the race despite immediate condemnation by more mainstream Louisiana Republicans. Referring to the possibility that Mr. Duke might succeed Mr. Livingston, Representative Jim McCrery of Shreveport told The Times-Picayune of New Orleans: "Obviously, we'd work to avoid that unpleasantry."
Despite such objections, Mr. Duke enjoys widespread popularity in many parts of Louisiana, including the district he would represent, which he claims supported him in each of his statewide campaigns. The district is directly north of New Orleans and 85 percent white. "And we weren't even concentrating there," Mr. Duke said in an interview before the speech.
He has also developed some support around the country, as evidenced today by the attentive crowd who paid $10 a person to hear Mr. Duke and another advocate of white rights, Edward R. Fields of Kennesaw, Ga., who spent most of his 30-minute speech blaming Jews and Israel for the ills of the world.
Like Mr. Duke, Mr. Fields embraced the Republican Party, asserting, "This country has been gutted by Jews who vote Democrat."
Mark Cotterill, the event organizer, said that many in the audience were members of the Council of Conservative Citizens, a right-wing organization that gained widespread attention in recent months when it was disclosed that Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Representative Bob Barr of Georgia, one of the most ardent supporters of the impeachment of President Clinton, had appeared as guest speakers at council events.
Both Mr. Lott and Mr. Barr quickly distanced themselves from the group, denouncing the racial views of many of its members.
And Mr. Cotterill, who recently resigned as chairman of the national capital region of the council, stressed that the event was not sponsored by the council. He said he stepped down, in part, because the organization regarded Mr. Duke and Mr. Fields as "too controversial."
Even so, human rights organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League contend that the council is steeped in bigotry, evolving as it did from the White Citizens Councils that once flourished in the South, promoting segregation. The human rights groups also claim that many members of the Council of Conservative Citizens have ties to the Klan, the National Association for the Advancement of White People and other white supremacist organizations.
Among the books on sale here were several published by the National Alliance, a virulent anti-Semitic and anti-black group based in West Virginia and run by William Pierce, author of "The Turner Diaries," a futuristic story of a race war in which whites rid the country of blacks. Authorities in Oklahoma said that Timothy J. McVeigh, who was convicted in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing in which 168 people died, had a copy of the book when he was arrested.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Union Salary Concession Could Change Economics

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE

 BODY:
When players and lawyers from the National Basketball Players Association sat down last week and devised their final proposal to management, they finally gave up on the notion of a luxury tax and gave in to the owners' desires for an absolute maximum salary limit.
As concessions in the league's labor dispute go, the $15 million figure was much higher than the league's offer of $12.25 million; league officials wondered whether that gap of nearly $3 million -- and several other economic differences -- could be closed by Thursday's deadline for canceling the season. 
 But there was also a feeling that dramatic changes could be ahead for the league's salary structure.
The players had previously agreed to capping the salaries of players with fewer than 10 years of experience. Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, said the two sides are less than $500,000 apart on players with fewer than six years of experience and players with seven to nine years.
"We've done something that no other major professional sports league has done," Hunter said. "We've said, in effect, 'You can only make so much for what you do in this game.' Even with some players grandfathered in under their previous deals, it's an unprecedented concession."
Russ Granik, the deputy commissioner, conceded that the maximum salary limit was probably the most important issue for the owners but said the union's proposal was not close to being a deal-maker.
"It's a nice idea, but $15 million would be consistent with the way they've done things," Granik said. "They agree to concepts that might be helpful, but then agree to numbers that aren't helpful."
The union compromise is in exchange for the owners' letting the players keep the Larry Bird exception, the clause that allows teams to compensate their own free agents above and beyond a team's salary cap. It is also a compromise that may have a wide-ranging effect on salaries the next 10 years.
Under the new deal, for example, a player like San Antonio's Tim Duncan -- perhaps the pre-eminent big man for the next 10 years -- could never approach the riches of a Kevin Garnett, whose six-year, $126 million deal with Minnesota last season -- averaging $21 million a season -- set off widespread alarms.
The most Duncan could make under the proposed plan would average out to about $11 million a year, $3 million less than what Garnett's contract called for this season. Players such as Portland's Damon Stoudamire and Philadelphia's Allen Iverson, who have a lot to do with the fan bases in their respective cities, could make no more than about $9 million in the first year of a deal.
"I think what everybody misses is that this is a seven-year deal," the agent Keith Glass said. "That means for the next seven years, this automatically stops the spiral of salaries growing at a rate that have been staggering. It eliminates a Garnett contract. This is what the owners have been worried about, controlling their own overspending."
With 12.5 percent annual raises, there would be an occasional $100 million contract. But the exorbitant deals that the owners claim have crippled their ability to make profits would be reduced significantly over the next six to seven years.
With market value having already been determined and only a set of numbers to be plugged in, there is also concern among the the players' agents. The bidding wars might be just as fierce and negotiations tense for the most prominent free agents, but general managers would no longer be frightened off by what another team could pay a player. They would already know.
"The idea of going to an agent with more clout because he can somehow help you get the best deal may not be as prevalent anymore," one league official said on condition of anonymity.
Glass said: "In terms of agents who represent high-end players, it may affect them significantly. They'll be subject to people saying, 'You don't need an agent.' But the truth is, it's never automatic. Nobody gives you $8 million or $10 million. Who's going to get it pushed up to $9.6 million? So to say this takes those agents out of the equation is a little bit of a reach."
The maximum salary proposal still needs tinkering, along with several other economic issues.
Last week's standoff between lawyers on each side over how the union's proposal would be delivered to the owners -- the union requested a meeting, the league officials said they would not guarantee one until they had seen the proposal -- characterized the stare-down state of negotiations entering the last round.
Hunter is expected to have the proposal delivered to the league's office early this week, a person familiar with the negotiations said yesterday. But that might not stop the last-minute campaigning by each side and might not immediately get the two sides closer to salvaging perhaps a 45-game season that would begin the last week of January at the earliest.
Granik still refused to blink yesterday, saying, "I don't see any reason to expect further negotiations at this point."

HEADLINE: Oregon Falters On a New Path To Health Care

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore.

 BODY:
Nearly five years ago, Oregon began putting an idea to work that seemed both harsh and humane: In return for health insurance paid by the government, the poor would be required to join health maintenance organizations and have their care rationed.
Most tonsillectomies, infertility treatment, hernia surgery and removal of bunions would be denied. The program would support preventive and hospice care and, starting this month, doctor-assisted suicide, but rule out heroic intervention to stretch a life for a week or two. 
 With that, the state calculated, it could afford to provide basic care for all the poor -- the goal of universal coverage that eluded President Clinton four years ago. With rationing, Oregon became the sole American outpost of an approach to care that is routine in most developed countries.
But the Oregon Health Plan is hitting roadblocks. The state has abandoned its promise of universal care. Doctors routinely find ways to get around the rationing. And conflicts with Federal Medicaid regulators have impeded efforts to deny more treatments.
A requirement that employers insure all their workers or contribute to a fund to cover them died early on. Spending for the plan climbed to $2.1 billion in the 1997-to-1999 state budget period from $1.7 billion in the 1995-to-1997 period. Higher cigarette taxes have not offset the increase, requiring more money from the state's general fund, and additional economic pressures await this year.
The plan offers all necessary care for people based solely upon their income, and not, as in the basic Medicaid system, according to their age or infirmities, as well as income.
The concept of "rationing care, not people," in the sloganeering leading up to the plan's start in 1994, has been ignored by physicians. "The idea of this being a rationing system is really bunk," said Jim Kronenberg, associate executive director of the Oregon Medical Association.
Enrolling participants in H.M.O.'s has failed to deliver expected savings. Moreover, the practice of managed care, with doctors, clinics and hospitals working together with H.M.O.'s to control patient care, is breaking down in the rural areas.
For many of the poor, access to care has become more difficult. For many others, eligibility has become harder to establish and to hold. A program that was once free now charges premiums of $7.50 to $28 a month for a family of four, and purges from its rolls those who do not pay. There are 340,000 Oregonians covered by the plan, and 350,000 still uninsured.
In his next budget, Gov. John Kitzhaber is proposing tougher screening of applicants and stretching the time it takes to approve applications from a day to at least a month. Members of the Legislature, controlled by Republicans, are considering lowering the income levels for eligibility.
"We have to go back and revisit entry-level policy decisions," said Mr. Kitzhaber.
A former emergency room physician, he conceived the program as president of the State Senate and rode it to election as Governor in 1994 after it took effect. He was easily re-elected in November. The program is overseen by the Office of Oregon Health Plan Policy.
"We're taking a pause to say: 'Are the structures right? Are our incentives right? Is it working?" said Barney Speight, the administrator of that office.
But one thing is already clear: health care for all cannot be attained. "Our goal is to have zero people in Oregon who are uninsured," said Hersh Crawford, the state's director of medical assistance programs. "I don't think we're going to make that."
Mr. Kitzhaber said that "if you could get to 5 or 6 percent" of the population, "you could declare victory."But that goal, too, looks remote. "Structurally, the plan is the right approach," said Donald Sacco, chief executive of Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield, the state's biggest health insurer and H.M.O. company.
"But it has never provided what's needed to take adequate care of the population," Mr. Sacco said. "To get to the next increment, we're going to have to spend more money, and to do that is a question mark."
In the context of the nation's health care, policy analysts still call Oregon's program innovative and promising. The state says the uninsured population has dropped in five years to 11 percent from 15 percent. The national average has remained about 16 percent. Other states have looked at the program with interest, but want to see more results before experimenting so radically.
In spite of the difficulties, groups with special interests in care support the ideas behind the plan and in most respects the way it works. Physicians, while irked about pressures on their incomes, see no turning back.
"It's certainly better than where we came from," said Dr. Michael F. Bonazzola, chief medical officer of Physician Partners, a management company owned by physicians.
The Clinton Administration set the stage for the program five years ago in waiving regulations restricting Medicaid coverage to specific groups, primarily women and children on welfare.
With Oregon's assurance that it could cover more people without asking the Federal Government to increase its 60 percent subsidy of Medicaid coverage, the Health Care Financing Administration permitted coverage of everyone with income below the Federal poverty line, currently about $16,400 for a family of four and $8,000 for a single adult.
Oregon's rationing begins with a "prioritized list," developed over years of deliberations, of 745 pairs of conditions and treatments. Those that save and prolong healthy lives and prevent disease are at the top, and cosmetic surgery, weight-loss programs, most infertility treatment and conditions that cure themselves, like colds, are at the bottom.
The Legislature then drew a line across the list, with free care allowed for conditions above the line and denied for those below. It drew the line low, at No. 606 but has since raised it to No. 574, still low enough to have stirred few complaints. But the line becomes fuzzy in the physician's office. The plan requires that family doctors admit all patients for diagnoses, and doctors say they do what they feel they must to treat a patient during the visit. And when a patient is referred to a specialist, doctors can skirt the rules by changing a diagnosis and moving a patient's condition from below the line to above it. Carole Romm, health services director for Care-Oregon, a nonprofit H.M.O. specializing in Medicaid patients, takes the example of fibromyalgia, a chronic condition with bodily aches and pains. The cause is unknown, there is no cure and it is below the rationing line.
In addition to recommending exercise, which can help, doctors find ways to prescribe physical therapy, which can also help.
Mr. Sacco of Regence said, "If someone comes into the office with a below-the-line issue, it's going to get treated."
Much of the unauthorized care, however comforting, is ineffective or marginal and contributes to the rising costs, Mr. Kitzhaber said.
The Governor also wants to raise the rationing line 10 more notches, to No. 564. Among services he would deny are some repairs of ligament damage to knees, treatment for contact dermatitis -- rashes from poison ivy or spills of household chemicals -- that cures itself, and treatment for genital warts.
But in raising the line, Mr. Kitzhaber faces intense Federal scrutiny because some procedures typically paid for by Medicaid would not be covered. The Health Care Financing Administration, he complains, "would rather have us keep the line and serve fewer people" and in that way preserve the practice of rationing people, not care.
Mr. Crawford, the medical assistance director, said negotiations over changing an item go on for months. "There's a lot of suspicion of states like Oregon that want to deviate from traditional Medicaid," he said, adding that "we spent hours arguing with H.C.F.A about diaper rash" before its coverage was excluded.
Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, called the plan "a very interesting experiment."
Ms. DeParle said there was no policy favoring conventional Medicaid coverage over Oregon's approach. "I think what the state would like to do is to make these decisions and do it unilaterally," she said.
But the agency is bound by Congress to provide a defined set of benefits to people who receive Medicaid. "We have to make sure that the procedures that are being covered are appropriate and that they are not leaving out things that should be covered," Ms. DeParle said.
The agency also has a responsibility for public health, so discussions over genital warts, a sexually transmitted virus that can be treated but not cured, will not be easy.
Such disputes aside, said W. David Helms, president of the Alpha Center, a health care research organization in Washington, Oregon has done something unique in tackling the taboo against rationing.
"As a society, we still face that issue, and we've ignored it," Mr. Helms said. The Oregon program, he said, "is how government at its best ought to work."

HEADLINE: INDUSTRIES PRESS PLAN FOR CREDITS IN EMISSIONS PACT

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2

 BODY:
Even as a proposed treaty on global warming faces an uncertain future in the Senate, big companies are maneuvering to push through legislation giving them valuable credits for early actions to control the waste gases that the binding treaty would strictly limit.
The proposed treaty, negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, and signed by the Clinton Administration last year, requires steep reductions in the industrial nations' emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. If the Senate eventually approves it despite widespread opposition from major industries, companies want to be sure they get credit for any reductions they achieve before the treaty takes force in 2008. 
 The legislation would mark a significant shift in the debate in the Senate over climate change, potentially moderating the opposition to the treaty among big industry groups and linking their financial interests to the goals of treaty supporters. And if it succeeded, it could revive the longstanding efforts of the Administration to persuade industries to cut their emissions voluntarily, which have met with mixed success.
"This is a potential winner," said Eileen Claussen, executive director of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change and a former treaty negotiator for the Administration. "It helps get the United States moving. It is voluntary. It is supported by industry. It seems to me there should be a way to get legislation like that through Congress."
For some companies, credits earned now could be applied against strict limits they would face later. Companies able to make even deeper cuts in emissions now could sell their surplus credits for billions of dollars under an emissions trading system that the Administration wants to set up.
With so much at stake, big companies, joined by influential environmental groups and policy analysts, are already lobbying hard for Congress to guarantee credits for early action.
Three Senators, led by John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, the leading Republican environmentalist in the Senate, introduced legislation late in the last session that would assure the companies that their early reductions would earn credit under any mechanism the Government eventually establishes to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. The bill is also supported by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat, and by Senator Connie Mack of Florida, a Republican.
In a speech last month to the National Association of Manufacturers, Senator Chafee, who is chairman of the Senate Environment Committee, said he will make the bill a priority as soon as Congress reconvenes next week.
"While the climate debate will indeed continue over the next few years, we strongly believe that there is a voluntary, incentive-based approach which can be implemented now," he told the group, which has opposed the Kyoto treaty.
"The good guys who take action now will be rewarded by having these actions count," Mr. Chafee said. "This credit program may also make early greenhouse gas reductions financially valuable to the companies who make them."
That could mean a windfall for companies that have recorded reductions in greenhouse gas emissions since 1991, a period when the nation's overall annual emissions ballooned by more than 10 percent despite the Administration's voluntary plan to curtail them.
As drafted, the bill gives ton-for-ton credits to any of the more than 150 companies that can document reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions under various voluntary Federal programs.
The DuPont company is one example. The biggest chemical producer in the United States, DuPont has taken steps that will cut its own emissions of greenhouse gases far more and much faster than the treaty would require.
Company officials said that DuPont will cut its annual greenhouse gas emissions to much less than half of 1991's levels by the year 2000. Under the treaty, the United States as a whole would have to cut emissions 7 percent below 1990's level between 2008 and 2012.
"If you did not recognize our voluntary work, you would punish us for stepping out in front," said Darwin G. Wika, director of safety, health and the environment for DuPont. "And the laggards who did not step up to the plate would be rewarded."
By DuPont's calculations, by the end of this year it will have reduced its annual emissions by the equivalent of 90 million tons of carbon dioxide. Economists' estimates of the value of carbon credits in an emissions trading scheme vary widely, but depending on the crediting rules, DuPont's savings alone could someday be worth billions of dollars.
Some big environmental groups, like the Environmental Defense Fund, which favors emissions trading and other market-based pollution controls, have published detailed proposals for granting credits to companies that move early, and have advised lawmakers on drafting legislation. There are at least five such proposals spelled out by various advocates, including one by Niagara Mohawk, the New York utility company.
But some environmentalists have criticized the bill offered by the three Senators.
John Stanton, legislative director for the National Environmental Trust, a pro-treaty advocacy group, said the bill "does not provide sufficient guarantees that emission reductions credited under it will actually result from reduced emissions, as opposed to phantom paper reductions."
With Senator Chafee planning hearings soon, the lobbying is sure to intensify.
"You are creating a new currency called carbon-dioxide tons," said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists, another treaty advocacy group. "There is a lot of money involved, and there is going to be a lot of ferocious jockeying to control who gets the money. It is going to be pretty intense."
For now, the most active proponents of credit for early action are a closely knit coterie of former Government officials, policy analysts, environmental advocates, lobbyists, lawyers and corporate officials who have been working for months to build support for the credit idea.
Along with the Environmental Defense Fund and the Pew Center for Global Climate Change, they include law firms and lobbyists like Van Ness Feldman and Alcalde & Fay, both of which represent several electric utilities, and a number of individual companies, several of them aligned with the Pew Center.
Hundreds of companies, big and small, could benefit from the proposal.
In 1997, the latest year for which data is available, companies participating in voluntary reductions of greenhouse gases reported to the Energy Department that they had reduced greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of 137 million tons of carbon dioxide. Under the bill, all of them would qualify for credits.
The companies, which filed detailed reports about more than 1,200 emission control projects, included 156 participants in more than a dozen different industries. Most of them are electric utilities, but other types of companies are increasingly participating.
Even one individual filed a report in 1995. Carter H. Lewis 3d, who at the time was a consultant for the Energy Department, claimed to have cut his personal emissions of carbon dioxide by between three and four tons by never having more than one light at a time turned on in his house, and by commuting to work outside of rush hours to save gasoline.
"I just wanted to demonstrate what the ordinary citizen could do," he said. "You don't have to be a gigantic power plant to reduce carbon dioxide emissions." (The reductions he claimed, however, would have only a trivial market value.)
Although the number of participants has increased steadily, for the past few years the amount of reductions in emissions that they claimed has been falling. In 1996 it was the equivalent of 154 million tons of carbon dioxide, and in 1995 it was 183 million tons.
There is considerable debate whether actions taken years ago should be granted credits.
"To the extent the credit is regarded as an incentive to spur industry to make greenhouse gas reductions that would not otherwise occur, there is little basis for rewarding reductions already achieved," said the report, written for the Pew Center by Robert Nordhaus and Stephen Fotis of Van Ness Feldman.
On the other hand, they noted, companies that signed onto the Administration's voluntary programs may have relied on the Government's representations that they would be granted appropriate credits.
The General Accounting Office, which investigated the Energy Department's reporting system, found some flaws that suggest that the claims may be exaggerated.
The agency noted that the Energy Department does not verify that claimed reductions are actually achieved.
Companies have used many different strategies for reducing their emissions.
DuPont, officials said, not only has cut its energy consumption, but invested millions of dollars changing its processes for making adipic acid powder, a chemical feedstock. The new approach eliminates most emissions of nitrous oxides, like carbon dioxide a potent greenhouse gas that would be controlled by the treaty.
American Forests, a conservation group, has filed annual reports with the Energy Department describing hundreds of tree-planting projects that could offset carbon dioxide emissions because growing trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store the carbon as wood.
So far, the organization has planted more than 8 million trees, which it calculates will offset 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide or lock up 634,000 tons of carbon. Credits for those tons could easily become worth millions of dollars to the organization in the future.
Many electric utilities have argued that they have achieved reductions in carbon dioxide emissions by operating their nuclear power plants more efficiently, reducing the need to burn coal in other power plants. Some utilities have filed reports with the Energy Department claiming millions of tons of reductions of this kind, even as their total emissions of carbon dioxide have continued to increase.
Duke Power Company, for example, reported that its total annual emissions of carbon dioxide increased from about 24 million tons in 1990 to about 36 million tons in 1996, an increase of 50 percent.
It said, however, that its more efficient use of nuclear power between 1993 and 1996 prevented an additional 35 million tons of carbon dioxide from being added to the atmosphere. Credit for those tons could be very important to Duke if it is told to sharply limit its emissions between 2008 and 2012 to help comply with the global warming treaty.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Guide to Bonds: Risky, Arcane, But Essential

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
JAY GATSBY was a bond guy in F. Scott Fitzgerald's yarn of the Roaring Twenties. The bond market was also the playground for John Meriwether's 1990's band of Nobel laureate-speculators who made eight-figure fortunes for Long-Term Capital Management before its recent meteoric fall.
Traditionally, though, bonds have been seen as boring, arcane investments suitable only for the aged, the already rich, the unimaginative and the hopelessly conservative. Not all that long ago, bond yields were lower than those on stocks on the grounds that it was stocks -- can you believe it? -- that people thought might carry some risk. 
 The truth about bonds is that they can be arcane, and they can be risky -- but that they have a place in almost every portfolio. And that is the case despite four consecutive years of supercharged gains in stocks, and despite the fact that the interest being paid on quality bonds, once collar-sized and then hat-sized, is as slender these days as a woman's ring size.
A generation has grown up believing that there is no growth in just lending money to a company or government. No, the smart thing is to become an owner, to get a piece of the action -- in other words, to be in stocks.
But life is more complex than that. Markets change -- consider the gyrations of the last year alone. People budget for college, face job losses, approach retirement or just plain get nervous when some stocks sell at multiples of revenue that at one time would have been thought ridiculous multiples of profit.
Investors may know that through history, stocks have outperformed bonds by handsome margins -- but they worry nonetheless that form won't hold indefinitely. In fact, not only did bonds beat stocks during the first nine months of last year -- long-term Treasuries returned 20 percent, three times as much as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- there have been periods as long as two decades when bonds were the better investment.
So investment astuteness is not properly gauged by how thoroughly one shuns the bond market.
"Relatively few people should be 100 percent in stocks," said Scott Lummer, chief investment officer at 401(k) Forum, an advisory firm in San Francisco. "Savviness does not mean, 'I take all the risks I want.' "
Perhaps the best way for most people to think about bonds is as ballast for their portfolios. Higher-quality bonds can usually be counted on to do well when the economy stumbles; their promised flow of interest payments gets even more attractive as interest rates decline, pushing the price of existing bonds higher. That stability also gives investors psychological "staying power" when confronted with the inevitable swoons in the stock market.
Held for the long haul, bonds are also good for anticipating large specific expenses, such as college. With good fortune, some can even use bonds to make capital gains.
Investors are often advised to shift into bonds as they age, the very rough rule of thumb being one percentage point of a portfolio for each birthday. (The rule is usually expressed in terms of stocks -- subtract your age from 100 to figure the equity portion of your portfolio, assigning the rest mostly to bonds.)
Tolerance for risk is another crucial factor, though investors don't really know in the abstract how much they can stand. Here, the rule in tough markets is to sell until you can sleep again.
Still, the bond market is a huge place, forbidding to most amateurs and sometimes impenetrable even to professionals. There are many traps for the unwary -- even in bond mutual funds, by far the most popular vehicle for individuals.
In fact, belying their staid reputation, bonds are far from the haven many assume them to be, as anybody with a stake in Far East debt learned last year. Financial planners report a dismaying number of clients who assume that nothing can go wrong with a bond purchase -- especially if the bond receives a coveted triple-A rating.
But interest rates can rise, depressing the value of all previously issued bonds. Or the issuer's fortunes could reverse, jeopardizing its ability to pay you back. Prices for bonds are often hard to obtain, and you may not find much of a market if you decide to sell before a bond comes due. You can wind up owing taxes on interest you have not yet collected. And if your bond is paid off early, your choices for reinvesting the money may be unappealing.
And those are just the dangers of individual bonds. As for bond funds, their names are sometimes misleading, fees are often high and investors are at the mercy of a manager who may have little concern about the tax implications, for the fund's holders, of all his trading.
Following are some of the considerations that can help bond investors size up these markets, instead of just assuming that one bond is pretty much like another.
 
Bonds, or Bond Funds?
The typical do-it-yourself bond buyer -- someone with, say, less than $100,000 to invest -- is decidedly handicapped in two respects.
One hurdle is getting enough diversification in a bond portfolio, given that the smallest municipal bond you can buy generally costs $5,000, and corporate and Treasury bonds are rarely bought in smaller units.
The other hurdle is the transactions themselves. It is a challenge to get timely quotations on bond prices. In the municipal market alone, there are 1.4 million issues outstanding, counting each annual maturity separately. And while there are more corporate bonds than stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, virtually all the trading takes place off the exchange, in the over-the-counter market.
So your broker must either shop for you or deal with you from his own firm's inventory, leaving investors somewhat in the dark about prices, markups and commissions. And if you need to sell before a bond comes due, most issues are so thinly traded that you may take a beating.
All this explains why individual investors increasingly are buying bonds through mutual funds or brokerage firms' investment trusts. Besides the benefits of diversification and professional management -- arguably even more important for bonds than for stocks -- bond funds are inexpensive to get into and make it easy to reinvest interest payments, reducing the chance that an investor will fritter away that income.
Yet bond funds can also be hazardous to your financial health. Portfolios can harbor bonds that investors would never expect -- and sometimes even contain stocks.
"I would not make any assumption that the name tells you anything," advised Jack D. Burks, a bond specialist at Offitbank, a money management firm in New York.
And because annual fees take a greater proportion of the return than for many stock funds, it is especially important to shop around. For example, the Scudder Income fund has an expense ratio of 1.18 percent, while fees for the Dodge & Cox Income fund, similar in size but with a better five-year record, run less than half as much -- 0.49 percent.
Moreover, bond fund managers labor under the assumption that investors want them to husband principal above all. If portfolio managers then find themselves underperforming peers, they may be tempted to take more risk than is prudent -- perhaps by buying bonds with more distant maturities -- to try to catch up.
Such sensitivity is aggravated by the daily publication of bond funds' net asset value, which exposes the bond-market volatility that is so well cloaked for individual bonds.
Investors in bond funds also need to bury the widespread assumption that a high return makes a fund a good buy. They need to be especially wary of a common bond-fund gambit of inflating current yield -- at the expense of total return -- by paying premium prices for high-coupon bonds that are likely to be paid off early or will certainly depreciate back to face value as they approach maturity.
"You can't look at top performance and assume it's going to continue," cautioned David F. Hill, president of Safeco Mutual Funds. "Timing the bond market can be at least as hard as timing the stock market" -- which to most professionals means impossible.
 
Measuring Risk
One hazard for bond investors is a general rise in interest rates, which raises market yields on new bonds while depressing the value of existing, lower-yielding ones. This market risk does not matter if you hold until maturity. But if you need to sell before then, you face a hefty loss of capital.
Credit risk, sometimes called event risk, is more specific: Will the issuer be solvent when the time comes to pay back your principal? If this begins to look doubtful -- a development that probably would be reflected in a downgrading by rating agencies -- the price of the bonds will sink, independent of the general trend in interest rates.
There can always be surprises, but the rating agencies are quite good at categorizing bonds. Default rates run highest on the worst-rated bonds, lowest on the best-rated. Moody's Investors Service, one of the prominent rating services, ranks bonds from Aaa (prime) down to C (for those in default). Standard & Poor's and Fitch IBCA have similar systems, ranging from AAA to D.
In the last few months, as corporate mergers boomed again, specialists pointed to the danger that the company whose bonds you bought may combine with a weaker company, jeopardizing its ability to service their joint debt.
"There are some potholes out there" for bond buyers in such situations, said Gregory W. Lobo, senior fixed-income portfolio manager at HGK Asset Management in Jersey City.
 
Gauging Price Volatility
In general, the longer until a bond comes due, the more it will fluctuate in value -- and thus the greater the risk of it being significantly depressed when you need to sell. The unwary, however, will typically fail to take account of a crucial distinction between a bond's maturity date and what is known as its duration, which is a far better gauge of price volatility.
A bond's duration reflects the weighted stream of payments, usually semiannual, through the life of the bond, while maturity merely considers when the principal is to be repaid. So bonds with the same maturity can have different durations -- and thus different levels of exposure to market risk.
Consider the differences between two 30-year bonds. The Treasury's 5 1/4 percent bond due in November 2028 has a duration of about 15 years, meaning that its price will move up or down about 15 percent for each percentage-point move in interest rates. But a Treasury zero-coupon strip maturing at the same time -- a bond that pays no interest over its life but is bought at a steep discount to its face value -- has a duration of 29 years, which means that a percentage-point change in rates will move its price by 25 percent.
 
Factoring in Prepayment
A persistent worry with bonds, including even some of the Treasury's, is that the issuers can pay them off ahead of schedule if rates fall. In other words, they can refinance, as homeowners do with their mortgages, and borrow anew from somebody else at a lower rate.
Indeed, bonds backed by mortgages are particularly susceptible to early redemption. So their yields, which tend to be seductively higher than on other debt, may prove fleeting.
"Mortgages I've always viewed as toxic waste," said Lincoln F. Anderson, a bond strategist in Boston who formerly was chief economist at Fidelity Investments.
While there is often the solace of getting somewhat more than face value when a bond is called -- typically an extra year's worth of interest -- this premium may well be already reflected in the price of the bond. That means investors must know the yield to call date of a bond, as well as the yield to maturity.
Some bonds have sinking-fund provisions, under which the borrower intends to redeem a specified part of an issue each year. The bondholders to be affected are chosen by lottery.
However it happens, early repayment almost by definition means an investor will find it hard to buy another bond promptly on equally favorable terms -- a situation called reinvestment risk. Where, for example, will holders of Amoco bonds due in 2016, which the company recently called at face value, match their 8 5/8 percent yield without accepting a lower-quality issue?
 
Making Room for Junk
Infamous for their aggressive use in corporate takeovers during the 1980's, junk bonds can be respectably employed, even in conservative portfolios.
Only the hardiest small investor will buy individual junk, or high-yield bonds, since by definition they are less than investment grade.
For wealthier investors, however, some strategists contend that a combination of essentially risk-free Treasuries and carefully selected junk will often produce superior risk-adjusted returns than a portfolio of average-quality bonds. That is particularly true in good economic times like these, when default rates on junk bonds stand far below their peaks.
For most investors, junk-bond funds are an appealing choice; even the most venturesome is less risky than the most conservative stock fund. In one sense, the typical high-yield bond fund actually poses less risk than funds composed of high-grade corporate bonds -- or Treasuries themselves -- because it is less vulnerable to a rise in interest rates.
Watch out, however, for closed-end bond funds whose quoted yields may be exaggerated because -- unlike the more common open-end funds -- they are not required to use a Government-approved calculation method.
 
Coming Up With Zeros
"Zeros," issued by the Treasury, by corporations and by municipalities, are ideal for many small investors. They let the purchaser determine exactly how much a modest amount of money invested today will grow to by a specified date -- perhaps the month that Junior is due to start college.
The entire return is paid at maturity; the zero represents the amount of interest paid over the life of the bond. Investors lock in a rate at the outset and avoid the risk of having to reinvest periodic interest payments at lower rates.
But with the payout coming at maturity, appraising the risk of default is crucial. And with the long durations of zeros, the price fluctuations can be up to three times as great as on an interest-paying bond.
There is a further caveat: Except with tax-exempt municipal zeros, income tax is due each year on the accrued interest, even though the interest is not actually paid until the bond comes due.
A cousin of the zero is a bond indexed to inflation, like those now issued from time to time by the Treasury. These provide guaranteed purchasing power at maturity, rather than a guaranteed sum, by adjusting the principal in line with the inflation rate.
 
A Place for Hybrids
Convertibles -- corporate securities that can be exchanged, under specified conditions, for stock -- are in theory a way to combine bond-like income with stock-like growth. The interest income, now averaging about 5 1/2 percent, cushions the impact if the company fails to thrive and the stock declines.
As recently as a decade ago, most convertibles were issued for 15 or 20 years. Now they are more investor-friendly, with five-year maturities, according to John P. Calamos, president of Calamos Asset Management in Chicago.
But they are still tricky to analyze, involving both bond-market math and the ability to pick stocks. Although blue-chip companies like I.B.M. and, more recently, Monsanto, have sold these hybrids, many issuers are fledgling companies whose survival is uncertain.
"It's a complex security," said Mr. Calamos, who specializes in convertibles, noting that institutions remain the chief buyers. "The ordinary investor needs to be careful."
 
Now, the Hard Part
If you conclude that it is time to add bonds to your portfolio, remember that bonds can be as different as chalk and cheese and that disinterested professional advice is hard to find. Most brokers tend to shun bonds, both because commissions are relatively low and because the investment is usually locked up for years.
"That's not were the money is," said Richard Ganz, president of Fixed Income Management Group, a Garden City, N.Y., bond specialist. So read up to avoid the pitfalls and be sure to shop around.
But while bonds remain what Mr. Ganz calls an "information deprived" subject, technology is starting to pierce the curtain long drawn over prices. The Bond Market Association, for example, recently added preceding-day transactions in the most active municipals to its Web site and hopes to start a similar listing for corporate bonds in the spring. And bonds are beginning to be sold on the Internet.
Perhaps the most important advice, professionals say, is to avoid the crowd's fixation on high rates to the exclusion of other considerations -- especially risk.
"There's a tremendous hunger for yield -- and Wall Street is so good at feeding that hunger," said Mark C. Lapman, executive vice president of Independence Investment Associates, a money manager in Boston. "That worries me."
 
The Bond Warriors: Three Voices of Experience
 
THE ALLOCATOR
William B. Paton
New Vernon, N.J.
 STILL working and with a portfolio permanently focused on a mix of 40 percent bonds and 60 percent stocks, William B. Paton, a real estate broker, buys bonds when his formula tells him to -- and not, for example, when he might have a hunch about the economy slipping into recession.
The latest such move came last month, when he picked up some West Windsor, N.J., tax-exempt school district issues, paying 4.60 percent and due in September 2003, to rebalance holdings distorted by swollen stock prices.
"Every time I get up to 62 or 63 percent" equities, Mr. Paton said, "we sell something and buy another municipal bond."
In this case, the sale was of Colgate-Palmolive shares on which he had a modest loss, thereby also establishing a tax deduction for 1998.
Mr. Paton, who is 66, holds taxable issues in tax-sheltered accounts and mostly municipals in the bond portion of his regular portfolio. Generally, he keeps bonds until they come due, disregarding the odd occasion when his formula suggests buying stocks to rebalance.
Their role? "Insurance," he says succinctly, for his nest egg.

 FOR years after her divorce in 1988, Elaine Perry was too uninformed about finance to tamper much with the way her large settlement had been invested, mainly in municipal bonds. But the one-time teacher and marketer for various nonprofit groups insisted on educating herself, gradually becoming confident enough to take control of her money -- "to venture out," as she puts it.
Mrs. Perry, now in her 50's, became fond of a strategy suggested by her broker, Richard Ganz, president of Fixed Income Management Group in Garden City, N.Y. Its principle, Mr. Ganz said, is that "bonds can be used for growth," not just as a source of income.
Initially, she had a portfolio of municipals tailored to reach maturity on a regular schedule. Now, she puts significant amounts in long-term Treasuries and municipals that pay relatively low interest but grow sharply in market value when rates fall, as they did in 1998.
"It's a guess" on rates, she acknowledged. But it is a play that is conservative enough -- no leverage, no derivatives, no junk -- to square with her goal of safety. A wrong guess often means only that Mrs. Perry holds on to a bond indefinitely, perhaps to maturity -- the consolation, she said, being that "I'll always get my money back."
 
THE MARKET TIMER
Joseph F. Ippolito
Malvern, Pa.
 IN the 1980's, Joseph F. Ippolito bought Chrysler Corporation debt and made a small killing over the course of the auto maker's brush with oblivion. Emboldened by that triumph, he thought it would be smart to buy shares in a bond mutual fund when the business cycle turned downward in mid-1989.
"The economy was starting to go south, and this would pressure the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates," recalled Mr. Ippolito, 61, a tax accountant turned investment adviser.
But the strategy backfired when rates climbed instead. Mr. Ippolito, relying on a computer model as well his reading of the Fed's intentions, saw a $5,000 stake shrivel to $3,500 in a matter of months because he tried to be "too cute" in an investment that is often portrayed as practically risk-free.
"It was a very good lesson," said Mr. Ippolito, who is now semi-retired.
"Don't try to outguess Alan Greenspan," he added, "and don't put complete faith in your technical analysis."
Though 20 percent of Mr. Ippolito's portfolio is still invested in bonds, that is a sharp reduction from past years.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Around the World in Four Days in London

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE

 BODY:
IN the 1920's, my grandfather boarded a ship in Bristol that was bound for New York. In the next 50 years he never set foot in his native England again, for the cost of a visit was unthinkable on a coal miner's wage. Although I have grown up accustomed to affordable travel, I can still remember when a European trip was a special event involving months of planning and anticipation. I thought about this as I zoomed across the Atlantic toward London in late November, with a $239 round-trip air ticket in my hand that I'd purchased on impulse just six days before.
"I'm off to London for the weekend." I drove this phrase once or twice around the block in conversation in the days before my trip, trying to infuse it with just the right la-di-dah tone. It sounded rich and luxurious to me, like serving Dom Perignon and beluga for breakfast. 
 More accurately, I was going to spend four days eating at restaurants, going to museums, first-run films and the theater and spending the same as or less than I would for a similar weekend in New York.
The New York-London air corridor is one of the most competitive routes in the world. In November, when days shorten and temperatures drop in the northern latitudes, air fares plunge to yearly lows. I'm in the habit of cruising the last-minute special fares offered weekly on airline Web sites, bargain-basement fares used to lure travelers onto underbooked flights. The $239 New York-London fare advertised on United Airlines' Web page of specials came with lots of restrictions: it was nonrefundable, of course, and limited to certain flights on certain days on the coming weekend. I had to book and pay for it simultaneously, with my credit card, online -- and the fare was likely to evaporate if I hesitated a day. What's more the $239 wasn't the whole story. With airport and international taxes the actual price of the ticket came to $322.28.
But still -- London! For the price of Washington, Florida or Buffalo. My itchy index finger clicked the mouse on "buy ticket" and the deal was done. It was Friday, and I would leave the next Wednesday evening, arrive Thursday morning, and come home on Monday afternoon.
I figured I'd lose a good part of my first day, Thursday, to recovery time, but it wasn't too bad. The economy section of my outgoing 767 had only about 50 people in it (despite the sale!) and I stretched out over four seats in the middle section and napped. Arriving at Heathrow at 9 A.M. (2 A.M. in New York), I was conscious enough to choose the regular subway into London, which cost $5.50, over the Heathrow express train to Paddington, which cost $16.60. The subway takes a half hour longer, but I wasn't in a hurry, since my hotel had a 2 P.M. check-in time. I passed the train ride looking through the theater and film listings in Time Out magazine and plotting my cultural track for the weekend.
The Kensington Gardens Hotel, in the Bayswater section of London, a busy neighborhood of shops, inexpensive ethnic restaurants, and immigrants from Spain, the Middle East and India, hadn't been my first choice for a budget hotel. But as I had ruefully discovered after buying my cheap ticket, getting any kind of budget lodging in London on only a few days' notice isn't easy. I'd called about 10 hotels from New York before securing my single room without bath ($83 a night) at the Kensington Gardens for Thursday and Friday. It took another round of calls to find a single room with bath ($75 a night) for Saturday and Sunday nights at Aaron House, a bed-and-breakfast in the less fashionable Earl's Court neighborhood.
The receptionist at Kensington Gardens had warned me that my room -- the last available -- was a fourth-floor walk-up, and that the bathroom was on the third floor down a steep flight of steps. But she hadn't warned me that the room was doll-sized. Since I wasn't planning to do anything but sleep in it, I figured I could cope. It was clean and had a single bed, a desk and a tiny shower stall next to a closet that contained a refrigerator. And at 11 A.M. it wasn't ready yet, so I dropped off my bag and headed out.
It was cloudy, damp and chilly, and the plane ride and time change were beginning to get to me; if the room had been ready I would have taken a nap. Instead, I headed for my friend Vivian's apartment, a 20-minute walk away in nearby Ladbroke Grove. She fed me cookies and tea and dragged me on an errand to, of all places, Ikea. I tagged along, staggering through endless displays of wood-veneer bookcases with tags that said "Glugg" and "Skol." The London Ikea is the eerie twin of the one in New Jersey, and I marveled at the reach of capitalism's tentacles.
There was a payoff: post-Ikea, Vivian took me to her favorite neighborhood restaurant, Makan, a Malaysian take-out tucked under the bridge of the Ladbroke Grove tube. The rich fish curry drenched in a coconut sauce came with rice; with tea, the check came to $8. Revived by the food, I left Vivian and walked back along Portobello Road, popping into antique shops along the way, and eyeballing the upscale town houses of Notting Hill.
After a stop for a shower at the hotel, I strolled up and down Queensway, Bayswater's hopping main street, dodging tourists with backpacks, veiled Arab women with children in arms, and well-dressed businessmen speaking French, or Urdu. Just when I thought it couldn't get any more cosmopolitan, I slipped into a coffee shop, La Churreria Espanola, and drank a hot chocolate so thick that my spoon almost stood up in it. I heard the waiter say in Spanish to the couple at the next table, "So, how's it going in Madrid?"
The next day, after a more or less good night's sleep (I decided that in chilly countries, it is reasonable to spring for the extra bucks to have a toilet in your room), I was ready to make the cultural rounds. November in London may be miserable if you are looking at a weather chart, but it is bliss if you have a hankering for the latest in film, theater or art. The London Film Festival was under way, interesting fringe stage productions abounded and there were several tempting museum exhibitions running. With a day's unlimited subway pass ($6), I tried to do everything, and I almost succeeded.
On Friday I was lucky enough to catch one of the last days of the Royal Museum of Art's collection of Picasso's pottery, made late in his career when he was living with Jacqueline Roque. I'd never thought of Picasso as whimsical, but these plates, with ceramic "food" rising from them, were delightful, even silly. Afterward, I walked along Regent Street, stopping in bookstores and pausing to admire Christmas windows at Liberty of London, done up not in their traditional prints but as bizarrely as Barney's.
I ate a splendid lunch at Rasa, a restaurant off Oxford Street specializing in dishes of Kerala, India (I'd decided to focus my eating on cuisines that were unavailable, or less than satisfying, in New York). For about $20, I filled up on savory potato dumplings with mustard seeds and cashews, coconut-vegetable stew, and a scrumptious dessert of rice balls in thick sweet milk sauce.
There was so much food that I was set for the rest of the day -- which was good, because my program was almost too full to take the time out for meals. On Friday night I bought a ticket ($15) to "Fourteen Songs, Two Weddings and a Funeral" at the Lyric Theater in Hammersmith -- a lively production that adapted a gaudy Bombay "Bollywood" movie as a staged musical comedy. (London's excellent range of fringe theater, at less than half the price of West End productions, is one of the city's biggest bargains.) Saturday, at the last minute, I went to the box office of the Royal National Theater and got a seat in the back of the house for $25 to see Alan Rickman and Helen Mirren in "Antony and Cleopatra."
True, Rickman's hangdog portrayal of Antony had been slashed to slivers by the critics, but, I figured, how bad could a Shakespeare production in London really be? My faith was rewarded by the first-rate supporting cast and the appearance of a live snake at Helen Mirren's bare breast in the last act -- which ended, inexplicably, with the sound of thunderous explosions. Rushing outside after the play, I stood on the balcony of the theater and watched as gaudy fireworks erupted over the Thames, part of the celebration of London's annual Lord Mayor's Show.
I raced into Waterloo Station and caught a train to Brixton, in time to catch a premiere at the Ritzy theater of the film "Bombay Boys," which I'd heard about while traveling in India -- where it had been banned. Movies in London, at $13, are pricey even by New York standards, but I saved on dinner by grabbing a Jamaican vegetarian patty from a nearby storefront stall for $1.50.
Picasso, Shakespeare, Bollywood, Malaysia, Jamaica, Ikea. . . . Was it possible that London was becoming as polyglot as New York, or more so? I pondered this the next day, Sunday, as I left my room -- at $75 a better deal than the first, much larger, and with attached shower and bath -- at the funky old Victorian Aaron House in Earl's Court, and rode the subway to Maida Vale, on my way to the Saatchi Gallery. Perhaps I pondered a bit too hard, because I got off at the wrong stop.
Consulting a map, I followed a path that I figured would take me to the museum via Abbey Road -- where perhaps I could take the requisite photo of the famous Beatles' street crossing. But as I wandered up a hill, past a quaint stone church, a different sort of music filled my ears. I walked into the church recreation hall to investigate, and discovered a congregation singing in a tongue I couldn't place.
"Please join us," an African man dressed in a sharply cut suit invited. I walked into a whirl of drums and hand clapping, and some of the coolest polyrhythmic singing I'd ever heard. "We are evangelicals, from Kinshasa, Congo," explained my host, who grabbed my hand and started to dance.
But there was more. That night I met friends in a vodka bar in the basement of a Latvian cultural center in Bayswater to see a Cajun dance band (free). Upstairs afterward, we dropped in on a rehearsal of a London tango club that meets in the same building, watching women in long dresses and dark eyeliner and men -- one of them with dreadlocks -- slink across the floor to shimmering waves of accordion. I ended the evening over a plate of Philippine noodles ($7) in Lutong Pinoy, a tiny restaurant in Earl's Court, listening to a jubilant bunch of Filipino expats sing Christmas carols in Tagalog.
This was getting a little ridiculous. I was, after all, in London. I resolved, on my last day, to do something very British. I left Aaron House after breakfast and made my way through Kensington, toward Knightsbridge, considering the possibilities. The Victoria and Albert museum looked like just the ticket -- but just as I was passing, the sun chose to make a special guest appearance in the London sky, and so I walked on. Soon I was standing in front of Harrods -- a good choice for a British farewell to London. Or so I thought.
Standing in the food court, surrounded by samosas and Italian salamis, tagines and pates, I gave up on the idea. I bought a lunch for the flight -- Spanish Serrano ham and manchego cheese for about $6 -- and got a free sample of an odd-looking dried meat from the friendly counterman. I said goodbye to Harrods, and to London, with the taste of South African springbok jerky on my tongue.
 
Bottom line: no fish and chips
 I spent an average of $115.50 a day for food, lodging, activities and local transport during five days and four nights in London.
 My last-minute round-trip ticket from Kennedy Airport to Heathrow on United Airlines cost $322.28, including all taxes.
 
Where to Stay
 The Kensington Gardens Hotel, 9 Kensington Gardens Square, London W2, is an old Georgian mansion in the Bayswater neighborhood that is near two different tube lines in West London, shops and budget ethnic restaurants. My tiny single room, without toilet, had a small shower stall, a window overlooking a quiet square, and its own phone. It cost $83 a night (at the rate of $1.66 to the pound), including taxes and a Continental breakfast; phone (44-171) 221-7790, fax (44-171) 792-8612.
 Aaron House, 17 Courtfield Gardens, London SW5, is one of many town houses in the Earl's Court neighborhood that have been converted into budget lodgings. My large room, with double bed and bath and shower, was a little frayed around the edges -- peeling paint and threadbare carpet -- but it had its own little terrace overlooking a pleasant square. There was no phone in the room. My room, with Continental breakfast, cost $75; (44-171) 370-3991, fax (44-171) 373-2303.
 With more warning, I would have jumped at the chance to stay at the Garden Court Hotel, 30-31 Kensington Gardens Square, London W2, across the square from the Kensington. It had larger and more nicely decorated single rooms with bath and toilet for $77 a night. But it was fully booked when I was there; (44-171) 229-2553, fax (44-171) 727-2749.
 
Where to Eat
 Rasa W1, 6 Dering Street, (44-171) 629-1346, serves the distinctive vegetarian food of Kerala state, India. My ample three-course lunch cost $30, including tip and drink.
Makan Malaysian Take-Away, 270 Portobello Road, (44-181) 960-5169, serves delicious food from a storefront in Ladbroke Grove -- you can eat there or take out. Coconut curry fish fillets and rice came to about $8.
La Churreria Espanola, 179 Queensway, (44-171) 727-3444, is a Madrid-style coffee-and-doughnut shop. Hot chocolate and doughnuts, or churros, cost $4.
Most Sunday nights at Lutong Pinoy, 10 Kenway Road, Earl's Court, 244-0007, there's a cheery guitar sing-along going on. A plate of vegetarian mixed noodles and a San Miguel beer came to $12.
 
Activities
Admission to the Saatchi Gallery, 98A Boundary Road, London NW8, (44-171) 624-8299, with shows of contemporary art, is $6.75. It is open Thursday to Sunday after Jan. 14.
The Royal National Theater, South Bank, (44-171) 452-3000, sometimes sells returned tickets at the box office just before performances for full price. If a performance is not sold out, tickets can be bought two hours before curtain for about $24, and sometimes at 10 A.M. for about $17.
A good place to find out about fringe theater productions is the theater section of Time Out magazine, about $3 at newsstands.
The London Film Festival is held in theaters throughout the city each November. The information hot line is (44-171) 928-3232. Tickets for most performances are $12. DAISANN McLANE

Life the Movie
How Entertainment Conquered Reality.
By Neal Gabler.
303 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $25. 
 When President Clinton sent Tomahawk cruise missiles against a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant and Osama bin Laden's redoubt in Afghanistan last August, after the bombings of the United States Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, many of those who had seen the movie "Wag the Dog" exchanged knowing looks. They couldn't help recognizing that the attack followed by only three days the President's now legendary grand jury appearance. Reality, in other words, seemed to be imitating fiction. (By December, when the President attempted to "degrade" Saddam Hussein's ability to produce weapons of mass destruction, there seemed to be no doubt about this, at least in the minds of many of his Republican opponents, for whom "Wag the Dog" had now become a "syndrome.")
While most political commentators were flummoxed by the rise in Clinton's ratings after the airing of the grand jury video, Frank Rich, a columnist for The New York Times and a former movie and theater critic, wrote, "The best explanation I've heard comes not from a journalist but a filmmaker in Los Angeles." The explanation need not concern us, but suffice to say it turned on a comparison between Clinton's televised ordeal and tragic drama, albeit of the trashy variety. More recently, The New Yorker let novelists pontificate about Monicagate in its Talk of the Town pages, presumably on the theory that they were as sure-footed on this soapy terrain as its pundit-turned-novelist-(re)turned-pundit, Joe Klein.
Such phenomena have attracted the attention of Neal Gabler, whose two previous books -- one a study of Hollywood's Jewish moguls, the other a biography of Walter Winchell -- more than qualify him as a credible commentator on the vagaries of American popular culture. Gabler thinks he knows why cultural critics have become the Walter Lippmanns of the millennium, and he lays out his provocative reflections in a new work whose title and subtitle do a pretty good job of summing up his thesis, "Life the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality."
Standing upon the shoulders of scholars who have examined the impact of movies and television on traditional values -- particularly Neil Postman but also the likes of Marshall McLuhan, Daniel Boorstin, Leo Braudy and Richard Sennett -- Gabler argues that everyday life at the end of the 20th century has become our very own "Truman Show," perhaps aptly retitled "The Human Show." We are all Trumans, with the difference that we are witting accomplices to the fictionalization of our lives because we prefer our life movies, or "lifies," as he calls them, to reality, which barely exists anyway. "Life itself," Gabler says, is "gradually becoming a medium all its own." We are all "becoming at once performance artists in and audiences for a grand, ongoing show. . . . Life has become art, so that the two are now indistinguishable from each other."
Gabler maintains that "there is obviously no such thing as a unified field theory of American culture," but this is precisely what he offers when he goes on to say that "if there were, one could do worse than to lay much of what has happened in late-20th-century America to the corrosive effects of entertainment rather than to the effects of politics or economics." This is a large claim. Does Gabler back it up?
Partly. Following Postman, he has a fine old time showing how entertainment values have come to permeate every nook and cranny of American life. Gabler traces the rise of entertainment, which he characterizes as "fun, effortless, sensational, mindless, formulaic, predictable and subversive," from its humble beginnings in 19th-century low or popular cultural forms like band music, penny dreadfuls, melodramas, variety acts, the yellow press and, of course, the early nickelodeons to its eventual triumph over high culture, transforming America into what he calls "the Republic of Entertainment." How did this happen?
First, Gabler says, came the "graphic revolution" at the turn of the century, when photographs made inroads into print media and "image-thinking" replaced reasoning, nurtured by the old culture of typography. Eventually, moving images replaced static ones, and entertainment swept everything before it -- not only logic but also character, which became personality, and the work ethic, which gave way to celebrity. The boundaries between real and unreal became increasingly permeable until they broke down altogether.
Citing everyone from Baudrillard to Warhol, Gabler aims to show that nothing has remained safe from the virus of entertainment. Indeed, it is impossible to put down this book unconvinced of the cataclysmic effect of celebrity on every area of American life.
Gabler makes particularly short work of American politics, for example, effortlessly showing how, beginning with John F. Kennedy and reaching an apotheosis with Ronald Reagan, entertainment has replaced substance. It is his great insight to see that Reagan's habit of confusing the plots of old movies with reality was not a manifestation of senility but rather the ineluctable working out of a seismic cultural change. He concludes that political candidates have become stars, primaries casting calls, campaigns auditions, the electorate no more than an audience. Gabler even refers to issues as "MacGuffins," Alfred Hitchcock's term for irrelevant plot devices, and borrowing from the New Yorker writer Kurt Andersen, he calls President Clinton the "Entertainer-in-Chief."
But an idea can be a dangerous thing, as someone once said, and as Gabler gallops through the pages of American history in search of evidence to fit his thesis, he rides his horse into the ground. "The real political revolution of the 1980's," he argues, was not "the much-bruited-about demise of postwar liberalism and the rise of conservatism but the triumph of entertainment over political ideology of any sort." This is absurd, and points to one of the problems with Gabler's argument. He seems to feel that entertainment trumps ideology.
Entertainment does have powerful imperatives, but they have not (yet) overwhelmed traditional ideologies. To be simplistic, it helps to think of entertainment as a delivery system that can carry ideologies of all political stripes, left, right and center. The left, for example, has its own music, say, Bruce Springsteen, and its movies (Oliver Stone), while the right has its Christian rock and Rambo. The biggest blockbuster (read: most entertaining) of all time, "Titanic," was so loaded with working-class sentimentality, Beverly Hills style, that if the ship hadn't hit an iceberg, its ideological baggage would have sunk it anyway. Often the medium's message, to use McLuhan's famous formulation of Gabler's thesis, reinforces the ideology it conveys. Sometimes it contradicts it, creating art or entertainment divided against itself, fun of a different kind -- for campus deconstructionists.
As for reality being swallowed up by entertainment, surely Clinton's favorable ratings in the face of Monicagate suggest not that Americans have confused his tribulations with a soap opera but, on the contrary, that they are well able to distinguish between entertainment and reality and that they do not want the President cashiered. When Mike Nichols's film adaptation of "Primary Colors," Klein's best-selling novelization of his experiences reporting on the 1992 primaries, flopped in the wake of the Lewinsky revelations, it was because reality had eclipsed fiction, not because it had become fiction.
In the traditional formulation, life precedes and inspires art, but in moments of high historical drama the spectacle of reality has often surpassed art. This is why, in the 60's, documentaries flourished and theatrical films like those of John Cassavetes and Martin Scorsese tried to incorporate news footage or otherwise approximate the look of documentary. This is one of the reasons that features did not succeed in dealing fictively with the Vietnam War until well after it was over. This is also why dog-wagging incidents like John Hinckley's attempt on Reagan's life, inspired by "Taxi Driver," still seem so transgressive.
When all is said and done, "Life the Movie" doesn't tell the whole story. Still, it tells a big part of it. It's a thoughtful, in places chilling, account of the way entertainment values have hollowed out American life and if not supplanted reality, at least threatened it.

THE YOUNG WOMAN ON THE TELEvision screen simply will not look up.
 "When this documentary was first to the floor, "I was having doubts about it. It was like I was trying to block out certain memories of my father, just block him out entirely."
 
 The camera shifts to a close-up, but the young woman's eyes don't move. Her face is thin and tense. "I knew right then and there that I would have to face issues that were in my past once again," she says grimly. "And this time, hopefully, get through them."
 The woman's name is LaToya Aultman, and the interview with her appears just after the documentary's title, "AWOL From the Father 'Hood': Are Fathers Necessary Anymore?" Made a year ago by Ms. Aultman, now 21, and five other high-school students at the Educational Video Center on the East Side of Manhattan, "AWOL" intercuts interviews with experts on parental roles; fantasy encounters with missing dads; statistics on fatherlessness and suicide, fatherlessness and divorce and fatherlessness and teen-age pregnancy, and even a segment from a documentary on how father penguins nurture their young.
 The editing is fast and often funny, but in the end, the effect is crushing: what at first appeared to be a rehtorical subtitle has been painfully answered. Five of the six young filmmakers grew up in fatherless homes.
 Unusual as it is, "AWOL" is a typical product of the Educational Video Center - a short documentary that connects s subject of compelling personal importance for its makers to the public issues and institutions that surround it. The center is a nonprofit organization currently housed in the School for the Physical City, an alternative high school and middle school on East 25th Street; it teaches the art of making video documentaries to students from public high schools all over New York City.
 Each semester, 25 students are chosen from a pool of applicants recommended by school counselors. Because the center has been successful with students who are at risk of failing or dropping out of school - often bright students sidetracked by emotional problems or difficulties at home - counselors often refer those with troubled histories. The center looks particularly for evidence of enthusiasm and creativity in its candidates' applications. It does not exclude affluent students, but it does seek out youths from poor neighborhoods and schools without the resources to offer video training.
 The chosen ones spend afternoons at the center for five months. Some students continue with an advanced class, and some eventually become part of Youth Organizing-TV, or YO-TV, which makes documentaries for museums and other institutions for small stipends. This fall, the YO-TV crew prepared videos for the New Museum and the Brooklyn Museum of Art. The center also trains teachers in 25 city schools on how to use video and how to teach students to interpret media.
 In the 14 years since its founding, the center has built up a large library of tapes, including "Young Gunz," about why teen-agers carry guns; "Unequal Education," an expose of the uneven allocation of resources in two neighboring schools, and "Blacks and Jews: Are They Really Sworn Enemies?" Some of the videos have been broadcast on national television, notably as part of Bill Moyers's "Listening to America" series on public television. Dozens have won awards.
 "Video documentary enables students to bear witness to their social conditions and look for solutions," says Steven Gooman, the center's founder and executive director. "It empowers kids to see themselves in context, to communicate to others how that feels." And, he adds, making a tape by "working together democratically, they learn a powerful way to learn."
 At the same time, students examine how the electronic and print media work, learning to decode, analyse and interpret the sound-and-image language of electronic communication.
 Such an understanding of media language is crucial in today's world of videos, CD's, CD-ROM's, megabudget movies and advertising, says mary Megee, a media eduator and author of a series of documentaries about television. She praises the center's method of combining hands-on learning with classroom studies.
 "We live immersed in a sea of messages," she says. "Other people's agendas confront us at every turn. To be effective participants in the public dialogue, young people have to learn to be critical receivers and capable senders of messages themselves." That kind of literacy is now as basic as reading and writing, she notes, because "the literature of our time is television."
 ON A CHILLY OCTOBER AFTERNOON, four Educational Video Center interns troop over to nearby Madison Square Park to do some videotaping. They are making short video self-portraits that, along with the written biographies, story boards, notes and other ephemera that went into their creation, will be the raw material for an installation about media at the Brooklyn Museum on Jan. 9 and 10.
 As the crew prepares equipment, Duwayne Philpotts, an 18-year-old senior at the Satellite Academy in the Bronx, slouches onto a bench in front of an empty playground to discuss his script for this scene. He has short cornrows, two diamond studs in his left ear and a bright, tender glance he seldom allows to show.
 "Action," says Jason Garcia, today's cameraman. Duwayne lights up what looks like - but is not - a marijuana cigarette, and then spits on the pavement near his feet. He drags deeply, looks up into the camera and blows smoke at its lens. Jason, a loose, lanky 16-year-old, then pans across the park, while Joan Jubela, a professional filmmaker who teaches the workshop with another filmmaker, Jacqueline Dolly, fights a burning desire to direct them.
 "We won't see the playground," she murmurs, noting that Jason is holding the camera so high above Duwayne that the face will exclude the interesting contrast of swings and slides behind him.
 "There's a constant pull between process and product," she adds a bit ruefully as the crew moves on. Indeed, the center's holistic approach to teaching turns entirely on a process-product axis. The teachers want the finished documentaries to be accomplished - they may be important for job or college applications.
 Yet the program is committed to keeping the focus on learning; instruction is given, but once the students are out in the field, they must solve problems on their own. Mistakes are considered intrinsic to learning, and the goal is the journey, not the end result.
 "Teaching is to make documentaries has always been the thing that we do here," Mr. Goodman explains. "But it's not the main point. the real point is the critical and creative skills learned along the way."
 All the same, as the crew approaches a demonstration that is taking place at the south end of the park, Ms. Jubela, foreseeing a wasted opportunity, can't help suggesting that they plan an itinerary before they plunge through the crowd. The crew pauses and confers. The demonstrators, mostly Albanian-Americans, are protesting the American policy in the Kosovo province in Serbia. They have chosen the park because of the association of Richard C. Holbrooke, the American envoy in the Balkans, with Credit Suisse, whose offices are across the street from the park. A sizable contingent of police is present to keep the peace. Serenely ignoring the purpose of the rally, Duwayne circles around so that he is in front of the police vans and uses the chanting behind him for background. He glances over his shouler.
 Then he declares passionately to the camera, "The police need to give us a break!"
 Back inside, the crew reassebles in a long, locker-lined corridor outside the center's crowded fourth-floor office. After much fumbling, they adjust the camera for taping indoors. Duwayne wants to tape a T-shirt on which a photo of his close friend, Charlie, who drowned last summer while swimming in a lake at college, has been reproduced. When at last the camera is ready, he picks up the shirt and stands miserably fluttering it before his chest.
 Later, Duwayne explains tha tcharlie was a member of his own "crew" in the Bronx, a tight group of friends who call themselves North Legacy. Duwayne speaks of North Legacy as his family - people who care about him, people he grew up with, hangs out with, plays music with - but to defend itself, the group is also capable of violence, he says.
 "My crew?" he says. "We're not going to bully civilized people. But if you want to be tough toward us, try to make us feel intimidated, something's going to happen."
 Members of the center's staff are worried that Duwayne may drop out of the program. He is doing well at Satellite and is close to graduating, but his demeanor here is removed, indifferent. He rarely speaks and is often the first one out the door. Helping students change counterproductive habits is an important aspect of the center's work, and Ms. Dolly, a warm, lively Englishwoman who like Ms. Jubela has a graduate degree in creative writing, recently asked Duwayne to consider how his diffidence may affect his success.
 "Do you think your tendency to maintain a distance will help you or hinder you?" she wrote on one of his papers, advising, "The more you make people notice you are here, the more they will respect you."
 But Duwayne is not inclined to drop his guard. "You can't trust anybody," he says. "I've had people talk behind my back, lie in my eyes." A writer of fierce, incisive rap lyrics, he states his policy in a song called "I.C.U."' "I keep my ears open, trap shut."
 MR. GOODMAN, 41, LEARNED THE power of video documentary to change lives firsthand in the late 1970's. A history student at Columbia College, he set out to produce a work of social journalism about youth gangs in the South Bronx. But as he was finishing, a gang member whom he had been observing killed two teen-age girls. Mr. Goodman, who by then had enrolled in Columbia's journalism school, extended the project to follow the story into the justice system. Three years after he started, he hooked up a monitor on a street in the neighborhood where he had been taping and screened his finished work: 20 chilling minutes of black-and-white testimony on life and death in the neighborhood.
 "One of the first things I learned from that was that video defamiliarizes the familiar," Mr. Goodman says. "We tend to go through life almost being lulled into accepting our conditions. But there's something about video that captures life, reframes it, positions it. The residents themselves had been going to the fire hydrant to get water because there was no running water in their buildings. They lived it. But to see it on the video somehow made it more real. It was a transformative experience for them" -- one that led to community action.
 For Mr. Goodman, the project was also transformative. He began to want to put cameras into residents' hands so that they could tell their own stories. At this point, he says, "Crossing the line from journalism to education seemed natural." In 1981, he began to teach video workshops at the Satellite Academy on the Lower East Side, a public high school serving students who are not succeeding elsewhere. The results, he says, were startling.
 "Kids who had been traditionally truant started coming in early and staying late -- and winning awards," he says. "Other teachers also wanted to learn." In 1984, with financing from the Cohn Foundation and the New York Community Trust, Mr. Goodman established the Educational Video Center as an independent entity that accepted students from all over the city. The center, which now receives some support from the New York City Board of Education, has an operating budget of about $800,000.
 The center is part of a growing trend toward teaching media literacy, a catchall term that covers many different kinds of programs. Some focus on how to handle equipment as vocational training. Others aim to create critical consumers -- and capable citizens -- by teaching youths how to decode the thousands of images thrown at them daily by advertisements, television and the like. Some media educators abhor popular culture, some embrace it.
 Either way, Mr. Goodman says, the language of such a powerful force needs to be taught.
 "It makes a difference whether something is shot as a close-up or a wide angle, what's in the camera frame, what's left out," he says. "Kids grow up watching TV, videos, films, computers, CD-ROM's, and all sorts of learning takes place, from infancy on, in an informal way. But rarely do they get the opportunity to be either producers of their own media using this language or critical analysts of it."
 As in other media literacy programs, the students learn to analyze the language of image and sound, just as they read and analyze books in English classes. Is the man in the whisky ad twice as big as the woman? Is the woman actually cut in half at the edge of the picture? What does that say about men? About women? About whisky?
 The subtler manipulations and biases found in entertainment and news media are also scrutinized, the same way a history textbook may be examined for slants and omissions, or a poem dismantled to find out how it was constructed. What effect does a rock song on the soundtrack have while a robbery is occurring in a film? Does it suggest that crime is hip and exciting? Why doesn't the camera stay with the security guard in an action movie after the explosion blasts him through the plate-glass window? Perhaps the death of ordinary people is not interesting or important?
 According to national studies, the average child between 8 and 17 years old watches 1,100 to 1,600 hours of television every year but spends fewer than 1,000 hours in school. The Center for Media Education in Washington reports that the only thing children in this age group do more than watch television is sleep. Yet only 11 states require media literacy instruction. (New York is not among them.)
 If the Educational Video Center is part of the media literacy movement, it also draws on the progressive methodology known as student-centered learning, which stresses a hands-on approach, collaborative group work and a connection with the larger community. Videos are framed around community issues like schooling, pollution, race relations and drug abuse and are rented by schools and other institutions around the world.
 Kathleen Tyner, a media theorist and the author of the 1998 book "Literacy in a Digital World" (Lawrence Erlbaum Associates), considers the center and similar programs to be pioneers.
 "Schooling has always been so associated with alphabetic literacy," Ms. Tyner says, adding that the center and others like it "have crossed the threshold into electronic and digital forms of communication in schooling."
 She continues: "We know that children learn best when they start with their home culture, with the things they know. And the thing they know very well is electronic communication. It's very important that children learn to read and write in print. But why not use all the literacy tools at our disposal to broaden children's ways of interacting with the world?"
 The documentary workshops are mixed groups in every way. Some interns are high achievers bent on media careers. Others are "super seniors," in high school too long yet unable to graduate. In this fall workshop, one student is a born-again Pentecostal Christian struggling to leave behind a history of truancy, cursing, provocative dress and sex. Another arrived from El Salvador at age 13 speaking no English but has earned enough credits to finish high school in three years. Jason Garcia has a growing career as a model and actor. Duwayne Philpotts may move with a tough crew, but he spent last summer working in a day-care center, and his television tastes include "Frasier" and "Seinfeld."
 One day in late October, he sits with a fellow student, Aram Zadikian, 17, at one of the two editing machines in the center's windowless work space. Idle equipment is piled in one corner, coats are strewn everywhere, and it is nearly impossible to cross the room without stepping on someone or tripping over something.
 Aram, whose father, Zadik, is a sculptor, is working as Duwayne's editor on his self-portrait. In his spare time, Aram and a friend are making an action comedy-drama pilot, which they hope to land on television. Like most of the boys in the class, Aram wears an earring and seems permanently attached to his headgear -- in his case, a knitted terra-cotta-colored cap. He and Duwayne work first on the brief scene of the rippling T-shirt, choosing a segment and adding the narration.
 "At times I start to think about my right-hand man, Charlie, who passed away," says Duwayne in a deep, deliberate voice-over. "But then I have to realize life goes on, and I learned that life has to be serious."
 At the monitor, Aram clicks on a window containing a still picture from the Kosovo protest, and the two review tape of that event. When they arrive at Duwayne's declaration, "The police need to give us a break!" Duwayne asks Aram to isolate the glance that he took over his shoulder just before speaking and to triple it, so that he seems to whip his head back and forth three times in a row. Duwayne has never made a video before, but he has been thinking about television lately, watching it differently (he watches about 16 hours a week, he says), noticing how images can reinforce ideas.
 He wants the triple glance to look, he explains, "like I'm scared to say it."
 A week later, Duwayne turns up two hours early for class. Hanging out in the hallway, he mentions that he hopes to make a career in the music or video industry. The documentary workshop is good preparation, he adds, not only because of the technical skills it provides but also because it is teaching him how to work with new people.
 "Because no matter what you're going to do, you're going to have to work with people," he observes. "Outside your race, gay, straight, whatever. So you learn a lot."
 LaToya Aultman, the young woman who helped to create "AWOL," also says she learned a lot in the workshop. She was, she says, a "loose wire" when she arrived at the center in 1997, impatient and confused. But Ms. Dolly worked closely with her, shepherding her through the making of "AWOL" and gently encouraging her to risk shedding her volatile persona. These days, after returning to the center for the advanced workshop and then joining the YO-TV crew, Ms. Aultman is virtually unrecognizable as the tormented teen-ager in the "AWOL" tape. She has a swift stride, a huge, brilliant smile and college plans.
 "In the school system, some of the kids get lost," Ms. Dolly says. "No one pays any attention to them. We have the luxury of being able to do that here."
In early November, the workshop interns view and criticize one another's self-portraits. In several, an artistic eye has already started to assert itself. Zoe Friedman, 17, a politically inclined student who cultivates a retro-hippie look, uses a plume of steam rising from a manhole on Madison Avenue to match the musing tone of her narration. Edward Griffith, 17, recalling his struggle to fit in and survive high school, shows himself shoved, and then slammed, into a locker.
 In 17-year-old Gina Sullivan's self-portrait, her perky voice-over chirps, "You could describe me as an outgoing person," while her image is replaced by Judy Garland as Dorothy skipping down the road to Oz.
 Duwayne watches his own video with the others. "Hello, my name is Duwayne," it begins. "I consider myself to be quiet and calm and normally don't come out of my character for anybody."
 The tape draws praise for its honesty and its match of words to image. Duwayne smiles. He is still hanging out with the teachers when class ends at 4.
 
ABC's for the Information Age
 To navigate the sea of information flooding into our homes, today's youths need to learn to "read"
 and "write" a whole new language of sound, image, text and data bits. Mary Megee, the producer and writer of the "On Television" documentaries for PBS and the former director of the Media Education Laboratory at Rutgers University, offers approaches to decoding and judging messages as well as creating and sending your own:
 COUNT THE CUTS: Every second of video contains 30 frames, some of which may evoke an unconscious memory or feeling. Record a commercial and play it several times, noting how the images change with each "cut" or "dissolve." If an advertiser pays $1 million to place a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl, each of the 900 frames costs $1,111. What's the possibility that any single image is incidental?
 HOLD A CRITICS' CAUCUS: Examine and discuss a music video in terms of religion, politics, health, finance and international relations. Consider symbols, costumes, effects and lyrics.
 FIND IMPLIED MEANINGS: In a beer ad, the hero feigns lasciviousness as tall, slim blond women surround him. Are there clues to the women's professions? Does beer make them slender? Is thinness crucial for beauty or for self-worth? Will drinking enhance the man's popularity, wit or prowess?
 LISTEN AND SEE: As accompaniment to a car chase in an action film, Mozart's "Requiem" suggests doom; rock music suggests fun. With eyes closed, "read" a story through music, dialogue, inflection, pace, tone and even pauses. Watch without sound and compare.
 ANALYZE MOTIVES: In any medium, consider the interests -- financial, public-service, artistic, political, advocatory -- of those presenting the information. Who is telling or selling what to whom, for what purpose, on behalf of which interests and with what effect?
 In a newspaper, who decides what is news and the order in which stories appear? Consider emotion-laden terms, unattributed statements, relationship of pictures to words, use of nicknames versus names and titles and the apparent significance of the lead story.
 On local television, why would a crime piece run longer than a piece on telephone company mergers? On network news, why does the opposite usually hold true?
 On the Internet, some companies with Web sites solicit demographic information, praising those who answer and ridiculing those who don't. How would you advise young people to navigate such sites?
 GET INVOLVED: Because digital will soon supplant analog television, Congress is writing new communications policies for economic, technological and public-interest standards. To participate in this process, viewers and media-makers need to understand their information options and rights. Only broadcast television -- not cable -- is required to serve the "public interest, convenience and necessity," as stated in the Communications Act of 1934, and provide at least three hours of educational programming a week. Should future decisions maintain or eliminate these provisions, or those for noncommercial television and radio? Which policies best serve the public interest rather than private interests? Will everyone have equal access?
 MASTER THE TOOLS: Becoming media literate entails producing and sharing ideas through all available media.

Say It Loud

BYLINE: By Juan Williams; Juan Williams is the author of "Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary."

 BODY:
The phrase "Black Power!" stands as Kwame Ture's defining contribution to the 1960's. In 1988, Ture told me that the phrase had been used before. But he alone used it "scientifically." Dr. King had been continuing James Meredith's "March Against Fear" after Meredith was shot by a sniper. When King left the march for a short while, Carmichael took over and changed the motto from the lyrical "We Shall Overcome" to the piercing demand "Black Power!"
 Ultimately, he was less interested in black political power than in protest and oratory. He moved to Guinea in 1968 -- changing his name -- because he was convinced that the black politicians who came to power were only creating a bourgeois class and did nothing to cripple capitalism. His rants against Jews and Zionism and his arrogance broke coalitions that had fired progressive politics. But he didn't care. 
 Blacks, he contended, had more elected officials in the United States than any other minority group but still had little power. His solution: for African-Americans to return to Africa and unify the continent under socialist principles.
 He died out of step with African efforts to join the world economy and irrelevant to the enduring efforts for racial equality in the United States. At best, Ture ended up a romantic figure for aging black-American radicals willing to look past his excesses.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: ECONOMY & INDUSTRY -- BANKING;
Financial Institutions Are Going the One-Stop-Shopping Route

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Banking is dead. Long live banking.
If a slew of big bank mergers over the last few years was not reminder enough, then the losses banks took in 1998 by lending to risky hedge funds like Long-Term Capital Management and by trading in exotic overseas markets may be proof enough that banking as we once knew it is firmly passe. 
 In its place, America now has a high-octane form of banking that our grandparents would not recognize. Many banks now proffer a financial cornucopia that includes credit cards, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, mortgages, auto loans, brokerage services and insurance. And the really big banks also offer investment banking advice, private banking and asset management services, derivatives and large corporate loans.
In fact, banks, brokerage firms, mutual fund companies and insurers are so eager to invade one another's turf that those neat little categories they inhabit do not adequately describe all of the services they engage in or want to provide. All of this goes to show that as banking ceases to be a useful way to describe a broad range of America's money-changers, a handy replacement term for what all of them are doing seems to be financial services.
"I've said before that banking is dead and we should bury it," said Richard M. Kovacevich, the chief executive of Wells Fargo & Company, a bank -- oops, financial services concern -- formed last year through the Norwest Corporation's acquisition of Wells Fargo. "A lot of these businesses were segmented, not because that's the way consumers wanted it, but because that's what the regulations mandated. And those regulations are breaking down now."
Of course, there is still not much of a consensus on the wisdom of combining the staid workings of plain vanilla banking with the riskier mechanics of investment banking -- especially when the nest eggs of individual depositors could be at stake. And there is not a consensus on how adequately these new high-fliers will meet the financial needs of low-income communities.
But financial services are clearly heading in the direction of once-unheard of combinations. Over the next year, and in years to come, the financial services industry will continue to evolve, albeit in fits and starts.
"The convergence between commercial and investment banking is sure to be one of the great themes in 1999," a group of Merrill Lynch analysts noted in a recent research report. "However, few companies, to date, have effectively blended a securities and commercial banking model."
Indeed, a continuing tale in 1999 and beyond will be how well some of the big financial services mergers play out. The two book-end deals in this regard are last year's combination of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc. to form Citigroup and the German banking giant Deutsche Bank A.G.'s planned acquisition of the Bankers Trust Corporation. Citigroup has already had plenty of trouble knitting together its unwieldy investment and corporate banking operations, while many analysts and industry observers see the Deutsche Bank deal as doomed from the start given the problems the German company has encountered trying to break into investment banking in the past.
All of America's big, multinational banks could face substantial headaches if ill-considered loans go sour in a slowing domestic economy. Financial turmoil abroad, perhaps the most significant business development of last year, also promises to pose continuing hurdles for big banks.
On the consumer side of the ledger, another landmark deal last year was Nationsbank's acquisition of BankAmerica to form a new national behemoth named, surprise, surprise, BankAmerica. The new BankAmerica Corporation is the first truly coast-to-coast national bank, complete with a brokerage operation and an appetite to enter other lines of business. Its size and diversity will increase the pressure on smaller banks to eat or be eaten in the merger game.
Smaller banks, those that rely heavily on traditional deposit-taking and lending, face tough sledding this year. While the Year 2000 computer problem is a well-known bugaboo, there are other problems lurking.
"We seem to be in a world where interest rates are going lower, and that's not a friendly environment for a deposit-taking bank," said David Berry, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. "That's because they can't bring deposit rates much lower than they already are and they will have to charge less for the money they are lending out because interest rates are dropping. That means profits are going to go lower, too."
To make up for declining profits on loans, traditional banks can be expected to try to get more fees from products like checking and savings accounts. While consumers can expect to encounter sticker shock if banks get more fee-happy, banks no longer have as much wiggle room to charge fees because competition has grown more intense.
"I think the real issue is going to be revenue generation," said H. Rodgin Cohen, a banking lawyer with the New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell. "And competition remains extremely intense so there's going to be a lot of pressure on banks to figure out where earnings are going to come from."
In the meantime, many big insurers, like the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, are converting to stock ownership so they have more ways to pay for growth as the financial services industry consolidates. Mutual fund titans like Fidelity Investments have to worry about how easy it will be to keep growing and are already offering financial services beyond fund management. Midsized brokerage firms like Paine Webber will have to struggle to remain competitive with giants like Merrill Lynch, while securities firms of all sizes are concerned about the possible setback from a slowing economy and continuing economic uncertainty abroad.
Indeed, uncertainty about the big economic picture will loom over financial services firms this year and may produce unpleasant earnings surprises at some companies.
"It will be like popcorn," Mr. Berry said. "There will be just enough popping to keep you on edge." <

Sewing a Label on a Decade

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Some decades in the life of the business world are easy to label. The 1960's saw a rebellion against the established order. Inflation dominated the 1970's. Deals branded the 1980's. But the 1990's, so far, seem to be the fill-in-the-blank decade.
As the decade opened, Japan was an economic powerhouse, Eastern Europe had its post-World War II borders, Democrats controlled Congress and Republicans ran the White House. By its midpoint, Japan had stumbled, parts of Eastern Europe were a killing field, Republicans controlled Congress and Democrats ran the White House. As the decade ends, Japan is an economic quagmire, Eastern European capitalism is a question mark and it is not clear that anyone controls anything in Washington. 
 Nine people, who view the business world from different vantage points, were invited to name this decade. Their suggestions follow.
One caveat, as Richard H. Jenrette, one of the founders of the investment banking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said: "It ain't over yet."
"At the end of 1928, you would have said the 1920's were the most prosperous decade ever," Mr. Jenrette said. "There is something wonderful about the eighth year; 1988 was the peak of the 1980's, and 1968 was certainly the peak of that decade. But that ninth year -- it can suddenly rise up and bite you."
Even so, Mr. Jenrette calls the 1990's "probably the most prosperous, felicitous overall decade we've had this century." Whatever the decade's ninth year brings, he suspects the future will see the decade as a time when the world began to question the "rugged 'let-the-markets-rule' philosophy" of the 1980's.
"This decade may be the beginning of a kinder, gentler capitalism," he suggested.
"Some funny things happen on the way to the millennium," Mr. Jenrette said, citing the political shifts to the left that have occurred during the decade in Britain, France, Germany and Italy. "And we just had a big swing back toward the Democrats in this country," he added.
What's going on? "I think the world tried the rugged brand of capitalism, and not everybody found it to their liking," he said.
In 1972, Jules B. Kroll, a former prosecutor, founded Kroll Associates, a large corporate detective agency in Manhattan. He is now chief executive of the Kroll-O'Gara Company, a corporate-security concern formed in 1997 by a merger with an armored-car maker.
As Mr. Kroll sees it, the decade has been a flashback to "Network," the 1976 film by Paddy Chayefsky. "You remember that great line, 'I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore,' " Mr. Kroll said. "Well, I think the 1990's have been like that."
People around the world spent the decade removing their leaders over issues of corruption, he said -- in Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Pakistan and South Korea.
"You can list an extraordinary number of individuals outside the United States who have been removed or forced out by accusations of corruption, proven and unproven," he said. "It seems to be based on people simply saying, 'We've had enough.' "
In the private sector, Mr. Kroll said, the decade has become the era of the megafraud. "Partly that's because there are just more zeros out there -- the economy is so much bigger than it was in the 1980's and everyone is playing with bigger chips."
But the growth in the use of esoteric financial derivatives has also played a role, he argued. "Most boards of directors, most regulators, really don't understand the importance of this derivatives activity," Mr. Kroll said. "It is scary that so few people understand it. It is the advent of these derivatives that has opened the doors to the institution-threatening, and nation-threatening, financial debacle."
For Maria Livanos Cattaui, who helped organize the prestigious World Economic Conference in Davos, Switzerland, and who is now secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris, the label for the 1990's "is absolutely obvious: This has been the decade of globalization."
Certainly, the economies of the world have been inching closer since the first caravans set forth centuries ago. "But never has the world been so intensively pulled together," she said. Technology has dramatically altered "the speed with which ideas -- and capital -- can whiz around the world."
In her view, globalization was encouraged by the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991. "That unleashed all the capital and energy that had previously been locked in this global power struggle," she said.
Ms. Cattaui warns against any nostalgia for a less-connected, slower-paced world. "When cars first came in, we didn't have any uniform rules of the road," she said. "Road systems all developed nation by nation, with some driving on the left and some on the right." And after more than a century, there still are no global rules to govern electricity. "You cannot take your computer from home and plug it in anywhere else in the world," she said with a laugh. "The voltage is different, the outlets are different, even the silly plug is different."
By contrast, she argued, today's business leaders and government officials are doing a much better job of developing standards for trade documents, global financial transactions, compatible computer software and international telecommunications.
"Globalization need not mean homogenization, after all," she said. But, she added, it must mean better cooperation among regulators and better communication among corporations about their exposure to risk.
Charles R. Schwab, chairman of the financial-services company that bears his name, said, "I think the dominant theme of this decade is confidence."
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Americans were freed at last from what he called "that awful, final what-if" -- the nuclear nightmare. "That gave us personal confidence with respect to our own and our families' security."
But the decade has also been marked by growing confidence in "the sustainability of the United States growth story," he said.
That may be based on the broad access to the Internet and the speed with which this technology is spreading, Mr. Schwab said. Already, more than 70 percent of his company's relationships and contacts with customers have been over the Internet -- "up from zip a few years ago."
But the can-do spirit he sees as dominating the decade cannot obscure the battle lines that stretch into the future, running between "the high-tech and the high-touch" approaches to business growth, he said.
Seen from the 1990's, he said, the future belongs to "the firms that get that balance right -- providing high-tech service but also helping people, face-to-face."
To Nicholas Negroponte, the 1990's may turn out to be the decade when both nations and corporations began to go the way of the buggy whip.
Co-founder and director of the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Professor Negroponte is a pioneer in the application of computer technology to everyday life and the author of the 1995 best seller "Being Digital" (Knopf).
In an interview by E-mail, he called the 1990's "the digital decade." From the emergence of the Internet to the Year 2000 computer bug, "it is a decade where the biggest asset is having none."
He explained, "The energy, people, spaces and vehicles needed to move physical things from country to country are suddenly a liability in an age of weightless, sizeless, colorless bits which move at the speed of light."
As he sees it, the bits of electronic information "make the world very small, borders truly meaningless and territory almost irrelevant."
Professor Negroponte also sees the face of the future in the "shockingly high" valuation the stock market is putting on new technology companies with little revenue. It is, he said, "a future that tells us today that we are clueless about who will be our competition."
But while investors may be in for a roller coaster ride, the professor is optimistic: "We're in a decade which is the first hint of people belonging to a single planet. Kids born today will grow up feeling like global citizens way much more than adults do today."
"Children will be the agents of change," he added. "A kid's grasp of the digital world will look and feel genetic."
But it may be the old, not the young, who give the 1990's their defining label, in the view of Richard C. Leone, president of the Century Foundation, formerly the Twentieth Century Fund, a public policy research foundation in Manhattan.
For Mr. Leone, what is "new under the sun" in this decade is the aging of the world's population, thanks to improvements in public health and a dramatic drop in birth rates.
Mr. Leone, the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and former president of the New York Mercantile Exchange, thinks this graying of the population will challenge both government and business.
For government, "the key issue is the same issue we had when the baby boomers were young," he said. "The things that the young and the old need are things that we once tended to supply with public money. But that will be harder in the future," especially for nations that do not yet have a secure social safety net.
For business, the global graying will present big opportunities for those that guess correctly about the aging population's preferences. "With everyone living longer, attitudes about the importance of saving and investment are going to proliferate," he predicted. "Anything to do with aging and the extension of vitality and vigor into one's later years will see dynamic growth."
Bruce Wasserstein, chief executive of Wasserstein Perella Group, thinks the dominant theme of the 1990's has been its volatility.
While Mr. Wasserstein, one of the leading dealmeisters of the last decade, agreed that globalization and technology have left their imprint, he said they came mixed in with "immense frustration and false gods."
"A lot of the foundations here are not as strong as one would think," he added. "There are a lot of false leads."
He pointed to the exuberant bidding for Internet stocks when, "in fact, the Internet may be technologically obsolete." In the course of the same decade, Japan was hailed as a triumph and then collapsed.
More recently, he said people optimistically "assumed a legal system in Russia that doesn't exist." He added, "It is quite a remarkable period."
While Mr. Wasserstein is hopeful that the world has changed for the better, he noted that "if you are in Brazil right now, it may not look that way."
"In many of the emerging markets, the glory of an entire decade has been wiped out in the last few months," he said.
As for Wall Street, the 1990's were the beginning of "the new era of consolidation," he said. With stock and bond offerings sold globally and with mergers valued in the billions, he added, Wall Street is likely to become a place where only about five giant firms will survive. "The problem is, there are about 30 people who think that they are 1 of the 5."
Esther Dyson is a computer industry consultant and venture capitalist and the publisher of Release 1.0, an industry newsletter. For her, the 1990's will go down in history as the decade when the Internet started to be taken for granted.
"A major issue of the decade was that we got wired," she said. "We got connected."
As Ms. Dyson sees it, the advent of the Internet trumps all the other changes the decade has seen. "Globalization, the backlash to globalization, the inevitability of globalization; the diminishing importance of the nation state, the rise of the tribe, on the one hand, and the corporation on the other -- the Internet makes a difference to all of those," she said. "Those changes are, in one sense, being pushed by the Internet."
While people always learn and adopt new technologies more slowly than cyberspace pioneers expect, Ms. Dyson thinks the Internet has unleashed wholly unappreciated changes in society. "The Internet permits people to communicate in a more decentralized way" by using a tool that is far more accessible than, say, a television station or newspaper, she said.
"The personal computer and the Internet put the means of production in the hands of individuals," Ms. Dyson explained. "Businesses are motivated primarily to make a profit, but individuals are motivated by other things, too. I think more people want to do good, and just get ground down. So if you're given a tool to resist that pressure, the world might be very slightly better."
The historian David Hackett Fischer of Brandeis University thinks the 1990's may be the decade when a century-long surge in inflation finally faltered and stopped.
In his book "The Great Wave: Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History" (Oxford University Press, 1996), Professor Fischer suggested that European history has been shaped by four great waves of inflation, the first climaxing in the mid-14th century and the most recent beginning in 1896 and continuing into this decade, with the 1930's a mere pothole in the upward path. It is this last long inflationary wave that may have begun to break in the 1990's.
"We've seen a very deep change in the dynamics of price movements," he said. "This is not the usual flutters, but something more profound."
Professor Fischer attributes this apparent shift to a worldwide decline in the rate of population growth coupled with a decline in military spending after the end of the cold war.
According to him, the transition from inflation to price equilibrium in the past has been a time of severe crisis -- and, indeed, he said, just such a crisis has been unfolding in recent years, with the shattering changes in the former Soviet Union and economic and social strains elsewhere.
Who wins and loses when prices finally stabilize? In the past, Professor Fischer said, the losers have included the world's farmers, as commodity prices fell, and the lending classes, which earned very low interest on their capital. On the other hand, businesses could borrow cheaply, pensioners were more secure and workers' wages stretched further, helping to close the gap between rich and poor.
"We have thought the world's recent troubles were caused by a monetary crisis in Thailand that spread to other nations," he concluded. "But most people have missed the demographic factors entirely. We have to look beyond economics to history and demographics to understand what's happening."

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: ECONOMY & INDUSTRY -- TOBACCO;
Companies Refocus Efforts As the Litigation Cloud Lifts

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
Cigarette makers are starting this year relieved of their biggest financial and legal threat but still not free of the uncertainty that has recently hovered over the industry.
In November, producers and 46 states, including many that had filed lawsuits against the industry to recover health care costs related to smoking, settled those actions in a package worth $206 billion over 25 years. 
 Producers had previously reached similar settlements with the four other states totaling $40 billion over 25 years.
The plans, under which producers also agreed to certain marketing restrictions, such as a ban on tobacco billboards, brought to a close a cycle of litigation that once threatened to bankrupt the industry. But the deals did not satisfy the anti-smoking groups, which wanted stronger measures like Federal regulation of nicotine, and other lawsuits may continue to plague the industry.
"The single biggest litigation threat has receded," said Martin Feldman, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. "But tobacco will remain a difficult social issue, and the residual litigation risk will be of concern to investors."
Mary Aronson, the president of Aronson Washington Research, which advises institutional investors on tobacco litigation risks, said that state lawsuits were just part of a "snowstorm" of legal problems that have fallen on the industry in recent years.
Still continuing are a Justice Department investigation into possible criminal wrongdoing by producers, individual cases brought by smokers and a class-action case, now under way in Miami, that was brought on behalf of all Florida smokers.
There are also assaults from abroad. Nicaragua filed suit in Puerto Rico last month, seeking to recoup the cost of treating sick smokers, and Brazil has threatened to sue as well. Guatemala brought a similar action in Washington last spring.
But such matters, both Ms. Aronson and Mr. Feldman agreed, pose a lesser threat than the state lawsuits did, and industry officials are turning their attention away from the courthouse and back to their businesses.
"The settlement allows the companies to operate in an atmosphere of greater stability," Mr. Feldman said.
The cigarette producers that participated in the plan are the Philip Morris Companies; R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation; Lorillard Tobacco, a unit of the Loews Corporation, and Brown & Williamson Tobacco, which is owned by B.A.T. Industries P.L.C.
The nation's fifth-largest cigarette maker, Liggett & Myers, a subsidiary of the Brooke Group, also joined in, at the 11th hour, and U.S. Tobacco, which is owned by UST Inc., the nation's largest producer of smokeless tobacco, settled with all states except Massachusetts.
Financially, the biggest test for the industry will be the effect of recent price increases on smoking rates. Soon after the signing of the settlement, both Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds increased prices 45 cents a pack at the wholesale level, passing along the settlement's cost to smokers.
Some analysts are speculating that the price increase could reduce cigarette consumption by 6 percent to 8 percent.
Others, like Mr. Feldman, say that while the price increase is not likely to make many smokers quit the habit, it may cause them to reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke each day.
Michael E. Szymanczyk, the chief executive of Philip Morris U.S.A., said in a recent interview that he had little idea how the price increase would affect consumption.
While analysts believe that Philip Morris will continue to consolidate its position as market leader, the biggest winner from the tobacco settlement may be Liggett & Myers.
Unlike its larger competitors, Liggett, as part of a last-minute deal with attorneys general, was essentially given a free ride to participate in the $206 billion settlement plan. The company will not have to contribute to the settlement unless its future sales exceed 1997 levels by 125 percent. And that outcome is all but impossible because the company, just before signing the plan, sold three of its cigarette brands, representing some 14 percent of its sales, to Philip Morris.
As a result, Liggett can raise its prices, too, without feeling any of the pain of having to give up any revenues to the states.
Paul Klemperer, an economist at Oxford University, recently estimated that even if Liggett & Myers loses some sales when it raises its prices, it will still collect an additional $100 million a year, a sum equal to its recent market value.
Investors apparently also see a boom for the company. In late November, when states approved the $206 billion pact, the stock of the Brooke Group, long an industry laggard, shot up nearly 60 percent in a single day's trading.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: ECONOMY & INDUSTRY -- AUTOMOBILES;
Car Makers Predict Strong Sales This Year

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
Global slowdowns in the auto industry have consistently started in the United States, which accounts for nearly a third of worldwide demand. But that pattern, which dates back to the end of World War II, seems to have been broken in the last year as plunging sales in Asia and South America have hurt auto makers around the globe.
The question now is whether sales will stay strong in North America, and whether the European auto market will remain vigorous despite recent hints of weakness, particularly in Germany. 
 Most auto executives are still expressing optimism for 1999. But difficulties in North America or Europe, the world's two biggest markets in terms of sales, would create serious problems for multinational auto makers.
The industry's health is important because highly variable auto sales tend to be a leading indicator of recessions. Auto manufacturing accounts for about 4 percent of economic output in the United States, for instance. The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company are the world's two largest companies in terms of sales and share of global economic output, although the planned acquisition of the Mobil Corporation by Exxon would produce an even bigger company if antitrust regulators do not require the combined enterprise to sell significant parts of their businesses.
For now, auto executives are watching low unemployment rates and low interest rates in Western industrialized countries and concluding that 1999 will be a fairly good year. "If you look at the world today, there are only two areas that look strong, but they happen to be the two biggest," said John F. Smith Jr., the chairman and chief executive of General Motors.
G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler A.G. are predicting a sixth consecutive year of high sales of around 15 million cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans in the United States -- a remarkable streak of level sales in an industry that until the current boom had never managed more than two successive years of roughly identical sales.
Auto executives in Europe are slightly less bullish about 1999 than their American counterparts, though they are not gloomy. "We will see a possible slowdown but we definitely don't see a recession in 1999, as far as the United States and Europe are concerned," said Jurgen E. Schrempp, the German co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler.
But outside the United States and Europe, there is a definite pall. The domestic Japanese auto market has been moribund since 1990. Auto sales in smaller markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America have fallen as much as 70 percent, compelling auto makers to furlough workers and postpone investment plans made as recently as two years ago.
Some analysts worry that the optimism in Detroit may be misplaced, given the troubles overseas. Prosperity at home "gives us the mind-set things haven't changed," said Paul D. Ballew, chief economist at J. D. Power & Associates, the automotive consulting company.
Yet in truth, he added, "we are in the midst of a global slump."
The precise level of worldwide auto sales is hard to calculate because some developing countries provide statistics late, if at all. But auto makers release detailed figures for worldwide auto production, which match up closely with sales. The final worldwide tally is likely to show a 12.8 percent drop in 1998, and a further 1.5 percent decline in 1999, according to estimates by J. D. Power.
The biggest financial damage has been to Japanese and South Korean auto makers, which face weak markets at home and were making the most aggressive efforts to expand in Asia before that region became the epicenter of global currency and economic problems. The Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea has already bought control of the insolvent Kia Motors Corporation, another Korean producer. Now auto makers around the world are following the struggle of the Nissan Motor Company, which was forced in November to negotiate a 100 billion yen ($817 million) loan from the Government-run Japan Development Bank.
Asian auto makers are also suffering because they are strongest in small cars, the segment of the global auto market hurt by an enormous excess of assembly plants. Auto makers around the world have the capacity to build 70 million vehicles a year of all sizes for an international market of 50 million vehicles, and most of the overcapacity is in small cars.
But while small-car factories are being closed or are running shorter hours, factories that produce sport utility vehicles and other light trucks are typically running around the clock and are still unable to keep up with demand. American auto makers own most of the world's sport utility vehicle production capacity, particularly for larger, high-profit models. These models have become very popular in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in foreign markets as gasoline prices have fallen in inflation-adjusted terms.
G.M. and Ford survived in the early 1980's partly because of profits from their international operations, while foreign auto makers used their profits overseas to build up American subsidiaries. But as Asian and South American markets crumble and the European market looks a little shaky, the North American market has turned into a bastion of profits for the auto industry.
"Now the shoe is on the other foot -- North America is carrying virtually everybody else," said William Clay Ford Jr., Ford's chairman. "We are very dependent on North American profits, and particularly our North American truck profits."

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: ECONOMY & INDUSTRY --;
World Economies On a Tightrope

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Last fall, with global financial markets imploding and recession fears rampant, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a group of business forecasters that he had been "looking at the American economy on a day-by-day basis for almost half a century" but had "never seen anything like this."
Not even Mr. Greenspan could have foreseen the chain reaction that began with a currency crisis in tiny Thailand. Who would have thought that stock markets as distant as Moscow, Rio de Janeiro and New York would tumble like dominoes? Or that an avalanche of bankruptcies and the near collapse of the high-flying hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management would follow and credit markets around the world would virtually freeze up? Or that a series of three modest interest-rate reductions by the Fed -- and similar actions by its counterparts abroad -- would restore calm and confidence in a matter of weeks? 
 Predicting the economy's ups and downs has always been tricky.
History is full of famously wrong forecasts, from the economist Irving Fisher's assertions throughout the Depression that recovery was imminent, to Mr. Greenspan's statements two months after the 1990 recession began that chances of a downturn were minimal.
A 25-year study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., concludes that growth estimates for the year ahead typically err by 100 percent or more and that, computer age or no, they have become no more accurate over time.
Last year, when economists were sure a slowdown was in the works, proved a case in point: growth was much faster and inflation and unemployment stayed much lower than predicted.
What now? The economic expansion that began in 1991 is about to become the second-longest since America entered the industrial age in the late 19th century. This alone suggests that the likelihood of recession is rising, but almost no one is predicting one in the foreseeable future. And even economists at J. P. Morgan, one of the few bears, say such a downturn will be "the shortest and mildest recession we've ever had."
In fact, most economists say that this year is going to look the way they thought 1998 would look. Growth is supposed to slow sharply, profits to shrink, inflation to creep up, unemployment to edge up a bit. The Blue Chip consensus of 50 forecasters expects growth to slow to 2.2 percent, compared with 3.7 percent last year, and inflation to accelerate to 2.2 percent from 1.6 percent last year.
Sure, they may be wrong. But that is exactly the kind of soft landing that Mr. Greenspan and other central bankers have been hoping for.
Three forces, economists say, may bring it about: a sluggish world economy, a growing profit squeeze and a less than ebullient stock market. The unsettled global economy should continue to drag down growth in the United States. Merrill Lynch expects growth in the 45 biggest economies to slow to just over 1.25 percent, from 3.5 percent in 1997 and 1.75 percent in 1998.
Asia's economies, which absorb a third of American exports, are likely to keep shrinking, though not as fast as last year -- assuming that Japan will hit bottom. South America, which accounts for one-tenth of American exports, will merely stagnate as long as Brazil doesn't collapse; growth for the continent should be around 1 percent. Mexico, as big a trading partner as South America and struggling with the effects of plunging oil prices, is already slowing. As monetary union begins, Europe will be growing about 2 percent, down from nearly 3 percent last year. Some of the biggest risks from abroad continue to be financial.
Unexpectedly aggressive easing by the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks has reduced but not eliminated the global liquidity squeeze. Even now, AAA-rated corporate bonds are still more than 2 percentage points over Treasury bonds, only slightly below the recent peak spread of 2.25 points.
"While equity markets are roaring ahead, credit markets are still depressed," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "That will slow growth because the marginal borrower is not able to get credit."
A growing pinch on corporate profits, already under way in the last six months, is also likely to retard growth. Per-share operating profits for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are down 3 percent from a year ago. Total corporate profits reported by the Commerce Department are also lower than a year ago.
Profit margins are beginning to erode, and there is no relief in sight. The problem is that incredibly tight labor markets -- unemployment is now 4.4 percent and job growth remains solid -- have been pushing wages up faster than robust productivity gains. Thus, labor costs per unit of output have been rising inexorably. With lots of excess capacity at home and abroad, a result of the 1990's investment boom, most companies are finding it impossible to pass along higher costs to customers.
"There's no pricing power out there in corporate America right now," Mr. Steinberg said.
Finally, the stock market is not likely to give the economy much extra kick, the way it has in recent years. Although stock prices no longer look as outrageously high as they did a year ago, somewhat lowering the risk of a plunge, few forecasters expect American households to keep reaping the huge capital gains that have propelled spending faster than income.
Economists expect these forces to affect individual parts of the economy in various ways. The trade deficit will continue to widen, but, barring another international crisis like last summer's, the deterioration is not likely to be as sharp as it was in the last year, when it shaved 1.5 percentage points from growth. This is in part because slower growth in business and consumer spending means less of a surge in imports.
Capital spending, booming in the first half of last year, has already flattened. Most economists are predicting sluggish growth, but not outright cuts in spending, in the 12 months ahead.
One factor that may cause spending to keep rising is that capital is a bargain right now. "I can buy more," said Ken Matheny, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis.
Government has not contributed much to spending in the last few years, and 1999 will be no exception, despite a small lift from the $500-per-child tax credit and the emergency spending measure passed in October to skirt the spending caps.
Consumers, who have been spending all their income and more, are due to behave in a more restrained manner. They have been on a tear, with car sales stronger last year than at any other time in the last decade. Most economists expect consumer spending to grow about 2.5 percent this year, about half of last year's pace and roughly in line with income growth. One reason is that job growth is apt to slow as the profit picture continues to darken.
But Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, one of the most bullish forecasting groups last year, says consumers will surprise forecasters once more. He says last fall's rash of layoff announcements by Fortune 500 companies has led to an exaggerated sense of how fast the labor market is weakening.
"The hullabaloo about layoffs is ridiculous," Mr. Goldstein said. Most job cuts since 1991 have been by attrition, he added. And first-time claims for unemployment insurance were no higher in December than they were a year earlier.
The red-hot housing market is also set to cool. It is still in great shape, with new construction of single-family homes running at their most rapid pace in 20 years. But few people expect mortgage rates, already the lowest in a generation, to keep falling, so fewer families will be refinancing. And fewer families will be cashing in stock market gains to renovate or trade up. Besides, housing starts have been outpacing family formation for several years.
With all the uncertainties, the only sure thing is that things will not turn out precisely as predicted.
Kenneth J. Arrow, a Nobel laureate in economic science, likes to tell his students the story of a group of statisticians (of which he was one) in the Pentagon during World War II who were responsible for forecasting the number of rainy days in Europe a month ahead of time. At some point, the statisticians concluded that the forecasts were worthless and asked Gen. Henry H. (Hap) Arnold, chief of the Army Air Forces, for permission to stop making them. After a few weeks the following reply came from General Arnold: "The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he has to have them for planning purposes."

Madison Avenue Waltzes to the Beat of the Market Share Drum

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
A year ago, Madison Avenue was asking: Will 1998 be as busy a year for agency and account acquisitions and consolidations as 1996 and 1997 were?
Now, after enduring another frenetic 12 months, Madison Avenue is asking another question: How could anyone have even asked that question? As a result, few are asking the question about 1999; the tumult of the last three years is widely expected to keep on keeping on. 
 "The pace of acquisitions will continue," said Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst who follows advertising for Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. "Some of that stems from the large agencies' need for market share growth that clients alone can't satisfy.
"And if you get market share growth," she added, "that can stave off any uncertainties about what clients will do" about their ad budgets for the new year.
Edward H. Vick, president and chief operating officer at Young & Rubicam Inc. in New York, echoed Ms. Fine. "The consolidation of agencies is not over by any means," he said. "There's no doubt the multinational communications companies will continue to get bigger and stronger."
As mergermania rages, said Edward H. Meyer, chairman, president and chief executive at Grey Advertising in New York, "we're all focusing much more of our attention on marketing services" outside the realm of traditional advertising like direct marketing, sales promotion and media buying.
"We've made three acquisitions in the media business in the last year," Mr. Meyer added, "and we're in there trying to buy whatever is still around."
James Dougherty, advertising industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York, said he agreed that deals in marketing services "and other specialty communications will clearly continue."
That will come, he added, as spending for advertising and marketing campaigns remains relatively strong.
Despite dislocations in local economies, "I think the advertising industry's rolling," Mr. Dougherty said. "While there are some soft pockets, there are no really serious signs that conditions in 1999 will be materially different from 1998."
The primary reason he gave was that "you now have a real engine of growth in the United States," where ad spending is rising at a higher rate than overseas.
"One percent growth in the United States," Mr. Dougherty said, "is worth a lot of Taiwans." America is the world's largest single advertising market.
"Marketers, the guys who make stuff, have already gone through growing profits by lowering costs and saving money," said Alan J. Gottesman, managing director at West End Communications/Consulting in New York.
"Now the way to grow profits has shifted from saving more to earning more," he added, "and the way to earn more is to sell more stuff."
Enter advertising.
"That will drive marketing service companies' revenues over the next couple of years," Mr. Gottesman predicted.
"It's almost like saying, 'The answer is up; what was the question?' " he said, chuckling.
Michael Russell, an advertising industry analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York, listed three reasons he was optimistic about ad spending in the United States.
One is "the continuing thrust from the pharmaceutical industry," he said, to advertise prescription drugs directly to consumers. The second is the growing number of campaigns to discourage smoking that are sponsored by state and Federal governments. The third reason is the rising demand for Internet advertising.
"The Internet is not interesting as a percentage of total ad spending," Mr. Russell said, "because it seems to be 1 percent for every business. But its very growth makes it interesting."
Mr. Vick at Y.& R. said he believed that "the rate at which electronic commerce transactions take place on the Web will triple by the end of next year."
"That's not only because of the technological explosion," he added, "but because people will finally realize their Visa is no less secure on line than at the Gap."
Some anticipate that conditions for the advertising industry will improve further in the final months of 1999 as the year 2000 approaches.
"You'll have an Olympics and a Presidential election in 2000," Mr. Dougherty of Prudential said, both of which stimulate demand for commercial time and ad space, "and the millennium on top of that."
Mr. Meyer at Grey is also bullish on the millennium, predicting that it will generate significant spending in the form of contests, sweepstakes and other promotional pitches.
As for what advertisers will tell consumers about 2000, "the messages will run the gamut," Mr. Meyer said, "from boring seriousness to outrageous mockery."
Hmm. In other words, not unlike advertising before the millennium.

Investors Study Drug Pipelines for the Next Blockbuster Medicine

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
The successful introduction last year of Pfizer Inc.'s Viagra, the impotency pill, delivered huge returns to investors who bought shares in the company. The windfall -- Pfizer's stock zoomed 68 percent in the year -- has encouraged investors to study the current pipelines of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, hoping to spot the next boom drug.
They and analysts alike are betting that at least one of the medications scheduled for introduction this year will also produce impressive gains. 
 Predicting the next blockbuster drug is never easy because pharmaceutical executives are loath to forecast the sales of their wares. But some compounds clearly have a better chance than others of achieving $1 billion in annual sales, the benchmark for a blockbuster drug.
Analysts agree that top-selling drugs share two common traits: they have to be prescribed by more than one type of doctor, ideally a general practitioner and a specialist, and treat an illness that is sorely lacking in new remedies.
Not only was Viagra prescribed by several types of doctors, including urologists and psychiatrists; it was offered in pill form, making it a popular alternative to the invasive shots of other impotency medications.
That formula for a winning drug should work this year as well, but with one major twist. Many of last year's hot new remedies -- Viagra and Detrol, Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc.'s pill for incontinence -- were so-called life style drugs, designed to relieve afflictions that damage self-esteem. This year's top-selling new medications are expected to treat several chronic or life-threatening conditions, including diabetes and organ transplant rejection.
The two most anticipated introductions this year are the Monsanto Company's Celebrex, which Pfizer is helping to market, and Vioxx by Merck & Company. Both drugs will treat the pain and inflammation of arthritis and are expected to be free of the gastrointestinal side effects of other medications.
This market is projected to be enormous, rivaling the $7.4 billion in antidepressant sales. About 13,000 Americans take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs each year, according to Merck. Yet, these drugs are not always safe; according to arthritis experts at Stanford University, they cause 20,000 hospitalizations and 2,600 deaths each year.
While the first product to market usually gets the largest market share -- in this case, that will most likely be Celebrex -- both drugs are expected to record strong sales. Analysts predict that Celebrex will have $3 billion in annual sales and Vioxx $2 billion by 2002.
"The peak sales of these drugs may not happen quickly," said Neil Sweig, a pharmaceuticals analyst with Southeast Research Partners. "It could take four to five years after the drugs are introduced in the United States."
As a supplement to the search for blockbusters, and in an effort to maintain annual earnings gains of 16 percent or more, many pharmaceutical companies are introducing drugs for markets that have been profitable.
Traditionally, the industry's cash machines are ulcer drugs, which can easily bring in annual sales of $1.5 billion or more.
The American Home Products Corporation and Johnson & Johnson are expected to roll out their respective ulcer drugs, Protonix and Aciphex. Even though the ulcer market already has several players, including Astra A.B.'s Prilosec, with $2.3 billion in annual sales, both new entrants are expected to be very successful. Analysts expect Protonix to bring in an annual $400 million in 2002, when Aciphex is expected to have sales of $800 million.
The market for diabetes drugs, which has long been competitive, should be vicious by the end of the year. SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. is expected to release Avandia, a drug that may siphon sales from the three leading medications, Glucophage by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Glucotrol XL by Pfizer and the Warner-Lambert Company's Rezulin.
Analysts expect that Avandia will have annual sales of $755 million and that the sum could be higher if patients decided to switch from the leading medications.
Glaxo Wellcome P.L.C. will introduce Ziagen to treat H.I.V. infection. Analysts expect the drug to have $450 million in annual sales.
American Home Products is set to introduce Rapamune for organ transplant rejection, a use that should generate some $750 million in sales.
The Schering-Plough Corporation and Zonagen, a tiny Texas biotechnology company, are expected to begin marketing Vasomax, a competitor to Pfizer's Viagra.
Unlike Viagra, which analysts predict will have $1 billion in sales during its first year on the market, Vasomax is not expected to surpass $500 million in annual sales during its first four years on the market. But it may usher in this year's crop of drugs to address everything from age spots to facial hair on women.
"We're really just beginning this phase of life style drugs," said Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta Partners, a biopharmaceutical investment research company in New York.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: MARKETS & INVESTING -- COMMODITIES;
Good News for Consumers Is Bad for Many Exporters

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Oil is about $12 a barrel, near its lowest level in 12 years. Copper is 66 cents a pound, its lowest price in 11 years. Aluminum is $1,241 a metric ton, the least expensive it has been in almost five years, and, like other commodities, still falling in price. The major commodity indexes are at or near their lowest levels in more than two decades. And analysts are not predicting a turnaround soon.
That's great for consumers. Gasoline prices, adjusted for inflation, are the lowest they have been since the 1950's. Those low prices are even better than a tax cut at stimulating spending, economists say, and they have been a major contributor to the continuing decline in inflation here and in other developed economies. 
 "No doubt, the collapse of commodity prices provided an important spur to U.S. disinflation," said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. He is forecasting an inflation rate of just 1 percent this year.
But low commodity prices are bad for much of the developing world -- for Russia, Chile, Mexico, Indonesia, Malaysia and Zambia. And they are not so good for some major developed nations, including Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
These countries depend on commodity sales to spur economic growth, and many of them also count on the revenue to pay for a major portion of their government spending. The price declines mean they have less of both.
Russia and Latin America will be especially hard hit. About 60 percent of Russia's export earnings are from oil, natural gas and precious and base metals. And a major portion of the revenue for the Russian budget comes from these sales and taxes on them. In Latin America, 50 percent of Venezuela's government revenue, 30 percent of Mexico's and 25 percent of Ecuador's come from oil.
The collapse in commodity prices since October 1997 has been dramatic and has been one of the major ways the Asian financial crisis, which began in Thailand in July 1997, has spread around the world. The collapse of the economies in Asia, whose people had been major consumers of oil, copper, timber, cotton, textiles and other commodities, sent prices tumbling.
Since the autumn of 1997, prices have plunged 45 percent for oil, 44 percent for natural gas and 30 percent for copper.
"I have no optimism about the demand for industrial commodities in the first half of 1999," said William O'Neill, director of futures research at Merrill Lynch. And, he added, the recovery will be "a long, slow process."
Neal Shear, head of commodities trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, is even more pessimistic. He said that commodity prices will be "in a flat to lower trend" this year. His reason: He does not expect demand to recover.
He thinks the economies in Europe will be flat and growth in the United States will slow, and he adds, "Asia will not recover in 1999."
He also worries that there is a chance commodities may fall further if market psychology leads to the kind of overselling that often occurs when prices are on a long decline.
What also could help delay a recovery in commodity prices is a rebound in the strength of the dollar, which fell 7.1 percent against the German mark and 12.8 percent against the Japanese yen last year. Most of those declines came in the last five months of the year.
Major commodities, like oil, are priced in dollars. This means, for one thing, that when the dollar weakens against the yen, oil prices in yen are lower for the Japanese. If the dollar rebounds, commodity prices are likely to rise for those spending yen and other Asian currencies, slowing the revival of demand in Asia that is ultimately crucial to any commodity rebound.
The cutting of interest rates by the Federal Reserve, in an effort to stabilize financial markets and prevent the American economy from falling into a recession, helped weaken the dollar at the end of last year. The unwinding of special hedge fund trades involving the yen, as investors panicked in the wake of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, also sent the dollar sharply lower against the Japanese currency.
But the dollar has not lost value against all foreign currencies, which means commodity prices will get less of a boost than might be apparent from looking only at the mark and the yen.
The dollar has remained strong against the currencies of two of America's biggest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. Over all, the trade-weighted dollar -- computed by measuring the strength of the American currency in relation to currencies of the country's chief trading partners -- still rose last year. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the trade-weighted dollar was up almost 1 percent through October.
And although most analysts expect further rate cuts by the Fed, some economists expect the dollar to stay at current levels or rally this year. One reason is that the United States will still be attractive to investors because it will be performing well in comparison to the rest of the world.
"The world is full of dollar bears right now," said Karen E. Parker, the currency strategist at Chase Securities. "But the U.S. economy is in a relatively good position. Asia is not recovering, Japan is in a recession and the recovery in Europe is more fragile than some think."
And if that is the case, then a rebound in commodity prices will not get an assist from the dollar.

Foreign Stocks Are Down But Aren't Necessarily Out

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
What good is diversification, anyway?
After years of injury, watching the nation's stocks handily outperform foreign stocks, owners of globally diversified equity portfolios last year suffered the insult of seeing the value of nearly all their investments decline during the summer downturn. When the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 12 percent in the third quarter, stocks in places like Japan, Switzerland and Mexico also fell, offering investors little, if any, downside protection. 
 Last year was not the only year in which diversification seemed to provide little value. Over the last three years, investors whose portfolios contained only United States stocks would have had better returns with less volatility, according to the Frank Russell Company, a Tacoma, Wash., money-management and investment-advisory concern. Those investors would have seen average annual returns of 27 percent through November, compared with gains of 21 percent for people who put a third of their money in a mix of foreign stocks.
Small wonder, then, that a lot of people are questioning the notion of diversification. Many individual investors are already shunning overseas stocks, putting the bulk of their retirement funds in domestic stocks. Even some professional investors are throwing in the towel.
"Financial advisers seem to be abandoning this idea as fast as clients," said Paul O. Solli, managing director of Financial Design Associates, an investment advisory firm in Larkspur, Calif. And some institutional investors, like pension funds, have been slow to rebalance their portfolios by taking money away from the booming domestic market and moving it overseas.
The events of the last year have clearly underscored the limits of diversification. With the domestic markets soaring, despite a few drops along the way, any foreign exposure has tended to reduce the overall returns. "It's the ugly side of diversification," said George U. Sauter, a managing director for the Vanguard Group, the giant mutual fund company. And when a global shock like Russia's bond default occurred, the tremors were felt everywhere.
But proponents of diversification say that the last few years have been atypical. "It's been an exceptionally unusual run in U.S. equities," said Ernest M. Ankrim, the director of portfolio research for the investment management business at Frank Russell.
Even the most troubling aspect of the last few years -- world markets that moved together, defeating the whole purpose of diversification -- may be a short-lived phenomenon, according to David Harding, director of global investments for Nicholas-Applegate, an investment firm based in San Diego. "You have had these periods where there is higher correlation, and they have not lasted," he said. For example, correlations between domestic stocks and their foreign counterparts rose for a while, and then dropped in 1987 and 1993.
Outside the United States, few need convincing that diversification still makes sense. Asian investors who put some of their money in the United States market or some of the European markets clearly benefited.
"If you ask an investor in Singapore, he would reply that it worked," Mr. Harding said.
Diversification also makes sense because no one anywhere knows what the future will bring. While the United States market has lately been the best performer, it is unlikely to keep beating other markets, analysts say. During other periods, foreign stocks have performed better than domestic stocks: Over the 10 years ended Dec. 31, 1992, for instance, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia, Far East index, or EAFE, gained an average of 17.1 percent a year, versus 15.4 percent annual returns for the Wilshire 5000 index, a broad index of the domestic market.
"If you look back in history, there is no one asset that dominates consistently," said Arthur A. Micheletti, the chief economic and investment strategist for Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, a money-management firm in San Mateo, Calif.
When will diversification become popular again among American investors? The probable answer is only after they have watched their solidly domestic portfolios trail foreign stocks -- which strategists say could be sooner rather than later.
"To abandon diversification in this environment," said Mr. Ankrim of Frank Russell, "would be the poorest decision."

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: ECONOMY & INDUSTRY -- THE BUDGET;
How to Spend a Long-Sought Surplus

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In 1997, Congress and the Clinton Administration agreed on a five-year plan to balance the Federal budget.
In 1998, they watched in surprise as the deficit disappeared ahead of schedule and the nation entered what should be a long era of surpluses.
In 1999, Congress and the Administration will debate in earnest for the first time what to do with the fiscal windfall, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates should total $1.55 trillion over the next decade. 
 They can use the money to help shore up the Social Security system. They can use it for tax cuts. They can use it to increase spending on education, health care, the military and other politically popular programs. Or they can use it to pay down the $5.5 trillion national debt accumulated over decades of deficit spending.
But if the options are clear cut, budget politics this year are likely to be more muddled than usual, even if the focus has shifted from the belt-tightening of the deficit years to dividing up the spoils generated by a strong economy and excess tax revenue.
"For the last 18 years the goal of fiscal policy was clear: to reduce the deficit," said Thomas D. Gallagher, a political economist at Lehman Brothers in Washington. "Now there's no clear goal for fiscal policy. This will be the hardest year to anticipate the outcome of the policy debate, and a hard year for the markets to interpret what's going on."
In addition to the usual ideological and interest group politics that shape the debate over tax and spending priorities, both parties will be keeping a close eye on the economy. If growth slows substantially and unemployment rises, Republicans are likely to step up calls for a tax cut to give the economy some fiscal stimulus and Democrats are likely to call for additional spending on unemployment insurance, job retraining and other social programs to help ease the impact of any downturn.
Barring a sharp economic downturn, though, the budget debate will center on Social Security. With the retirement system heading toward insolvency in 2032, according to the latest Government projections, the Administration and Congressional leaders are looking for solutions among a host of ideologically charged and politically sensitive proposals.
At stake is not just Social Security's long-term health, but the budget agenda for 1999. In a move that even Republicans concede was brilliant politics, Mr. Clinton demanded early last year that Congress set aside any surpluses until the nation had dealt with Social Security -- a formulation that stymied Republican efforts to use the surpluses to finance tax cuts.
Democrats, too, have been itching to get at the surplus. After years of being told that social programs had to be curtailed in the interests of bringing down the deficit, they have a long list of priorities that they say deserve more money, especially education, child care and help for people moving off welfare.
Working out agreements that can pass a Republican Congress and win the President's signature would be difficult enough, given the ideological difference between the parties. Reaching bipartisan deals in the aftermath of impeachment proceedings will be even trickier.
"In the end, you have to find a way to accommodate both sets of goals, or neither gets done," said Philip D. Moseley, a former Republican chief of staff for the House Ways and Means Committee who is now a partner at Ernst & Young. "It's going to take some accommodation. What I don't know is whether the political situation will allow for that."
If Republicans succeed in freeing up some of the surplus for a big tax reduction, they will face a fight among themselves about what kind of cut to pursue. Social conservatives want to concentrate on tax cuts for families, and have put at the top of their list a reduction in the so-called marriage penalty. Economic conservatives are pressing for an across-the-board cut in income tax rates. In recent years the social conservatives have prevailed.
Mr. Clinton has left open the possibility that he could support a tax cut once Social Security's problems are solved. But when asked about uses for the surplus, Mr. Clinton's advisers have, in the last several months, emphasized the need to also shore up Medicare, the health insurance system for the elderly.
Given all the crosscurrents at play, Mr. Gallagher of Lehman Brothers said he could see four possible developments. First is what he calls "the big deal," in which the two parties agree on Social Security and tax cuts.
Second would be an outcome similar to 1998, in which the two parties stalemate, spending a bit of the surplus, but basically allowing it by default to go to reducing the national debt.
The third of his outcomes is no Social Security deal, but a modest budget package, including some additional spending plus some reduction in the marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that leads many two-income couples to pay more in taxes than single people with the same incomes.
And fourth is a sizable tax cut independent of a Social Security overhaul -- an outcome that would be likely only if the economy turned down sharply.
There are some signs that the two parties may be able to reach a compromise on Social Security. But any bipartisanship on that front could be more than offset by lingering effects from the impeachment proceedings. And if the two parties are unable to reach some accommodation on fiscal issues this year, they will have to wait until after the Presidential race of 2000, which both sides think could hinge on what priorities the nation wants to set for the new era of fiscal plenty.

5 Problems Tarnishing a Robust Economy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
It might seem churlish to find fault with a best-in-a-generation economy. Unemployment and inflation rates are at record lows, and low-paid workers are, for the first time in decades, receiving wage increases that outpace price increases. But despite the benefits of a temporarily buoyant economy, deep-seated problems remain.
Frank Levy, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, notes that the best time to tackle problems is when the economy is flush. He points to increasing inequality at a time of stagnating wages in his new book, "The New Dollars and Dreams" (Russell Sage Foundation, 1998). Borrowing a phrase from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Mr. Levy warns against "defining deviancy down -- accepting economic outcomes as normal today that would have been seen as pathological 10 or 20 years ago." 
 The new year is traditionally the time for making lists. So here are five profound problems facing the American economy:
INCOME INEQUALITY -- A study by Sheldon Danziger of the University of Michigan shows that from 1969 to 1997, when the earnings of college graduates rose briskly, the inflation-adjusted median earnings of white male high school graduates 25 to 34 fell nearly 30 percent. An economy that was supposed to lift everyone to new highs of income and consumption instead pushed the least skilled workers down.
Professor Danziger points to a stunning statistic: the earnings of these less skilled white workers fell so far that they earned less in 1997 than their black counterparts, a notoriously underpaid group, had earned almost 30 years earlier. And those black male high school graduates fared almost as badly. From 1969 to 1997, their inflation-adjusted earnings fell 25 percent.
Mr. Levy's data show that the richest one-half of 1 percent of American taxpayers account for about 11 percent of aggregate income, and about 5 percent of households take home 20 percent of total income. The share of income captured by the bottom 60 percent of households is falling. Only college graduates, about a quarter of the work force, are racking up significant wage gains.
There is substantial evidence that the nature of technology in an information-intensive era is stacked in favor of workers with college-level verbal and math skills. That leaves at least half the work force behind.
The United States, the richest country in history, has a fifth of its children in poverty. That this has taken place when the national unemployment rate hovers around 4.4 percent raises the question: What will happen when the next recession strikes?
WEALTH INEQUALITY -- The only sure way for a country to grow and prosper is for its citizens to save and invest, in education, highways, research, machinery and other wealth-creating activities. But data from Edward N. Wolff of New York University show a country where few people save. That leaves them with skimpy bank accounts and meager holdings of stocks, bonds, real estate or other forms of wealth.
Nearly 20 percent of American households, Professor Wolff contends, possess no net wealth (the value of their liabilities, like mortgage debt, offsets the value of assets) or negative net wealth (their liabilities exceed their assets). The bottom 40 percent of households control a meager two-tenths of a percent of total wealth. By contrast, the wealthiest 1 percent of households control nearly 40 percent of the total wealth.
The picture looks even grimmer if the value of housing -- a form of wealth that cannot be bought and sold quickly and is, therefore, largely unavailable for solving many financial emergencies -- is subtracted from the calculations. By this measure, the bottom 40 percent of families have more debt than assets. And from 1983 to 1995, the poorest 40 percent of households lost 80 percent of their wealth, while the wealthiest 1 percent of households gained 17 percent.
Members of minority groups did much worse. In 1995, Mr. Wolff reports, for example, the typical black household held only 12 percent as much wealth as the typical white household. Subtract housing, and that figure falls to 1 percent. More than 30 percent of black households, but only about 15 percent of white households, have no net worth.
SLUGGISH PRODUCTIVITY -- Over the long sweep of history, wages rise only about as fast as productivity -- the value of output per hour of work by all workers. If productivity rises by, say, 3 percent a year, employers can raise wages by 3 percent without sacrificing any profit. But if wages rise faster, workers' extra income can only come out of payments that would otherwise go to investors and creditors, a process that cannot continue indefinitely.
During the halcyon days of the 1950's and 1960's, productivity rose by an average of 3 percent a year. At that rate, wages could double in 20 years or so. But since the 1970's, productivity has been crawling along at a 1 percent annual clip, taking about three times as long to double. The productivity numbers have improved recently, but there is scant evidence that the new numbers will be permanent.
It is one thing for an economy, as is currently the case, to operate close to capacity, thereby reducing unemployment and driving up employment and wages. But to keep wages rising thereafter requires harnessing technology to expand the economy's productive capacity.
On this score, the lessons of history are sobering. For much of the last 100 or so years, productivity has been rising at the seemingly slow pace of about 2 percent. The fast pace of the 1950's and 1960's was anomalous. At the very least, it would take stiff increases in savings and corporate investment to return the economy to fast growth, but, according to Mr. Wolff's data, Americans appear unconvinced that they need to make such sacrifices.
EDUCATION GAP -- Investing in training and education is a possible cure for sluggish productivity and rising inequality. Indeed, the hiring practices of employers increasingly reward employees with college-level verbal and math skills, a trend caused by skill-biased technology. In 1978, male college graduates 25 to 34 earned about 15 percent more than recent high school graduates. Now the gap is about 50 percent.
Yet college and, therefore, access to high-income jobs remain beyond the reach of many families. In 1992, about 40 percent of high school seniors from the 25 percent poorest families did not enroll in post-secondary education. By contrast, only 10 percent of students from the 25 percent richest families failed to enroll in college or other post-secondary education.
Employers are turning increasingly to college-educated workers. Over the last 20 years, the number of full-time workers who are college graduates has risen from about 20 percent to almost 30 percent. Many unskilled male workers have become so discouraged that they have dropped out of the labor force, increasing the fraction of nonworking male high school dropouts from about 25 percent in 1975 to 35 percent in 1995. The current employment rate of high school dropouts, 40 percent, is only about half that of college graduates.
Given the huge earnings increase associated with college attendance, it is no surprise that college enrollments are rising. About 65 percent of whites in this country now acquire some college education. But black attendance rates are about 10 percentage points lower. Hispanic students are about four times as likely to drop out of high school as are whites.
The obvious explanation for these wide gaps in college attendance -- the ability of the family to cover tuition and living expenses -- may not be accurate. James Heckman of the University of Chicago argues that the income of parents at the time their children leave high school has less impact on the decision to attend college than do long-term factors, such as the economic and social circumstances of the family when the child was young. The time to intervene, Professor Heckman argues, is early in a child's life.
TATTERED SAFETY BLANKET -- Millions of adults have dropped out of the labor force because they cannot afford to replace their Government-paid health insurance with a private policy. Nor can they afford day care for their young children. The percentage of the population without health insurance has risen to about 16 percent and is nudging higher. An ominous trend is that workers are increasingly turning down offers by employers for insurance.
The economy has turned quickly and viciously against unskilled workers, leaving many of their families adrift. Fifty years ago, low-paid workers could seek their fortunes by migrating out of Southern agricultural areas and into Northern manufacturing cities. Today, escape routes are far more difficult to find. As Mr. Levy of M.I.T. notes, "getting an education is harder than getting on a bus."

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: ECONOMY & INDUSTRY -- BAILOUTS;
U.S Role as World Savior: A Delicate Balancing Act

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Markets and governments around the world operated under an unshakable assumption throughout the economic turmoil last year: if things really got bad, the United States would be there to engineer a bailout.
After all, as everyone from President Clinton to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin kept declaring, the future of the United States was inextricably linked to the fate of the troubled emerging economies. 
 That was how Washington justified its $5 billion commitment to the bailout of South Korea led by the International Monetary Fund. It was why the Treasury persuaded America's allies to pony up $17 billion in additional aid for Russia in July -- money that failed to stabilize the country but that made it a lot easier for some rich oligarchs to convert their fast-falling rubles into dollars, which were immediately parked in Europe. And it was the justification for the American commitment to aid Brazil, an effort whose success is still an open question.
But the unstated assumption that the United States will always be ready to step in is a risky one. The failure of the Russian bailout was a searing experience, opening the Clinton Administration to the criticism that it had wasted billions on a government that was never as committed to change and capitalism as Mr. Clinton contended. And if the instability around the world continues, a likely bet in the minds of many in the Administration, the question of whether America should serve as the savior of last resort seems likely to come under increasing scrutiny from all sides.
"Russia was the turning point," conceded one senior Administration official who has been an advocate of aggressive economic intervention by Washington. "When it went bad, and it became clear that the U.S. and its allies were not about to pour more money into the place, it led to the two scariest months we have seen in markets around the world."
And yet, the official noted, "the political tolerance for continued American contributions, particularly in countries that are resisting major reform programs, clearly has some limits."
The problem is one of the most complex in modern American foreign policy. On the one hand, the United States feels a mounting obligation to help stabilize the world economy, to act as what Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright calls "the indispensable nation." That urge reached its zenith this fall, when the United States engineered a series of steps to calm world markets, starting with three interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
But many economists still warn of the so-called moral hazard problem: If investors know that Washington and the I.M.F. will ultimately step in to prevent the worst, they will not consider the potential risks of lending their money abroad. And that can distort investment decisions, leading to a flood of money into markets when times seem good -- exactly what happened in Russia -- and a devastating rush to get that money out after investors decide that no amount of outside help will keep the country afloat.
So Washington is caught in the middle, fearful of doing too much or two little. The problem is that American participation in huge bailouts is considered a key to restoring what is gingerly termed "market confidence," building an aura of stability around a country in chaos. The creation of that aura starts with confident-sounding predictions from the Treasury or the I.M.F. that a country is on the right track and that the world's major powers are there to provide support. Such declarations worked quite well for months in Brazil, as the I.M.F. and the Clinton Administration slowly put together a $41.5 billion package of aid -- a package that was meant to signal investors that they should not bet on a falling Brazilian currency because Brazil's allies were ready with a huge war chest to prop it up.
The problem is that the war chest works only if the markets are convinced that the fundamental economic problems are being addressed. In Brazil's case, that means bringing down a huge budget deficit and putting limits on very generous pensions and other social programs that Brazilians had come to expect from their Government. Naturally, politicians balk at such moves. And as the Brazilian Congress has delayed compliance with some of the toughest commitments it made in return for the huge loan, investors are again nervous and money is continuing to flow out of the country.
"It's a balancing act you can only keep up for so long," said Allen Sinai, the chief global economist for Primark Decision Economics, a consulting firm in Boston. "Sooner or later, you have to show that you are willing to make the changes, or even the biggest bailout will not work."
Treasury Secretary Rubin puts it more diplomatically. "These programs work in countries that are willing to internalize the need for change," he said, pointing to places like Thailand and South Korea, where the reforms have come slowly but still seem on track. "Without that commitment, success is limited."
So far, Mr. Rubin has been lucky. Of the big bailouts, only Russia's has blown up in his hands. He tends to view these things with a trader's equanimity, arguing that Russia was a risky but reasonable bet in July, a bet worth taking if a loan from the West gave Russian politicians the time to stabilize their economy, collect taxes and come up with a reasonable budget.
But Russia's Parliament rebelled, and the effort collapsed. Remarkably, there was relatively muted criticism on Capitol Hill, largely because Russia's economic collapse in mid-August led to a market panic around the world. With the stock market plunging in the fall, a reaction to Russia's troubles and fear of a global recession, even the politicians who attacked the 1995 American-led bailout of Mexico kept silent. After all, who wanted to be blamed for fueling the international market chaos at a moment when Boeing was laying off 24,000 workers and farmers throughout the Midwest were suffering because their export markets had collapsed?
But this year could easily be different. The market is back, at least for now, and once again there is a sense, perhaps a false one, that the United States is more insulated from the worst effects of the global chaos than many feared a few months ago. If that remains unchanged, one or two more Russia-like failures may call the American role into question.

Publications Are Trying New Techniques to Win Over Loyal Readers

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
For most newspapers, the numbers game played out in the twice-yearly audited circulation figures has been a losing proposition for the last 14 years. The figures, which are often considered a basic measurement of the industry's economic health, have dwindled more than 10 percent, to slightly more than 56.7 million copies from a peak in 1984 of 63.4 million newspapers.
In the past, the reactions have ranged from a heavy dose of price-cutting to a willingness to exercise unused marketing muscles. But this year a new set of remedies is being readied as some newspapers prepare to sell themselves in different ways and different places on different days. Meanwhile others are enlisting the people in their circulation area as partners in their marketing drives. 
 To find the latter strategy one need only head to New England, to the Blackstone Valley area of Rhode Island. There, The Providence Journal is betting that the devotion of communities to their high school athletes can translate into permanent circulation gains.
The Journal, bought (along with nine television stations) in 1997 by the A. H. Belo Corporation of Dallas for $1.5 billion, is not fiddling around with its pricing. Its cover price has been 50 cents since August 1990. Instead, it is looking for targeted sports coverage to produce targeted circulation gains.
A pilot program last spring to marry sports coverage, marketing and circulation is becoming routine this winter. It gives high school athletic directors a chance to propose which of their athletes should be profiled in articles designed for the editions delivered to the neighborhoods around the school.
Last spring, the newspaper interviewed and profiled the teen-age volleyball or baseball or soccer players every Tuesday and Thursday. Before publication, high school assembly announcements mentioned the upcoming articles. Stores and newspaper boxes in the neighborhood heavily promoted the player profiles. The work was recognized as a largely promotional vehicle; the athletes sign legal releases before participating in the interviews and photo sessions, according to Peter Phipps, the newspaper's deputy managing editor.
Such blending of journalism and marketing has been taboo at many newspapers, but the economic payoff was quick: the pilot program pushed single-copy sales up 7 percent, about 250 copies, according to Michael Dooley, the Journal's circulation director.
And the new readers appear hooked; the paper has held on to those circulation gains, helping stem a long-term decline that has left the Journal with a daily circulation of 167,381 -- down about 24 percent from its daily peak of 219,000 in 1982. This year, the program is being moved to the areas around Pawtucket and Woonsocket in the Blackstone Valley.
The Journal, like many other newspapers, is also working to keep subscriber revenues steady by asking home-delivery subscribers to pay and renew by leaving credit card information on file with the company. The number of subscribers who pay by credit card is still small -- 7,000 out of more than 125,000 subscribers -- but it is more than double the 3,000 of a year ago.
In Phoenix, there is the same kind of credit card push, and the circulation strategies are becoming more complex and computer-dependent. Leon Levitt, the circulation director for The Arizona Republic, said he was trying to make it more attractive for subscribers to renew by using the growing data base of demographic and economic information on its customers.
The Republic wants to use data it gathers on subscribers to decide, for instance, which readers would stay with the paper if their discounted $2.25-a-week offer were continued, and which readers would continue to take the paper even when the introductory offer ends and the $3.80-a-week rate starts. After it kicks in, it may also mean giving away papers to lower-income subscribers for two months to win their loyalty, Mr. Levitt said.
While The Republic is in a market most of Mr. Levitt's peers would envy -- booming with new residents -- its circulation growth has not kept pace with the region's population growth, he said. As of Sept. 30, it was selling an average of 435,330 copies daily and 553,495 on Sundays, down about two-tenths of a percent from the year earlier.
Another option being tried by several newspapers -- including The Republic, which is owned by Central Newspapers Inc., and The Charlotte Observer, owned by Knight Ridder -- is finding new middlemen. Apartment managers take out subscriptions at a discount, and they in turn offer it to tenants as part of the rent. In other programs, customers pay for cable and newspaper service in one bill.
It's a far cry from the bygone days of the newsboy collecting quarters door to door. But John Murray, vice president of circulation marketing for the Newspaper Association of America, points out that the Internet, like television, is creating a generation of news consumers with no habit of paying for the product. This, he said, makes direct payment increasingly problematic. More of the cost, he believes, will be borne by advertisers -- who already provide about three-quarters of the industry's revenue.
The Republic is also refining another strategy, though it is not quite ready to put it into action. Instead of the old trio of subscription options -- Monday through Saturday, Monday through Sunday and Sunday only -- he wants to experiment with have-it-your-day offerings. For someone who does not want to read the paper on Monday or Tuesday but wants the grocery coupons on Wednesday or Thursday or the entertainment news on Friday, why not a Wednesday-Thursday-Friday-Sunday subscription?
"Up till now, we've been in the habit of doing things for our convenience," not the customer's, he said, adding that the key is developing an electronic route list that can change daily and that carriers can download in the predawn hours before they begin their routes. There is even talk, he said, that porch delivery -- as opposed to leaving a paper at curbside -- could be offered for a premium.
Like the days of delivery, the bundle of paper delivered may also be streamlined to suit the customer, he said. "The biggest stopper any salesman gets," Mr. Levitt said, "is people saying they have no time to read. We've been almost our own worst enemy. The product gets bigger and bigger with more bulk, and that's not what people want." Electronic route lists, based on refined subscriber data bases, could shrink the pile of daily inserts. "Advertisers could give inserts for just people with pools or just people who wear glasses," he said.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: INTERNATIONAL -- RUSSIA;
Mustering a Whistle in a Graveyard Economy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin left his sickbed to deliver a surprisingly bullish year-end verdict on Russia's economy. "Russia is on the up," he declared.
Mr. Yeltsin, in fact, is probably the only optimist. From international economists to the Kremlin's own specialists, the prognosis is decidedly grim.
The chief question is not whether Russia will turn the corner this year. It is whether Russia will find some way to muddle through despite a weakening economy or whether the situation will tumble precipitously out of control. 
 This is not just an economic matter. Given its vast store of nuclear material and often poisonous politics, Russia's struggle to establish a stable, pro-market system has powerful implications for the West.
The muddle-through school believes that Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov and his unlikely coalition of Communists and social democrats are far more realistic than their polemics would suggest.
True, they have lauded the idea of state intervention in the economy and mocked the specialists at the International Monetary Fund.
But optimists say the Government team will try to limit the printing of new rubles, contain public spending and do just enough market reform to pry a few billion dollars from the I.M.F. and the World Bank.
The movement toward a market economy will continue, they maintain, but at a slow pace. And Russia will be spared yet another debilitating Government shake-up, like the ones last year that resulted in the ouster of Sergei V. Kiriyenko as prime minister and Anatoly B. Chubais, one of the nation's most prominent economic reformers.
The muddle-through theorists even have a name for this policy: They call it the "Russification of reform."
The darker view foresees hyperinflation, a deepening recession and mounting confusion in the top Government ranks, as financial problems overwhelm Mr. Primakov's untested and ideologically incongruous team.
No one can say for sure how Russia's economy will fare. That will depend mightily on the Government's ability to make unpopular but necessary decisions about the economy and to make them stick.
The failure of the I.M.F., the United States Treasury, most specialists and the news media to foresee Russia's current economic crisis should chasten anyone bold enough to hazard a prediction.
It is sobering, however, to see what a "good year" signifies for Russia's policy makers. The nation's gross domestic product fell almost 6 percent in 1998 and Russia will be fortunate if the decline is no more than 4 percent or 5 percent this year. (The International Monetary Fund projects that economic output will shrink 8.3 percent, and some critics fear the contraction could be as much as 15 percent.)
Inflation, the Russian Government hopes, will hover at 30 percent in 1999. (The I.M.F. is predicting 56 percent and other critics say it could be more.)
The Government says the exchange rate this year will be about 21.5 rubles to the dollar, more or less the rate in late December. Before the currency collapsed in August, the rate was about 6, and few believe that the ruble will not be devalued further.
With a little luck, and some food and other humanitarian aid from the West, the nation will suffer only isolated pockets of hunger. (That, experts say, is a fairly credible expectation, assuming that the assistance reaches those that need it and is not stolen.)
The economic crisis gathered force when foreign and domestic investors began to lose confidence in emerging markets because of the economic turmoil in Asia. That was a huge problem for Russia, because it had financed much of its debt through the sale of Government Treasury securities to foreign investors. Its troubles were compounded by the plunging prices of oil and other natural resources that Russia exports.
The crisis hit average Russians hard. Many people lost their savings when the banking system collapsed. After the Government stopped propping up the ruble in August, the price of imports soared, no small concern considering that the goods most desired by Russian consumers are made abroad.
Since many Russians are owed months of back wages, the devaluation of the nation's currency means that the wages they will eventually receive will be worth only a fraction of what they expected.
Real incomes dropped 15.6 percent last year, according to Government statistics. The Kremlin's sanguine view is that real income will continue to drop by 7.5 percent this year and then rise in 2000, a presidential election year.
There has not been any sustained period of economic growth since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. And as the Government tells it, growth is always just around the corner.
There is no easy explanation for the Russians' ability to grin and bear it. But the question is a vital one -- especially for those who are worried where the economy is headed.
Russians appear to have become accustomed to many of the material benefits of a freer economy even as they have become disillusioned with Russia's corrupt version of market reform. Russia may not be moving boldly to carry out economic changes, but at least it has not been moving backward.
Nor have the nation's financial elite been dislodged by the economic crisis. The so-called oligarchs who dominate the nation's energy, banking, natural resources and media industries are mostly still in place, though they are not quite as swaggering as they used to be.
The key factors to watch will be President Yeltsin's faltering health, which could open the door to early elections, and a change of economic policy.
Much will also depend on whether the Primakov team has the will to tackle fiscal problems. Mr. Primakov has successfully pressed Parliament to pass important legislation, encouraging foreign investment in Russia's oil industry.
The list of unaccomplished changes, however, is long and includes a new tax code, laws that would allow farmers to buy and sell land and the overhaul of the battered banking system.
Putting the nation's fiscal house in order is also essential. After defaulting on its domestic debt, the Kremlin can no longer finance its deficit by selling Treasury bills.
Printing money is not the answer. The money supply was increased 20 percent after the August crisis, but the Primakov Government understands that it is flirting with hyperinflation if it covers the deficit by running the printing presses at full steam.
Assistance from the I.M.F. and the World Bank would help. But the fund has made it clear that it will not provide more aid until the Government demonstrates its ability to cut spending and collect taxes.
The fund put it accurately, if somewhat inelegantly, in its latest report on the world economy.
Russia, it said, urgently needs a fiscal policy under which most expenditures "would be financed by tax revenue, without resort to arrears, and whose financing would allow inflation to be reasonably well contained, without price controls."

Turning Financial Dialects Into a Common Language

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
Life would be simpler if all companies, whether in Thailand, Tanzania or Tennessee, spoke the same financial language.
But each country now sets its own accounting rules, and what may look like profits at a bank in Kuala Lumpur may turn into losses at a bank in Kansas City with the same numbers but using American accounting rules. 
 The International Accounting Standards Committee, a group of accountants and executives from around the world, has set out to change that. And, after more than two decades of work, the committee is ready to present a core set of 15 universal accounting standards.
This year, world securities regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, will review the proposed rules and decide whether they are strong enough to recommend to all countries. These would not be the first international rules to be devised, but the goal is to have one set that applies worldwide.
"This is the year," said James L. Cochrane, the chief economist at the New York Stock Exchange. "Investors and analysts are crying out for a common language, a common set of accounting principles."
But a growing number of critics, many of them in this country, say that the global rules written by the London-based committee are weak and full of loopholes. The critics, including members of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting rules in the United States, have also raised questions about the inner workings of the committee, which has been holding its meetings in private and has some members with close ties to companies that would follow the rules.
In defense of the proposed international rules, Patricia A. McConnell, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company and the International Accounting Standards Committee's vice chairwoman, said that they "look and smell" like the American rules. "They are far superior to most things you would get outside of the U.S.," she said.
And Trevor S. Harris, a professor of accounting at Columbia University and a consultant for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said that while the United States accounting rules are more detailed, the broad differences between the American and the proposed global rules are small. "In my mind there are few differences that are significant from an investor's point of view," he said. "Sometimes the extra detail does not lead to more informative information."
Many financial experts and executives are clamoring for a worldwide set of accounting rules. They contend that universal rules are necessary in a world where investors regularly struggle to compare companies that operate across several time zones and under very different governments.
Some countries, like South Korea, Poland and Russia, now have few accounting rules or do not enforce the rules they have, leaving executives to decide on their own what investors should and should not know.
While such countries may seem distant enough not to worry most of this nation's investors, even now anyone can go on the Internet and invest in foreign companies in countries that lack well-enforced accounting rules.
Dozens of countries have already adopted existing international rules as an alternative to writing their own, and the World Bank recommends the existing standards as a condition of its loan agreements. But the aim of the new effort is full global standardization.
Global rules have widespread appeal in Europe, where 11 countries are now using a common currency, the euro, but have not yet knitted together their accounting rules.
Many European countries now allow foreign companies wanting to sell stock on their exchanges to use the existing international rules rather than to conform to their own. One of these is Britain, and many companies that would like to sell their stock on the American exchanges have gone to the London Stock Exchange instead.
Mr. Cochrane at the New York Stock Exchange said that many foreign companies now turn away from American markets because they do not want to reconcile their financial statements to United States accounting rules, as required by the S.E.C.
American regulators say they understand the need for having one set of accounting rules, and they have agreed to review the international committee's rules and decide whether to allow their use in this country.
And in a recent speech to the World Congress of Accountants, the president of the World Bank, James D. Wolfensohn, said: "In a world that is growing more and more like a single economic household, it makes no sense to be speaking in different voices. We urgently need a unified global language of business."

90's Mantra: Bull Market To Carry On

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
The economy will probably cool and corporate profits will probably slow, but stocks will stay in the stratosphere. That is the dichotomy that market strategists believe is in store for investors in the United States stock market this year.
This sort of disconnect -- falling profit growth but rising stock prices -- is familiar. After all, it was in the midst of last year's disastrous third quarter, when corporate profits at America's largest companies wound up falling an average of 3.2 percent, that stocks shook off the bear-market blues and started soaring again. The big-capitalization shares that make up both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index took off on Oct. 8 and by the end of the year had risen 18.7 percent and 28.1 percent, respectively, from their lows. 
 For the year, the Dow Jones rose 16.1 percent and the S.& P. returned nearly 26.7 percent. The biggest mover of them all was the Nasdaq composite index, which gained a monumental 39.6 percent, largely on the fortunes of technology stocks like Dell Computer, Intel and Cisco Systems.
Although the market has recovered nicely from its brush with the bear last fall, corporate earnings have not rebounded nearly as much. The final calculations for the fourth quarter will not be tallied until February, but expectations are that full-year earnings for S.& P. 500 companies averaged 5 percent, according to Charles Hill, research director for the First Call Corporation, which tracks earnings estimates. Many analysts and economists are guessing that the rate of growth will be lower this year, an average of 4.2 percent for stocks in the S.& P.
Earnings this tepid are obviously not enough on their own to keep stock prices at or near current levels. But many strategists think stock prices will remain high this year. After all, it is that kind of market: Internet stocks such as Amazon.com and Ebay Inc. have scant earnings, but they are the hottest issues around.
The fact is, something other than earnings has been propelling equity prices for years. Consider this: Earnings for stocks in the S.& P. 500 have been flat since early 1997, but during that time the index has risen nearly 67 percent, to 1,229.23 from 737.01. Since 1995, the S.& P. has almost doubled, while average earnings are expected to have advanced only 28 percent for the period.
The factors other than earnings that have driven stocks to historically high valuations will keep them aloft this year, strategists say. The most significant factors are barrels of cash on the sidelines earmarked for stocks, a continued explosion in the growth of the nation's money supply and more corporate megamergers.
"Astonishingly, after yet another good year in stocks, the outlook going into next year is still pretty favorable," Byron R. Wien, chief domestic investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York, said late last year. "My view is we'll have another up year -- not a 20 percent year, but maybe a 10 percent year" for the S.& P. stocks, he said.
To be sure, most market predictions are barely worth the paper they're printed on. But Mr. Wien has proved fairly prescient on stock movements recently. A year ago he predicted, among other things, that technology stocks would re-emerge as market leaders and that the Dow would roar to 9,000 in the spring, only to fall to 7,000 later in the year. Although he was wrong about the reason for the decline in the Dow -- he thought inflation and rising interest rates would be the culprits -- his numbers were pretty close. The Dow was at 9,211.84 on May 13 and fell to 7,539.07 on Aug. 31.
Mr. Wien thinks stocks will rise again this year for two reasons. One is that central banks around the world are expanding their money supply, and that is usually good for equities. Even more important, "It doesn't look like we're going to have a recession," he said. "The economy didn't do as badly in the third and fourth quarter as everybody thought it would." As a result, he predicts that average earnings of companies in the S.& P. could rise 7 percent this year.
Still, all is not rosy on the economic front. The nation's trade deficit will almost certainly worsen as Asian economies begin to recover and flood American shores with cheap products. Furthermore, the ability of corporations to raise prices in the new deflationary world is nonexistent, a factor that pushes down profit margins.
This is unlikely to change. James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis says that both the supply of goods and the capacity to make them have been growing faster than demand for the last four years. This imbalance cannot go on forever without some unhappy consequences, like plant closings and ensuing layoffs.
In addition, sluggish profit growth is likely to decrease capital spending, which has been the jet propellant behind many stocks recently. And as layoffs rise, consumer confidence may fall, putting pressure on stocks.
But as the bulls correctly point out, stocks have climbed this wall of worry before, and admirably. So another good, if not great, year for stocks may be in the cards.
A big push for stocks will very likely come from the billions of dollars currently sitting on the sidelines waiting to be invested, according to Christine A. Callies, equity strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. She said that the year-over-year growth of assets held in retail money market mutual funds hit 24.8 percent in October, the most recent data available and the highest rate since 1990. "There was one growth rate of 23 percent in 1996, but it's quite rare," Ms. Callies said. "This year, the growth rate really started to sprint over the course of the summer."
Ms. Callies thinks that this money is headed for equities. "Because employment is reasonably good and wages are rising, we doubt that this money is being piled up to support consumer life styles," she said. "This appears to be recycled from other sources and stored there with intent of putting it to use."
Another force that will continue to be positive for stocks is merger mania. Edward M. Kerschner, chief strategist at Paine Webber, expects that record levels of merger and acquisition activity seen in 1998 will extend into 1999. Mr. Kerschner pointed to some factors that would drive deals this year: Mergers will appeal to companies trying to gain economies of scale and scope -- for example, by offering consumers one-stop shopping -- and to those looking to acquire new technology or assets that would be impossible to build quickly. Corporate combinations are also the answer for companies that want to expand internationally, move into higher-margin businesses or respond to deregulation, according to Mr. Kerschner. All in all, a pretty compelling case for lots more mergers and acquisitions.
But while some aspects of the market may look familiar in 1999, there will also be significant differences. For example, index-fund investing may no longer produce results superior to those obtained by seasoned stock pickers.
It may be just a straw in the wind, but according to Lipper Inc., the mutual-fund research firm in Summit, N.J., funds in two of the most popular stock fund categories were beating the return of the S.& P. 500 index during the last months of 1998. From the end of October to mid-December, the average capital appreciation fund gained 8.86 percent and the average growth fund returned 7.69 percent. The S.& P. returned 7.63 percent during the period.
In 1999, the market may shift to reward stock picking over basket picking, a reverse of the trend throughout the decade.
And even though high-priced growth stocks, particularly those in the technology sector, have been the place to be in recent months, more defensive issues might be the favorites this year. Strategists who question the market's ability to make 1999 the fifth consecutive year of double-digit returns suggest that investors focus on high-yielding stocks of good-quality companies, such as utilities, consumer goods manufacturers or integrated oil concerns. With inflation nowhere to be seen and the possibility of future credit loosening by the Federal Reserve Board, shares in these kinds of companies would seem to be a safe but profitable place for investors to stash some cash.

2 Industries Unite to Pave the Way for High-Speed Internet Access

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Anyone who has used the Internet at both work and home knows that those are vastly different experiences. Whatever the metaphor they choose -- jack rabbit and tortoise, water and molasses, heaven and hell -- most people who access the Net from home via dial-up modems miss a big part of what cyberspace ought to be all about: high-speed, low-hassle access to text, graphics, audio and video.
The problem, of course, is that typical modems are simply not able to do the Internet full justice. And most consumers have no other economically realistic options for connecting. 
 But if the telecommunications and cable television industries have their way, that will start to change in a big way this year, beginning a process that could bring quick Internet connections from the office to the living room just as Henry Ford brought the automobile from the mansion to the middle class.
Coupled with the advent of truly low-cost personal computers, the mass deployment of cheap, reliable, high-speed Internet links for residential consumers could have an impact as deep as Ford's. After all, it was not until cars became less of a novelty for the rich than a necessity for the rest that it made sense to actually pave roads.
Likewise, the broad availability of high-speed cyberspace connections could foster the development of new sorts of applications that make today's Internet look like a rutted cart path.
That, at least, is the bet that many of the nation's largest telephone and cable television companies have made or are getting ready to make. And 1999 will probably be the year that those two industries, with their vastly different financial, regulatory and cultural dimensions, join their battle to control the future of how the nation's consumers enter cyberspace.
"This is the biggest single opportunity that exists in all of communications," said Howard Anderson, the managing director of the Yankee Group, a high-technology consulting firm in Boston. "It will get very serious and this, 1999, is the year that we will see competition."
The cable television and telephone industries are trying to use radically different technologies to deliver huge amounts of data to homes, but the financial opportunity for each of them is impressive.
Even the most aggressive projections peg the number of homes that had high-speed Internet access at the end of last year at something less than 750,000 (a vast majority of those using cable modems rather than the telephone technology known as asymmetric digital subscriber line, or A.D.S.L.)
Over all, somewhere around 45 percent of the nation's 100 million homes have computers, and only about half of those, or around 22.5 million, are on line at all.
U S West Inc. has been the most aggressive of the Bell local phone companies in deploying A.D.S.L. technology, planning to sign up as many as 25,000 customers by the end of last year. Michael Rouleau, a U S West vice president for marketing, estimated that about 10 percent of cyberspace-using homes would pay extra for high-speed access.
Thomas A. Jermoluk, the chairman of the At Home Corporation, the cable-modem venture backed by many of the nation's large cable system operators, said his company's business plan was to win 20 percent of any given market's on-line homes as customers after four years.
Split the difference at 15 percent and the potential market today -- at $40 a month a home, which is roughly what both the telephone and cable companies are charging -- comes to about $1.6 billion. In the communications world, that is not a large number.
Mr. Anderson of the Yankee Group, however, believes that fully half of the on-line homes would pay $40 a month for high-speed Internet access. If that were true, and if, in a few years, the proportion of United States homes that had computers rose to 60 percent and if the proportion of on-line homes also rose to 60 percent, then the market opportunity would be a much more significant $8.7 billion.
But even that is just the entrance to the potential gold mine. That $40 a month just covers basic access to cyberspace. What the telephone and cable companies may try to do is to leverage that relationship with users to sell them additional services, ranging from E-mail to clothing shopping to video games.
Of course, standing in the way of such incremental revenue are some very daunting fixed costs. It generally takes around $700 to upgrade each phone or cable line to provide high-speed data access. (Additional options, like offering Internet-based phone service over a cable line, cost even more.)
So, for instance, because At Home's affiliates serve about 60 million customers, Mr. Jermoluk said, it would cost a staggering $42 billion to get all of them on line using cable modems. And so the deployment goes slowly.
Other than competition between each other, however, the biggest force pushing the cable and telephone companies to deploy high-speed data systems may not be consumers, but the computer industry.
In this day of 450-megahertz processors and video cards with as many transistors as Pentium chips, the biggest bottleneck in the computer system is the link to other computers. If the connections do not increase in speed, the prospect of buying a new computer every year or two becomes less compelling.
That is why companies like Compaq Computer and Microsoft are perhaps more eager for widespread high-speed data connections than even the most intense Internet surfer. For the local phone and cable companies, the Internet is the future. For the computer companies, it is now.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: INTERNATIONAL -- TRAVEL;
Price Rises Ahead for Road Warriors

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
By the time business travelers fly to their destinations, hop into rental cars, check into hotels and sit down for meals, their trip will most likely cost their employers 5 percent to 7 percent more than it did last year. That is, if they are among the lucky ones who get to travel at all.
While even 5 percent would be almost double the 2.8 percent inflation rate forecast for this year by PricewaterhouseCoopers, corporate travel managers do not seem overly concerned, probably because anywhere within that range would be an improvement over last year's 8 percent rise over 1997 travel costs. And if costs do exceed expectations, corporations are not entirely helpless to rein them in. 
 For example, until the stock market started declining last summer, corporate America had been content to impose travel policies on employees at a measured pace. But by the fall that gradual approach had become a gallop.
A survey of 450 major companies in October by the National Business Travel Association found that 56 percent had cut back on the number of employees who travel and 53 percent had replaced some travel with videoconferencing and teleconferencing. And in the wake of big cutbacks recently announced by manufacturing companies and financial institutions alike, there is every reason to assume that travel costs will not escape corporate belt-tightening.
Meanwhile, a preliminary projection of 1999 business travel costs by American Express expects them to rise an average of 5 percent to 6 percent -- not much higher than the 4.8 percent rise forecast by Runzheimer International, the management consulting firm in Rochester, Wisc., and not much lower than the 7 percent increase forecast by Travel One, the management company based in Mount Laurel, N.J.
But the forecasters agree that all bets are off if, as American Express put it, "current economic turmoil overseas and stock market instability in the United States translates into lower demand for business travel."
A good many road warriors expect to see that lower demand. In a recent survey of 1,348 frequent corporate travelers, compiled for Business Travel News magazine by Plog Research Inc. of Reseda, Calif., 49 percent said that they expected a decrease in company travel this year and 56 percent expected a decrease in the number of travelers.
That survey did not pinpoint where the travelers expect the decreases to come from, although the source of any substantial savings is fairly obvious. Air travel accounts for 42 percent of companies' travel and entertainment budgets, according to American Express, while meals and entertainment account for 22 percent, lodging 21 percent and car rentals 8 percent. Communication and miscellaneous items make up the rest.
Since corporate travel managers know that, in the words of the old adage, the place to go duck hunting is where the ducks are, the most likely target for cutting costs -- on paper, at least -- is air fares. Yet corporate travel managers do not expect air fares to fall this year, although they disagree about how much they are likely to increase.
Runzheimer, for example, expects overall fares to rise an average of 5.1 percent, but about 10 percent on the hundreds of routes without nonstop competition. American Express has forecast an average fare increase of 4 percent to 5 percent, while Travel One expects domestic fares to jump a whopping 9 percent. It reasons that airlines are in no big hurry to expand capacity even though the number of passengers remains at record high levels, and that except for Southwest Airlines and Pro Air in Detroit, low-cost competitors have had little impact on business fares.
If the forecasters are right, business fares to Europe will increase about 6 percent, while fares to Asia and the Pacific region may rise as much as 5 percent. While 5 percent is not out of line with historic trans-Pacific fare increases, travel management companies say any such rise this year will seem much higher in view of the fact that just a few months ago some struggling Asian airlines were practically giving away trans-Pacific tickets (many of which were bought by American companies with business in Asia).
"Most of the major airlines in the Asia-Pacific region survived the 1998 economic crisis by restructuring routes and re-examining capital expenditures to decrease operating expenses," said Clint Cable, general manager of that region for Rosenbluth International, the Philadelphia travel management company.
The forecasters expect car rental prices to rise between 5 percent and 8 percent, the result of a combination of higher rates, insurance, airport fees and surtaxes imposed by cities; for example, Houston's average surcharge for midsized car rentals has risen 24 percent since 1997, according to American Express. And according to Michael Boult, director of supplier relations for Rosenbluth, "Car rental is also a convenient target for higher Federal, state and local taxes."
The only break business travelers can count on are in restaurant prices, which none of the forecasters expect to rise more than about 2.5 percent. But given the large percentage of travel budgets spent on meals and entertainment, corporations are still paying close attention. Most of this scrutiny is in the form of spending limits, but some companies are going beyond that. One major Midwestern company, for example, not only scrutinizes the entertainment portion of expense accounts, but occasionally contacts guests whose names appear on expense accounts -- ostensibly to inquire if they found the food and service satisfactory.
Hotel rates have been climbing for several years and show no signs of stopping or even slowing down. PricewaterhouseCoopers projects a 3.9 percent increase, to $81.77 a night, an average that includes budget and economy motels. For business travelers, though, American Express forecasts a jump of 7 percent to 10 percent in the top 25 business cities, while Runzheimer expects rates in downtown hotels will rise about 12 percent.
Moreover, New York's room rate has averaged $245 for several months, 15 percent higher than in 1997, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, while a standard room at a luxury New York hotel has ranged between $350 and $700 a night.
Sky-high room rates and sky-high occupancies are also pretty much the outlook for 1999 in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington and other major cities.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: ECONOMY & INDUSTRY -- MERGERS;
After $2.5 Trillion in Combinations in 1998, the Sky's the Limit in 1999

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
You would think that after last year's more than $2.5 trillion in announced mergers worldwide -- the largest on record -- corporate executives might take 1999 off. Think again.
With the stock market for the most part continuing its upward march, investors can expect even more mergers in the next 12 months. But unlike last year, when mergers were concentrated primarily in the telecommunications, banking and insurance industries, the frenzy this year will spread to other industries as well, merger professionals say. Even more international combinations are expected in the months ahead, along with a shift in activity to include industrial companies as well as increased activity in the burgeoning high-technology industry. 
 "If you assume a reasonably stable market environment for a good part of the year, it will be good for the merger market," said Stephen R. Volk, a senior partner at the New York law firm of Shearman & Sterling. "Chief executive confidence is quite high now, and it is a major predictor of deals getting done."
Most of what has driven the megamerger boom in the United States is the effort by corporations to fend off competition from larger rivals by combining. As a result, regional companies will continue to turn their attention away from their home market in the hopes of quickly establishing a national, if not international, presence.
"Timing becomes important," said Steven B. Wolitzer, head of global mergers and acquisitions at Lehman Brothers. "The ability to build your business first becomes important to really create the winners. It's a mad scramble to get there quickly."
Witness the flurry of activity after Nationsbank bought and assumed the name of BankAmerica in a $60 billion stock deal or after SBC Communications announced its intent to acquire Ameritech for $62 billion in stock, a deal the Federal Communications Commission is reviewing. Investors can expect even more activity, particularly in pharmaceuticals, health care, utilities and energy -- the latter recently evidenced by the planned merger of Exxon and Mobil.
"One of our themes has been the everyday nature of this activity," said Mac Heller, co-chief operating officer of the investment banking division and head of global mergers and acquisitions at Goldman, Sachs. "Yes, the numbers are spectacular, but it is no more spectacular to have a $70 billion deal in 1998 than it was to have a $10 billion deal in 1984."
More United States executives are expected to turn their attention to foreign concerns. That's in part because more European companies have set their sights on America, as well as on their next-door neighbors, in an effort to extend beyond national borders -- a trend that will only grow as Europe moves closer to a common market. A unified Europe "requires companies to look at themselves and become larger and more competitive," said John Studzinski, head of European investment banking at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "There will be more profound consolidation in the midsize sector."
The courtship has already begun, for companies of all sizes.
There has been a spate of recently announced pharmaceutical combinations in Europe, including the $35 billion planned acquisition of Astra of Sweden by the London-based Zeneca Group, and the agreement to combine the drug and agricultural units of Hoechst of Germany and Rhone-Poulenc of France.
And while European companies have always been attracted to United States targets, they are finally going after them in a big way. In December for instance, Scottish Power announced its intent to acquire Pacificorp, which operates in the Pacific Northwest and is one of the country's biggest power companies, for $7.9 billion. If approved, it would be the first purchase of a United States utility by a foreign company. And Deutsche Bank said it would buy Bankers Trust for $10.1 billion.
Such cross-border combinations will be anything but easy to pull off as companies grapple with inconsistent accounting, legal and regulatory rules in the home countries. And there are sure to be social and political ramifications as foreign workers and their bosses alike become accustomed to the American-style corporate reorganizations of the 1980's, which turned many companies into leaner operations -- but only after major cost-cutting and huge layoffs.
Technology will continue to be an active area for mergers, too, but these combinations present their own complications, industry experts say. For one thing, technology stocks are quite volatile, and anyone seeking a merger partner is subject to unpredictable downside risk because of the often short life span of technology products. That is why activity in the industry has mostly consisted of weaker companies being acquired by stronger concerns. This is likely to change as the industry matures.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: MARKETS & INVESTING;
After 4 Years of Optimism, Not Giving Up Now

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Abby Joseph Cohen did not flinch in August when the stock market sank. Instead, Ms. Cohen, the chief investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, telephoned her clients and told them the same thing she told them a year earlier when the market seemed to be in free fall: "Stay the course."
It has become a familiar refrain for Ms. Cohen, who has remained steadfast in her bullishness even when others have turned bearish. And what should investors expect this year? 
 "When we do a retrospective of 1999 we'll be saying, 'It wasn't so bad after all,' " she said in a telephone interview late last year. "We see profits continuing to grow in 1999."
After combing through an array of charts and graphs, her statistical crystal ball, Ms. Cohen predicted an unprecedented fifth consecutive year of solid gains for blue-chip stocks, even though profit growth will continue to moderate. By the end of the year, she said, the Dow Jones industrial average could reach 9,850 and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index could climb to 1,275.
Last year, Ms. Cohen said that the Dow, one of the most widely followed market barometers, would end the year at 9,300. (It ended at 9,181.43.) She also predicted that the S.& P. 500, which most index funds track, would finish the year at 1,200. (It ended at 1,229.23.)
She has not been alone in forecasting a prolonged bull market. Edward M. Kerschner, the chief investment strategist at Paine Webber, has also had relatively accurate predictions, bucking the trend toward pessimism when the Asian economic crisis appeared. He, too, was projecting modest gains for stocks this year, noting that the big shift of cash into equities (spurred by baby boomers) could continue for the next 15 years.
Another prescient Wall Street forecaster is Laszlo Birinyi, a former Salomon Brothers technician, who now heads his own research and money management firm in Greenwich, Conn. By following the amount of cash rushing into certain stocks, Mr. Birinyi has been able to discern trends in buying sentiment -- trends that have made him an unrepentant bull, even during sharp downturns.
"We're still very positive," Mr. Birinyi said. "When the market goes down, people continue to buy stocks, you see investors manifesting their views about the future."
Mr. Birinyi, who said the blue chips would continue to lead the rallies, predicted that the Dow would reach 12,000 this year.
For those who see nothing impressive in the actions of these bulls, consider this: almost every other Wall Street strategist has forecast that the sharp increase in stock prices that began in October 1990, with the Dow at 2,365.10, would surely collapse into a bear market. Valuations, they said, were too high. They said it in 1995. 1996. 1997. And 1998.
In late 1997, for example, Barton M. Biggs, the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said: "If this has been a year of moonlight and roses, next year, I expect, is going to be sackcloth and ashes. In other words, the huge brutal hug of a bear market will squeeze some."
The same year Ralph J. Acampora, the widely followed technician at Prudential Securities, predicted a Dow 10,000 by 1998, and then had a change of heart in August, after the Dow passed 9,300, declaring himself a bear and warning that the Dow could fall 20 percent. "It was the toughest call I've ever made, but I didn't flip-flop," Mr. Acampora said. "I market-time -- that's my job. I saved my clients a lot of agony."
In fact, concerns about a global economic crisis caused the Dow to fall 19 percent from its all-time high in August and September, before it roared back in the final quarter.
During the downturn, Ms. Cohen was resolute. She moved swiftly to calm investors' fears, calling the decline a short-term "market event" and not a real threat to the economy or the thriving bull market in equities.
That most strategists would expect a sharp and prolonged downturn is only natural. Few other bull markets have roared so fast for so long. And if one listens to Ms. Cohen, that run is not over yet. "Where our forecast ends, there is no recession in sight," she said. "The U.S. economy is strong. I believe in business cycles; I just don't think this cycle is ending in the next 12 months."
Ms. Cohen said she expected more of the same this year: steady earnings growth, with profits up about 5 percent from a year earlier; a steady economy, and stable interest rates -- a recipe for the strong rise of share prices.
A year ago, Ms. Cohen said that investors should be comforted by the nation's economy, which she likened to a "supertanker": it wasn't the fastest or most colorful ship at sea, but it was the strongest and the steadiest. This year's metaphor? "Supertanker revisited," she said with a chuckle.
Investors will be much more comfortable this year, she contended, having worked off a great deal of anxiety during the downturn in 1998.
How exactly does Ms. Cohen forecast what will happen 3, 6 or 12 months out? Ms. Cohen said she had developed statistical and intellectual models, models that weigh economic trends, cash flows into mutual funds, corporate earnings and other variables that could propel or eventually upset the apple cart.
"The most important thing we do is deciding which of the things we look at are the most important, the critical variable," she said.
Of course, every Wall Street strategist has a model, but Ms. Cohen said she sweated all the details. She creates her own measurement of corporate earnings growth and tries to identify the variables that may eventually undermine her projections.
"What we do is a combination of science and art," she said. "Many investors believe if they only have the numbers they can get all the answers, but there are also critical variables."
Such variables, she says, could include earnings, the global economy, wage growth -- almost any statistic or trend in business and the economy. The real trick, she says, is in learning how to use those details to construct a forecast.
An important and early lesson came when Ms. Cohen was working at the Federal Reserve Board in the 1970's. Some of the best econometricians had devised an enormously successful forecasting model that suddenly did not work. Ms. Cohen helped try to find out why. The reason, she and other staff members later determined, was that the forecast was based on a particular inflationary environment, and when that environment changed, the model failed.
"One of the great lessons I learned is that you can have sophisticated models and they might not work," she said. "I view our work as: Let's try this disciplined scientific approach, and then let's try intellectual approaches as to why it won't work."

AsiaRegains Confidence As Its Stability Returns

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
Like a cyclone victim emerging from a storm cellar to survey the damage, Asia ended 1998 with equal measures of shock and relief. Shock at the enormity of the devastation wrought by the economic crisis; relief that its storm-tossed markets and currencies had finally regained their footing.
"Until now, everyone was stuck with a very gloomy picture," said Neil Saker, the head of economic research at SG Securities in Singapore. 
 But thanks to cuts in interest rates in the United States and the strengthening of the Japanese yen, Mr. Saker said a modicum of confidence had returned to Asia. Stock markets and currencies in Thailand, Korea and Malaysia have risen steadily since October. Even fragile Indonesia has gained ground.
"We've turned the corner and we're in a period of stability, which is the prelude to real recovery," Mr. Saker said.
Of course, Asia could easily falter again. Experts said the blow could come from a number of places: the United States, if its growth slows; Japan, if it cannot revive its moribund economy, or the rest of Asia, if social unrest in Indonesia or Malaysia spreads and scares off returning investors.
Even without fresh shock waves, the region's recovery will be a protracted and painful affair. After predicting that Asia would follow a pattern similar to that of the Mexican currency crisis -- in which that country tumbled abruptly into recession but climbed out just as fast -- most economists and international agencies are now scaling back their expectations.
In recent reports, the World Bank and the International Labor Organization both predicted that most of Asia's economies would barely eke out positive growth this year. The World Bank forecasted that Indonesia's economy would shrink 2.5 percent, on top of an estimated 15.3 percent decline in 1998.
And the supercharged growth that led people to marvel at the "Asian Miracle" may be gone for good. The World Bank projects that after growing at an average annual rate of 6.8 percent between 1991 and 1997, East Asia's four major economies -- Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines -- will grow at an annual rate of just 2.8 percent between 1998 and 2007.
"The consensus is that it will take two to five years for Asia to recover," said Mac Overton, a portfolio manager at MBF Unit Trust here. "If you have a serious injury, it's not like you can go out and play ball the next day."
The challenge for Asian governments will be to pursue disciplined policies during this convalescence. Banks will have to be shut down, corporate assets will have to be sold and millions of workers laid off, all at a time when unemployment has tripled in Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.
The economic stress is already fraying nerves. Indonesia has been riven by clashes between students and soldiers, as well as between Christians and Moslims. In Malaysia, crowds rallied to denounce Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad for ousting and imprisoning his change-minded deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
"If there is no recovery in a year, these social problems will multiply," said Marc Faber, the head of his own investment firm in Hong Kong.
Indonesia may have less time than that. President B. J. Habibie has begun to close unprofitable banks and take over debt-ridden conglomerates. But his hold on power is tenuous at best. Although Mr. Habibie has pledged new elections in the middle of this year, student protesters say he has been irredeemably tainted by his ties to his predecessor, President Suharto, and should step down immediately.
"As an economist, how can you run a restructuring when it is being influenced by the political process?" asked Mari Pangetsu, the executive director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research group in Jakarta.
Although Indonesia's neighbors are in less precarious shape, they, too, face internal pressures that could derail changes. In Korea, the chaebol, the corporate leviathans that dominate the economy, are obdurately resisting efforts to slim down their empires.
The President of South Korea, Kim Dae Jung, recently summoned the leaders of the five top chaebols to his residence, the Blue House, for a curt lecture on the need to reduce their debt and spin off unprofitable operations.
In Thailand, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai is pushing for a bankruptcy law that would allow the Government to begin weeding out insolvent companies. But Mr. Chuan's campaign is being threatened by opposition from "vested interests" in the corporate sector, according to James Stent, the senior executive vice president of the Bank of Asia, Thailand's 11th-largest bank.
Looming above all these stop-and-go efforts is Malaysia, which has chosen a radically different remedy for its ills. Rather than accept the prescriptions of outside agencies like the International Monetary Fund, it has imposed sweeping capital controls on its currency and financial markets.
Economists warn that the controls could sabotage Malaysia's overhaul efforts. For now, though, they are shielding Malaysia from the vagaries of the global economy. Some experts in Kuala Lumpur argue that the economy is even perking up a bit. Outside analysts fear that if Malaysia thrives while the rest of Asia languishes, other countries will follow its example.
"The problem comes if growth doesn't pick up in 1999," said Simon L. Ogus, the managing director of Asian economics at Warburg Dillon Read in Hong Kong. "Then Malaysia may serve as a siren call for other countries."
And there is an even more fundamental debate under way: about where countries should put their emphasis in economic policy. The conventional wisdom here has been that Asian countries must export their way out of recession. Only by selling rubber, palm oil, cars and computer chips to their neighbors -- as well as to the United States and Europe -- could they hope to recover.
But now some economists argue that Asian countries cannot depend on each other or on the West to fuel a recovery. C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, a research organization in Washington, said these countries must first revive demand in their domestic markets. To do that, he said, the governments should increase public spending and relax their monetary policies.
"It looks to me that they're continuing to go downhill," Mr. Bergsten said. "They really have to put a concerted strategy in place."

WithEuro, Europe Reinvents Itself

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
Europe is making history today, but there will not be much time for self-congratulation.
After years of political squabbling, arduous negotiations and painful economic preparation, 11 European nations are opening for business today with a new common currency: the euro. 
 It is a political and economic achievement that seemed impossible and even quixotic as recently as three years ago. Yet suddenly, the euro is here. And in a testimony to the euro's remarkably smooth start, the economic debates within Europe have already moved on to other topics.
Almost no one worries whether the euro can establish its credibility as a strong currency in world markets. Now the big issue is whether the euro will be a bit too strong, so highly valued that it hinders European growth by making exports more expensive.
Similarly, almost nobody fears an imminent resurgence of inflation -- not even the famously austere German central bank, the Bundesbank. Now the debate is whether Europe faces a danger from deflation and declining prices.
Meanwhile, European business is reinventing itself both at home and in the global marketplace. Much of that is a simple response to global competition, but the euro is accelerating the change by bringing Europe closer to the ideal of a single market as big as that of North America.
Led by the stock exchanges in Frankfurt and London, European bourses are moving rapidly toward becoming cross-border equities markets. Corporations, which traditionally financed themselves through their own reserves or through bank loans, are now raising billions in global stock and bond offerings. Junk bonds and American-style leveraged buyouts are on the increase. Banks and insurance companies are searching for mergers and partnerships throughout the world. And Europe's bewildering patchwork of consumer pricing -- where the price of a Volkswagen Golf or a bottle of Chanel perfume can be 25 percent higher in Paris than in Madrid -- is under new challenge as the euro strips away the camouflage of currency differences.
The euro will still seem like a phantom currency to many consumers for some time. The new bills and coins will not enter circulation until Jan. 1, 2002, and companies are allowed to keep doing business in their national currencies until then.
But as an economic entity, the euro is now more real than the German marks or French francs that people keep in their wallets. European monetary policy and interest rates are under the control of the new European Central Bank. And when European finance ministers locked in the exchange rates between their national currencies and the euro on New Year's Eve, the old currencies became nothing more than different ways to print euros.
Beginning today, the securities exchanges in all member countries will conduct their business in euros. All interbank transfers, even those within the same country, will be in euros. Consumers now have the choice of keeping their bank accounts in euros or their national currencies. During the next year, many stores and companies plan to convert credit-card and other electronic transactions into euros.
As Europeans enter this new era, the ground beneath them is shifting. Economists and government officials are much more worried about an economic slowdown this year than they were just six months ago. Having argued somewhat smugly that Europe would be only mildly affected by the financial crises sweeping through Asia, Russia and Latin America, government officials now admit they are troubled.
Most economists have cut their aggregate growth estimates for the 11 countries in Euroland from more than 3 percent to about 2.5 percent or less. In Germany, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the region's economic activity, some economists predict that growth will drop from about 3 percent in 1998 to just 1.7 percent this year.
Manufacturing companies are considerably more pessimistic. German engineering and machine-tool companies have slashed their predictions for export growth from 7 percent to 4 percent. Chemical companies such as BASF and Hoechst are all reeling from lower prices and lower demand, mostly as a result of the problems in Asia.
Much like the United States, Europe is flooded with low-cost imports as a result of currency devaluations from Asia and Latin America. While Europe still has a big trade surplus with the rest of the world, a rising tide of imports is cutting into local growth.
"Together with the U.S., Euroland is turning into the global importer of last resort," wrote Holger Schmieding, European economist for Merrill Lynch in London, in a recent report. He predicts that the shift in trade will reduce Europe's growth by about one-half of a percentage point, and bring it down to about 2 percent this year.
That would not be catastrophic. Most economists expect that the United States, which has grown faster than Europe since the early 1990's, will not do much better.
But even a modest slowdown will put more pressure on the fledgling European Central Bank, with Wim Duisenberg as its president. Formerly the president of the central bank of the Netherlands, Mr. Duisenberg has cast himself as an unflinching hawk on monetary policy whose only interest is preventing inflation.
Long after the Federal Reserve Board began cutting American interest rates last fall, hoping to head off a possible recession, Mr. Duisenberg argued against similar measures in Europe.
But as the signs of a European slowdown continued to multiply, Mr. Duisenberg and his mentors at the Bundesbank changed course and surprised almost everybody last month by cutting nearly all benchmark rates to 3 percent.
It remains to be seen whether that will be enough to shield Europe against the chill winds from Asia or Latin America. But the rate cut is bigger than it looks, because it came on top of even more radical reductions in European countries like Italy, Spain and Ireland, which have traditionally had higher inflation and interest rates.
Because countries adopting the same currency have to have the same general level of inflation and interest rates, central banks in these poorer periphery countries had already slashed their rates to 4 percent from more than 6 percent in the last year.
As a result, baseline interest rates are now mostly at 3 percent from Madrid to Frankfurt for the first time in European history. As recently as a year ago, most economists assumed that this process of convergence would head in the opposite direction, with countries like Germany nudging their rates up to about 4 percent.
The lower interest rates could lead to economic tensions within Europe. For Ireland, Spain and Portugal, which were already growing much more rapidly than their bigger and wealthier neighbors, the latest cuts simply add more rocket fuel to the mixture and could ignite inflationary pressures.
But that hardly settles the matter. With last fall's election victory in Germany by Gerhard Schroder and the Social Democratic Party, most countries in Europe are now controlled by left-of-center governments that are more interested in reducing unemployment than in adhering to orthodox inflation-fighting policy.
Many of those political leaders are hinting at a readiness to run higher budget deficits, especially if European unemployment rises beyond its current level of about 10 percent. If budget deficits do begin to swell, Mr. Duisenberg will be under pressure to counterattack with tighter monetary policy -- an unpopular job.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: ECONOMY & INDUSTRY -- HEALTH CARE;
With a Difficult Road Ahead, H.M.O.'s Are Set for Many More Mergers

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
This is bound to be a better year for the health care industry than 1998, which, to borrow Queen Elizabeth's mournful phrase, was an annus horribilis for some of the nation's biggest insurance, hospital and physician practice companies.
After several years of mediocre earnings, and only small increases in profits last year, many big health maintenance organizations have raised premiums 8 percent to 20 percent this year. 
 The managed-care companies are racing to push their revenue ahead of the growing cost of care, especially for heavily advertised prescription drugs, as well as new surgical equipment and more consultations, tests and referrals to specialists by physicians. Incomes of many types of doctors continued to rise last year, and hospitals, with notable exceptions, thrived.
H.M.O.'s generally set their monthly premium charges based on estimates extrapolated from past experience. Seriously misjudging costs, as several big companies did last year, invites financial trouble; premiums typically cannot be raised again until the following year.
"If the managed-care industry's losses in 1998 are worse than expected, 1999 is unlikely to be a stellar year -- the early 1999 pricing is already locked in," said Arun Kumar, a director of Standard & Poor's. "It will probably be a break-even year, with small profits, if any at all."
And Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said employers might resist H.M.O. price increases now that growth in corporate profits is slowing.
The difficult conditions are likely to be reflected in another round of health care mergers and acquisitions. Aetna Inc. agreed last month to buy the Prudential Health Care unit of the Prudential Insurance Company of America, making Aetna the nation's biggest managed-care company.
"Some recognizable players won't be here in a year -- they will be absorbed by other companies," said Dr. Peter Kongstvedt, a partner in the Washington office of Ernst & Young.
Several of last year's big losers are still not out of the woods. "There are alarming signs of fragility in the corporate health care sector in an otherwise strong economy," said Jeff Goldsmith, an independent consultant based in Charlottesville, Va.
Kaiser Permanente, the nation's biggest H.M.O. company, with nine million members, reported big financial losses for the second consecutive year. (It is, however, projecting a tiny profit in 1999.) Oxford Health Plans, one of the largest H.M.O.'s in the New York region, was also struggling with red ink. And state regulators in New Jersey recently took control of the 194,000-member H.I.P. Health Plan of New Jersey, the troubled unit of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York.
Hospitals, too, have had some rough times. the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, the nation's biggest for-profit hospital chain, was still struggling to shed unprofitable units, regain the confidence of customers and investors, and settle Government charges that fraudulently inflated expenses were charged to Medicare and other Government programs. The Government also joined a lawsuit last year based on similar charges against the Quorum Health Group Inc., another hospital company.
In Pennsylvania, the 13-hospital nonprofit Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation system filed for bankruptcy protection in July. The Tenet Healthcare Corporation, a for-profit hospital chain, agreed to buy eight Allegheny hospitals in Philadelphia.
There was also trouble for companies that bought the practices of physicians. Medpartners Inc., once a high-flying player in physician practice management, left that business, casting doubt on the ability of physician groups to meet Wall Street demands for quarterly earnings growth.
Insurance premiums are again rising more rapidly. And that means employers will be paying more for care, adding to pressure on profits and, potentially, prices.
Consumers who pay for their own care faced especially steep increases in monthly premiums. The alternative was to pray for good health and go without insurance. The pool of uninsured people continued to rise by more than 1 million annually, to 43.1 million in 1997, the latest information available from the Census Bureau. The increase also reflected overall population growth and welfare policies that forced millions of low-income people off state Medicaid rosters.
Economists, while admitting that they often misjudged the strength of the economy, said a general slowdown would swell the ranks of the uninsured and add to pressures on Medicaid, which is a major, if not the largest, item in most state budgets.
Growth in Federal payments for Medicare has also slowed, cutting into a formerly lucrative business for many managed-care companies.
Last year, H.M.O.'s in 30 states announced they were leaving unprofitable Medicare markets, forcing more than 440,000 elderly Americans to scramble to replace their coverage. Mr. Kumar of Standard & Poor's said a "legislative backlash" might try to restrain managed-care companies from exiting certain markets by threatening to blackball them statewide.
On another cost-sensitive front, recent Federal laws are straining the computerized information systems of health plans just as computer problems related to the year 2000 are casting a broad shadow, Dr. Kongstvedt of Ernst & Young said. The H.M.O.'s must computerize their Medicare systems and must also track measures intended to show the quality of care they provide.
"We will know in 1999 whether the health plans and Blue Cross plans will be able to make it past the Year 2000 problems," Dr. Kongstvedt said. If their computer systems cannot distinguish between the new year and 00, meaning 1900, they may have to go to outside contractors for information services.
The H.M.O.'s would also be vulnerable to computer glitches at the Federal Medicare financing agency, state Medicaid programs and managed-care drug companies, and in the records and billing systems of hospitals and doctors.
Adding yet another big uncertainty for managed-care companies, lobbyists for doctors and consumers have pushed through patient protection laws and regulations in most states that the health maintenance organizations contend will raise their costs. Similar proposals are likely to be revived in Congress, where they were blocked last year by lobbyists for the insurance industry.
Health maintenance organizations were manipulated "into doing the job that most other companies have to do for themselves" -- squeezing down expensive services, said Ian Morrison, a health care consultant and senior fellow at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif.
"Now we are going to regulate them and prevent them from doing the things they were supposed to be doing in the first place," Mr. Morrison said.

Companies Prepare for Year 2000

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
For the information technology industry, 1999 will bring back memories of cramming for a final exam.
Companies are spending heavily to avoid the chaos that could be caused around the world if computers, software programs and electronically controlled machinery become confused by the transition to the year 2000. 
 Most of the spending on Y2K, as the industry calls it, will go toward heading off the problems that could come after Jan. 1, 2000. Some companies and government agencies may also be forced to lay out millions of dollars toward recovering from malfunctions this year.
Those unplanned outlays will pop up, Year 2000 consultants predict, because many forward-looking scheduling, purchase order and budget programs will trip up this month, or around April 1, July 1 and Sept. 1, dates when most companies and governments open the books on the fiscal year 2000.
The potential for global trouble stems from the once-common practice of using just two digits to refer to the year in dates, like 99 for 1999. Many computers read 00 as 1900 instead of 2000. Others cannot process 00 in the date field at all and reset their clocks to 1980, the dawn of the personal computer age, or some other date. Some simply freeze.
The year may also be marred by the rollover to 0 this summer of the calendars used in satellites that pinpoint the location of mobile equipment, called global positioning satellites. The satellite network's longest time unit is a week, not a year, and the highest number it recognizes as a valid week will be reached in August. The transition to week 0 could disrupt industries and military systems that use the satellites.
Sept. 9, 1999, is another possible land mine because many computer programs treat a data entry of 9999 as a shorthand for end of file or date unknown. Thus, office clerks, sales representatives and other workers innocently entering orders and other information for Sept. 9 may end up deleting huge amounts of data or causing programs to crash.
The bottom-line question for anyone in the information technology business is how much of the spending on Year 2000 and other problems will come at the expense of other information technology projects.
"We're not expecting the bottom to fall out, but it will be a definite speed bump for many I.T. products," said Louis E. Marcoccio, global director for Year 2000 research at the Gartner Group, an information technology consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.
Estimates of information technology spending tend to vary widely because of differences in sampling techniques and in what is included.
The International Data Corporation, a market research firm based in Framingham, Mass., projects that centralized corporate spending on information technology will decline to just under 2 percent of revenue but that strong growth in other areas, including home offices, will lift total worldwide spending nearly 9.4 percent, to $720.4 billion from $658.6 billion in 1998.
Computer Economics Inc., a smaller research firm based in Carlsbad, Calif., which does not count home offices in its estimates, expects just 3 percent growth, but puts the projected total this year at $987 billion.
And Gartner's Dataquest subsidiary estimates that information technology spending by governments and businesses will climb more than 14 percent from 1998, to about $1.27 trillion.
There is general agreement, though, that the portion of the corporate information technology budget going to solve Year 2000 problems rose rapidly last year and will peak somewhere between 20 percent and 40 percent of information technology spending this year.
A survey by Gartner of 65,000 companies around the world suggests that many of them will meet Year 2000 needs by postponing purchases of new E-mail packages, software that generates data supporting sales programs and similar decision-support applications, investments in new telephone service centers and logistics applications.
Gartner expects large servers to continue to sell well throughout 1999, along with information storage devices, which could benefit from a rush to back up data. Companies in the midst of deploying large enterprise software packages to link and automate many activities may accelerate some investments to beat the Year 2000 deadline. But the slowdown in the growth of new orders for such software, which began last year, should continue for at least several quarters, Gartner said.
Gartner also expects orders for mainframe computers and desktops to weaken, then rebound next year.
Others foresee an even tougher spending climate. "About the only thing we are not seeing postponed for next year is E-commerce," said Kazim S. Isfahani, an analyst at Giga Information Group in Cambridge, Mass., referring to applications that allow companies to do business with suppliers and customers over the Internet. Rapid investment in such software is widely seen as strategically essential, Mr. Isfahani said.
Perhaps the most optimistic view for vendors popped up in a Gallup poll for Computer Reseller News, a trade publication, which concluded that nearly four out of five large companies planned to increase information technology spending to deal with the Year 2000 problem rather than cut back on new investments.
That was probably wishful thinking. Information technology spending accounts for just 2.3 percent of corporate revenue on average, and many companies are budgeting for an increase in that figure. But that does not mean they want to authorize a spending spree just when recession in Asia and other uncertainties threaten growth and profitability. And it would take a huge jump in information technology budgets to keep all new projects on track, given the projections by Gartner and others of the huge share that will go to fix Year 2000 problems.
Cost pressures aside, companies are also reining in new information technology investment because they simply do not have enough skilled managers and technical workers to handle new projects on top of the Year 2000 challenge and the usual load of maintenance.
Others are also worried that new projects could introduce bugs that compromise the reliability of the Year 2000 work they have already completed.
"The trick for vendors will be to single out customers who are ahead of the curve and point out which investments they can safely go ahead with," Mr. Isfahani said.
That could include the early stages of a wide variety of enterprise and E-commerce projects that would not be deployed until the year 2000 or later, agreed Thomas D. Oleson, chief researcher for the corporate advisory service at International Data.
Year 2000 distortions in spending patterns actually began to show up in 1997 in the form of surging orders for enterprise software -- packages that coordinate major business functions. Many customers decided to attack their Year 2000 problem by replacing as many older programs as possible with such packages.
In 1998, though, it became too late to get enterprise software up and running before the year 2000. Growth in new orders -- and stock prices -- slumped for several vendors, including Peoplesoft and J. D. Edwards & Company.
On the other hand, Dell Computer, Compaq Computer and other makers of desktop computers enjoyed stronger-than-expected orders last year from companies upgrading their computer networks as part of Year 2000 preparations. That trend is expected to continue, at least until the last few months of this year.
The Year 2000 impact will be felt most directly, of course, by companies that have made remediation software and services a major part of their business. Many, like Viasoft Inc. of Phoenix and the Alydaar Software Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., saw their stock prices tumble last fall as investors concluded that the best growth prospects of the companies were over.
The real issue, though, will be how successfully these companies respond to the obvious strategic challenge.
Some have already reconfigured the software programs they developed to look for Year 2000 bugs into packages that can be used to verify that repairs have been successful, a market that is likely to boom this year.
Similarly, companies that prospered on outsourced Year 2000 repair work are leveraging those contacts into other technical support deals. Outsourcing relieves the stress on internal experts who are needed to concentrate on final Year 2000 preparations. Outsourcing mundane tasks like the maintenance of existing programs may also help pace-setting companies with the majority of their Year 2000 investment behind them to accelerate other projects later this year.
"People see an opportunity to get a year or two ahead of competitors they think will have trouble with Y2K," said Michael Erbschloe, director of research at Computer Economics. "After diverting so much attention to Y2K, management is hungry for applications that will add to revenue."

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: MARKETS & INVESTING;
As Big Stocks Whiz Along, Hope Exceeds Returns in the Small-Cap Universe

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Conventional wisdom has held that small companies grow faster than big companies, small companies are more nimble than big companies, and over time, small stocks outperform big stocks. But recent experience has cast doubt on how valid these precepts still are.
Stocks of small companies -- those with a market value of $300 million to $1.5 billion -- lagged behind their larger cousins last year for the fifth consecutive year, despite a growing economy and low interest rates. And some professionals are questioning the viability of small stocks as an investment class. 
 "I am not anti-small cap," said Frederick B. Taylor, vice chairman and chief investment officer at the U.S. Trust Company, "but there is no guarantee that small caps will outperform just because they haven't for some time."
There are reasons to be skeptical. Earnings of small-cap companies, which historically have outpaced those of big companies when the economy is expanding, have trailed the earnings of the 100 biggest companies for most of the last five years, according to statistics from Leuthold/Weeden Research, a Minneapolis-based research firm.
It has become clear in the last few years that ready access to credit is a distinct edge large-cap companies have over smaller concerns. And that edge, analysts say, is not likely to disappear anytime soon.
"Access to credit is an even bigger issue today than it used to be," Mr. Taylor said. "The big guys don't have to go to the bank to get it. They can issue their own debt."
Then there is the agility issue. As developments through much of the last two decades have shown, big companies are well aware that they can no longer compete unless they are lean enterprises.
Despite the small-cap track record of the last five years, investors have remained hopeful. From 1992 until the end of 1997, assets in small-cap mutual funds skyrocketed, to $136.1 billion, from $22.1 billion, according to Lipper Inc. Through the end of November, total net assets in small-cap funds fell to $127.2 billion, even as $5.7 billion in new money was added.
Small-cap stocks do have advantages -- and champions. To start with, as a group, they are cheap.
"Small-cap stocks are where all of the bargains are in the market," said Joel Tillinghast, lead portfolio manager of the $9 billion Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund. Compared with big stocks, "relative valuations are as compelling as they have been since I started managing the fund," at the end of December 1989, he added.
The comparison is even better than that, said Satya Pradhuman, director of small-cap research at Merrill Lynch. "Valuations are at a 20-year low, with respect to big stocks," he said. "That suggests the risk levels in small caps currently are probably lower."
Still, Mr. Pradhuman worries that a big dive in major market averages -- which are the exclusive domain of big-cap companies -- would bury small caps. It happened in the third quarter, and could happen again.
Some analysts -- like Claudia E. Mott, director of small-cap research at Prudential Securities -- are hopeful that last summer's steep selloff may have decreased the appetite for big-cap companies.
And, as Mr. Pradhuman suggested, if the past is any guide, recent interest rate cuts by the Fed should also help small-cap stocks.
"Rate cuts have tended to be very good catalysts for the market," Ms. Mott said. "Small- and mid-cap stocks have tended to outperform in periods following rate cuts."
That has not happened yet, however. The Russell 2,000 index fell more than 3 percent last year -- and is 14 percent below its peak in April.
"Until the back is broken on the new Nifty Fifty big-cap stocks, something that almost happened in August and September, small caps won't outperform large caps," said John H. Laporte, manager of T. Rowe Price's $4.7 billion New Horizons and $1.8 billion New America Growth Funds.
Those considering an investment in small-cap stocks should pay close attention to how the group does this month.
"If the small-cap market lags in January, it usually lags for the year," Ms. Mott said. "Since 1926, there have been 16 January's when small caps underperformed big caps. In only three of those years did they end up beating the big caps" for the entire year.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: ECONOMY & INDUSTRY -- TAXES;
I.R.S. Anticipates Year 2000 Well Ahead, Early in 1999

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
For taxpayers, the pesky software flaw known as the Year 2000 problem could cause lots of trouble -- not in the year 2000, but this spring, when the Internal Revenue Service processes 1998 income tax returns.
The problem will be felt a year early at the I.R.S. because the service must, early this year, reprogram all its computers to be ready for next year. Some of these still use technology developed when Dwight D. Eisenhower was in the White House. The I.R.S. must also process 124 million individual tax returns and millions of corporate and other returns so that it will be ready for the year 2000. 
At the same time, I.R.S. executives are trying to reorganize a bureaucracy with 110,000 employees and change its culture from one of deep suspicion of taxpayers to one dedicated to helping them comply with increasingly complex tax laws.
If things go badly, Americans can expect all sorts of foul-ups, like lost tax returns or an occasional anticipated refund check emerging from I.R.S. computers as a demand for millions in additional taxes.
"If there is a bad filing season, it will be the upcoming one, because this is the period when the service has to test whether they are going to be Y2K-compliant," said Michael Murphy, a former senior I.R.S. official who is executive director of the Tax Executives Institute, a Washington organization for corporate tax officials. "If they can't demonstrate it in this filing season, they are going to have difficulties in the next one."
Charles O. Rossotti, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, said, "Our task is like changing the engines in the plane while you are still flying."
In the real world, such a situation would virtually assure a disastrous crash. But Mr. Rossotti said that while he anticipated there would be some unusual and unexpected problems for taxpayers, there should not be many, and only a few people should be affected. "It shouldn't be too bad," he said, "but people need to understand that 1999 really is going to be the risky year for us, not the year 2000."
Among Government agencies that could experience disasters because of Year 2000 problems, none faces a bigger challenge than the I.R.S., which still uses huge reels of magnetic tape, rather than modern disk systems, to store and process data.
Mr. Rossotti likens the main I.R.S. data center in Martinsburg, W. Va., to a living museum of early computer technology.
Today, the Martinsburg center's relics of data-processing past operate in a tenuous electronic marriage with highly complex data bases that are supposed to link each section of the tax code, each regulation, and each schedule of taxes, penalties and interest to the appropriate lines on thousands of different tax forms -- those completed by taxpayers and those used by the I.R.S. to generate notices. A big concern is that with the complications introduced by reprogramming, this marriage might become a communications problem that would thrust taxpayers into a nightmare of bizarre notices and demands or into a void where their information would vanish.
Groups like the National Association of Enrolled Agents have alerted their members to be on the watch for bogus notices and to send them on to its national headquarters in Washington. Joseph Lane, an enrolled agent in Bellevue, Wash., who serves on a national advisory panel for the I.R.S., said, "Tax practitioners are all geared to watch for indications of programming glitches, such as oddball notices saying 'You owe $35 million,' and we have an early warning identification system."
Mr. Lane said he expected few problems, however. "So far as I know, they have done enough systems-acceptability testing."
To process the torrent of tax returns each spring, the I.R.S. operates 10 paper-pushing factories around the country, commonly known as the Pipeline. In these sprawling complexes, clerks open letters, sort the returns, assign numbers to track the documents, enter most of the data from the returns into computers and then review the results for accuracy before deciding which returns need immediate attention and which can be boxed for storage.
The Pipeline is from an era when department stores had wooden floors and charge slips were rolled up and put in metal canisters that were moved by wire-and-pulley systems to clerks on other floors.
In 1985, part of the Pipeline, the I.R.S. Philadelphia Service Center, suffered a breakdown, brought on in part by inadequate computer systems. Some employees ended up shredding some tax returns and putting others in the trash so that they could appear to be meeting work quotas.
Representative Steve R. Horn, Republican of California, has been holding hearings on the Administration's progress in dealing with Year 2000 issues. He gave the Treasury Department, of which the I.R.S. is part, a grade of C in November, up from D-plus 90 days earlier. The I.R.S. was not among 25 individual departments and agencies given report cards, but Mr. Horn singled out the service for praise in its efforts to deal with the problem, saying that Mr. Rossotti, a former computer systems executive, was "an outstanding commissioner who understands this problem better than others in the Administration" and was moving the service to "the cutting edge of technology."
Mr. Rossotti also said that the complex changes Congress had made to the tax code were creating new difficulties for the service's aging computers. He cited new protections for "innocent spouses" as a prime example. "Innocent-spouse relief requires separating the tax liability of spouses," he said, "but our computers are not equipped to deal with proportionate liability."

HEADLINE: Europe's Great Leap of Faith

 BODY:
The euro, the most audacious gamble in the history of currency, has become a reality. What will this crucial step toward unity mean for Europe, the United States and the world? The Op-Ed page asked several experts in economics and observers of European culture to offer their insights.
 
Laura D'Andrea Tyson was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the first Clinton Administration. 
 The euro is good news for the American economy if it fosters political stability and economic growth in Europe. But this benign outcome is by no means certain.
A more dynamic European economy would strengthen European demand for American goods and services and provide more attractive opportunities for American investors. Greater prosperity would enhance Europe's willingness to cooperate with the United States to further liberalize trade with emerging markets and to strengthen multilateral institutions to combat turbulence in global financial markets. More efficient European producers would mean tougher competition and hence better performance by American companies over time.
These gains would far outweigh the expected small rise in United States interest rates as the euro emerges as an alternative reserve currency to the dollar.
But there are more serious risks. The euro's adoption makes it impossible for member nations to use currency adjustments as a way to offset inflation. The new European Central Bank will set a common monetary policy, but its effects will differ from country to country.
Moreover, with a charter providing insulation from national political leaders and specifying inflation as its sole target, the bank has neither the mandate nor the inclination to stimulate growth or moderate cyclical downturns.
In short, the member countries have unilaterally disarmed themselves of important weapons to fight unemployment and recession. This is why many economists like myself remain skeptical about the euro's success while fervently hoping that such skepticism proves unwarranted.
 
Muriel Spark is the author, most recently, of "Reality and Dreams," a novel. She lives in Italy.
 In Italy, where I live, the people are remarkably indifferent to the advent of the euro. They don't really care about united Europe, but rather, cynically, sense a rip-off. It is true that any price changes here never take notice of fractions; they are always rounded up to the next zero.
Far more excited about the euro are the people of Britain, where I come from, even though they have not yet joined the system. They know that international trade will be affected but are waiting to see the extent.
Some years ago, in Chamonix, France, I was waiting in line to change my lire to francs at a bank. The currency prices of all European countries were visible on a big board, changing continually according to the central exchange to which it had a link-up. I got to talking to a man in the line. He said he spent the best part of his day buying and selling currencies from bank to bank.
I got so far as to ask him what his job was.
"Just this," he said, "changing my money."
I inquired if he made a good living. "Excellent," he said, "and you don't pay tax."
I wonder what he will do for a living now?
Everyone is agreed that the euro will be a great convenience for the traveler in Europe. One always needs actual cash. But investment advisers are saying, "Stick to dollars."
The aim of the euro is to further unite Europe. I suppose it will. Europe has for the past 55 years been united for the first time, due to the nuclear deterrent. No commercial advantages, however, could unite different peoples so effectively as language, as in the case of the United States of America and Britain.
 
Robert B. Reich was Secretary of Labor in the first Clinton Administration.
Left-of-center politicians now lead every major Western nation, including most of Europe. So what? Real power is shifting to global businesses, which are merging at a record pace, and to central banks, rapidly consolidating their authority. The euro accelerates both trends.
Jurgen Stark, vice president of the Bundesbank, says the euro presents a "great opportunity for Europe to combine sound monetary and fiscal policy with more flexibility." These are code words.
"Sound monetary policy" means that the new European Central Bank (freed from democratic oversight) will fight inflation, not unemployment.
"Sound fiscal policy" means that public spending, already slashed as the price of admission to the euro club, will stay that way.
"More flexibility" means that a common currency will push employers to cut costs, especially payrolls.
Europeans are willing to go along because these sorts of policies appear to have paid off for the United States. President Clinton's 72 percent popularity rating, impeachment notwithstanding, exactly matches the record percentage of Americans who think our economy is good. It is no coincidence.
What Europeans don't know is that America's economic ebullience rests on a house of cards. It's not "sound" macroeconomics and a "flexible" labor market that have put us in such a good mood. It's a stock market that has soared into the stratosphere, combined with plummeting world commodity prices that have made oil and raw-material imports so cheap that even the Fed has briefly stopped battling inflation.
The Dow Jones could come back to earth with a thud when the frenzy abates. Our ballooning trade imbalance will pop at some point.
Meanwhile, we aren't saving a dime. And when the going gets rough again, we will notice that the gap between rich and poor has widened into a chasm, nobody has job security, and there is no safety net. Even in these frothy times, more of our children are impoverished than before the expansion started, and fewer Americans ever see a doctor.
The euro will surely make Europe more efficient, speeding capital to where it can get the highest return. But the real lesson from America is that people don't move nearly as fast as capital.
Left-of-center governments, here and abroad, used to provide a buffer between the two. Now, capital is running the show everywhere.
 
Michael Portillo is a former British Defense Minister.
European economic and monetary union isn't about economics, but politics: the steady shift of power away from nation-states to an emerging government of Europe. Americans should be concerned because what's likely to result is a Europe that's both less democratic and more anti-American.
At least since biblical times, when Christ held aloft a coin bearing the image of Caesar, it's been understood that whoever controls the currency holds political power. Europe cannot have a single currency and centralized monetary policy without merging all its economic decision-making, including control over government spending and taxation.
The choices that most affect citizens' lives -- the balance among interest rates, growth and unemployment -- will be made by the European Central Bank, which is completely unaccountable. Voters will elect national governments that have given up the power to govern.
European economic policy self-consciously represents an alternative to American laissez-faire. European governments spend and tax heavily, overregulate their labor markets and maintain excessively costly social programs.
Those policies have produced high unemployment, but the architects of the new Europe see them as a humane "third way" between old-style socialism and the supposed divisive social consequences of the American way. By creating a new economic bloc more populous than the United States, the European visionaries hope to protect European inefficiency and bureaucracy against attrition from global competition.
That's not all. Europe is planning to have its own defense and foreign policy too, decided by majority voting among the member states. The United States didn't need the latest Iraq crisis to tell it that a European policy based on consensus isn't going to be pro-American.
 
Martin Feldstein was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan Administration.
European monetary union is likely to put Europe on a path to higher inflation, reversing 20 years of progress. Before the start of the monetary union, good monetary policy in the major European countries reduced inflation to less than 2 percent because of the dominant leadership of Germany's independent and fiercely anti-inflationary central bank. With the euro, Germany's dominance will end and central-bank independence may be dead.
Even when other countries had double-digit inflation back in the 1980's, public sentiment in Germany supported the tough monetary policies needed to keep inflation low. Under the rules adopted then, other European countries had to follow Germany's lead or accept the destabilizing consequences and political embarrassment of currency devaluations.
But in the new order, the making of monetary policy and therefore the determination of inflation passes from individual national central banks to the new European Central Bank where each country has equal weight. Without the tough standard-setting by the German central bank, the process is likely to drift to higher inflation rates. Indeed, some non-German politicians favored monetary union as a way to end Germany's dominance of European monetary policy, in the mistaken hope that an easier monetary policy would have favorable long-term effects on employment and growth.
Leading European politicians are now also calling for political controls over monetary policy, a clear violation of the Maastricht treaty that established the union and an equally clear recipe for higher inflation. Although the new left-of-center Government in Germany supports this move, the higher inflation that results will be very unpopular in a country in which the majority of voters doubted the advisability of abandoning the German mark for the untried euro.
How Germany responds to the conflict caused by rising inflation will be a critical issue in Europe's political future.
 
Diane Johnson is the author, most recently, of "Le Divorce," a novel. She lives in Paris.
 You might suppose that the average European, faced on Jan. 1 with a disconcerting shift to the euro from his local franc or Deutschemark, would be filled with some emotion of elation, exasperation or dread. Just as we've been thinking in dollars since we were born, or in Swiss francs if we were farsighted, a Frenchman's familiar francs and centimes are very central to his consciousness -- plenty of people still think in old francs, the currency before the revaluation in 1960.
Europeans have been warned for some time that life is going to change, that soon enough now (mid-2002) their pockets will be filled with new, unfamiliar, bland-looking Monopoly money. They might be expected to resist this, but instead they seem to be ignoring it. With the Jan. 1 change-over affecting governments and banks, the private citizen, in Paris at least, is paying no attention whatever.
Yes, there's a little kiosk in the bank designed interactively to help you work out your euro situation. No one ever goes near it. Yes, some price tags are now expressed in the two currencies -- the euro price, symbolized by an enigmatic little double-crossed E, is tucked in small print under the "real" price.
But you ignore the euro price because it doesn't mean anything except, deceptively, if you've misread it and think for an instant that you are getting a bargain.
Who can convert centigrade to Fahrenheit? The conversion of francs to euros is not a friendly or easy one either: roughly 6.5 to 1. That is, you thought you had 6,500 francs, but now you only have 1,000 euros.
No one has ever seen a euro, and people have a couple of years before they have to start dealing with the new bills and coins; so they'll think about that problem tomorrow.
Remember the metric system in America, and how they gave people 10 years to get ready for it, optimistically putting up road signs in both miles and kilometers? As Americans did with centiliters, milligrams and meters, Europeans seem to be hoping the euro will just go away.
Some currencies, after all, don't make it. Whatever happened to the E.C.U.?
 
Franco Modigliani won the Nobel prize in economics in 1985 and is a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The introduction of the euro is a crucial step in Europe's courageous march toward political union, which may end forever the deleterious nationalism that has ravaged the Continent for centuries.
Is the union going to last or will it be pulled apart by centrifugal forces? Legally, the treaty does not contemplate secession, but in the end durability will depend in large measure not on the legal binds but on economic performance.
Conventional wisdom holds that success will be measured by the extent to which the euro replaces the dollar as a reserve currency. This is a superficial and even dangerous view. The economic advantages of being a reserve currency are questionable; the danger is that pursuing prestige could result in escalating interest rates, which would prove very damaging for Europe.
The relevant test of economic performance will be the ability to cure the plague of unemployment, currently averaging 10 percent and higher in member countries. There is no developed country outside the euro group with unemployment close to two digits.
There are many causes, but the recent "Economists' Manifesto on Unemployment in the European Union," supported by many leading economists, holds that much of the problem can be traced to misguided and inept economic policies, especially in the monetary area. These missteps resulted in a collapse of investment.
The prospects for improved policies, which had looked rather dismal, have taken a turn for the better with the election of new governments in France and Germany over the last year and a half. At the same time, the European Central Bank has arranged a concerted reduction in interest rates, with its president expressing the hope that the move might help "stimulate investment."
If these recent events are any sign of things to come, we can look with some new hope to a successful and lasting euro.

HEADLINE: The Euro: For U.S., Gains and Losses

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
For the last several years, the Clinton Administration has articulated a simple policy toward the single European currency: Anything that helps build a more prosperous trading partner on the other side of the Atlantic is good for the United States.
"We have everything to gain," Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said, "and little to lose from the success of this momentous project." 
 But that policy masks some complex and unresolved issues for the United States.
If the new currency, the euro, is successful over the long run, it could pose a threat to the dominance of the dollar as the world's primary reserve currency, perhaps increasing borrowing costs for the United States. If it is unsuccessful, the struggle to make the euro work could endanger the progress made by Europe in melding its diverse economies into a single market and subduing historical animosities with the help of economic engineering.
In the meantime, American officials are prodding European governments to make sure that their focus on getting the euro off to a good start does not diminish their resolve to deal with Western Europe's chronic economic problems, most notably its persistently high unemployment rate. The monetary union formally began on Thursday with 11 countries locking their currencies to the new euro and will debut in the financial markets on Monday.
American officials say Europe should not allow the very real challenges of monetary union to turn its attention inward as much of the world is still struggling to recover from the shocks of the financial crisis that began last year in Asia.
"Some have argued that a Europe with a single number in the global directory might ultimately pose a threat to the United States," Mr. Summers said in a speech last month. "But in a global economy, the United States has infinitely less to fear from an open and integrated Europe that continues to take its share in global responsibilities, than a Europe that turns inward and seeks insulation."
To the extent that there has been any debate in Washington policymaking circles, it has had less to do with the euro itself than with Europe's economic challenges and view of its place in the world.
On one side are those who are optimistic that the euro will prove to be the spur that Europe needs to unshackle its economies from excessive regulation and stimulate more growth and jobs through private investment. On the other side are those who think that Europe is doomed to years of economic underperformance, tinged by protectionism, as left-wing Governments now in power in France, Germany and Italy stall on long-delayed changes.
"This is a double-or-nothing bet for Europe," a senior American official said. If the euro works, the official said, Europe will emerge stronger and more prosperous; if it fails, the Continent will emerge more divided, poorer and less confident.
Beyond the questions of political and economic stability, the benefits to the United States of a successful euro could be considerable. By replacing the French franc, the German mark and nine other national currencies, the program should make it easier and less expensive for American companies to sell their products and services. Multinational American companies are already among the largest in Europe, and many smaller American exporters are increasingly looking to Europe.
Although Britain, the most popular location for American business investment, has chosen not to adopt the euro for now, it may well join later, spurred by euro trading in London's powerful financial markets and dealings done in euros between British companies and their business partners in "Euroland."
"I think we are going to see significant advantages go to those companies who had already viewed Europe as a single market, which a lot of our bigger companies already have done," said David L. Aaron, the Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade.
Moreover, he said, eliminating fluctuating exchange rates should create competitive pressures in Europe that will narrow price variations among countries, favoring cost-conscious American companies.
"Prices are going to fall," Mr. Aaron said. "That will increase demand and put more money in consumers' hands. That's going to have a positive effect on the European economy, and that will be good for the United States."
While American officials say the potential economic threats to the United States from a successful euro are too often overstated, they are nonetheless real.
A euro representing the might of nations whose economies together already rival that of the United States in size could eventually draw away some of the influence and financial power that America has long maintained by virtue of having the world's dominant currency.
David Hale, an economist at Zurich Kemper Investments in Chicago, compares the introduction of the euro to the formation more than eight decades ago of the Federal Reserve system in the United States. Before it had a central bank, the United States had no uniform monetary policy. Although it had a share of world trade nearly equivalent to Britain's, America accounted for a minuscule share of global finance.
The dollar now accounts for nearly 60 percent of global foreign currency reserves, almost four times as much as the European currencies combined. And although it is difficult to predict how fast that situation will change, a successful euro would certainly reduce the dollar's hegemony in international finance over the long run. That could make it more expensive for the United States Government to borrow in an increasingly global capital market.
"Until now the fragmentation of Europe and the national nature of the central banks has inhibited the international use of the currencies," Mr. Hale said. "But at some point there will be a moment when international capital demand and additional competition for global savings hurt the ability of the United States to fund its external deficits because there will be competition to the dollar."
There is also some question whether the United States will continue to benefit from the desire of people in other countries to hold dollars -- a practice that amounts to a huge interest-free loan to the United States.
By some estimates, a majority of dollars in circulation are outside the United States, held by everyone from Russians desperate to avoid the effects of a ruble depreciation to drug smugglers and arms merchants who need a currency they can move around the world with ease.
The Europeans seem to have taken that potential role into account in devising their new currency, which will start circulating as coins and bills within the next three years. The largest European bill will be a 500-euro denomination, worth about $550, while the largest American bill in general circulation remains $100.

HEADLINE: George Jackson Eder, 98, Expert On Latin American Economics

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
George Jackson Eder, a lawyer and economist active in Latin American affairs, died last Wednesday in Shands Hospital in Gainesville, Fla. He had collapsed the previous evening while Christmas shopping at Wal-Mart, his son Richard said. He was 98.
Born and raised in New York City, Mr. Eder served in the Cavalry during World War I in France. After studying law and accounting, he served as a coffee buyer for several years in Costa Rica. 
 In 1926, Mr. Eder was appointed to head the Latin section of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce. It was a period in which the United States was superceding Europeans as the leading trading partner of South and Central America.
In 1931, Mr. Eder was dismissed after publishing a feisty attack on British efforts to promote their exports to Argentina. In a 175-page pamphlet published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Mr. Eder wrote that a recent visit by the Prince of Wales to open a British trade fair in Argentina was to "attack American mercantile supremacy." And he wrote that British merchants and diplomats were making "veiled attacks on Argentine-American friendship."
After working at an investment firm, Mr. Eder joined the International Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1939 as a deputy counsel. He was sent to work in ITT's Argentine subsidiary in 1940, which operated that country's telephone system. After negotiating the sale of the telephone company to the Argentine Government, he moved back to ITT's New York headquarters in 1947.
In 1956, he took a leave from ITT to head an economic mission to help the Bolivian Government cope with spiraling inflation. He helped concoct a plan that included balancing the budget and eliminating currency exchange limits, followed by a one-year freeze on wages. A key element of the plan was to repay debt the country owed to the United States.
The plan had critics on the Bolivian left. In June 1957, Nuflo Chaves, the labor-backed Vice President of Bolivia, resigned after a public dispute with Mr. Eder. But in a speech before Congress two months later, President Hernan Siles Zuazo said that the plan created by Mr. Eder had "saved the country."
Mr. Eder left ITT in 1961 and spent several years teaching, first at Harvard Law School and then at the business school of the University of Michigan.
Mr. Eder's wife, Marceline Gray Eder, died in 1971. He is survived by four children: Donald Eder, a teacher in Norwalk, Conn.; Richard Eder, a book critic in Milton, Mass.; Luli Gray, a writer in Chapel Hill, N.C., and Elizabeth McCulloch, a lawyer in Gainesville. He is also survived by eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Three Reasons for a New China Policy

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A couple of Shanghai prostitutes let themselves into a hotel room occupied by a Chinese man who had discussed human rights in a local teahouse. With a quick couple of zips, the girls stood naked. Moments later, police entered the room and arrested the dissident for patronizing prostitutes.
This old entrapment-and-blackmail dodge run by the frightened men ruling China is their crude way of trying to discredit the tiny group that wants to start a labor union and perhaps a non-Communist political party. 
 Why this transparent subterfuge? Because the nationwide crackdown on dissidence, begun as President Clinton visited China and hailed Jiang Zemin as his partner, is not playing well in the world press and may not be going down well inside China.
But why should Beijing go to the trouble of disguising the jailing of a relative handful of troublemakers? Intellectuals and students do not a counterrevolution make.
The logical reason for the iron fist is instability in the Forbidden City at the prospect of economic hard times. A generation anesthetized by ever-rising prosperity is growing restive at slower growth. In the vast countryside, we have reports that farmers are grumbling, unable to market bumper crops; in the jammed cities, an army of the underemployed posits a threat of unrest.
The Communist leadership knows that the Soviet breakup began with Solidarity, supported by Lane Kirkland's A.F.L.-C.I.O., and the stress on the state-stagnated system of Reagan's arms race; the ensuing dissatisfaction of workers and farmers was ignited by a cadre of underestimated dissidents. Fear of that scenario explains the desperate need of Jiang to squelch every peep of opposition.
Here in America, we are beginning to discover how brazenly the sclerotic Chinese regime has stolen our missile technology, and how it played on the naivete and financial need of our politicians to influence our trade policies.
Last week the bipartisan Cox Committee revealed the tip of the iceberg of espionage penetration. Stimulated by a Jeff Gerth article in The New York Times, it began investigating China's illegal acquisition of all sorts of national-security secrets. Because the committee tracked some of the Chinese spy successes back to Republican administrations, it was able to issue a unanimous report even in these times.
If the White House allows enough of the 700-page report to be declassified, it will show that the worst hemorrhage of secrets took place in recent years. That's partly because our counterintelligence was flummoxed by Larry Wu-tai Chin's successors, but mainly because Clinton flip-flopped on trade with China. Restrictions came off; we now pump $60 billion a year into the regime. Worse, he steered the regulation of technology transfer to the complaisant Commerce Department.
Which brings us to Colonel Liu, a Chinese intelligence agent, daughter of a top general, who channeled money through Asian-American fronts to the Clinton-Gore and other campaigns. Where stands the prosecution of the notorious "China connection"?
Becalmed. After nearly two years of resisting independent counsel lest it embarrass the White House, the deeply conflicted Reno Justice Department made a show of activity by charging a few small-fry with being China's conduits to the Democrats. Then the foot-draggers of Justice ran into the new "Turn 'em Loose Bruce" on the Federal bench.
Bill Clinton must be happy to have this case in the hands of his Democratic appointee, Paul L. Friedman. This judge has further crippled the lame Justice investigation by throwing out most of the counts against Maria Hsia, Charlie Trie and Pauline Kanchanalak. Under his curious reading of election law, Saddam Hussein and the K.G.B. would be free to contribute millions to the Democratic National Committee so long as it is "soft money."
Here's the box score: one serious investigation of Chinese penetration suppressed because it's secret, the other stymied because of incompetence and misjudgment.
In the light of (1) China's desperate duplicity on human rights; (2) the 38 secret recommendations by the House to stem the flow of secrets to China and then to Iran and North Korea, and (3) the botched and scotched investigation into the change of trade policy amid heavy contributions -- isn't it time to re-think our "partnership"?
Forget "who lost China?" Consider "who Shanghaied America?"

HEADLINE: Whither the Tube?

 BODY:
No one in the television industry has enjoyed the past year. The networks -- six of them now -- preside over a steadily falling audience share, and NBC has even considered suing Nielsen Media Research for what the network says is under-reporting of the critical 18-to-34-year-old viewing audience. Nielsen's measurements allegedly cost the network $60 million in advertising revenues. Meanwhile, network programmers have left their jobs in droves, and the networks have begun to replace them with programmers from cable. The production costs of prime-time shows have gone through the roof.
Digital television, perennially in the offing but now getting really close, will soon increase the number of channels to around 1,500, fracturing the audience into ever smaller shards and enticing phone companies and Internet providers onto the tube. Channels like MTV and the A&E Network have begun to spawn and morph as fast as fruit flies. Meanwhile a clear racial divide between black and white audiences has emerged, leading one producer to speak of "a chitlin circuit on TV." One of the few bright spots -- speaking only of revenue -- has been the WB network, which has a popular lineup of shows for occult teen-agers and a big hit called "Dawson's Creek," a kind of Titanic in a skiff watched every week by teen-age girls on the phone with other teen-age girls. 
 The obvious question -- besides "What's on?" -- is "What does it all mean?" One answer is that for years an extremely narrow bandwidth -- three channels representing three networks -- severely compressed the TV-visible demographics of this country. As the bandwidth has expanded -- as the number of channels has increased -- TV has begun more accurately to reflect the diversity of audience markets in this country.
The problem, of course, is that it costs a lot of money to produce television shows: it is an inherently expensive medium. A cable channel or a network may begin by seeking a niche market. But the economics of television work only if that niche market rapidly broadens. That is what provides value to advertisers, if not to viewers. Established networks and cable channels have an enormous advantage, even as they clone themselves, because they already control a stockpile of paid-up shows. That is why when digital channels begin to multiply we will be watching a lot of leftovers. Luckily, Americans are used to that.
But does anyone besides the executives at ABC, NBC and CBS really miss the days of network domination? Only, perhaps, to the extent that we miss the forced passivity of having so few choices. There is, in fact, a certain danger in the recent fractionating of TV. Some of the ways the audience has been sliced -- Fox's Boyz and Girlz channels, the marginalizing of black programs -- are potentially harmful. But to the lament that we are losing a sense of national community as television grapples with its recombinant future, there is only one thing to say: Get a life.

HEADLINE: CLINTON SEEKS AID FOR CARE OF THOSE WITH CHRONIC ILLS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
President Clinton will announce a $6 billion package of tax and budget proposals on Monday to help provide long-term care for people with chronic illnesses or disabilities, Administration officials said today.
The proposals represent the most ambitious effort to deal with the long-term care needs of the elderly since the collapse of Mr. Clinton's plan to guarantee health insurance for all Americans in 1994. 
 The core of the initiative is a proposal to give a tax credit of $1,000 a year to people who need long-term care, at home or in an institution. The credit would also be available, in some cases, to people who care for relatives with conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke and brain injuries.
The White House said that the tax credit, if approved by Congress, would help two million people, at a cost of $5.5 billion, from 2000 to 2004.
White House officials said the President would probably not specify now how he intended to pay for the initiative, but would probably ask Congress to cover the cost by eliminating several corporate tax breaks. In any event, they said, Mr. Clinton will not dip into the anticipated budget surplus, which he has said should be reserved for Social Security.
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, said the proposed tax credit for long-term care was "a good idea that has a potential to be enacted into law." It was, he said, part of the House Republican manifesto, the so-called Contract With America, in 1994 and 1995.
But Mr. Fleischer said that Republicans and Democrats alike had in the past resisted some of Mr. Clinton's proposals for business tax increases. The long-term care changes would have a better chance of approval if they were not linked to tax increases, Mr. Fleischer said.
The initiative is to be included in the budget that Mr. Clinton sends to Congress this month. It responds to a significant need, Administration officials say, pointing out that five million Americans need long-term care because of illness or disability, and that the need will grow with the aging of the population.
The President's proposals would encourage and reward people who provide informal, unpaid care to spouses and parents. Many of these caregivers are themselves over 60.
Administration officials cited the plan, which has been in the works since the summer, as evidence that the President was still able to focus on the needs of the American people, despite his impeachment by the House of Representatives on Dec. 19.
"If this helps on that front," said an Administration official asked about any connection between Monday's announcement and the impeachment proceedings, "I'm happy, but that's not the rationale for it."
Budget documents show that Mr. Clinton's initiative also includes these proposals:
*The Federal Government would provide $125 million a year to the states -- $625 million over the five years covered by the initiative -- to assist families caring for relatives with serious illnesses or disabilities. The money would pay for information, training and counseling, as well as the occasional services of a home health aide or personal attendant, so that the regular caregiver could get out of the home for a few hours a week. About 250,000 families could be assisted under this program.
*Medicare officials would give out information to all 39 million beneficiaries emphasizing that most long-term care is not covered by Medicare, the Federal insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Surveys of the elderly have found that nearly 60 percent do not realize Medicare's limitations. The education effort would cost $10 million.
*The Federal Office of Personnel Management would make private long-term care insurance available to Federal employees and retirees, their parents and certain in-laws at negotiated group rates. The Government would not pay the premiums, but would negotiate the rates with a single insurer or "a very small number of carriers."
The White House estimates that 300,000 people would buy insurance under this arrangement. Because of the group rates, it says, premiums would be 15 percent to 20 percent lower than the cost of individual long-term care policies. The Government would insist on certain minimum benefits and a cost-of-living allowance, to protect benefits against inflation. The administrative costs to the Federal Government would be $15 million over five years.
Joshua M. Wiener, an expert on long-term care at the Urban Institute, a research and policy center, welcomed the President's proposals. "It's good to see some recognition of this issue," he said. "In the debate about Social Security and Medicare, we've almost totally forgotten the third concern about retirement security: the need for long-term care."
But Mr. Wiener said the tax credit would be of little help to people with incomes so low that they did not pay Federal income taxes. "You have to pay some taxes to qualify," he said, "and 40 percent of the elderly pay no income taxes at all, primarily because substantial amounts of Social Security are not counted as income for tax purposes."
And although a $1,000 credit would be valuable, many people with chronic illnesses require home-care services costing tens of thousands of dollars a year, experts said.
The Administration says that three-fourths of the people who would get the credit would be spouses or other relatives of people needing long-term care.
Under the Administration proposal, a person could qualify for the tax credit if he or she was unable to perform three or more basic tasks of everyday life. These include bathing, dressing, eating, using a toilet and getting in and out of a bed or a chair. The person's impairments would have to be certified by a doctor.
Alternatively, the family of someone needing long-term care could qualify for the credit if the family provided such care to a close relative who lived with the family and who had an annual gross income of less than $8,100.
The credit would be available, in some cases, to parents of children with severe disabilities. The rate of children living with handicaps has increased in recent years, in part because of doctors' success in saving premature, sick and disabled infants.
The Administration says the tax credit would benefit 1.2 million elderly people, 250,000 children and 550,000 nonelderly adults.
The full tax credit would be available to couples with incomes up to $110,000 a year, but would be reduced for more affluent couples and would be eliminated for those with incomes over $130,000. The credit would be phased out for individuals with incomes from $75,000 to $95,000.
In a description of the proposal, the White House says: "The flat $1,000 credit would be given on the basis of a certified need for long-term care, rather than expenses for long-term care. This means that families and people with chronic illness or disability do not have to collect and submit receipts for paid home health care" or other expenses.
Administration officials said the proposals recognized the value and costs of informal, unpaid long-term care by relatives. If, for example, a man has a stroke and his wife takes time off from work to care for him, she would not necessarily have a receipt to show her reduced hours of work or the time spent bathing and feeding her husband. But the family might qualify for the tax credit.

HEADLINE: The Big City;
On Changing Our Approach To Change

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
BEFORE Mayor Giuliani or Governor Pataki gives another rousing speech about New York's bright prospects for the 21st century, he might take a look at a new book by a journalist who lives in Los Angeles, Virginia Postrel. The book is titled "The Future and Its Enemies," and New York clearly belongs with the enemies.
Ms. Postrel is one of those people who divide the world into two kinds of people, and she's not satisfied with the liberal-conservative dichotomy. Liberals are supposed to be the ones who welcome change, but they're often just as reactionary as conservatives in opposing innovation, whether it involves a new technology (like genetic engineering) or a real estate development. The Upper West Side calls itself progressive but can't abide the prospect of a new building. 
 Ms. Postrel proposes another dichotomy: stasis versus dynamism. Stasists, as she defines the term, believe that the future must be managed. Some are nostalgists generally opposed to change, while other stasists are technocrats determined to make any change conform to their vision and regulations.
Dynamists prefer to let changes proceed by trial and error, with little central guidance. It's a philosophy that sounds a lot like libertarianism -- not surprising, since Ms. Postrel is the editor of the libertarian magazine Reason -- although she says it's shared by nonlibertarians on both the left and the right. It's the evolutionary approach, guided by lots of independent "feedback loops," that's popular in Silicon Valley and on the Internet, and that once flourished in New York.
"New York will be a great city when it's finished," Will Rogers said in the 1920's, and back then everyone in America got the joke. New York was the symbol of perpetual change, the urban evil despised by agrarians who extolled the timeless virtues of farms and small towns.
Manhattan's skyline appalled the stasist elite in cities like Philadelphia, where tradition forbade any new buildings reaching higher than the statue atop its City Hall. New York was much less orderly. Its famous skyscrapers and neighborhoods were built by countless developers and homeowners who gradually learned from one another's successes and failures.
But eventually New York fell under the control of master planners like Robert Moses, whom Ms. Postrel presents as the ultimate stasist technocrat. He casually razed entire neighborhoods to make way for his grand vision of the future, which did not allow for any feedback from the nonexperts who only happened to live there.
The results were so disastrous that the next generation of technocrats became obsessed with neighborhood preservation, and their myriad regulations have made it difficult to build anything at all. In their own stasist way, they have all but eliminated the experimentation that once created New York's neighborhoods.
MAYOR Rudolph W. Giuliani took office vowing to shake the city out of its lethargy, and he's succeeded in some ways. He has simplified some of the regulations on housing and businesses, and his war on crime has been a triumph of the dynamist method. The police in each precinct, instead of following fixed rules imposed by central headquarters, have learned what works by studying crime statistics each week and tailoring their strategy to local conditions.
But Mr. Giuliani is not at heart a dynamist. Like his role model, Fiorello H. La Guardia, he is a moralistic technocrat fond of controlling everything, from crosswalks and the schools to the economy. He practices a stasist economic policy, giving special subsidies and dispensations to old established corporations while small new firms are left to fend with the country's most onerous taxes and regulations.
"New York's one saving grace," Ms. Postrel said yesterday, "is that it still attracts newcomers who provide an infusion of dynamism. But New York's central planning mentality makes it harder and harder for these creative people to build lives there -- to find a place to live, open a business, educate their children. The risk is that those people are going to head for more dynamic cultures."
Like Los Angeles? "I don't like to make comparisons," Ms. Postrel replied tactfully. "We have our own stasist problems in California with regulations and growth controls. But I will say that when I go to New York, I don't feel like I'm seeing the future. It's still a city that is largely living off its past."

HEADLINE: Debut of Euro Has the British Underwhelmed

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Holding back on the brink as it has at every turn of Europe's integration, Britain this weekend observed the birth of the euro single currency as a nation apart, its leaders mute even as its major banks prepared to trade the new money by the trillion.
Neither Prime Minister Tony Blair, on vacation in the Seychelles, nor Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had anything to say. Britain has initially excluded itself from the currency, the inception of which has been cast as an event of momentous proportions for the 290 million people in the countries taking part. 
 Despite the official reticence, London of course remains home to Europe's biggest stock, bond and foreign exchange markets.
This weekend, swapping pinstripes for blue jeans, some 30,000 bankers and back-room workers toiled to prepare the trading floors for an anticipated euro deluge at the opening of markets on Monday, as 11 separate European currencies are turned into expressions of the euro.
Some depicted the activity as a less-than-thrilling exercise. "As far as excitement is concerned, it was a bit of a dud," said Rich Silverman, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch. "You had the sense that you were part of history. But not every part of history is exciting."
The Clinton Administration supports the euro, but that policy masks complex and unresolved issues for the United States. Page A6.
The clue to Britain's reserve lies, perhaps, in lines penned almost 70 years ago by Churchill, which have defined Britain's ambiguity toward the great land mass across the Channel ever since: "We are with Europe, not of it. We are linked, but not comprised."
Britain is politically and economically by far the most significant of the four European Union members outside the euro zone. Denmark and Sweden also chose to stay out for now, and Greece failed to meet the financial criteria.
Public debate about the euro in Britain has been fierce, and divisions over Europe were one of the many reasons for the defeat of the Conservatives by Mr. Blair's Labor Party in the 1997 election.
In the view of Britons skeptical toward Europe, Britain stands alone, as it did when Churchill rallied this nation against the Nazi swamping of Europe in 1940, its sovereignty on the line.
"The classic argument" among the so-called Euroskeptic newspapers that have driven the discussion, said Peter Riddell, a newspaper columnist, "is that it's Britain versus Germany." In the skeptics' view, Germany is not just the bulldozing power behind the euro's creation, but also the driving force of a United States of Europe.
As the euro became reality in global electronic trading tonight, those opposed to the new currency raised alarms anew that the currency was no more than a Trojan horse for a European superstate in which the essence of British-ness would be lost.
"How can the Government keep pretending that it is just about currencies when the continentals are clearly out to create a new country and a new government?" said John Redwood, a Conservative and a leading Euroskeptic.
For all the rage of Tory skeptics, and the somewhat coy silence of a Blair Government that has hinted that it will join the euro one day, no one in financial circles here seems to doubt that Britain will really escape the tidal pull of the currency and the vast euro market lapping at its shores.
Already, said Grant Phillips, head of the euro program at Barclays Corporate Banking, some 30,000 British corporations, large and small, have opened bank accounts in euros with his bank, Britain's biggest, alone.
Indeed, some leading companies with continental business ties have let it be known that they will favor suppliers who deal in euros, abandoning Britain's cherished pound sterling. There is even talk of some companies offering euro salaries to enable British employees to have access to cheaper mortgages at the lower euro interest rates.
With this "creeping euro," Mr. Phillips said, "we are fast getting to the stage of the euro strolling -- if not galloping -- through the British economy."
Such arguments strengthen those who argue that by abstaining from first wave of the euro, Britain is repeating its historic mistake of denying the inevitable in Europe.
"The tragedy," said an editorial in the Observer Sunday newspaper, "is that once again the British political and media establishment have made sure Britain is not in a vital European project at the beginning."
By that argument, Britain is missing out not just on decision-making about the currency of its main trading area, but also on a great opportunity for cheaper money in the low-interest-rate euro zone and cheaper trade in a vast region free of foreign exchange risks and costs.
The skeptics' counterargument turns on Britain's ability to steer its own economy, manage its own interest rates and taxes and preserve its own blend of low unemployment, low taxes and relatively cheap labor.
The euro, said Lord David Owen, a former Labor Foreign Secretary, would mean far greater European "involvement in tax, even welfare, hours of work, working conditions."
And, he said, "essential parts" of British budget making would "now be decided in Euroland" -- the term widely used for the 11 countries taking part in the new currency. They share fixed common interest rates set by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.
The European Central Bank, like most European financial institutions, said today that its preparations for the euro had been completed smoothly. The currency formally came into being on Jan. 1. Since then, European markets have been closed, so many bankers say the real test will come only when the markets open.
In contrast to all the hoopla surrounding the euro across the Channel, it seemed typical of Britain's introversion that the main political issues this weekend related not to the new currency, but to lingering brush fires over the resignation last month of Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson and to a tussle over Mr. Blair's decision to let his children defy Government education policy and miss classes at school this week while his family completes its Indian Ocean vacation.
Beyond that, though, Mr. Blair's Government is widely seen as being friendlier to the euro than its Conservative predecessor, to the extent, said Mr. Riddell, the newspaper columnist, that "it's when rather than if with Blair."
The Government's stated policy is to postpone a decision until a referendum after the next general election. Under Britain's electoral law, a national election need not be held until 2002.
By that time, Euroland will have completed the transition to using euro notes and coins, and much of British business will already be conducted in euros.
Mr. Blair and his colleagues may be hoping for a triumph of pragmatism over pride.
"The most obvious factor is whether the euro is a success," said Gerald Segal, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies here. If Mr. Blair "is going to take Britain in, he needs to be seen as going into a positive exercise."
But will the euro be a success? Andy Meadows is the curator of an exhibit at the British Museum charting common currencies from ancient Greek tridrachms through the silver denarii of the Roman Empire and on to the euro.
He says history reinforces the mantra of the market-and-mirrors 1990's. "If a coin is persuasive, then people will accept it, and if people accept it, it becomes a model," Mr. Meadows said in an interview. And if the market-place needs a common currency, "then the market takes over." Euro-watchers, please note.

HEADLINE: Hospitals in New York Escalate Competition for Cancer Patients

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The vast prestige, power and -- critics would argue -- arrogance of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center can be measured by its physical space.
It is on York Avenue in the 60's -- inconvenient, like many prestigious New York hospitals, to public transportation. Many of its hospital floors feel grim and dated, with harsh lighting and nurses' stations enclosed in Plexiglass. Its parking lot is dismal, and some waiting areas are about as welcoming as the average public hospital's. 
 Yet historically, Sloan-Kettering has been the place to go for cancer treatment in New York, because of its prestigious doctors and esteemed reputation for clinical research, and the promising drugs trials it conducts. Ambience has never been the point.
But lately, curious things have been happening at Sloan-Kettering. It is building a new ambulatory care center at 53d Street and Third Avenue, smack next to several subway lines. The main hospital is undergoing a face lift: peach-toned walls, with still-life paintings, are replacing blinding white ones, sand-colored carpeting is being added to match, and nurses' stations are now open and accessible. In recent years, it has also opened a modern, attractive center for breast cancer patients on East 64th Street, complete with comfortable furniture and a shop that sells hats, scarves and other accessories.
And last week, Sloan-Kettering's 72-year-old president, Paul A. Marks, said he would retire this year, perhaps paving the way for further changes in the center's way of doing business, which at this point has included all but ignoring the managed-care movement.
This is hardly enlightenment in a vacuum. Cancer is becoming an essential part of any hospital's business, and the major medical centers in the city are aggressively trying to nibble away at Sloan-Kettering's market share. While this concentration on cancer patients is a nationwide phenomenon, experts say the new competition is particularly fevered in New York, where there are already more centers that have the official designation of the National Cancer Institute -- and its financing -- than in most other regions.
"Right now, New York is the hotbed of competition," said Christopher Demby, who runs the Oncology Round Table program for the Advisory Board, a health care research firm. "There is action being taken by every player in the market now."
Hospitals are building new centers devoted to the disease, and poaching some of the country's biggest names in cancer care -- some from Sloan-Kettering itself -- to run and staff them. They are investing in expensive technology, adding all manner of consumer-friendly fringe benefits, like support groups and libraries, to their cancer wards, and pouring money into advertising campaigns that hawk cancer treatments in a way once reserved for gentle innovations like birthing centers.
"We are here to show that Memorial is no longer the only game in town," said Marilyn Halper, executive director of Beth Israel Medical Center's gleaming new cancer center, in the Zeckendorf Tower on Union Square.
Carving off one disease and homing in on it is an important trend in medicine, especially chronic diseases that require long-term care. Diabetes, for instance, is also getting lots of attention. But few illnesses have attracted quite the same focus and investment as cancer.
The reason is largely financial: Cancer is big business. Experts believe that cancer will soon overtake cardiovascular disease as the No. 1 killer in America as the population ages and cardio-care becomes more advanced.
Cancer offers other financial incentives beyond the sheer flow of cases: the disease is still fairly immune from managed-care penny pinching, while at the same time, treatment advances have helped to streamline care. And there is constant excitement in the field: there are more than 300 cancer drugs in the pipeline.
 
Offering Convenience And New Technology
Much of the activity involves the opening of outpatient clinics, which are starting to flourish across the country as new technologies and changing medical economics allow patients to have chemotherapy and radiation treatments without staying overnight in a hospital.
Continuum Health Partners, which runs Beth Israel and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, has built the new outpatient center at Union Square, and beefed up its breast cancer program at St. Luke's. It has poached several doctors from other, far more prestigious cancer centers to run many of its programs, and has spent over $400,000 last year on cancer advertising campaigns.
Over at New York University, the medical center has carved off neuro-oncology as its brightest attraction, investing $10 million alone in a rare Gamma knife that administers beams of gamma radiation without surgical incision to the brain, and $2.5 million more on special M.R.I. machines, which enable doctors to rule out malignancies without a biopsy. It also lured Dr. Michael Gruber, a prestigious neuro-oncologist from the University of California in Los Angeles, to run the unit.
St. Vincent's Hospital, which has had almost no profile with cancer, has hired an outside company to build its cancer clinic. Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan and Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx have made similar deals with Dr. Bernard Salick, the California physician-entrepreneur whose 24-hour for-profit cancer clinics have raised the customer-service bar.
Significantly, all of these hospitals and their doctors are well versed in the ways of managed care, and are in a position to take the increasing load of patients who are enrolled in H.M.O.'s and can only afford to go to centers that honor them. Sloan-Kettering has all but shunned the managed care movement, a position that could cost a hospital important drug trial money. "In order to have enough patients to do these trials, you need a cross section of patients," said Joann Schellenbach, a spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society. "Not just those who can afford to go to elite physicians."
It is almost impossible to track cancer business market share figures -- most of the hospitals guard their numbers more closely than any privately held company, and many experts think that community hospitals are simply getting slices of a growing market rather than stealing business from Sloan-Kettering.
But since 1996, when Beth Israel opened its Union Square center, the number of patients seen there has risen to 21,174 from 15,027. Further, the hospital's inpatient cancer business has grown 12 percent since 1992.
At N.Y.U., new-case growth is similar. In 1993, its department of neuro-oncology saw five patients. In 1997, that number grew to 275. And if Dr. Salick's history in California is any indication, numbers of new cases at hospitals he has been affiliated with should certainly swell this year.
 
A Push in the Direction Of Patient-Friendly Care
Dr. Salick, whose mere name tends to raise hackles in more traditional circles, can be credited with helping to push New York's medical centers toward a greater emphasis on patient-friendly cancer care.
Dr. Salick began opening for-profit centers in 1986 in California, then expanded to Florida. He says that his niche is the 24-hour comprehensive service that patients can get in his centers, and that his deep knowledge of managed care, prevalent in California for a decade but still fairly new to this area, gives him an edge. He also provides the financing, badly needed by hospitals with dwindling resources, to get clinics off the ground.
"I have a highly credible reputation of running very cost effective facilities," Dr. Salick said in an interview. "You have wonderful hospitals and wonderful doctors in New York, but there is a breakdown in the delivery system. You go to these places at nine at night and no one is there. Cancer is a disease that happens to go on 24 hours a day. All these other hospitals are doing is opening a center and sticking some doctors in there."
Some cancer experts have expressed concerns about Dr. Salick's for-profit model, contending that health care surpluses should go back into the hospitals that generate them, not into shareholders' pockets. Others deride his approach as either impractical or nonthreatening. "Not too many people want radiation at 4 A.M.," said Dr. Warren Enker, the associate director of Beth Israel's cancer center. "So it's not that great a gimmick."
But Dr. Enker's colleague, Ms. Halper, admits that Dr. Salick has underscored the importance of focusing on customer service. "The for-profits have taught us the importance of being patient friendly," she said. "This is a service." A wig shop, wooden furniture designed in Vermont and a light-soaked atrium of a lobby are all part of Beth Israel's efforts in this regard.
And patient friendliness has traditionally been the Achilles' heel of Sloan-Kettering's reputation. Doctors who have worked at the hospital, and some patients who have received care there, describe an imperious and sometimes cold atmosphere, where waits can be long and doctors hard to reach.
Sometimes, warmth wins over clinical reputation. Michael Berkowitz learned he had lung cancer in 1996. His wife was pregnant, his life as a successful Wall Street lawyer was thrown into turmoil, and he had to make some decisions about treatment, fast. First, he went to Beth Israel, then to Sloan-Kettering for a second opinion. He decided to go with Beth Israel.
"Everyone says to be cured, you have to go to Sloan because they have the reputation," he said. While he was impressed with the doctors, he found the hospital to be "a scary and institutional place," he said. "It feels big, and you feel small. I felt that I did not have the same personal connection as I did to the Beth Israel doctors."
Some former Sloan-Kettering physicians say a lack of warmth toward patients was an unfortunate byproduct of working in a highly elite institution. "Sloan-Kettering is one of the institutions that has an exceedingly cumbersome administration," said Dr. Enker, who left the hospital in 1995 for Beth Israel.
"The surgeons there are very dedicated to their patients," Dr. Enker added. "But it is a very busy environment. You can't see hundreds of patients each year and not have patients feel rushed. And I hear repeated complaints that the medical oncologists are lacking in compassion, and part of the arrogance becomes, 'Look, I am the expert, you came to me for my opinion, so listen to me or you're dismissed.' "
Sloan-Kettering doctors and administrators are not unaware of their reputation. But they maintain that it is more myth than reality. "There is a misperception that we are an ivory tower," said Dr. James B. Dougherty, deputy physician in chief of clinical affairs at Sloan-Kettering. "This is a very patient-centered environment."
Nonetheless, Dr. Dougherty and his colleagues have made customer-friendly cancer care a focus of their energy in recent years, even studying the hospitality industry for clues, and have adopted elements like a more room-service-style approach to patient meals as a result. Focusing on getting patients out of the hospital and into its new 200,000-square-foot outpatient center on East 53d Street, where care will be more streamlined, is a goal.
 
Aggressively Recruiting The Cream of the Crop
Just as universities and corporations go after big names to attract new business, so do medical centers. Cancer is no exception. In the last few years, Sloan-Kettering has lost several doctors to various centers, four to Beth Israel alone. St. Luke's poached Dr. Alison Estabrook of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, and she now heads St. Luke's breast center. In addition to Dr. Gruber, N.Y.U. recently recruited Dr. Patrick Kelly from the Mayo Clinic and several prominent doctors from other states. In turn, Beth Israel took three doctors from N.Y.U.
"The best way to go after patients is through building your talent base," said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University. What is more, prestigious doctors attract drug companies and other institutions needed for drug trials, which are another major attraction for critically ill patients.
Interestingly, Sloan-Kettering is not just content to spiff up its hospital here. It is also encroaching on some of the cancer business of community hospitals in the region by opening satellite centers in smaller towns, which enable patients to undergo chemotherapy and radiation without having to trek into Manhattan. There is one such center on Long Island, two in New Jersey and one in Westchester, and there are plans for more, Dr. Dougherty said.
Of course, hospitals on Long Island are not cheering. "There is considerable concern in Suffolk County over Sloan-Kettering's plans," said Mr. Demby of the oncology round table, "and what that will mean to local facilities."
Indeed, the cancer war promises to escalate, experts say. "Cancer is to the 1990's what heart disease was to the 1970's," said Dr. Gruber of N.Y.U. "It puts a center on the map, and that begets business."

HEADLINE: St. Croix Hopes Gambling Will Bring Back Tourists

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: CHRISTIANSTED, V.I.

 BODY:
When Lisa Newkirk-Svarczkopf heard that casinos would soon open on St. Croix, the biggest of the three United States Virgin Islands, she moved her clothing store to a location three times the size of the old one in anticipation of a tourism boom.
"I thought I was getting a jump start on things by moving to a bigger spot," she said. 
 As it turned out, the move was four years off and Ms. Newkirk-Svarczkopf had to move back to a smaller store. But her excitement and that of other St. Croix residents has not abated as the first casino is scheduled to open here this fall. In a region battered by four major hurricanes in the last decade, casinos are seen as a catalyst to help bring back the economic prosperity that all but vanished in September 1989, when Hurricane Hugo left 90 percent of the buildings damaged and more than 20,000 people homeless.
"It's the beginning of our turnaround," Ms. Newkirk-Svarczkopf said. "We know it's just a matter of time because we know what a beautiful island this is."
The Caribbean is full of islands with casinos, but the United States Virgin Islands, where tourism accounts for two-thirds of the economy, has resisted starting their own. In a 1992 referendum, both St. Croix and St. Thomas voted the idea down, concerned by the unsavory aspects of gambling.
But the economic need for more tourism in St. Croix, a less popular tourist destination than either St. Thomas or St. John, increasingly made residents here see casinos as a necessary evil. In another referendum four years ago, St. Thomas still said no but St. Croix's 60,000 residents relented.
Moving cautiously, however, the Legislature of the Islands has limited the number of casinos to six and allowed them only as a means of increasing the number of hotel rooms in St. Croix, which stands at about 1,000 -- half what it was before Hurricane Hugo. To get a license, a casino operator would have to either build a hotel or renovate an existing one to add new rooms.
"We never talk about casinos; we talk about casino-hotels," said Eileen R. Petersen, a former territorial court judge who chairs the islands' new Casino Control Commission. "Our goal is to surpass what it was before the hurricane."
Hotels are vital to what Government officials describe as an economic chain reaction: more hotels mean more tax dollars to promote tourism, which would in turn lead to more visitors, more airline flights from the mainland, where most visitors to the islands come from, and, it is hoped, lower fares.
Airlines usually carry that most desirable breed of tourist, the overnight guest. Government figures show that in 1997, 1.6 million cruise ship passengers spent $288.3 million in the American Virgin Islands. Land-based travelers were far fewer that year, 410,000, but spent almost as much, $281.6 million.
"Cruise ships are really not doing it," said Noel Loftus, president of the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce. "Cruise ships are getting larger and have their own stores. Passengers are spending less and less money."
St. Croix lags behind its two sister islands in all tourism. In the first three quarters of 1998, Government figures show, St. Thomas and St. John together had more than 315,000 airline visitors and 1.2 million cruise passengers. St. Croix received 111,000 airline passengers and fewer than 126,000 cruise ship visitors during the same period.
St. Thomas has made a name for its duty-free shopping district, and St. John, mostly an unspoiled national park, for its natural beauty. St. Croix combines elements of the two and has found it more difficult to create a separate identity. But, its residents note, the island is bigger and friendlier and offers less predictable attractions, like West Indian and Danish colonial historic sites.
Cruzans, as the locals are known, say the Government favors St. Thomas and St. John in advertising, an accusation officials explain by saying that promotional dollars come from hotel taxes and St. Thomas has four times as many.
"They're rather paranoid about feeling they always get the short end of the stick," the islands' tourism commissioner, Wylie H. Whisonant, said about Cruzans. "It's like a sibling rivalry." And, he added, even if more tourists were directed St. Croix's way, "Where are people going to stay?"
Enter casinos.
St. Croix's first casino is scheduled to open in September in the island's scenic eastern end, on the grounds of a hotel resort that was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo and is being rebuilt as the 200-room Divi Carina Bay Resort and Casino. The hotel, owned by Grapetree Shores Inc., is expected to open a few months earlier, in April or May.
The casino license went to Grapetree Shores' partner, Treasure Bay Corporation, a Mississippi casino operator that is investing $6.8 million here, moderate by industry standards, on a 10,000-square-foot casino with 275 slot machines, 12 table games and 132 employees. By law, the Government will take 8 percent of the casinos' annual gross revenue for the first two years, and up to 12 percent by the fifth year. The casino has also agreed to give at least 80 percent of the casino jobs to Virgin Islands residents.
Bernie Burkholder, president and chief executive of Treasure Bay, said he expected his property to capture about half of what he estimated was already a $20 million casino market in St. Croix.
"Obviously there's a lot of competition in the Caribbean," Mr. Burkholder said in a telephone interview from Biloxi, Miss. "A big percentage of tourists are going to come from the United States and they'll fly over the Bahamas and Puerto Rico and other places with casinos to get to St. Croix."
"We feel a well-executed, quality property will be able to compete. We will compete well against the older, more dated properties."
In the shopping district of Christiansted, store owners said they expected nothing but economic good from the first casino venture. "This will help bring in the Marriotts and the Hiltons," said Rob Low, owner of the Gold Shop jewelry store. "This is going to give the bigger-name hotels a reason to come. Then the airlines would start adding flights."
At the Casino Control Commission, the hope was to earn respect as a world-class gaming jurisdiction.
"We want people to feel that when they gamble in the Virgin Islands the games are fair and honest," Ms. Petersen said. "The best that can happen is that we have six fabulous, widely recognized casino-hotels and that the community is happy that it invested time, money and energy in this venture."
With so much at stake, Treasure Bay officials are feeling some pressure. "I'm concerned sometimes that maybe the expectations are too high and people would be disappointed," Mr. Burkholder said. "I know a lot of people are watching, the people in St. Croix, the investment community."
But although casinos are not a cure-all for the island's troubles, Mr. Burkholder said, they could make a difference if their success helps stimulate other investment. "We're the catalyst, but we won't by ourselves double the tourism," he said. "But in two or three years that can happen."

HEADLINE: Partisan Tone Seen in Return Of Legislature

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 3

 BODY:
With the capital's political landscape left virtually untouched by the November elections, lawmakers return here this week for a 1999 legislative session that experts say is likely to yield the same sort of partisanship and acrimony that have become synonymous with Albany.
Both Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, and his Democratic rivals in the State Legislature enter the new year with their hands strengthened by voters. Mr. Pataki won a second term by handily defeating all three of his major opponents, while Democrats increased their already large majority in the Assembly by one seat. 
 The election results seem to have emboldened these bitter adversaries as they prepare to confront a host of important policy issues, from proposed utility rate cuts to criminal justice initiatives.
The Governor and legislative leaders must also grapple with the main business of Albany, adopting a state budget. The Legislature has failed for the last six years to enact a budget by the April 1 deadline, becoming mired instead in long and bitter legislative sessions that have regularly plunged the state into fiscal uncertainty.
The budget is expected to be among the most contentious issues again this year, largely because the state has a ballooning budget surplus that Democrats and Republicans are already deeply divided over how to spend. Experts contend that the surplus could total as much as $2 billion by March 31, when the state's 1998-99 fiscal year ends.
Lawmakers note that at least they will not face the same kinds of highly partisan issues that divided them in previous years, like revamping the state's welfare and rent-regulation laws. Zenia Mucha, the Governor's spokeswoman, said that left open the possibility for a relatively smooth session. "If partisan politics do not become the focal point," she said, "I think we can have a relatively productive session."
But the work awaiting the Legislature in 1999 would be difficult to resolve even in the most collegial environment. Democrats in the Assembly say they intend to push a plan to cut electricity rates by reducing the Pataki administration's role in reorganizing New York's electric power industry. Mr. Pataki has resisted that proposal in the past, though he also strongly advocates cutting electric rates.
Some Democrats are also seeking to ease what they and others assert are the state's Draconian drug penalties, though Republicans have made no effort to change them even as they acknowledge that the penalties should be more flexible.
Mr. Pataki and his Republican allies who control the State Senate say they will renew their call for a sweeping overhaul of the state's juvenile justice system, seeking harsher sanctions and flexibility to prosecute youths as adults for certain violent crimes. Democrats have expressed willingness to compromise on this issue in the past but have failed to pass a bill that Republicans would support. Mr. Pataki and Senate Republicans also want to pass a package of bills that would stiffen penalties for sex offenses and crimes committed in schools.
A looming complication for 1999 could be Mr. Pataki's apparent ambition for national office. After proposing an election-year budget last year that was criticized by fiscal conservatives nationwide, the Governor plans to offer the kind of austere budget that he championed in his first two years in office. His aides say he mainly wants to hedge against a downturn in the economy.
Such a move could also help enhance his standing among conservatives who dominate the national Republican Party, even as it potentially angers Assembly Democrats who battled against deep spending cuts that he proposed in 1995, his first year in office.
Anger between Mr. Pataki and the Legislature would be nothing new. They clashed fiercely over a surplus last year after Mr. Pataki vetoed hundreds of millions of dollars in programs approved by both houses of the Legislature. The items vetoed were largely Democratic initiatives, like a plan that would have spent $500 million to refurbish existing schools and build new ones. But Senate Republicans also saw some programs dear to them cut from the budget.
The hostility stirred by that action has yet to subside as Mr. Pataki's main nemesis in the budget debate, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, indicated in a recent interview. "I don't think the public will let the Governor get away with his partisan vetoes," Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said. The Speaker, ignoring the Governor's overwhelming re-election victory in November, added that Mr. Pataki's "right wing" agenda was "out of step with New Yorkers."
Not even the Governor's recent decision to grant lawmakers a much coveted pay raise has helped ease the tensions. After years of blocking a raise, the Governor agreed to approve one last month during a brief special session. In return, Democrats, by far the most vocal supporters of a pay increase, passed legislation that allows for the creation of publicly financed schools that operate largely independently.
But Democrats and some Republicans in the Legislature are still seething over Mr. Pataki's contention that lawmakers did not deserve a salary increase.
"I think lawmakers on both sides of the aisle feel he was being demeaning," Mr. Silver said.
What may be hardest to predict for the 1999 session is the role of the Republicans who make up the majority in the Senate. They have been the Governor's loyal allies in his campaign to reduce taxes and toughen criminal penalties. He will need them again in this second term.
But the Senate Republicans have also been willing to align themselves with Assembly Democrats when it suited them. In 1996, for example, they helped Democrats block the Governor's proposals for sharp spending cuts in education, welfare and health care, among other programs. The Republicans feared the impact that such cuts would have on their constituents.
Mr. Pataki also stunned and angered Senate Republicans last year when he vetoed not only Democratic initiatives from the budget but Republican ones as well. The vetoes were largely viewed as an attempt by the Governor to burnish his credentials as a tough fiscal conservative and thus improve his prospects for national office. But he risks alienating Senate Republicans if he continues along that path.
The Republicans have already started staking out their own agenda for 1999, even before the Governor has laid out his own. They are seeking a package of multiyear tax cuts that would cost the state $770 million by 2002-03.
The Senate plan would, among other things, use much of the budget surplus to provide tax credits to individuals who pay into medical savings accounts, cut taxes for businesses that make capital investments, reduce utility taxes for banks and insurers and offer tax credits to businesses that provide child care for employees.
While Mr. Pataki has generally supported tax cuts, people close to him say he wants to set part of the budget surplus aside in case the economy slows and tax revenues dwindle. Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, said in a recent interview that he shared the Governor's concerns. But Mr. Bruno and his Republican colleagues in the Senate also believe that further tax cuts would bolster the economy.
The main opposition to the Senate plan is expected to come from Democrats in the Assembly, who would like to use the surplus for initiatives like refurbishing schools and reducing class sizes in the fourth through fifth grades. The Assembly persuaded the Senate and the Governor to approve a similar plan two years ago that was intended to reduce class sizes in kindergarten through the third grade.

HEADLINE: OUTLOOK 1999: ECONOMY & INDUSTRY;
How the U.S. Consumer Feels . . . and How the Economy Is Doing

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
The American economy is in good shape, according to 85 percent of the 895 adults polled in the middle of December by The New York Times and CBS News.
This positive outlook from respondents to the nationwide telephone survey was even higher than the 83 percent who found the economy either very good or fairly good at the start of last year. 
 In fact, optimism about the national economy has been gaining almost steadily, according to poll results, since February 1992.
Analysts believe that consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economy, will continue to feel good about the economy and continue to spend freely.
"Consumer spending is by and large determined by income and wealth," said Michael Cloherty, a bond strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. And many households seem to have more of both.
With the unemployment rate at 4.4 percent, the lowest in a generation, most people not only have jobs but the likelihood -- despite some layoffs -- that they will continue to be employed. Raises may not seem particularly generous, but neither are they being eaten up by inflation. And a lot of households are building assets as the stock market ends its fourth consecutive year of double-digit gains.
Another reason many Americans have more spending money is that they took advantage of tumbling interest rates last year to refinance their home mortgages. That freed up cash for monthly spending and for paying off debts.
"Consumers," said Keith J. Leggett, a senior economist at the American Bankers Association, "feel fairly good about their financial circumstances." ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

HEADLINE: Biracial Politics

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"In the Rural White South, Seeds of a Biracial Politics" (front page, Dec. 30) highlights two important points about race and redistricting: polarized voting is not an all-or-nothing proposition, and black candidates can win office even in majority-white districts with widespread racism.
Biracial politics can have a transformative effect on a community: the more that white voters see a black politician representing their interests, the less easy it is to maintain historic prejudices. And having a black representative in a rural district goes a long way toward shattering stereotypes about the policy positions minority candidates take. 
 This does not mean that districting should be race-blind, but it does indicate that highly gerrymandered majority-black districts work against minority interests by making it more likely that surrounding districts will go Republican and by eliminating the possibility of a biracial politics that was the goal of the civil rights movement.

The Fed Seeks an Even Keel

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve reduced interest rates three times in seven weeks late last year because the global financial crisis was making it hard for companies to raise money, threatening the long expansion in the United States.
 The three quarter-point reductions in the Federal funds rate, to 4.75 percent, helped fuel a rebound in the stock market while providing considerable reassurance to other countries. 
 Although analysts still expect the American economy to slow this year, perhaps enough to require further rate cuts, the continuation of the nation's long expansion no longer appears to be in any immediate danger.

A Decidedly Drab Year for Many Fashion Companies

 BODY:
It's been a tough year for the fashion industry. Among the year's casualties: Isaac Mizrahi, below, lost his financial backing and closed his design business. Anne Klein & Company was put on the block, Kenar Enterprises filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Andrea Jovine shut its doors and Todd Oldham closed his wholesale collection business.
 Faced with sagging sales and profits, Liz Claiborne also fell victim to the industry's malaise. In December, the New York-based clothing maker announced a reorganization that would result in the closing of about 30 stores, eliminate 400 jobs and cost about $17 million. 
 The thinning ranks of design concerns stemmed to some degree from a gradual erosion in consumer confidence as well as a ripple effect from an earlier consolidation among department stores, which weakened fashion's grip on retailing. Consumers reined in their free-spending ways and balked at look-alike offerings available at most chains.
 Publicly held fashion companies sagged. Shares of Donna Karan International, for example, lost about 40 percent of their value. And St. John Knits, seeking to avoid the pressures of Wall Street while navigating the vagaries of the industry and customer fashion dictates, announced plans to go private after five years as a public company.
 Profits at department stores also slipped as sales of apparel flagged and Internet shopping gained followers.

The Debut of the Euro Underwhelms the British
Officially, Britain has been reticent over the euro, but the public debate about Europe's new single currency remains fierce. As major banks prepared over the weekend to trade in the new currency, no one in financial circles seemed to think that Britain would escape the tidal pull of the vast euro market lapping at its shores. A1 

The Clinton Administration policy on the euro has assumed that anything that helps build a more prosperous trading partner on the other side of the Atlantic is good for the United States. But that policy masks some complex issues for the United States. The euro may threaten the dominance of the dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. A6
 
Israel Arrests Cult Members
Israeli police officials arrested eight American members of a Denver-based apocalyptic cult who the officials said were planning to mark the millennium by committing suicide or provoking their own killings in the streets of Jerusalem. The police said the eight belonged to the Concerned Christians cult and planned to destroy themselves shortly before the millennium in order to hasten the Second Coming of Christ. A4
 
Angola Peace Efforts in Doubt
The top United Nations official in Angola called into question future peacekeeping efforts after a United Nations-chartered plane with eight people aboard was shot down on Saturday, the second such incident in a week. The head of the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola said the increasing conflict in Angola and disintegration of the country's 1994 peace accord placed the United Nations peace mission in doubt. A4
 
Pakistani Leader Was Target
A powerful bomb apparently intended for Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif exploded under a bridge he was to cross on a road near his home in Lahore, killing three people. Mr. Sharif was not in the vicinity of the blast and was unharmed, but "obviously it was targeting the person of the Prime Minister," said Mushahid Hussain, the Information Minister, speaking from Islamabad. A9
 
Chinese Dissidents Sentenced
The Chinese police have sentenced two members of a would-be opposition political party to nine months of detention on what a rights group called fabricated charges. Han Lifa and Cai Guihua are the latest members of the nascent China Democracy Party to be imprisoned in the ruling Communist Party's broadest crackdown on dissent in years. (AP)
 
15 Killed in Pakistan Mosque
Gunmen opened fire as Shiite Muslim worshipers prayed at a mosque in eastern Punjab province today, killing 15 people and wounding at least 25, the police said. No one claimed responsibility. The police fear that the attack in Shah Jamal, 180 miles south of Lahore, is part of the relentless violence between rival Shiite and Sunni Muslim sects that has killed hundreds in Pakistan. (AP)

Senators Seek Delay In State of the Union
Several influential senators said that President Clinton should postpone his State of the Union Message if the Senate was still grappling with an impeachment trial when he is scheduled to appear before a joint session of Congress on Jan. 19. The call for a delay, which came from Republicans and Democrats alike, underscored how the 106th Congress will convene on Wednesday under the same shadow of impeachment that sharply divided the 105th Congress. A1
 
Aid for Care of Chronically Ill
President Clinton will announce a $6 billion package of tax and budget proposals today to help provide long-term care for people with chronic illnesses or disabilities, Administration officials said. The core of the initiative is a proposal to give a tax credit of $1,000 a year to people who need long-term care, at home or in an institution. The credit would also be available to some people who care for relatives with conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke and brain injuries. A1
 
Chicago Comes Back to Life
Chicago, pummeled by the most ferocious snow storm in more than 30 years on Saturday, started to come back to life. Streets became passable, but getting in or out of town by air was a problem. A12
 
Gingrich Pitching Tax Cuts
Newt Gingrich may be on his way out of the Speaker's office, but his mind is still actively concocting grand strategies to save the Republican majority in Congress that his critics say he nearly destroyed. Most important, he told a group of conservatives, Republicans need to present themselves as the party of tax cuts. A14
 
Mars Polar Lander Begins Trip
A robot lander and two piggy-backed microprobes embarked on the second of NASA's water missions to Mars, launched atop an unmanned Boeing Delta 2 rocket. After an 11-month journey, the Mars Polar Lander will parachute gently to the surface of the red planet and start scooping up dirt. A15
 
Mrs. Dole May Leave Red Cross
The American Red Cross said that it would make a "major" news announcement today, lending credence to expectations that Elizabeth Dole, the organization's president, would resign, possibly as a first step toward running for the Republican nomination for President. A14
 
New Governor, New Age
Jesse (the Body) Ventura, the former professional wrestler, officially becomes the Governor of Minnesota today. Little is clear about what that means for him and for his constituents, but one thing seems certain: Mr. Ventura will be unlike any governor Minnesota -- or any state, for that matter -- has ever seen.

First Major Winter Storm Arrives With Sleet and Rain
The New York region's first major storm of the winter churned out of the Midwest with a deluge of lashing sleet and record-setting rains that disrupted air travel, flooded roads and neighborhoods and caused hundreds of traffic accidents, including a 50-car pileup in Queens. A1
 
Cancer Centers Competing
Major medical centers are vying with the prestigious and powerful Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for patients, and the competition is particularly keen in New York, which already has more centers with the official designation and the financing of the National Cancer Institute than most regions. The reason for the competition is largely one of money: Cancer has become a big business. A1
 
A Piece of Baseball History
A baseball that was made in Costa Rica for considerably less than $5 will be auctioned next week at Guernsey's, the Manhattan auction house, at a price some think will exceed $1 million. The ball is identical to the other 70,000 dozen supplied by Rawlings Sporting Goods to major league teams last season, with one distinction. It is the ball Mark McGwire whacked over the fence on Sept. 27 for his 70th homer of a record-smashing season. B1
 
More Partisanship in Albany
Lawmakers return to Albany this week for a 1999 legislative session that experts say is likely to yield the same sort of partisanship and acrimony that have become synonymous with the capital. Both Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, and his Democratic rivals in the Legislature enter the new year with their hands strengthened by voters. B1

 BODY:
Call it the nesting instinct. Last year, kitchens, bathrooms and dens made the best-dressed lists of many as consumers favored chenille throws over sweaters, scented candles over trendy perfumes and designer labels on their linens and tableware over ones on their jackets. Also, a strong economy and interest rates hovering at 30-year lows pushed sales of new and existing homes to record levels for the third consecutive year; Fannie Mae estimated that 5.6 million units were sold. Consumers -- especially aging baby boomers, confident about the prospects for jobs and income -- went shopping, lifting home ownership to an all-time high. All told, Americans spent about $1.5 trillion on new loans and refinancings, channeling some of that cash to renovations as well.

HEADLINE: A Tough Match: 'Jesse the Gov.' vs. Daily Grind

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Dec. 29

 BODY:
The new Governor of Minnesota doesn't know exactly what he'll do in office yet, but he has made a decision about his daily schedule.
No appointments before 9 o'clock in the morning, he has told his staff.
Why? 
 "Arnold was very worried about me," the Governor-elect said the other day. "Arnold told me I really have to get back to working out, so that's what I'm going to do every morning."
Arnold would be Arnold Schwarzenegger, of course. And he was offering advice to his friend and fellow muscle man, Jesse (the Body) Ventura, the former professional wrestler who happened to get elected in November to Minnesota's highest office.
As Mr. Ventura officially becomes Governor on Monday, there is still a lot up in the air.
How will Mr. Ventura, who won 37 percent of the vote under the banner of the Reform Party, work with a House of Representatives controlled by Republicans and a Senate controlled by Democrats? What will his policies be? How will a self-styled outsider who ran under the slogan "Retaliate in '98" adjust to being part of the political establishment?
One thing seems clear: Mr. Ventura will be unlike any governor Minnesota -- or any state, for that matter -- has ever seen.
He has already been a subject of the comic strip "Doonesbury" and a guest on Jay Leno's and David Letterman's talk shows. He has signed a six-figure book deal. And he is arranging for the sale of Jesse Ventura action figures and T-shirts with slogans like "In Jesse We Trust."
Even his elaborate series of inauguration events seems unprecedented, including a gigantic party later this month for 13,800 people in Minnesota's basketball arena, for which tickets at $10, $15 and $20 sold out long ago. (Mr. Ventura did, however, forgo his initial promise to arrive at the official inaugural ceremony in a helicopter and rappel down through the Capitol dome -- his staff concluded that was a little too dangerous.)
"This is strange stuff," said Steven Schier, chairman of the political science department at Carleton College. "Usually a governor comes in and you know where he stands, who his enemies are and what he's going to do for the next four years. He's working hard at it and he's smart, but the problem is he's got zero background."
Mr. Ventura, the strapping, chrome-domed, former bad boy wrestler, action-film actor and talk radio host, stunned prognosticators by trouncing two respected and well-known opponents, the Democratic Attorney General, Hubert H. Humphrey 3d, and the Republican Mayor of St. Paul, Norm Coleman.
Many of Mr. Ventura's supporters were young people, especially men, and nearly half had only a high school education. They saw something refreshing in Mr. Ventura, whose previous political experience was as a part-time suburban mayor and who himself voted in only 4 of the last 14 elections.
Now, Mr. Ventura has put away his leather jacket and jeans -- and his occasional camouflage outfit and Australian bush hat.
"Suits used to take me 40 minutes," said Mr. Ventura, who has a gift for quickly shifting between his entertainer and politician personas. "Now I can do it in 12."
He is getting used to a chauffeured sedan instead of his beloved Porsche. And he has submitted to a phalanx of bodyguards, because, he says, "It wouldn't be too good if the Governor knocks somebody down."
Aware he has a lot to learn, he is trying to get off to a strong start. He has assembled an advisory committee and immediate staff, drawing some of the more independent-minded people from all parties, people generally considered skilled and knowledgeable. He has spent time touring the state and visiting every state department. But he has just begun to assemble a Cabinet and says that will take more time.
"We're like the discoverers of the New World," Mr. Ventura said in his transition office in the basement of the Capitol, where he has hung a neon sign with the words "Jesse the Gov" and an image of Rodin's "Thinker," a pose he struck in one of his campaign commercials. "There was no one who could sit there and say, 'Been there, done that.' "
Since the election, Mr. Ventura, who is generally considered fiscally conservative and socially progressive on issues like abortion, has given few concrete hints about his policies, saying he wants to be prudent and consider a range of ideas.
When asked after the election about the details of his tax cut proposals, he responded, "Oh, sheesh."
In a recent speech to farmers, he said he wanted to "deregulate some stuff," which he later said referred to lifting restrictions, like those prohibiting farmers from growing industrial hemp.
And during the campaign, he criticized state-subsidized child care and the state's health insurance program for children. He said that families should not have children until they could afford them without government assistance. And he told college students, many of whom benefit from state tuition aid: "You don't need the government. There are plenty of ways to get through college. You're smart enough."
Mr. Ventura now suggests his actual approach will be less extreme. His chief of staff, Steven Bosacker, said that Mr. Ventura had a habit of saying things that were intended to provoke debate, rather than establish a policy stance.
"I think unfortunately people tend to believe that as soon as you make a comment, that's your firm position," Mr. Bosacker said.
Mr. Ventura is finding that even firm campaign pledges require careful implementation. After promising to give back the state surplus in increments of $1,000 for every man, woman and child, Mr. Ventura is evaluating different options for returning a surplus and wants to wait until the end of the budget period in June to make sure the state has the money in hand.
It is also not clear how he plans to accomplish one of his major goals: reducing school class size to 17 without spending more money.
Still, while he is treading carefully, Mr. Ventura has already managed to push the envelope, especially in an ethically strait-laced state like Good Government Minnesota.
After refusing contributions from political action committees in the campaign, he has accepted corporate donations to finance his transition costs, although he says he does not look at the contributor list.
He has proposed that his wife be paid a salary. And he wants to put the money from selling T-shirts and action figures into his campaign fund, but will give it to charity if the state's campaign ethics board nixes the idea. (He has also asked stores not to sell the popular, but unlicensed, items that came out shortly after the election: T-shirts and baseball caps that say "My Governor Can Beat Up Your Governor.")
"A whole host of things have come out that are extremely unconventional," said Steve Sviggum, the new Republican Speaker of the State House. "I guess I would just as soon that he focus on the job that he ran for."
So far, though, hardly anyone seems to be complaining. A poll in December by The Minneapolis Star Tribune found that more people would vote for Mr. Ventura today than did in November. Only 3 percent answered yes to a somewhat unconventional poll question -- whether they considered Mr. Ventura an "embarrassment."
And Mr. Ventura has another tremendous thing going for him: a state being left in remarkably good shape by the departing Governor, Arne Carlson, with low unemployment, a projected budget surplus of $3.3 billion over the next two and a half years and money from a tobacco lawsuit settlement to boot.
"I don't expect it's going to be a session that's going to produce a lot of new initiatives, and as far as budget, it's a pat hand," said Roger Moe, the Democratic State Senate majority leader. "It's very difficult to screw it up, to be perfectly honest."
Perhaps a more difficult challenge for Mr. Ventura will be balancing his stated desire to "bring honor to this office" with his rebel instinct.
So far, he has satisfied his need to tweak conformity by smoking stogies on the Capitol steps and eating an occasional lunch in "the regular people's cafeteria."
But some experts worry that he might get bored or frustrated.
"I still have a sense that Jesse may become tired of playing governor," said Chris Gilbert, chairman of the political science department at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter. "Not that he doesn't take it seriously, but I think it is another role for him. I wonder how he's going to hold up in April when the legislation is being introduced. I wonder if he's going to really have the stomach and patience to sit through it."

HEADLINE: No Funeral For OPEC Just Yet

BYLINE: By Ron Chernow; Ron Chernow is the author of "Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr."

 BODY:
Even as cruise missiles rained down on Iraq in mid-December, oil prices scarcely budged from their severely depressed levels of about $11 a barrel. In the past, Middle East tension inevitably spooked the oil markets, provoking panic buying. This time, the December price slump presented us with a stunning paradox: we had waged war against Saddam Hussein precisely to safeguard the Persian Gulf oil fields, yet the market's blase reaction to the fighting seemed to underscore the marginal status of Mideast oil in the global economy.
Is our apprehension about Iraq's threat to Arabian oil now sadly anachronistic? In a world brimming with oil -- and with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries providing only 40 percent of it -- should we finally stop fretting about the Middle East? 
 In fact, it would be both foolish and premature to gloat over OPEC's demise. A retrospective glance at the oil industry last year suggests that, far from being liberated from Mideast oil, we may be sliding into a dangerous new era of dependence on the Arab sheikdoms.
In the 1970's, OPEC was the fearsome bogyman of Western politics, able to quadruple prices and impose a punitive embargo on the United States. The resulting shortage riled many economies, provoking rampant inflation, sluggish growth and plummeting stock markets. Sober analysts predicted that oil might fetch $100 a barrel by century's end.
In the 1990's, we have seen the movie running in reverse as squabbling OPEC members have failed to curb a glut that has slashed oil prices to their lowest inflation-adjusted levels in a quarter century. The breathtaking price tumble has helped to tame inflation, spur economic growth and buoy stocks. Commentators now deride the once haughty OPEC as a sorry relic, rent by blatant cheating and factional feuds. In a world flooded with oil, it has seemed to surrender its formidable powers to the marketplace.
Some factors that have humbled OPEC -- including the sharp contraction in Asian oil demand and balmy weather in North America -- are passing phenomena. The great and most lasting threat to the cartel is the technological revolution that has transformed the oil business. Back in 1972, the Club of Rome, sounding the apocalyptic note so voguish at the time, warned that world reserves might be exhausted in a little more than a generation. What its analysts failed to foresee was the amazing ability of technology to take a finite resource and convert it into something seemingly infinite.
Long a low-tech backwater, the oil industry during the past decade has become an exotic showplace of futuristic technologies. Producers can now find and produce oil with exceptional precision and at lower costs than was ever dreamed possible. Special sensors create three-dimensional maps of deep geological formations. Producers can drill horizontally for long distances, extracting oil trapped beneath towns. With computers guiding drill bits for miles underground, producers have resurrected numberless old fields long thought depleted.
The upshot of such innovation is that analysts have radically revised their sense of the earth's oil-bearing potential. Supplies today are dictated not by the amount discovered but by what can be profitably produced at a given price. In Texas, Oklahoma and elsewhere, a new breed of independent oil producer has extended the lives of small, aging fields. Their so-called stripper wells produce 10 barrels or less per day. This might sound insignificant, but they have been furnishing America with about as much oil as imports from Saudi Arabia have.
Unfortunately, the strippers are now reeling from a crisis that may prove fatal. They typically break even when oil is in the $12-to-$15-a-barrel range, but as prices have fallen below that barrier they have suffered a disaster. Small companies are going bankrupt almost daily, and thousands of wells are being capped in the continental United States. The oil service industry is another casualty, with only about half of its available rigs searching for oil off American shores. Even our giant energy companies are curtailing exploration budgets, and this will simply deepen American dependence on foreign oil.
Bolstered by their networks of refineries and gas stations and their strength in petrochemicals, the big oil companies haven't been as vulnerable as their smaller brethren. Yet the spate of recent megamergers shows that their plight, too, has grown precarious. In early December, the Exxon-Mobil merger reunited the two largest pieces of the Standard Oil trust dismantled by the Supreme Court in 1911. Antitrust concerns about the combination have been misplaced: the new colossus will refine less than 14 percent of American oil, compared with nearly 90 percent for Standard Oil.
The merger testifies as much to the partners' weakness as to their strength. When John D. Rockefeller formed Standard Oil in 1870, he aimed to consolidate refiners into a giant cartel that could contain falling prices. In contrast, the Exxon-Mobil and BP-Amoco deals demonstrate that even the biggest companies now accept lower prices as a fait accompli and can sustain their profitability only through stringent cost-cutting and consolidation.
The real predicament shadowing the Exxon-Mobil merger resides with the State Department, not with the Justice Department. Exxon has enjoyed the luxury of inexpensive oil from Alaska and other domestic fields but must now replace these bountiful fields with more expensive oil from abroad. In the past 20 years, no giant new American fields have been discovered to rival the Texas strikes of the early 1900's or 1930's or Alaska in the late 1960's. Because Mobil has lacked a strong base in domestic oil and has been more aggressive in tapping frontiers abroad, it was an attractive partner for Exxon. The major oil companies are too large to bother with tiny stripper wells at home, which means that their future exploration will be largely in the third world. And Big Oil will turn inescapably to the Middle East as the last place left with huge, cheap reserves.
While OPEC today accounts for only 40 percent of world production, it possesses 75 percent of known reserves. And its Persian Gulf members can drain these vast reservoirs for less than $2 a barrel. By contrast, it costs the super-efficient Exxon an estimated $7 to produce a barrel of domestic oil and more than $10 a barrel for foreign oil. Given the dramatic cost advantage enjoyed by Saudi Arabia and its neighbors over foreign oil companies and non-OPEC producers, OPEC may be on the threshold of a new hegemony.
Now that crude prices have sagged to such low levels, each further dollar decline will bankrupt more high-cost competitors and widen the Arabs' market share. Might OPEC deliberately boost production and drive down prices to single digits to recapture control of the oil market?
It seems unlikely that it would do so by design. In the short run, this risky strategy would rob it of too much revenue before it won the compensating gain in market share.
But if the United States slipped into recession, intensifying the glut and pushing oil down to, say, $5 a barrel, the Persian Gulf states would be back in full control. Production and exploration budgets would be sharply reduced outside the Middle East as prices fell below the cost of extracting oil elsewhere.
During the anti-American frenzy of the 1970's, the Arab states nationalized their oil companies, chasing out the large Western companies that had operated their fields in the early postwar years. In response, big oil companies have turned to places that are geographically remote and politically volatile. The countries rich in new oil and gas deposits -- including Nigeria, Angola, Indonesia, Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Colombia -- are also places steeped in corruption, poverty and violence. The acrimonious dispute over the pipeline route that will carry oil from Baku in Azerbaijan to Western markets illustrates the extreme geopolitical hazards that await American policy makers in the next century. Guaranteeing oil supplies will create security problems that may make the Middle East seem a peaceful oasis in comparison.
As chance would have it, the Arab oil states are about to forge an alliance with the Western companies 20 years after most of them lost their concessions in the region. On Sept. 25, a Saudi crown prince presided over a one-hour "tea party" to explore possible cooperation with chief executives from seven American companies. Prominent among the chieftains was Lucio Noto, the chairman of Mobil. Analysts have speculated that one motive for the Exxon-Mobil merger was to combine Mobil's Saudi connections with Exxon's capital to strengthen its bargaining position with the desert kingdom.
Why would Saudi Arabia court American investment at a moment of patent weakness for Big Oil? The Saudis have watched jealously as Mexico and Venezuela have angled to supplant them as the foremost supplier to the United States, the largest oil consumer. Not only is Saudi Arabia loath to cede the American market with Asia in recession, but it wishes to retain the Defense Department security umbrella that accompanied its former status as America's largest oil exporter.
The Mideast oil states would also like to profit from the new technologies patented by American companies and to enlist their worldwide refining and marketing apparatus to sell oil. It was partly in the hope of providing expensive services, including exploration and pipeline building, to producers in the Middle East that BP merged with Amoco and Exxon with Mobil to form a critical mass of capital and expertise. Faced with the extreme risks and production costs in new areas like the Caspian Sea, the American oil companies will be powerfully attracted by any new partnership offered by the Arab states. Iran, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates have already formed joint ventures with foreign companies.
All of the foregoing suggests that if oil prices stay low -- and that isn't certain, especially if Asia revives -- the oil industry of the early 21st century may well resemble that of the 1960's more than that of the 1990's. Far from being extricated from the morass of Mideast politics, we may only grow more entangled.
The low prices of recent years have produced an extraordinary complacency about energy policy. Profligate Americans have turned to sports utility vehicles, light trucks and other old-fashioned gas guzzlers. At the time of the Arab embargo in 1973, the United States produced 9.2 million barrels of oil a day; last year we managed only 6.4 million barrels. Yet nobody talks anymore about our perilous reliance on foreign oil. In fact, energy policy is so seldom discussed in Washington these days that the term has acquired a quaint ring. By focusing solely on deterring Iraqi aggression over the past eight years, we have been diverted from the concern over secure energy supplies that prompted both the gulf war and the recent air strikes in the first place.
It may be naive to assume that anybody in our sex-obsessed capital will care about things as banal as energy conservation, fuel efficiency and the like. But the alternative is to be forever menaced by the future Saddam Husseins who will undoubtedly emerge to challenge the American presence in the Middle East's oil fields.

A Cuban Sound Dancing North

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS 

 BODY:
There has been a flood of traditional records from Cuba recently, and the reasons for it are simple. The first is the descent into irrelevance, perhaps temporary, of the Havana-based Timba dance music world, which started receiving plenty of attention five years ago and is now self-destructing. The second is the international success of the Ry Cooder-produced album, "Buena Vista Social Club," released last year. Given the easy availability of hundreds of fine little local Cuban son bands and older singers playing the same music made by Buena Vista Social Club, it's not surprising that the market is overflowing. Here are a handful of the best; all are available from Descarga, (800) 377-2647 or at www.descarga.com.
 
Ibrahim Ferrer: 'Tierra Caliente'
Mr. Ferrer was the star vocalist with the Afro-Cuban All-Stars (another Ry Cooder production), who released an album in 1997 and toured the United States last year. His own record, with Los Bocucos, is a marvel of syncopation and oddness. "Tierra Caliente" (Egrem) is sort of son and sort of salsa, and it shows a side of Cuban music that Americans used to the authenticity of "Buena Vista Social Club" haven't seen. 
 There are electric keyboards and electric guitars, and the rhythms draw from all over the world. Sometimes the music sounds Haitian, sometimes Cuban, and it is always joyous, with a sense of humor that's palpable whether one understands the words or not. And it has an intensity that only the best dance music achieves.
 
Los Naranjos: 'Mi Son Tiene Piel Morena"
What a rocking little record. With a tres guitar motoring away at rhythmic figures, the music, hardcore son, never stops. Most of the songs are older without being overfamiliar, and the chorus sings away, surrounding the rough tones of the lead singer.
There's a force under the prettiness of the music; suddenly the music is charging down the highway, swinging with power. "Mi Son Tiene Piel Morena" (Eurotropical) is perfectly made; the band is obviously a working group, and its precision helps drive the dance-floor sensibility.
 
El Son Entero: 'Cuba'
Yet another little rock-house of a record. This time it features the tres playing of Luis Acosta Pino, a virtuoso, and when the singers call on him to solo, they call him the killer of the tres. His solos charge the record, zipping around the fretboard, using more of a jazz sensibility -- he even bends some notes -- than the traditional Cuban point of view. The music is built around his solos, and when he starts the band seems to stand back, wondering what's about to pop out of Mr. Acosta's imagination. The group is from the province of Camaguey, and it uses a few unusual rhythms. If anybody needed an argument to prove that the son doesn't stand completely still, this is it. There are occasional imperfections in the singing in "Cuba," (Playasound) but the feeling and the solos make up for the problems.
 
Laito Sureda: 'Ahora Comienzo a Vivir'
Mr. Sureda is 84 and the title of the record, "Now I Start to Live," has some truth to it and some wishful thinking, given Cuba's economy. Mr. Sureda sang with Celia Cruz in the Sonora Matancera and spent much of his life traveling. "Ahora Comienzo a Vivir" (Eurotropical) catches him in bolero, son and guaguanco territory, backed by Su Sonora, a swinging small band with a few trumpets. It is sophisticated dance music in an older style influenced by jazz, and Mr. Sureda's large, intense voice floats over the classic sound of the band. The music is nicely balanced and gentle, but with a rhythmic tug.
 
La Banda Municipale de Santiago de Cuba: 'Fanfare Cubaine'
This is an oddity, a record of the community brass band from Santiago, home of the son, produced by the French ethnomusicologist Emmanuelle Honorin. The band, started in 1900, is big and full, and it takes on famous sones, danzones and congas and turns them into lilting, beautiful orchestral pieces. "Fanfare Cubaine" (Buda) includes the Buena Vista Social Club's "Chan Chan," with tubas announcing the bass line. The recording is a footnote, but a gorgeous one that suggests the breadth of imagination and the conservative essence of Cuban music.

HEADLINE: Burberry Modernizes and Reinvents Itself

BYLINE: By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO 

 BODY:
It was a neat trick, and between Rose Marie Bravo and Roberto Menichetti, they seem to have pulled it off. They took a moldering old British clothing company called Burberrys, known mainly for its plaid umbrellas and raincoat linings, altered the name to Burberry and gave it a spiffy new look without destroying its essential character.
Ms. Bravo, the chief executive, and Mr. Menichetti, the design director, accomplished the feat by looking at the 150-year history of Burberry and updating the best of its attributes into a thoroughly modern line of women's clothing and accessories. 
 The trench coats, the plaid, the innovative fabrics -- they're all there, but reinvented for a new age. The trench coat has been streamlined, stripped of extraneous epaulets and tabs. The plaid (which the British call a check, reserving "plaid" for tartans) has come out from under wraps to appear on skirts and dresses. New ways with materials include coating canvas with voile and distressing leather with perfume. But there has also been a return to gabardine, the fabric that Thomas Burberry, who founded the company in 1847, had specially woven for the durable coats worn by sportsmen and the military.
The first collection of the new Burberry, for spring of this year, was quietly introduced last September in the company's London showroom. Although it wasn't shown on the runway with all the hoopla that entails, the line took the fashion world by storm. Many fashion magazines borrowed pieces to photograph, and retailers all over the world bought the collection.
In stores where once just a smattering of raincoats could be found, there are now motorcycle jackets and trench coats in buttery soft leather, jersey T-shirts and hip-slung skirts that bare the midriff, motocross pants of stretch canvas with insets of leather, ankle-length kilts without pleats, and plaid dresses of Irish linen loomed on antique machines. Colors are mainly cool neutrals, with touches of sky blue, mauve and a yellow inspired by a pair of the Duke of Windsor's trousers.
The first styles are now arriving in Burberry's own stores, in Bergdorf Goodman in New York, Jeffrey in Atlanta, Louis of Boston, Joseph and Harrods in London, Colette in Paris, Joyce in Hong Kong and Taiwan, Trois Pommes in Geneva and Zurich, and Club 21 in Singapore. Barneys New York started selling the clothes last week in its Madison Avenue and Beverly Hills stores.
"We made a big commitment," said Judy Collinson, an executive vice president of Barneys. "Only 15 percent of the delivery is in now, and the leather coats are already selling. The line has two things we always love: beautiful, modern, amazing fabrics and the old English sports tradition. The marriage of the two things has been done beautifully. There's a lightheartedness to it, but the quality is definitely there. We were so excited when we saw it in London. It was something new and exceptional."
Joseph Boitano, the executive vice president of Bergdorf Goodman, called the line "very sophisticated, in its color palette and styling."
"It's very clean sportswear, with a bit of a twist, but still keeping the Burberry concept," he said. "It's very item-driven, and that's very much how our customer shops these days."
The words of praise are music to Ms. Bravo's ears. Since she left the presidency of Saks Fifth Avenue in October 1997 to reinvent Burberry, she has hired designers, found new factories in Italy, eliminated inappropriate licenses and set up a new band of distributors, dropping those that were channeling goods into discount stores in Asia.
"This is just the beginning, just the DNA of the new Burberry," she said last week in the women's department of the Burberry store at 9 East 57th Street. The first shipment of spring clothes was hanging on racks, and nearby the new handbags and shoes were on display.
Besides Mr. Menichetti, the new Burberry team includes Eugenia Ulasewicz, as president of retail and wholesale operations in the United States; Michele Smith, as senior vice president for women's wear; Robin Marino, as senior vice president for accessories, and J. Stanley Tucker, as senior vice president for men's wear.
Mr. Tucker is currently working on the men's-wear licenses, changing factories to upgrade the current line of suits and coats and adding more luxurious fabrics. Meanwhile, Mr. Menichetti is designing the signature men's collection, which will be made in Italy; it will be introduced next July for the spring 2000 season.
Ms. Bravo decided to concentrate on the women's wear first, she said, because it had no fashion image.
"Burberry had a masculine image," she said. "The women's was anonymous. We felt we could make a big statement in the women's world."
"We were very fortunate in that Burberry has such a reputation globally," she added. "When you think of all the designers and brands working so hard to build world recognition, and the Burberry check is as recognizable as the Coca-Cola bottle."
But that hasn't stopped the design staff from tinkering with the classic plaid, making it bigger on certain fabrics and changing the background color slightly. There are even two tone-on-tone plaids, in beige and in dark blue, used so far only for handbags. There are also sleek new leather shoulder bags that are molded to follow the curve of the hips.
The trench coat has been reinterpreted as a double-layered dress, and the pleatless kilt is fashioned from two pieces that wrap around the hips. There are knee-length and ankle-length skirts, and blazers with a feminine cut.
Mr. Menichetti, who worked on Jil Sander's men's wear line for four years, comes from a family of Italian fabric and clothing manufacturers. When he went to Burberry last year, he immediately began to build on its tradition of marrying fashion and function. He worked closely with Italian mills to develop special fabrics, because like Thomas Burberry, he believes that everything begins with the fabric.
Despite the fact that he is Italian and Ms. Bravo is American, they are committed to the Britishness of Burberry. "When Roberto and I first talked," Ms. Bravo said, "he instantly understood that the man of a certain taste, whether in Italy or Japan or wherever, always had something by Burberry. We felt we could latch on to that and go into the next century."
The path to the new Burberry hasn't been totally smooth. The company's profits nose-dived 90 percent for the six months ending last Sept. 30, mostly because of the economic problems in Asia, which had been Burberry's biggest market.
"The debacle in Asia is complicated, of course," Ms. Bravo said. "We totally stopped parallel trading, where distributors sent our products to discount stores. That was a big business, but over a period of time it was deleterious to the brand. You'd have products selling at regular price in a store on one side and at a discounted price on the other side of the street. That detracts from what we're trying to do.
"So much business was tied up in Asia. That will come back in time. A lot of London business was from Asian travelers, and the idea now is not to be so driven by the tourist trade. We want to gear ourselves to the local audience, wherever our stores are. Burberry has over 50 stores worldwide. We want to build Burberry into an international luxury company with a British style and sensibility."
Burberry's parent, Great Universal Stores, is a multifaceted British company that is also in the mail-order business. Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale is the chairman of Great Universal, and Victor Barnett is the chairman of Burberry Ltd. They have both given their blessings to the changes Ms. Bravo has made.
"Victor and Roberto and I are working together to clean up and develop the business," she said. "One of our strategies is to re-establish ourselves in the United States and London and have a more balanced portfolio around the world."
What Ms. Bravo is doing is similar to what other old-line fashion houses have been doing, starting with Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel and continuing through Tom Ford at Gucci and, more recently, John Galliano at Dior, Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton and Michael Kors at Celine.
The next step for Burberry is to put the women's collection on the London catwalks during the fall shows next month. Ms. Bravo said she wasn't sure Burberry was ready to face the critics last season. Now she is.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Weighs Swifter Action to Bar Economic Crises

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund, sharply criticized for how it handled crises from Southeast Asia to Russia, is discussing an overhaul of its operations that could let it intervene directly in national economies long before they get into deep trouble.
The ideas being discussed in the fund -- and by outsiders like George Soros, the billionaire -- build upon and go substantially beyond proposals made by President Clinton and leaders of other industrial powers in October. 
 At that time, trying to calm investors who were pulling out of developing countries, the Administration backed some cautious proposals that would allow the fund to act before currencies collapsed and economic "contagion" spread around the globe.
The first real experiment with that approach began in November, when the I.M.F. put together a $41 billion "precautionary" loan package for Brazil, hoping that early intervention would prevent the kind of crises that struck Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia and Russia.
The central idea now being discussed in the I.M.F. -- and outlined in a speech on Sunday by Stanley Fischer, its No. 2 official -- is to turn the fund into a "lender of last resort," making available pools of money for countries that, like Brazil, appear threatened by global forces beyond their control.
Mr. Soros outlined his ideas for an enlarged role for the I.M.F. by suggesting in the Financial Times that the fund become a global "central bank."
But the Clinton Administration made clear today that it had reservations about such a grand expansion of the fund's role.
Such a system, while intended to head off trouble, could create new risk. The I.M.F., for instance, has shown little ability to predict which nations are most at risk.
Moreover, there remains the problem of what to do about nations like Russia, which have resisted the kind of economic reforms that would qualify them for I.M.F. aid. But when countries like Russia get into trouble, the West feels compelled to provide aid anyway, as it did last summer, when it determined that Russia was too big -- or too nuclear -- to fail.
"There are a lot of interesting proposals out there, but there are a number of concerns associated with all of them," a senior Treasury official said today, on condition that his name not be used. "We're still working through how to address those concerns, and whether we can adequately address them at all."
In an interview today, Mr. Fischer, a former chairman of the economics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he was not trying to "turn the I.M.F. into some kind of superpower."
"If everything we are trying to do works, there shouldn't be five crises in a year, as we've just had, and the I.M.F. should be able to do less lending, rather than more," he said. "The whole idea is prevention."
Mr. Fischer said he was speaking for himself, but acknowledged that many of the ideas had been widely discussed in the fund. So has the question of how the institution can polish its battered image. In December, it hired Edelman Public Relations Worldwide and Wirthlin Worldwide, a polling company, to recommend how the fund can explain itself around the world. That may be especially difficult in Asia and Russia, where the higher interest rates prescribed by the fund are blamed by many for deepening rather than alleviating their recessions.
In essence, Mr. Fischer's proposal would reward nations for good behavior, as defined by the I.M.F. and its board, which is dominated by the United States, Japan and Europe.
Nations that strictly supervise their banking systems, that disclose far more information about their financial state and that balance their budgets would "pre qualify" for I.M.F. help. Presumably investors would be reassured, and speculators would not take the risk of betting against that nation's currency.
"For such a scheme to work, lender-of-last-resort loans would have to be denied to countries that do not qualify," Mr. Fischer said in his speech to the American Economic Association. Those countries might be forced to pay higher interest rates once they do come for help, he said.
There were echoes of Mr. Fischer's proposal in the recommendation from Mr. Soros. Mr. Soros argued that the I.M.F. should act more like an international central bank, imposing "conditions not only on the country concerned but also on the creditors" who lent the country money, thus regulating capital flows.
Undoubtedly, that idea would encounter resistance, both in Congress and among developing nations. Many countries recoil at the idea that the fund, in return for its aid, could dictate economic and monetary policy.
"For the moment at least," Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said in a speech today, "it is difficult to imagine nations ceding control over their money or their banks to an international institution."

Japanese Stocks Hit 3-Month Low

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Japanese stocks suffered their biggest declines in three months today on concern a stronger yen would prevent exporters from meeting their profit forecasts.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average sank 426.28, or 3.1 percent, to 13,415.89, its biggest drop since Oct. 8 and its lowest close since Oct. 16. The Toyota Motor Corporation and Canon Inc., which depend on United States sales for a half and a third of operating profit, respectively, paced declines. 
 The dollar fell to as low as 112.75 yen, well below the assumptions of 115 to 130 yen used by many exporters for their earnings forecasts.
Toyota, whose earnings forecast assumes 120 yen to the dollar for the six months ending in March, fell 3.8 percent, to 2,955 yen. Canon shed 3.9 percent, to 2,320 yen. Every one-yen fall in the United States currency's value takes 2.6 billion yen ($23 million) from Canon's operating profit, which was 162 billion yen in 1997. The Sony Corporation, whose forecast assumes 115 yen to the dollar, fell 2.2 percent to 8,050 yen. Bucking the declines, Nissan Motor gained 1.2 percent, to 350 yen.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Slid Again in December

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
United States manufacturing had its weakest month in December since the end of the last recession in 1991 as production slumped, factories cut jobs and weak demand hurt prices.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's index of manufacturing activity dropped to 45.1 last month from 46.8 in November. The index has fallen for three consecutive months; since June, it has held at less than 50, a measure indicating that the number of manufacturers who said business deteriorated was greater than the number of those who said it improved. 
 Manufacturing, which represents about a fourth of the economy, has been in a slump for most of the last year even as the overall economy grew by about 3.7 percent. While slower economic growth is likely this year, there is no sign of a recession as high-technology industries, the service sector and housing offset the weakness in manufacturing.
December's index was the lowest since a reading of 44.5 in May 1991, just as the economy began to recover from a recession. The decline was mirrored in components of the broader gauge.
The production index, a gauge of current output, fell to 46.5 in December from 48.6 in November. And the employment index, a measure of hiring plans and labor-market conditions, fell to 40.8 in December from 44.9 in November -- the lowest since January 1992, when it was 40.6 at a time of more than 7 percent unemployment. In November, the jobless rate was 4.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Motorola Revises Job-Cut Numbers

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO Jan. 4

 BODY:
Motorola Inc. said today that it cut 1,000 more jobs than expected from its chip business, reflecting steps by the big semiconductor and cellular phone maker to cut costs and reduce its chip-product line to increase profits.
Motorola said it cut 6,000 semiconductor jobs by the end of last year, 20 percent more than its earlier target of 5,000, from a total of 51,000 semiconductor workers worldwide. Of the total cut, only 450 were laid off, said Ken Phillips, a company spokesman. He said the remaining cuts were done through buyouts or attrition. 
 Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., has suffered a decline in its chip business as prices declined and economic crises in Asia reduced demand in the semiconductor industry. Last June, Motorola said it planned to cut about 10 percent of its work force, or 15,000 jobs, by June 1999.
Motorola shares, which rose $3.9375, to $65 today, have surged about 69 percent since the company reported third-quarter earnings on Oct. 5. It is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings Jan. 13.
The company is expected to earn 23 cents a share for the quarter, the average estimate of analysts polled by the First Call Corporation.

HEADLINE: Harold Edelman, 75, Architect Who Helped to Save Small Treasures for New York

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
Harold Edelman, an architect and teacher who helped to preserve some of New York's small treasures -- a park, an ornate library and a quiet church -- died on Dec. 21 at the Beth Israel Medical Center hospice. He was 75.
He died of cancer, his family said. 
 Mr. Edelman, the founding partner of the Greenwich Village architecture firm that bears his name, designed buildings that were not the lofty castles that shape the city's spiked skyline, but the smaller buildings that fill the lower spaces, places where people live, worship or rest when sick. His firm was the architect for the Two Bridges urban renewal area on the Lower East Side, and designed 1,364 apartments between the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. He also designed housing for the elderly on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and health clinics in the Bronx.
But Mr. Edelman will probably be remembered for twice planning the reconstruction of St. Mark's in the Bowery, one of the city's oldest churches. In 1978, a nearly completed restoration project was ravaged by fire. Colleagues said Mr. Edelman did all the design work personally, finishing with plans for the series of stained glass windows that frame the building's interior.
Mr. Edelman was born in Brooklyn and received his architecture degree from Cornell University in 1943. After serving in the Army Signal Corps in World War II, Mr. Edelman spent a year studying in Paris at Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts.
He taught at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn from 1952 to 1962, and in 1960, founded an architecture firm with his wife, Judith Hochberg Edelman, and Stanley Salzman.
While teaching at Pratt, Mr. Edelman learned of the impending demolition of the Jefferson Market Courthouse, the turreted red-brick hall in the center of Greenwich Village. He assigned his architecture students to draft possible uses for the doomed building. Two students suggested using it as a branch library, the form in which it survives today.
Mr. Edelman was one of nine architects assembled to redesign Washington Square Park. The committee's design, drafted in response to a city-proposed plan, maintained the crossing paths at the heart of the park and rejected an attempt to turn half of the area into a great lawn.
In addition to his wife of 51 years, Mr. Edelman is survived by a sister, Edna Friedman of Bethesda, Md; a brother, Paul, of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.; two sons, Marc, of Manhattan, and Joshua, of Madrid, and four grandchildren.

New Rival Arrives, but Dollar Is Still the World's Champion

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The euro -- the new European currency -- had a positive debut yesterday in foreign exchange dealings. But it is still unclear how the euro will fare against the dollar this year and what kind of challenge it will make over time against the United States currency.
"The dollar will stay the world's predominant currency but the euro will be second," said Robert C. Standing, managing director in London of the global trading division in Europe for Chase Manhattan Bank. But, he added, "the euro will be the first credible challenger." 
Others think the euro may be more than a challenger. C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said that the question was not whether the euro would rival the dollar but simply how quickly it would happen.
"Some people say 3 years, some say 10 years," he said, "but there is no doubt that it will happen."
While the talk is of the euro challenging the dollar, what the new currency really represents is another big step toward a global economy, in which the United States will face more competition. In this case, the euro is a mechanism helping to make a united Europe far more competitive with the United States.
"It's a culmination of the globalization trend," said Mr. Bergsten, adding that "what the Europeans have done is show how you can take maximum advantage of globalization."
In afternoon trading yesterday, the euro cost $1.18060, up from the $1.17400 value of the old European currency unit on Dec. 31. The ecu, a basket of European currencies that was the precursor to the euro, converted to the euro on Friday.
The euro rallied from its New York lows as the stock market reversed course, with the Dow Jones industrial average giving up most of its gains for the day. The dollar fell much more sharply against the Japanese yen, ending at 112.07 yen, from 113.57 Thursday, in light trading, which some traders said might have exaggerated the decline.
The euro, some traders said, was buoyed on buying by European banks and strong rallies in European stock markets from Germany to Spain, France to Italy. Traders also said that trading was orderly, though volume was moderate. Traders "were working their way in slowly," Mr. Standing of Chase said.
For Americans used to following the German mark, the Italian lira and the other currencies from the 11 nations now represented by the euro, the new currency may be a little confusing. Until now, quotes of the value of the dollar against marks or lire have described how many of them one dollar can buy. For example, the dollar was worth 1,639.34 lire yesterday. (Americans will still have to look at the values of individual European currencies because availability of the euro in coins and bills is to be phased in over three years.)
But the euro's value will be quoted in how many dollars it can buy. When the euro moves, for example, from $1.17 to $1.18, it is strengthening and the dollar is weakening. The British pound is quoted in the same fashion.
Since the euro is not yet available in coins or bills, Americans traveling on the Continent this year will still spend marks, lire and French francs when using cash. But goods can be bought in the euro on credit cards, and visitors can get euro-denominated travelers checks. Britain and three other nations in the European Union -- Greece, Denmark and Sweden -- are not part of the euro.
As for the strength of the euro this year, that is open to debate. Plenty of currency forecasters think the euro will be strong; others think it will be weak. The answer, Mr. Standing of Chase said, "depends on the views of where the two economies go."
Many forecasters expect growth to be stronger in Europe than in the United States, which would help the euro. But Paul Podolsky, a currency strategist at BankBoston, thinks growth in Europe will be slower. He also feels that the new European Central Bank will have a more difficult time navigating in its new environment than others expect.
Concerning yesterday's trading, Mr. Podolsky said European authorities got what they wanted: an "uneventful" session. He said they did not want the euro to fall in value nor did they want it to have a volatile day.
Within the foreign exchange trading community, the biggest significance of the start of euro trading has been how it will affect jobs.
The industry has been scaling back and preparing for the arrival of the euro for about a year, and with particular intensity since May when the starting date for trading in the new currency was set.
"We have been streamlining and adjusting for all of 1998," Mr. Standing said. Another factor that made life difficult for many foreign exchange traders last year, he said, was the crash of many emerging-market currencies. This forced many firms to cut back or get out of trading those currencies altogether.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Stocks Begin the Year Mixed, as Technology Issues Dominate

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In the first trading session of the new year, stocks jumped, then retreated and finally closed mixed yesterday, as traders and investors began to focus on coming quarterly earnings reports and a fairly hefty calendar of expected initial public stock offerings.
The flow of new stock offerings had slowed significantly after the market's steep selloff last summer, effectively capping the pool of securities from which investors could choose. Therefore, a rise in new supply would alter the equation. 
 "The market enjoyed four months of no new supply, a strong merger-and-acquisitions market and strong inflows of funds," said Michael Clark, head of United States stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston.
"The new-issue calendar is as big as I have seen, which means things will not be so favorable as they have been," he said. "That will leave the spotlight squarely on earnings, and I don't think they will be so great."
Yesterday, for instance, Goldman, Sachs & Company sold 50 million shares in the MBNA Corporation, the big credit card company. Goldman had bought the block of new shares from the company, in a transaction that raised $1.2 billion for MBNA. Shares of MBNA, the session's most actively traded issue, closed at 24, down 13/16 on the day.
The Nasdaq composite index set a new closing high, propelled by expectations that when earnings are reported, they will show that the fourth quarter was a good one for technology companies. The Nasdaq index, which is heavily weighted with technology issues, rose 15.36 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 2,208.05. Intraday gains were even bigger -- early in the session the index traded as high as 2,233.57. Last year, the Nasdaq rose 39.6 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 16.1 percent last year, began 1999 with a slim gain of 2.84 points, to 9,184.27. Before a number of computer-generated sell programs hit the blue-chip index, though, the Dow had been up as much as 168 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted a loss of 1.13 points, to 1,228.10. During morning trading, the index traded as high as 1,248.81. The S.& P. rose 26.7 percent in 1998.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,742 to 1,446. Volume on the Big Board was active, at more than 892.5 million shares traded.
Some analysts attributed the market's strong early advance to a surge in European stock prices.
Share prices on the Continent surged on optimism that the arrival of the euro, the common currency for 11 European nations, will help to increase economic efficiency and growth, developments that if realized would be beneficial for both American corporations and the United States economy.
Share prices on the French, German and Italian exchanges were up more than 5 percent yesterday. Of major European markets, only Britain, which is not adopting the euro, registered a decline.
Technology stocks, among the strongest market performers last year, retained their popularity yesterday. Microsoft rose 2 5/16 a share, to 141. Intel, the maker of computer chips, gained 2 1/4, to 120 13/16. Cisco Systems, the networking company, gained 2 1/2, to 95 5/16.
Internet companies also posted big gains. Amazon.com shares shot up 33 11/16, to 354 15/16. Those of Yahoo rose 11 1/16, to 248.
But America Online, trading for the first time as a component of the S.& P. 500 index, fell 6 5/16, to 148 13/16.
Shares of Spyglass, a maker of Internet software, declined 7, to 15, after the company said it expected to report a loss of 14 cents to 16 cents a share. Analysts had been expecting Spyglass to eke out a profit of about a penny a share.
Among the Dow stocks, AT&T gained 2 1/8, to 77 7/8, after the company said it had dropped a plan to separate its consumer and corporate businesses. Shares of DuPont, which ended a $750 million bid for a unit of Imperial Chemicals Industries, rose 2 3/16, to 55 1/4, on the expectation it would seek a more attractive acquisition candidate.
But International Paper fell 2 11/16 a share, to 42 1/8. And I.B.M., whose stock was one of the Dow's most impressive performers last quarter, fell 1 3/8 a share yesterday, to 183. General Electric also slumped, losing 1 7/16, to 100 9/16.
The day's big gainers also included E*Trade, the on-line securities broker. Its shares jumped 8 21/32, to 55 7/16, after the company announced a 2-for-1 stock split.

Trading Begins Smoothly As Euro Enters Markets
The euro had a nearly flawless debut in world markets as European financial institutions opened for business without a hitch and Europe's new single currency climbed in value against other major currencies.
In its first full day of trading, the euro opened at $1.17 and climbed to nearly $1.186 before falling back to about $1.18. Far from being unsettled by the uncertainty or technical glitches, the stock markets in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Madrid all jumped by 5 percent or more. But the reaction was much more subdued in the consumer marketplace, where there was little evidence of change. Page A1.

Prices for Treasuries Tumble As Investors Look Overseas

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as the dollar slumped and European stocks and bonds soared on the euro's first day of trading, curbing demand for Treasury securities.
"There's a lack of interest in U.S. Treasuries," as investors turn to European and other securities with the advent of the single currency, said Graham Allen, who oversees $33 billion of fixed-income securities at Wells Capital Management in Los Angeles. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond declined 27/32, to 101 19/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.15 percent, from 5.09 percent on Thursday.
Bonds followed the dollar lower, as the euro climbed in its first day of trading, and stocks from Frankfurt to Milan surged. That happened as the creation of a $10 trillion euro-denominated securities market increased demand for the currency on its first day of trading.
Most major stock indexes among the 11 European nations adopting the euro rose more than 3 percent, with Italy's benchmark index climbing more than 6.4 percent. European bonds also rose, driving yields to record lows, while speculation of selling by hedge funds also weighed on the market, traders said.
Gains in United States stocks for most of the day also hurt Treasuries.
Investors and bankers said that 1999 would probably start with as much as $40 billion of investment-grade and $15 billion of junk-rated bond sales in January.
While the names of many coming borrowers are yet to be announced, investors said that finance companies and borrowers with well-known names will top the list.
Treasuries slumped even after a manufacturing report suggested the economy was slowing.. The National Association of Purchasing Management index of manufacturing activity unexpectedly fell to 45.1 for December, from 46.8 in November.
Results of the yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.893	97.765	High Rate	4.38%	4.42%	Coupon Yield	4.49%	4.58%	Low Rate	4.33%	4.37%	Median Rate	4.37%	4.41%	Total applied for	$30,572,552	$29,820,980	Accepted	$11,620,494	$11,359,303	Noncompetitive	$1,306,671	$1,155,598	
 
Both issues are dated Jan. 7, 1999. The three-month bills mature on Apr. 8, 1999, and the six-month bills mature on July 8, 1999.

Without a Hitch, the Euro Opens To Trading in World Marketplace

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 4

 BODY:
The euro, Europe's new single currency, had a nearly flawless debut in world markets today as European financial institutions opened for business without a hitch and the euro climbed in value against other major currencies.
From London to Paris to Frankfurt and beyond, stock exchanges and banks opened serenely despite a grueling weekend in which millions of computers had to be reprogrammed to handle euros. 
 "What we are observing today is the natural and happy birth of the euro," said Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the Bank of France.
In its first full day of trading, the euro opened at $1.17, climbed to nearly $1.186 and by afternoon in New York was trading at $1.18060. Far from being unsettled by the uncertainty or technical glitches, the stock markets in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Madrid all jumped 5 percent or more.
Britain, which has thus far refused to adopt the euro, had a less euphoric day. The FTSE stock index ended up roughly even while the pound slipped against the euro.
On European streets, there was little sign that anything had changed. Even in downtown Frankfurt, which is home to the European Central Bank, few stores were posting prices in euros.
At Kaufhof, an upscale department store in the city's financial center, signs boasted, "We will make you ready for the euro," but none of the prices were listed in euros.
And plenty of people were befuddled. Because euros will be usable only for electronic payments until Jan. 1, 2002, some German bank customers did not understand why their banks would not give them euros in cash. Others were annoyed that banks were suddenly ordering them to identify the currency they were using when writing checks.
Even bank employees were perplexed about how, exactly, to open a bank account denominated in euros.
"This will be a sort of experiment," said Monique Pouzet, a teller at Credit Commercial de France in Paris, as she opened a binder marked "Memento euro." After a moment's study and a few key strokes, Ms. Pouzet reported with a smile that the experiment was a success. "You can pick up your euro checkbook in about one week, apparently," she told a customer.
Traders, bankers and Government officials warned that it would take several more days to know for sure whether the huge technical conversion was successful. But the evidence today pointed toward a remarkably smooth start for the euro and toward its acceptance as a serious competitor to the dollar as an international currency.
"Technically, there is absolutely no problem at all," said Michael Bartmann, a securities dealer on the floor of the Frankfurt stock exchange. "The only problem is that people have to get used to the new numbers. Trading volumes are very low right now, probably because people need time to get adjusted."
None of the elaborate "dress rehearsals" for the euro involved the full range of financial institutions at one time. So, although individual institutions seemed to function well today, the real test will come when all of them -- banks, brokerage firms and settlement systems -- have had a chance to thoroughly interact with one another in settling accounts, or processing their transactions, after the markets close. Bank executives said that would take several days of trading.
"Before we declare this a complete triumph, let's just wait until the settlement is done of the first few trades," said Graham Bishop, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney. "Once we have pushed through to the end-of-the-week settlements, then people will feel a lot happier."
Peter Wolf-Koppen, head of euro projects at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said: "There are still two important milestones in front of us. One of them comes today when we have to post all the day's transactions to all the accounts. The other will be in settling transactions with other institutions."
One trader in Frankfurt commented: "There is definitely potential for problems. What could happen is that you get orders in euros and in marks, and in that case you would see complete chaos. We will have to wait and see whether the banks have fully implemented the conversion."
All in all, both industry executives and European central bankers said the conversion seemed a success. Most central banks, including the German Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy, said they had received no distress reports during the weekend conversion or today. And both big and small financial institutions said the conversion had been easier and faster than they had expected.
Deutsche Bank, which had more than 3,000 workers on duty over the weekend, said today that it had reprogrammed all its computers by 10 A.M. on Sunday. In London, Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney had wrapped up their work by Sunday evening.
"It went absolutely perfectly, much faster than in our dress rehearsals," said Detlev Rahmsdorf, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank.
Mitchell Shivers, head of Merrill Lynch's euro conversion project, was equally optimistic. "It went tremendously and far exceeded our expectations," he said this afternoon in London. "It's been unprecedented -- very unusual to see an industry pull together and accomplish something like this."
Though many industry experts worry that smaller banks may turn out to be weak links in the chain of processing payments, executives at several smaller institutions said their conversion to the euro seemed to go smoothly, too.
Vincenzo de Bustis, chief executive of Banca del Salento in southern Italy, said all the bank's operations seemed to be function properly when business started this morning.
"We worked on the conversion all weekend," Mr. De Bustis said. As of early this morning, "exchange operations and transfers both within Italy and abroad went without any problems," he added.
Currency traders in Australia and Asia had already bid up the price of euros, and there was considerable evidence that Asian fund managers were buying euros as a hedge against global economic turmoil. The buoyancy continued after the European markets opened, though traders noted that the volume of activity in both stock and currency markets was very low.
Economists said it would be a mistake to read much significance into the rising price of the euro, but they said the activity today was consistent with the general strength that individual European currencies have enjoyed for much of the last year.
"We predicted that the euro will be a stable currency, and that is what we are seeing today," said Petra Koehler, a senior economist at Dresdner Bank. "I think there was also some relief that the conversion went well."
All the effort for conversion was of little interest to ordinary bank customers and shoppers, who have heard so much for so long about the euro but cannot feel the soft comfort of a thick wad of bills or drop a shiny new euro coin into a vending machine.
That most German stores continued to post prices only in marks today reflected, in part, a residual hostility toward the new currency among many Germans, who still treasure the mark as an anchor of stability.
But it also reflects the fact that most people do not really need to do anything in euros for the time being. Executives for both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank said that far fewer than 1 percent of their customers had asked for euro-denominated bank accounts.
"The euro is a great thing for Europe, but it makes no difference to me in my daily life," said Egon Weber, a customer at the Frankfurter Volksbank. "If I had a lot of customers in other countries, a euro account might be useful. But for the moment, there isn't any point."
Many German bank customers may soon be furious about the euro. Some banks say they will not process bank transfers if customers forget to specify on the form whether the payment is in euros or marks.
"If a customer forgets to indicate the currency, we will have to clarify each case individually," said Herbert W. Staub, a board member at Frankfurter Sparkasse, a savings bank.
In France, where the dream of a single European currency first took hold, stores and banks were far more hospitable to the euro.
At the Virgin Megastore on the Champs-Elysees and at Galeries Lafayette, the flashy department store in downtown Paris, clerks said they had been taking euro-denominated checks since Saturday.
Michel-Edouard Leclerc, head of the Leclerc chain of stores, went so far last weekend as to take a group of journalists along on a shopping trip in which he paid for his purchases with euro-checks.
And Le Printemps, another big department store, is offering until Jan. 15 to deliver anything ordered from its Internet site anywhere in Europe for three euros, or roughly $3.50.

HEADLINE: Jerry Brown Sworn In as Oakland's Mayor

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Jan. 4

 BODY:
People here expect Jerry Brown to be a different sort of mayor. On his first day, he did not disappoint.
From morning meditation at his downtown loft to his earnest pronouncements of what "we can do together" before throngs of well-wishers outside City Hall on a windy, chilly afternoon, to his tieless suit -- the shirt, as usual, had a banded, priestly collar -- the three-time candidate for President and two-time Governor of California became the Mayor of the state's seventh-largest city in his classic, inimitable fashion. 
 Mr. Brown, the 60-year-old native San Franciscan who moved across the bay to Oakland five years ago, formed a research organization -- We the People -- and started a radio talk show, marched six blocks from the swearing-in ceremonies at the Paramount Theater to the rally at City Hall, escorted by a jazz band and what seemed like the entire city.
And despite pickets from a group that says the new Mayor's promise to reduce crime amounts to an order for the police to round up blacks, Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s inauguration was greeted with the wild enthusiasm that politicians' dreams are made of. He gave just a three-minute speech at his swearing-in -- after a tedious ceremony in which Board of Education members and City Council members took their oaths. But his words, judging from the audience's response, were inspirational. When he said, "Everything will be made right," the cheers had an almost religious zeal.
At his rally, Mr. Brown announced four goals: to reduce crime, to attract 10,000 people to live downtown, to help parents and teachers create public charter schools, and to encourage celebrations, festivals and artistic performances.
"There's so much that we can do together," Mr. Brown said, as the crowd shouted its approval.
Oakland has high hopes and expectations for its new Mayor. Mr. Brown won the nonpartisan primary with more than 58 percent of the vote, avoiding a runoff with 10 opponents. His ballot proposition to give the mayor more power than the city manager, was supported by 75 percent of voters. And his inaugural festivities, "Celebrating Oakland," which offered citizens a jam-packed schedule with scores of local acts -- musicians, visual artists, dancers and poets -- were touted today as a sure-fire sign that the new Mayor is planning to showcase the best Oakland has to offer.
"He's a breath of fresh air in the American political syndrome," said Tom Siporin, a poet and yogi who hobbled on a crutch to attend the rally in the City Hall plaza. "He's a great attempt to show there's hope in the inner city. He's a visionary."
Oakland, with nearly 400,000 residents -- 41 percent of them black, 26 percent white, 17 percent Hispanic and 16 percent Asian according to Census Bureau figures -- suffers from an inferiority complex. The city has been called homely and crime-ridden, a poor cousin to San Francisco, for so long that these have become its defining characteristics.
Meanwhile, the city's assets -- a thriving port, handsome neighborhoods high on the Oakland Hills, a growing community of artists and musicians, many of them refugees from San Francisco's sky-high rents -- have been largely ignored.
Residents believe that the new Mayor's political prominence and pull as a magnet for news coverage, could give the city the respect and attention it deserves.
"Oakland is a beautiful city," said Clement Sinclair, a teacher, "and with a strong Mayor we will have an even better Oakland. People who have run away from Oakland in the past will now be glad to come back."
Henrietta Hamilton, who has lived in Harlem and the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Watts and Venice, flew to Oakland for the inauguration.
"I would like to change the world," Ms. Hamilton said, "and I can't imagine a better person than Jerry Brown to do it here for Oakland."
Some Oakland political pundits are already criticizing Mr. Brown's plans as too vague. Skeptics doubt whether a would-be philosopher king once known as "Governor Moonbeam," with all his New Age-ish language, could also be a pragmatic nuts-and-bolts administrator.
"Jerry just doesn't have the mind for these everyday matters of city government," said Robert Warwick, a member of a local Democratic club that backed a Brown opponent. "I know Jerry well. He used to be involved with Zen Buddhism, and so was I. But he was a terrible Governor. That stupid tax reform proposition he pushed ruined the state for 25 years, and now he's here."
No matter what Mr. Brown accomplishes, Mr. Warwick said, given the expectations, it will not be enough.
"The idea that one charismatic guy could come here and turn things around is ridiculous," he said.
But Mr. Warwick's was a minority opinion, one that Mr. Brown surely did not hear above the roars of approval today.
"We all know politics is not doing too well in this country lately," Mr. Brown told the city. "But in Oakland, we're putting it all together. It's real in this town. We're going to break the mold."

HEADLINE: California's New Governor Promises to Overhaul Schools

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 4

 BODY:
Declaring "a time to do great things again," Gray Davis took office today as the 37th Governor of California, pledging to overhaul the troubled public schools of the nation's most populous state as the centerpiece of his efforts to shepherd its growth and preserve its prosperity in the coming years.
In his inaugural address, Mr. Davis, the first Democrat to hold the state's top job in 16 years, sounded forceful notes of contrast with his Republican predecessor, Pete Wilson, and to a lesser degree with his onetime boss, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., whose 70's-era skepticism led him to proclaim a time of lower expectations for the Golden State. 
 "Today we begin a new chapter in the history of California: the era of higher expectations," said Mr. Davis, who began his political career as Mr. Brown's chief of staff, but today sounded like a more optimistic Democratic forebear, Mr. Brown's father, Edmund Sr., who presided over the state's explosive growth in the 1950's and 60's. "We will embark in a new direction guided by our lasting values."
After thanking Mr. Wilson for cooperation in the transition to a new administration, Mr. Davis several times implicitly rebuked his predecessor's campaigns against affirmative action and illegal immigration, telling an audience at the Memorial Auditorium here that "you can finally ring down the curtain on the politics of division."
Those words left Mr. Wilson and his wife, Gayle, the only people seated on the stage amid a thunderous standing ovation.
But Mr. Davis, 56, who faces strong pressure from Democratic interest groups to deliver long-delayed raises and long-sought policy changes, made clear that he planned no radical departures, though Democrats control all three branches of state government for the first time since Jerry Brown's day. Instead, Mr. Davis, a cautious career politician who has spent most of his adult life aiming for the job he assumed today, repeated the moderate mantra that helped him win a 20-point victory over his conservative Republican opponent, former State Attorney General Dan Lungren, last fall.
"I will govern neither from the right nor the left, but from the center, propelled not by ideology, but by common sense that seeks better results," Mr. Davis told an overflow crowd that included Vice President Al Gore and former Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts.
Mr. Davis is to begin work in earnest this week, when he presents his first budget on Friday and, keeping a campaign promise, calls a special session of the State Legislature to focus on improving school accountability, increasing teacher preparation and assuring that every child learns to read by the end of the third grade. None of those tasks will be easy for Mr. Davis, who won office with strong support from the powerful state teachers union, which feuded bitterly with Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Davis fired a not-so-subtle warning shot across the teachers' bow today, saying, "Yes, there are some deficient teachers and principals out there," and adding, "Under my administration, they will either get better -- or they will be encouraged to find another line of work."
"The time has come to restore California's public schools to greatness," he vowed. "The voters demand it, our future depends on it, and I am determined to make it happen."
The Republican minority leader of the State Assembly, Rod Pacheco of Riverside, said he agreed with "a lot of what I heard."
"Republican themes," Mr. Pacheco said. "That's good. We'll do what we can to help him."
Just how much Mr. Davis can do about education in the short term remains to be seen. In the last two years of Mr. Wilson's administration, the Legislature or voters approved several changes, from smaller class sizes for early elementary grades to mandatory testing of students to an end to most bilingual education, that are still being phased in.
And despite a booming economy, state and local government budgets remain relatively tight, in part because of restrictions on taxation like Proposition 13, the 1978 ballot measure capping local property tax rates.
But while Mr. Davis has made it clear that he will not try to reopen past policy debates, like the ballot measure that overturned state affirmative action programs, he has already sent some signals of change, like appointing the state's first black and Asian-American Cabinet members. And with a 23-year career in state politics, Mr. Davis, who campaigned against a field of richer, flashier Democratic rivals with the slogan, "Experience Money Can't Buy," has a good idea of what he may be in for.
For much of his career, as a State Assemblyman, Comptroller and, for the last four years, Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Davis was mocked as a tireless fund-raiser who rode his staff hard and was as bland as his first name. But he is having the last laugh now.
"You know, sometimes a person meets his moment," Mr. Davis said in an article today in The Sacramento Bee. "I have always been a pragmatist and moderate by nature. I have always been more interested in solving people's problems than in espousing a rigid ideology.
"You read all these commentaries about me, and they're always saying how dull and stodgy and predictable, but that's just the way I am. Happily, the people were in the mood for the kind of person that I am."

HEADLINE: Merger Rumors Abound at Big Auto Show

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 4

 BODY:
When top auto executives gather here each winter for the North American International Auto Show, the talk in the halls is usually about the latest car or, more recently, the latest sport utility vehicle or pickup truck. But at this year's show, there is also another theme: merger rumors.
Ever since Daimler-Benz A.G. and the Chrysler Corporation announced their merger last May, and particularly since the two companies completed the deal last November, the industry has been full of speculation on who might link up next. But top industry officials here said today that while many auto makers were cautiously and tentatively holding discussions, that did not necessarily mean another deal was imminent. 
 The company most often mentioned as a potential acquirer is the Ford Motor Company, which has accumulated $22 billion in cash, a hoard equal to nearly a third of its market value. Just before Christmas, rumors started that Ford was in talks to acquire Volvo of Sweden or BMW of Germany.
Jacques Nasser, who became Ford's chief executive on Friday with the retirement of Alex Trotman, expressed amusement today at the rumors. "I was lying back on a beach over the Christmas period reading about all these wonderful strategic meetings being held that I clearly wasn't involved in," Mr. Nasser said in an interview at Ford's huge, two-level display here, which is almost as long as a football field.
Mr. Nasser declined to discuss either Volvo or BMW but did say, "Everyone's talking to everyone else." Yet Ford views the prospect of an acquisition as a potential opportunity rather than a necessity, and therefore is in no hurry, he said.
"Haste, in these circumstances, I wouldn't put a premium on," Mr. Nasser added.
BMW has insisted that it wants to stay independent and that the controlling Quandt family has no intention of even discussing a sale. "BMW will remain independent and, contrary to all the speculation and rumors in the industry, there have not been any discussions," said Helmut Panke, a member of BMW's management board.
Mr. Panke was particularly emphatic that BMW had not been negotiating any deals with Ford. "I can really confirm that there haven't been, are none and will be no discussions" with Ford, he said.
Bodil Eriksson, a senior vice president of Volvo, said today that while the company was willing to talk to other auto makers about cooperating on production and other ventures, it was not interested in being acquired.
Volvo is small by industry standards. In terms of sales, it is twice the size of the Microsoft Corporation but only one-seventh the size of Ford. Smaller auto makers that lack broad ranges of models and international operations are increasingly seen as the most likely to engage in mergers.
The General Motors Corporation, already the world's largest auto maker, has shown little interest in growing through acquisitions. G. Richard Wagoner Jr., G.M.'s president, said today that there had long been speculation that the auto industry would undergo considerable consolidation, but the DaimlerChrysler deal might yet turn out to be an exception rather than a new rule.
"We've been talking about this business getting down to 'X' major players -- 5 or 10, pick a number -- for a decade," he noted.
Jens Neumann, a member of Volkswagen A.G.'s management board, took a similar position, saying that informal talks did not automatically mean that more big transactions were on the way.
DaimlerChrysler officials started the current merger speculation by insisting that their transaction was necessary to achieve greater economies of scale. But even DaimlerChrysler has had trouble moving quickly on further deals.
Jurgen E. Schrempp, the company's co-chairman, said in mid-November that he expected a decision by the end of 1998 on whether to buy the Nissan Motor Corporation's stake in Nissan Diesel. But no decision has been reached, and Thomas Stallkamp, DaimlerChrysler's president for North American operations, said today that the company was concerned the Japanese economy might not have hit bottom.
Ford has also been rumored to be interested in Nissan, but Ford executives have become leery of any deal because of concerns that Nissan's balance sheet may not reflect the true extent of its debts.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Its Offer Spurned, Union Will Vote on N.B.A. Plan

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Calling the players' latest labor proposal inadequate, the National Basketball Association's negotiating committee voted unanimously yesterday to reject it, reaffirming that it would recommend the cancellation of the season to the league's board of governors when it meets in New York on Thursday.
Hours later, the union said it would put the league's most recent proposal -- one that Commissioner David Stern has said is final -- to a vote of the full membership at a meeting of players in New York tomorrow. Stern has been pressing the union's bargaining committee to do just that, but until yesterday it had refused. 
 Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players association, said the union had decided to call the vote even before Stern's comments last night. He said the players were changing their stance on a vote "to assure that the owners understand the level of player resolve and the degree of opposition to the N.B.A.'s onerous demands."
Hunter said the union would continue to recommend against accepting the proposal.
"I'm glad to hear the players will have an opportunity to be heard," said Russ Granik, the league's deputy commissioner. "I hope they don't vote thinking that the owners are not serious about the recommendation to the committee on Thursday."
League officials who spoke on condition of anonymity expressed concern about the format of the vote. The union will decide today how to hold the vote, in accordance with its bylaws; it is unclear whether the voting will be open or secret.
In his strongest comments yet regarding the potential loss of the season, Stern said the union's latest offer not only fell short of the league's desires but even represented a step backward. After meeting for an hour with Hunter and Patrick Ewing, the union's president, Stern said a settlement appeared unlikely.
After announcing the 9-0 vote by the league's labor committee to reject the players' offer, Stern talked about the stalemate in dire terms. "The N.B.A. owners are going to act on the recommendation," he said. "We're going to lose a season and probably the careers of 20 percent of our players. It's a terrible thing."
The commissioner also spoke openly about the future of the league in the event of a canceled season, adding that he could envision using replacements for the unionized players, whom the owners locked out more than six months ago.
Stern had already said that he would recommend the season be scrapped if the players did not accept the league's offer by Thursday. So his dire comments and the committee's vote may be part of an 11th-hour negotiating strategy intended to put pressure on the union. If so, it worked, at least as far as persuading the players' association to call for a general vote. More than 400 players have been invited to New York to take part tomorrow.
 If the players vote against their 19-member negotiating committee, the union would presumably rethink its position and agree to the league's proposal. If the players support their negotiators, it could fuel last-minute talks before Thursday's deadline.
"The player members of the N.B.P.A. negotiating committee previously rejected the N.B.A.'s final proposal unanimously," Hunter said in a statement. "The committee stands by that determination and will continue to recommend against acceptance of that proposal."
 "To assure that the owners understand the level of player resolve and the degree of opposition to the N.B.A.'s onerous demands, the negotiating committee will convene an all-players meeting in New York on Wednesday, Jan. 6, at which time the general membership will be asked to approve the negotiating committee's recommendation to reject the N.B.A.'s final proposal."
Not all of the union's members were convinced that Stern and Granik would recommend canceling the season before negotiating with the union. Buck Williams, a former union president, saw the management's action as a negotiating ploy.
"It's still Monday," he said. "I would caution that no one be alarmed until the 7th at least. I'm sure Stern wants to apply as much pressure as possible. David Stern is banking on a players' vote. My whole issue is that we shouldn't vote now."
Union officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, were concerned about putting the owners' offer to a vote of the general membership. The feeling was that the players would not be voting for the deal but instead voting to salvage what's left of the season and might therefore take any offer on the table.
But with several players recently publicly requesting a vote of the general body, Hunter and the negotiating committee decided to gamble. If the players do not accept the deal, it sets the stage for either a whirlwind last round of talks or it insures that the N.B.A. will become the first major sports league to lose an entire season to labor strife.
"We plan to educate them about the pros and cons of the deal and we will ask that they support the negotiating committee's decision to reject the proposal," Ewing said. "We'll see how the guys vote and then take it to the N.B.A."
Reflecting on the possibility of using replacement players in the 1999-2000 season, Stern said: "It's not necessarily a pretty sight early on, but obviously if we have to rebuild the league, we'll rebuild the league."
The announcement last night came after Ewing and Hunter had an almost fruitless meeting with Granik and Stern.
The union was hoping its most recent concessions, including agreeing to a maximum salary for players with at least 10 years' experience, would prompt the league to negotiate further.
The main stumbling block could be how much revenue would be paid to the players during the six-year deal. The sides also have differences on the length and terms of a new rookie salary scale and a number of other economic issues.
In its proposal, the union asked that 55 percent of revenue be devoted to salaries in the fourth year, while the owners have offered 53 percent. In the fifth year, players want 56 percent while owners are offering 53.5. And in the final year, players want 57 percent -- the amount they received last season -- while the league is offering 54 percent.
"I needed to see a proposal that reached for ours," Stern said. "Instead I saw one that went backwards." Stern added that another full bargaining session "doesn't seem likely at all."
More than three months of the season has been lost since the owners locked the players out. The players have lost about $500 million in salaries. Ewing alone has lost more than $8 million. "I don't think it's in the interests of the owners to blow the season up," he said. "I still believe we're going to have a season."
Stern was dubious. "Stay tuned and see on Thursday how close we are," he said. "In order to see who's more accurate in his depiction of where we are, we're going to have to lose a season."

HEADLINE: U.S. READY TO EASE SOME RESTRICTIONS IN POLICY ON CUBA

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
The United States is ready to let more people and more money flow to Cuba, senior American officials said today, while rejecting a fundamental review of American policy toward Cuba.
The moves would let Cuban citizens receive millions more dollars from American friends and family members, allow them to buy more American food and medicine, permit more direct flights between the two countries, renew direct mail service from the United States and let the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban national baseball team play ball in March, the officials said today. 
 Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright formally recommended the steps to President Clinton today, and the White House is expected to announce them on Tuesday.
A senior Administration official, speaking in Ms. Albright's seventh-floor State Department offices, said the measures "are intended to strengthen support for the Cuban people," to allow them "some elbow room" and "some modicum of independence."
Other officials said the moves are intended to increase educational, religious and humanitarian contacts with Cuba.
There was no immediate reaction from the Cuban Government.
Reforms in American policy toward Cuba were under review three years ago, but were halted when Cuba shot down Cuban-American pilots for an anti-Castro group. The proposals moved forward after Pope John Paul II visited Cuba a year ago. "The Pope's visit created a wedge" through which political light and air can stream into Cuba, a senior Administration official said.
Another factor was the death last year of Jorge Mas Canosa, the leader of the Cuban American National Foundation and the most vocal and influential anti-Castro Cuban-American political figure in the United States.
The nature and timing of the announcement also arose in part from a report just completed by the Council on Foreign Relations, published under the signature of two former senior State Department officials. The report proposed essentially similar steps, and some bolder ones, such as granting some American businesses licenses to operate in Cuba and promoting Cuban-American military ties. The council's report said it was intended to "break the current logjam" in American policy toward Cuba.
Under the steps recommended by Ms. Albright, the American embargo against Cuba, imposed 37 years ago, would remain in effect. So would more restrictions added after the pilots were shot down. Individually, some of the changes would be incremental expansions of existing policies on private relief aid to Cuban citizens. Taken together they represent a consensus among top officials that, since the 40-year-old reign of Fidel Castro is likely to end soon, the United States must "promote a peaceful democratic transition" by injecting American money, culture and ideas into the isolated island.
"We are doing what we can to expand the space" in which Cuban citizens can breathe more freely, the official said.
The measures endorsed by Ms. Albright can be undertaken by Presidential order, without Congressional approval. Senator John Warner, a Virginia Republican, said he was "concerned that these efforts fall way short" of what could have been accomplished by a national commission he proposed to revise American policy toward Cuba. Ms. Albright recommended that no such commission be formed, saying it could never resolve the question of the economic embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba in 1962.
"It's a lost opportunity for America to review a policy of basic isolationism," Senator Warner said tonight. "We allow food and medicine to get into North Korea. We allow food and medicine to get into Iraq. And we still deny this tiny country basic things."
Reacting to the news in Miami, the Cuban American National Foundation issued a statement today saying that most of the measures to be announced are consistent with current policy and praised the Administration for refusing to re-evaluate American policy toward Cuba.
The most important proposal is to increase the flow of dollars to Cuba, officials said. Today these remittances are limited to $1,200 a year from a Cuban-American family to relatives in Cuba. The amount could increase sharply under the plan proposed by Ms. Albright: any American citizen could send $1,200 a year to anyone in Cuba except to senior Communist officials. Religious groups, human rights groups and other organizations may be able to send larger sums to sister organizations under proposals still in the works, officials said.
The most politically appealing of the proposals was for holding two exhibition games between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban national team. Baseball is immensely popular in Cuba, a wellspring of baseball talent. However, a baseball official said tonight that fears of angering anti-Castro Cuban-Americans could delay or scuttle a trip to Havana planned for this week by members of the Orioles organization.
The Orioles have been privately discussing such an exhibition with United States officials since 1995. Their owner, Peter Angelos, is a major financial contributor to the Democratic Party.
But in February 1996 the Cuban Air Force shot down two unarmed civilian aircraft flown by Cuban exiles testing Mr. Castro's will. President Clinton almost immediately signed legislation to tighten the embargo and strengthen trade restrictions against Cuba. The moves, which pleased anti-Castro Cuban voters in Florida and New Jersey, froze attempts to thaw American-Cuban relations, including the idea of an American baseball team playing a game in Havana.
The Orioles organization received Washington's permission for a trip to Havana later this week to discuss how to schedule the games. If they can be set up so that the Cuban Government receives little financial benefit from them, and so that profits go to authorized charities benefiting Cuban citizens, Government officials will grant the teams the license to play ball -- once in Havana, once in Baltimore -- during the exhibition season in March.
At least one staunchly anti-Castro Senator, Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, said tonight that he found the new steps unobjectionable. "Our ultimate weapon against Fidel Castro is the flood of ideas," he said. But he said the Administration's idea of sending American food to independent restaurants and independent farmers in Cuba was naive, since few such institutions exist and those that survive are tiny.
Mr. Toricelli, a Yankees fan, jokingly warned that "having the Orioles going to Havana may be good foreign policy, but it's bad baseball strategy." The Baltimore team finished fourth in the American League's East Division with a 79-83 record last year.
Administration officials said the forthcoming report from the Council on Foreign Relations helped to shape their new proposals, in part because it has received quiet support in conservative circles, leading them to believe that the steps put forth by Ms. Albright to the President today would be seen as bipartisan.
In an interview, one of the report's two principal authors, Bernard W. Aronson, a former Assistant Secretary of State, said: "American policy has succeeded in containing the spread of Cuban Communism. That battle is over. We can move to a new stage in our policy. We should, because within the shell of Communist society in Cuba there is a fragile civil society clawing its way to the surface."

Real Bulls Are Listless

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The running of the bulls? Sauntering, perhaps. Meandering, maybe.
As blase New Yorkers stole sidelong glances, 10 star-crossed bulls took Wall Street -- well, not exactly by storm. If the beasts' listless performance yesterday was any indication of what is in store this year, investors might want to bail out now. 
 The 8 A.M. spectacle was held outside the New York Stock Exchange building in frigid weather, attracting a smattering of bleary-eyed Wall Streeters.
"If this performance means anything, we could be in a lot of trouble," said a financial analyst, Josh Rappaport, 33, of Manhattan.
The bulls, owned by a company called Animal Actors in Glen Gardner, N.J., looked a bit sedate, and were certainly in no hurry to rush through the concrete canyons for the amusement of the harder-charging financial types who call Wall Street home.
They -- the bulls, not the financial types -- were kept away from pedestrians by a railing set up along Wall and Broad Streets. Both streets were closed to traffic during the "race," which took several minutes to finish.
The event, billed as "Bull Monday," also featured the prognostications of Ben Stein, a television personality and writer, who said, "I believe the bull is a much stronger predictor of the economy than groundhogs could ever be with the weather."
During last year's inaugural running of the bulls, the company says, the animals predicted the market's merger mania (when one bull "vigorously" pursued another) as well as the market's tumble and subsequent recovery (when another bull skidded and fell, threatening the rest of the herd before all eventually righted themselves).
So what did Monday's race foretell?
"Well, bull No. 5 won and No. 6 took second, so divide the five into six," Mr. Stein said. "Which means there will be a 12 percent gain in the Dow in 1999 and only a standard 30 percent deviation in that prediction."
In other words, absolutely nothing.
The event was sponsored by Bestfoods,an Englewood, N.J., company that makes Skippy peanut butter and other products.

HEADLINE: Now, Midsize Is Beautiful;
Cincinnati Exemplifies the Cities Driving the U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI

 BODY:
When a recruiter offered her a job as a research specialist at a rapidly growing medical company, Kimberly Belknap grabbed it and moved here from Grand Rapids, Mich., to get herself, as she put it, on a more lucrative career path.
The new job, auditing doctors who test new drugs for pharmaceutical companies, pays nearly $60,000 a year. Ms. Belknap earned that much in Grand Rapids, but only by holding two jobs, and the long hours were getting to her. So was the lack of opportunity. As a 36-year-old physiologist, she had already risen, in her main job, to research coordinator at a local hospital. 
 "I liked the feel of this city," Ms. Belknap said. "It is much larger but very conservative, like Grand Rapids, and the cost is about the same." For $660 a month, she has a two-bedroom apartment with a fireplace. And there is opportunity in a city with a big university, teaching hospitals, a young biotechnology industry and other growing companies like Kendle, the one that employs Ms. Belknap. "I have already been approached," she said.
Cincinnati is prospering, drawing professionals like Ms. Belknap to companies that are expanding or putting new operations here. Jobs in this Ohio River metropolis are multiplying at a nearly 3 percent annual rate, on the strong side for cities its size -- higher, for example, than the 2.4 percent rate in Salt Lake City but lower than the 4 percent for Austin, Tex. The national average is 2.3 percent.
Midsize American cities -- not only Cincinnati, Austin and Salt Lake, but Denver, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Mo., Sacramento, Calif., Jacksonville, Fla., Charlotte, N.C., and more than a dozen others -- reflect the strengths that have sustained the American economy in the 1990's and, more recently, kept it growing in the face of economic turmoil abroad.
Corporate America has found in these cities a fertile ground for the service sector job creation that has played so big a role in the current expansion. AT&T, for example, has a huge telephone operator center in Jacksonville; Microsoft and Vanguard chose Charlotte for some of their new service operations and Integral Technologies, a new software company with 100 employees, came to life in Indianapolis, financed by a local venture capital company, one of many that have sprung up in midsize cities.
Public spending, particularly for downtown redevelopment, like the two sports stadiums and the riverfront highway under construction here, also plays a role in these cities' prosperity. So do tax breaks and other subsidies that the cities use aggressively to coax companies to move or expand there. But the main engine is a plentiful pool of workers who are not too expensive, even those who are college educated and highly skilled.
"Five years ago, everyone was predicting that companies would move to Montana or some other rural state," said Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist and urban expert. "The key now is the middle-sized city, 750,000 to 2 million people, that can provide enough amenities, enough of the right sort of labor pool, to attract companies, encourage expansion and create jobs."
Greater Cincinnati, with 1.9 million people spread over 13 counties in southern Ohio and northern Kentucky, offers such a pool. Most of the nation's job creation in the 1990's has been generated by companies in the service and financial sectors, Labor Department data show. And they have hired mainly among two groups of workers. One group, near the high end, college educated like Ms. Belknap and very skilled, accepts $40,000 to $80,000 as a satisfactory wage. The other, at the low end, often fairly skilled but either just starting out or not as well educated, settles for less than $25,000.
Smaller cities, even if they have this mix of workers, lack the nexus of business services -- accountants, lawyers, advertising agencies and transportation -- that corporations need, said Mark Zandi, chief economist of RFA, an economic consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. And larger cities are saddled with the urban social problems and the unionized workers that corporate America tries to avoid.
The prosperity in Cincinnati could dissipate. Even as new companies arrive, long-established ones could falter. Auto sales, now strong, could fall, hurting the numerous parts suppliers here. China, a big customer of General Electric Aircraft Engines, could cease to be an enthusiastic buyer of the narrow-bodied airliners equipped with the jet engines that G.E. assembles here at a sticker price of $5 million an engine. Or stock prices, whose rise has encouraged a flourish of borrowing and spending, could falter, extinguishing wealth among thousands of shareholders here in such hometown companies as Procter & Gamble and Fifth Third Bancorp.
But if the booming stock market helps explain the spending and home construction so evident in this city, Megan McCoy helps explain why expanding companies like Fidelity Investments choose cities like Cincinnati to put new operations.
Ms. McCoy, 24, is one of the more skilled people at the low end. After graduating in May 1997 from Miami University in nearby Oxford, with a degree in finance, she joined Fidelity, the Boston-based mutual fund and financial services company that is a unit of FMR. Years ago, Fidelity had all its workers in Boston, and the most sophisticated operations are still there. But as Fidelity grew, it spread across the country, and now 60 percent of its 27,000 workers are in regional centers like the one here, which is Fidelity's largest, with 3,500 employees -- up from 300 in 1992.
Ms. McCoy is a phone operator, taking calls made to an 800 number by Fidelity clients who want to cash in their 401(k) plans. "I wanted to get into the securities industry, but I did not want to be thrown right away into cold calling," she said of her decision to join Fidelity.
She commutes from the Hyde Park neighborhood, where many young singles live, to a quiet, wooded campus of modernistic office buildings near the city's huge airport, on the Kentucky side of the Ohio, in one of the two Kentucky counties that are part of Greater Cincinnati. There, using answers that come up on her computer, she counsels Fidelity clients who are retiring or leaving a company.
For this, Ms. McCoy earns just under $12 an hour, or nearly $24,000 a year, although with regular overtime, her total pay in 1998 was roughly $28,000. With many other workers like Ms. McCoy eager to get started, other companies have also set up telephone operations here. Citibank, a unit of Citigroup, and G.E. Information Technology Solutions are the latest.
Distribution is another growing Cincinnati activity, because of the giant airport, which is the second-largest hub of Delta Air Lines. From its campus, Fidelity mails the monthly statements to all of its 12 million clients, as well as the checks they receive and a variety of other materials. Seven hundred people, earning $18,000 to $23,000 a year, work in mail. An administrative staff for the entire Fidelity operation, as well as a variety of technical workers -- more than 500 people in all -- earn between $40,000 and $75,000.
"The work ethic here is extremely strong," said Paul F. Smith, manager of the Fidelity campus.
The public subsidies are also robust. As a lure, Fidelity got tax relief equal to about 5 percent of the $100 million construction cost for its five-year-old campus, a free highway to its hilly site, and, starting in January, a telephone center at Northern Kentucky University, a state school 10 minutes away by car, where 200 students will do the same work that Ms. McCoy does -- for $2 or $3 an hour less in pay.
Indeed, no major corporate undertaking seems to happen in the Cincinnati area anymore without a public subsidy. That is true of other American cities, although Cincinnati, with strong support from the Kentucky and Ohio governments, is more aggressive than most. And the subsidies flow, whether the company is being drawn here, like Fidelity, or is long established, like Procter & Gamble, which gets property tax abatements for new investments, and Duke Realty Investment, a developer.
Duke built and recently opened a gray concrete and tinted glass shopping center on Fountain Square, the busiest downtown area. Palomino, a trendy, lamp-lighted restaurant, is a tenant. Tiffany's is another, and so are a Brooks Brothers clothing store and a Lazarus department store. But the city government, not Duke, purchased the choice site for $80 million and leased it to Duke for monthly payments that cover, in effect, only $10 million of the city's outlay.
"We could not have gotten into this," said James Gray, a Duke vice president, "if the city had not presented us with that modest lease."
A different view of Cincinnati's appeal emerges from the city's leaders. True, they say, wages are lower than in the Northeast, or on the West Coast or in Chicago and Detroit. But the cost of living is also much less. The hub airport, greatly expanded in recent years, plays a decisive role as a corporate lure, they argue. And the riverfront construction project, featuring new football and baseball stadiums for the Bengals and the Reds, each demanded by the teams, gives the city an indispensable lure.
"When we are talking to businesses about locating here," said Robert L. Wehling, a senior vice president at Procter & Gamble, the city's largest employer, "if you don't have professional sports teams, you are not going to make their cut."
The saucer-shaped foundation of the new football stadium is already in place and bulldozers have cut the wide swath of an eight-lane highway to replace a road now running through the riverfront site. Two thousand feet upriver, the Reds' new stadium will rise almost on top of the team's present stadium.
"Between these two bookends," said Andis Udris, director of economic development, "we will have retailers, restaurants, offices, a museum -- basically items that complement tourism."
In full swing, the five-year, $800 million construction project, financed through a half-cent increase in the sales tax, will generate 2,000 jobs, many at local supplier companies, city officials estimate. That is roughly 7 percent of the 25,000 jobs added in Greater Cincinnati in 1998.
"The riverfront stadiums are marketing," said Bob Bedinghaus, a commissioner of Hamilton County, which includes downtown Cincinnati. "They show that this is an exciting place to live and work."
But they are not what encouraged Candace Kendle Bryan and her husband, Christopher C. Bergen, to form Kendle, the medical company, after they moved here from Philadelphia to be near her mother. They have since expanded from 63 employees in 1991 to 350 today in Cincinnati. Many are nurses, pharmacists and physiologists like Ms. Belknap. They audit doctors who test drugs on patients before the Food and Drug Administration rules on licensing the drugs.
"There has to be a big enough health care industry, a critical mass, so that we have people to draw from," Mr. Bergen said, "and there has to be alternative jobs for our employees who don't work out or who want other opportunities."
Far from being attracted by the stadium development, Larry Martin, a 35-year-old molecular virologist from Seattle, was worried that Cincinnati might be too conservative, too straitlaced. But the opportunity for advancement and the salary at P.& G.'s new pharmaceutical research center -- more than $40,000 to start, a big jump from the $28,000 he had been earning in cancer research -- drew him. "It was a total career decision," he said. Although still a bachelor, he has already purchased a suburban home.
But for all the growth, there are caveats. The city's black population does not share equally in the prosperity. The black unemployment rate for the area is at least 8 percent, more than double the 3.4 percent rate for the work force as a whole. And some of Cincinnati's job gains, like those of other midsize cities, are someone else's losses. Ashland Oil, for example, is shifting its headquarters to Cincinnati from smaller Ashland, Ky.
Still, Mr. Zandi, the economist, said, "There are no hard numbers, but most of the new jobs in midsize cities seem to represent expansion rather than transfer."

HEADLINE: THE POP LIFE;
Best Memories Of a Musical Year Full of Echoes

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
Last year was a momentous one for the music business. Record stores, music labels and the concert industry all underwent massive consolidation putting them under the control of a shrinking number of corporations. And use of the computer for downloading and playing music exploded, particularly on college campuses, much to the chagrin of those few corporations.
Unfortunately 1998 was not momentous for the music itself, commercially or critically. Of the year's Top 10 recordings, 7 came out in 1997, including the best-selling albums, the "Titanic" soundtrack and Celine Dion's "Let's Talk About Love." 
 The year was one of waiting: for follow-up records that didn't materialize, for anticipated albums that disappointed, for next big things that never were.
Hip-hop albums flew to the top of the charts and then plummeted, while most albums with staying power were by manufactured teeny-bopper bands like 'N Sync. Promising groups whose first album didn't sell well enough didn't get a second chance, while performers whose albums sold well were sent on long tours that kept them out of the studio. The business focused on hit singles at the expense of complete albums and careers.
Reflecting a status quo year for popular music, the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times selected few newcomers in their lists of the Top 10 releases of 1998, which appear below. Sometimes familiarity may breed contempt, but this year familiarity bred admiration as well-known performers took chances.
 
Jon Pareles
 
1. Lauryn Hill, "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" (Ruffhouse/Columbia). Instruction and confession, righteousness and heartbreak -- along with hip-hop, reggae, rhythm-and-blues and touches of old-fashioned soul -- all swirl together on an album that lives up to extraordinary ambitions.
 
2. Bob Dylan, "Live 1966/The 'Royal Albert Hall' Concert" (Columbia). Friction produced incendiary sparks as Bob Dylan faced a heckling audience in Manchester, England. Goaded by the naysayers, he and the Hawks came up with molten, bluesy, savagely funny folk-rock. The music was supremely self-confident, inventing itself on the spot.
 
3. Carlinhos Brown, "Alfagamabetizado" (Metro Blue/Capitol). Melody and drive find new configurations in the music of Mr. Brown, the most important songwriter to emerge from Bahia, Brazil, in the 1990's. From rhythmic dynamos to tender ballads to carnival-propelled raps, he stays as graceful and smart as his finest Brazilian forebears.
 
4. Beck, "Mutations" (DGC). Jettisoning samples and looking past irony, Beck and his band took just two weeks to make an album that's both folksy and untraditionally warped. The lyrics ponder decay, exhaustion, funerals and endings; the music, gentle but sly, suggests that hope won't disappear.
 
5. Bloque, "Bloque" (Luaka Bop/ Warner Brothers). Rock still sounds wild and dangerous in the hands of this Colombian band. Mixing regional rhythms with funk and jazz, Bloque turns discontent into a party that could easily get out of hand.
 
6. R.E.M, "Up" (Warner Brothers). Audaciously reshaping its identity, R.E.M. turned to introspection for an album that reveals itself on repeated listening. Wandering from Stereolab to the Beach Boys to Leonard Cohen, the songs consider the global economy, love, death and faith.
 
7. Tricky, "Angels With Dirty Faces" (Island). Now that trip-hop is no longer new, Tricky tore new fissures in the music, coming up with some of the year's most disorienting grooves. The songs throb and totter, stutter and scrape; odd meters and Tricky's paranoid rasp pull listeners into a zone where every step could lead to a trapdoor.
 
8. Hole, "Celebrity Skin" (Geffen). Concealing her fury within gleaming pop tunes -- more Go-Go's than grunge -- Courtney Love made her own passage through notoriety, loss and stardom sound like something more than a California whine. She lashes out at celebrity culture as she acknowledges its temptations.
 
9. Elliott Smith, "XO" (Geffen). Years of making quick, cheap albums honed Mr. Smith's ingenuity so that "XO," his major-label debut, is filled with textural metamorphoses to match his restless harmonies and neo-Beatles melodies. He's still trouble, but his music reaches out more decisively than ever.
 
10. Air, "Moon Safari" (Caroline). Buzzing, burbling and sliding, sliding everywhere, analog keyboards have started to sound warm and endearing by contrast to the cool precision of digital sounds. Air, a French duo, used its collection of obsolescent keyboards to create serenely pensive music, making yesterday's futurism sound like a lost electronic Eden.
 
Peter Watrous
 
1. David Berkman, "Handmade" (Palmetto). Sad to say, but a jazz record that has rhythm as one of its priorities is a rarity. Mr. Berkman, a pianist, has convened an exceptional band, including Tom Harrell on trumpet, Steve Wilson on saxophones, Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Brian Blade on drums and percussion, and it moves, always rhythmically, from percussion workouts to quintet mainstream jazz.
 
2. Ravi Coltrane, "Moving Pictures" (RCA). This is the first album by a saxophonist who has promise. He has produced a recording of just that, plus some. There's a drum choir here, exploratory playing there and if it doesn't add up to the pungency of the band's live performances, few recordings ever do.
 
3. Jack DeJohnette, "Oneness" (ECM). The recording is spare and percussive and suggests the mainstream in Mr. DeJohnette's utterly swinging ride cymbal. The band, including Jerome Harris on guitar and bass guitar, Michael Cain on piano, Don Alias on percussion and Mr. DeJohnette on drums, makes music that could serve for film. It's atmospheric, gauzy and textural.
 
4. Herbie Hancock, "Gershwin's World" (Verve). Instead of trying to reproduce the intensity of a live performance, this album revels in its artificiality; each track features a different band, from Mr. Hancock and drummers to singing.
 
5. Sherman Irby, "Big Mama's Biscuits" (Blue Note). Soul abstraction: the recording, deep in the black jazz tradition, moves from the blues into striking, unfettered improvisations. Mr. Irby, an alto saxophonist, sounds loose and daring. And his control of dynamics is a wonder.
 
6. Ethan Iverson, "Deconstruction Zone (Standards)" (Fresh Sound). The pianist takes apart standards with a trio. Drifting chords enrich the changes, and a tune's basic form is the starting point of intense, complex improvisation.
 
7. Joe Lovano, "Trio Fascination" (Blue Note). Backed by Dave Holland on bass and Elvin Jones on drums, Mr. Lovano turns in a set of liquid improvisations. The pianoless trio format suits him, and he's rarely been recorded in such splendor.
 
8. Greg Osby, "Banned in New York" (Blue Note). This live album has Mr. Osby and his band at their rawest and finest. Tunes segue; Mr. Osby's serpentine lines clear the way for a type of formal improvisation that sounds, and is, new.
 
9. Tim Warfield, "Gentle Warrior" (Criss Cross). He's perhaps the most powerful tenor saxophonist of his generation. This is his best album, and he moves from cool ballads to free playing; it offers the pianist Cyrus Chestnut, relaxed and deadly serious in his playful improvisations.
 
10. Steve Wilson, "Generations" (Stretch). Mr. Wilson, an alto saxophonist, is in the company of elders: the pianist Mulgrew Miller, the bassist Ray Drummond and the drummer Ben Riley. His own generation has some formal tricks not heard on the album. Instead he turns up the intensity in his own solos."
 
Neil Strauss
 
1. Air, "Moon Safari" (Source/Caroline). The secret to this album of French electronic lounge-pop is not in the gurgling analog synthesizers, the robotic vocoders or the subdued grandiosity of the Burt Bacharach-style arrangements but in the tone and timbre: sweet, relentlessly seductive; everything old done right.
 
2. Lauryn Hill, "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" (Ruffhouse/Columbia). This well-thought-out soulfully introspective album chronicles life's camouflaged traps and small triumphs, showing off Ms. Hill as a rap-pop syncretist wise beyond her 23 years.
 
3. Lucinda Williams, "Car Wheels on a Gravel Road" (Mercury). Six years in the making and without a weak cut, "Car Wheels" charts a South where towns, roads and songs exist only as markers memorializing relationships and memories. Ms. Williams futilely tries to return to these markers, knowing that what she's looking for has long since gone.
 
4. Tom Ze, "Fabrication Defect" (Luaka Bop/Warner Brothers). An odd yet accessible collection from one of Brazil's most consistent innovators, this is a politically and musically restless concept album about repression underscored by sharp guitar picking.
 
5. Herbie Hancock, "Gershwin's World" (Verve). On the occasion of George Gershwin's centennial, no musician managed to explore, elevate or respect him and his contemporaries as well as Mr. Hancock did, with some of his best piano work in recent years and mesmerizing contributions from Joni Mitchell, James Carter and Kenny Garrett.
 
6. Black Box Recorder, "England Made Me" (Chrysalis U.K.). "Life's unfair," whisper the angel-voiced Sarah Nixey and Luke Haines (of the Auteurs) on a beautifully macabre album in which contradiction is key. "Kill yourself or get over it."
 
7. Cornelius, "Phantasm" (Trattoria/Matador). This is the sound of one collector collecting, a Japanese studio savant (Keigo Oyamada), equal parts Beck and Brian Wilson, who helped prove that the future of music may lie in the East.
 
8. Outkast, "Aquemini" (LaFace/ Arista). Hip-hop fans spent millions on Jay-Z, DMX and No Limit records extolling the gangsta life, but this Atlanta duo brought something new to the genre, with fast-paced raps, clever wordplay and the feel of a live funk party.
 
9. Eels, "Electro-Shock Blues" (Dreamworks). This was one of the year's only fully realized albums, with a beginning (the singer E's sister lying dead by her own hand on her bathroom floor), a middle (E visiting his dying mother in the hospital) and a life-affirming ending. The tragedy is that for E, these events were not fictional.
 
10. Molotov, "Donde Jugaran los Ninos?" (Universal/Surco). Equal parts Beastie Boys and Rage Against the Machine, Molotov railed against the Mexican establishment on a hard-hitting hybrid album full of fat bass lines, growling guitars, hip-hop scratching, screaming Spanglish choruses and a sense of humor.
 
Top Singles The Beastie Boys, "Intergalactic"; Terry Callier, "Love Theme From Spartacus (4 Hero Main Mix)"; Arling and Cameron, "Speeding Down the Highway/We Love Dancing"; Madonna, "Ray of Light"; Dilated Peoples, "Work the Angles"; Swirl, "Hey Now Now"; Fatboy Slim, "The Rockafeller Skank"; Everclear, "I Will Buy You a New Life"; Brock Landars, "S.M.D.U."; R. Kelly, "If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time."
 
Ben Ratliff
 
1. Carlinhos Brown, "Omelet Man" (EMI Brazil). This Brazilian pop factotum throws disparate cultural ingredients into one dish: funk, Bahian drumming, old-world hymns, booming reggae, rock anthems, orchestral ballads. The ambitious result was gorgeously produced by the singer Marisa Monte. (Available on Metro Blue/Capitol on May 4.)
 
2. Caetano Veloso, "Livro" (Mercury Brazil). Sonically modern without becoming producer-driven schtick, tender like a classic movie romance, it's the sort of record that a brilliant middle-aged pop singer-songwriter should be making.
 
3. Tom Ze, "Fabrication Defect" (Luaka Bop/Warner Brothers). A Brazilian master of eccentric pop returns with a set of strange songs, philosophical and deeply rhythmic, busting with impish humor.
 
4. Greg Osby, "Banned in New York" (Blue Note). The live sound on the saxophonist's new disk is cheap and a bit washed-out, and there's no overarching concept about repertory besides what Mr. Osby's quartet brings to the stage on a usual night.
 
5. Tortoise, "TNT" (Thrill Jockey). The new version of Tortoise, a two-bass, two-drums experimental Chicago jamathon band, both expands its palette with brass and guitar, and narrows its focus with a refinement of studio craft. The group no longer sounds provincial; this record kicks it up into the realm of the great.
 
6. Chris Potter Quartet, "Vertigo" (Concord). One of the tunes on the still-under-30 saxophonist's fifth album is a musical acting out of Hamlet's "to be or not to be" soliloquy: harmonically and rhythmically, he dives into the unresolvable with a strong poetic eloquence.
 
7. Sherman Irby, "Big Mama's Biscuits" (Blue Note). If, say, Lee Konitz had made this record -- and in places, with its spare trio lineup and Mr. Irby's willowy-with-an-edge alto saxophone sound, he could have -- it would have been the talk of the jazz world. But there's also some wonderful blues playing here.
 
8. Joe Lovano, "Trio Fascination" (Blue Note). 1998 was a year of great trio records, but the serenity and the slow-gathering tidal waves of improvisation on this one, with the bassist Dave Holland and drummer Elvin Jones, affirmed with an easy authority this saxophonist's status as one of jazz's greatest figures.
 
10. DJ Faust, "Man or Myth?" (Bomb Hip Hop). There are good reasons to be skeptical about the rise of turntablism: Is all that hand-eye coordination on the turntables and cross-faders art or parlor tricks? But the worthy documents are now slowly seeping out, and this one came with virtuosity and humor.
 
Ann Powers
 
1. Lauryn Hill, "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" (Ruffhouse/Columbia). In a year of shadows and complements, every outstanding album had its well-matched rival. The solo debut by this rapper and singer outdid the efforts of her fellow Fugees and helped stimulate today's hip-hop renaissance. But Ms. Hill ultimately stands alone as this year's legend in the making: a paragon of musicality, vision, and personal grace.
 
2. Lucinda Williams, "Car Wheels on a Gravel Road" (Mercury). The six years fans waited for this exquisite meditation on traveling among towns, lovers and life spans made its arrival feel like a literary event. But for all its novelistic carefulness, "Car Wheels" manages to be more than perfect because of the ambiguity that pervades Ms. Williams's writing and singing; it comes from learning to survive.
 
3. Billy Bragg and Wilco, "Mermaid Avenue" (Elektra). The communal counterpart to Ms. Williams's personal history lesson, this collection of Woody Guthrie lyrics, set to music by an English alternative folkie and a Midwestern band set on revitalizing roots rock, confirmed that great songs add up to more than the sum of their parts. "Mermaid Avenue" is a political act, but its messages never overwhelm its joy.
 
4. Duncan Sheik, "Humming" (Atlantic). Spirituality was big last year, with artists from Madonna to the Beastie Boys finding power in the quest for the sacred. This smooth melodicist best translated religious experience into sound. In songs that coalesce like so many drifting thoughts, he made a soundtrack for the examined life.
 
5. Rufus Wainwright, "Rufus Wainwright" (Dreamworks). These days music isn't often a family affair, but with several 1998 releases, the clan of singer-songwriters led by Kate and Anna McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright 3d carved out a shining corner. Kate and Loudon's son Rufus stole the show with a starry-eyed debut that wanders from dance floors to the opera.
 
6. Black Star, "Mos Def and Talib Kweli Are Black Star" (Rawkus). As hip-hop flourished in the bright light of commercial triumph, its tendrils extended strongly and vitally underground. Outkast, from Atlanta, was a favored alternative; that crew's potential is matched in skill and superseded in resolve by this collaboration between Brooklyn's two wittiest freestyling wordsmiths.
 
7. Hole, "Celebrity Skin" (Geffen). Women continued to rule rock stardom, with Liz Phair, Tori Amos, and P. J. Harvey all releasing albums that furthered their brilliant careers. Courtney Love, leader of Hole, caused the biggest ruckus and showed the most courage by staunchly championing old-fashioned life-altering epiphanies.
 
8. Massive Attack, "Mezzanine" (Virgin). The most alluring music from Europe now is the spawn of dance music and rock-and-roll attitude. On "Mezzanine," the band that originated these mutations returned with the sound of a summer night at the end of the world.
 
9. Quasi, "Featuring 'Birds' " (Up). Forming a dialogue with the cruelly gorgeous "XO" by Elliott Smith, this duo's former Portland, Ore., neighbor, and the latest offering from the delightfully disturbed Modest Mouse, of Issaquah, Wash., this album of jagged little commentaries is marked by the honesty, black humor and rage-filled independence of the Pacific Northwest.
 
10. Pernice Brothers, "Overcome by Happiness" (Sub Pop). With so many musical asteroids breaking off from pop's shattered planet, serious listeners can each treasure a private favorite. Mine might have been "Deserter's Songs" by Mercury Rev, if not for this startling slice of beauty masterminded by Joe Pernice of the Scud Mountain Boys. Its sweet melodies and bitter undertones surface like classics from the radio that plays for but one lucky listener.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Many of those headed to Europe are a bit bewildered about coping with the euro.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
ONE of the first phone calls Alami Driss received yesterday morning was from someone asking how he could buy euros for a planned trip to Europe. Responding as he had done to similar phone calls for more than a month, Mr. Driss explained that the euro is not available for purchase anywhere for three more years.
"A lot of people think that by this Jan. 1, European currencies just vanished," said Mr. Driss, senior vice president of People's Foreign Exchange, a money exchange in midtown Manhattan. Meanwhile, he is awaiting a supply of explanatory brochures about the euro to give to walk-in customers, both as a service and in hopes of forestalling a rash of similar phone calls. 
 "Although people come in here worried and confused," Mr. Driss added, "it doesn't take long to explain the situation to them."
The 11 so-called euro zone nations are Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. For now, at least, Britain, Denmark and Sweden have opted out, while Greece did not meet economic requirements for membership.
Many visitors to American Express offices the last two days also have the impression that the French franc, German mark, Italian lira and the currencies of the other eight member countries are extinct, according to company officials. "So we have to tell them that the euro is a virtual currency for the next three years," said Chris Levite, a spokeswoman for American Express.
Not every potential traveler to Europe is confused about the euro, which has been the official currency of the 11 participating countries since midnight in Brussels on New Year's Eve. "We got a check for $10,000 about a month ago from a man in Long Island wanting to buy the first printing of our euro-traveler's checks," Ms. Levite said.
While euro notes and coins will not go on sale before Jan. 1, 2002, and will not formally replace local currencies before July 1, 2002, the euro exchange rate can be used for traveler's check payments, credit card purchases and other noncash transactions. While still too early to know how avidly Americans will take to euro-traveler's checks, they are not likely to set any sales records, mainly because for now they are readily accepted only in Europe's bigger shops, restaurants and hotels.
Many establishments in the 11 countries already post prices in euros as well as local currencies, and most are expected to do so before long.
Corporate travelers usually have at least a passing familiarity with the euro, but Mr. Telford said they wanted reassurance about how to pay bills quoted in both euros and local currencies. They are told they can pay in either euro-traveler's checks or with major credit cards, whose purchases will be converted by the card's issuing bank and billed in dollars or the card user's home currency.
Travel officials in the United States generally agree that in the future the euro will benefit American travelers by allowing them to pay just one commission for any or all 11 currencies, and will save them money when they reconvert leftover currency at the end of a trip.
The ease of comparing hotel rates in different countries will benefit leisure travelers, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, as well as corporations and associations looking to book meetings. Travelers will also have a better idea of the costs, if not necessarily the value, of restaurant meals, souvenirs, clothing and any number of other purchases.
Even smaller companies that do business in countries using the euro can expect to save time and money on overhead by not having to reconcile bills and receipts issued in many currencies. And corporate travel managers say they expect the simplicity offered by a single currency to make it easier for big corporations, especially multinationals, to negotiate preferable rates with European airlines, hotels and rental cars -- or, at the very least, to extract lower fares and rates from current suppliers by threatening to negotiate with their European rivals.

HEADLINE: Cubans Skeptical About Expanded Contacts

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Cuban officials reacted with cool skepticism today to President Clinton's decision to expand contacts between Americans and Cubans, while the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, maintained a pointed silence.
Cuban officials and economists said they doubted that the decision to allow additional people and organizations to send money to Cuban families and charities would ease the deep economic crisis here. 
 Most Cuban officials, from Mr. Castro down, fault the embargo for this nation's dismal economic performance.
Cuban officials also said it appeared that the Clinton Administration had given up on the idea of a bipartisan commission to consider lifting the embargo, a signal that there would be no fundamental change in policy under Mr. Clinton.
"This is nothing surprising, just more of the same," said a high-ranking official who insisted on anonymity. "The purpose of the embargo was always to undermine the revolution from within."
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said on his arrival on a visit to Haiti that the measures announced by Mr. Clinton "don't really go to the root of the problem."
"The root of the problem is still a blockade that is unjust," Mr. Robaina said.
Payments to Cubans from family members make up one of the country's largest sources of hard currency, estimated from $500,000 to $800,000 a year. They have fueled a growing dollar-based economy. Mr. Clinton's proposals would be expected to increase the flow of cash to the island.
Cuban officials said, however, that the changes were cosmetic and would neither influence the economy nor public opinion here.
Antonio Romero, an economist with the University of Havana, said an increase in payments from abroad might help individual families but would not cure the underlying malaise. "It will have an economic impact, but only at the micro level," Mr. Romero said.
The American embargo, he added, makes Cuba less attractive to foreign investors and keeps interest rates on bonds in the high teens, making it almost impossible for Cuba to obtain capital to modernize its aging Soviet-style factories.
Most people in the capital knew little about Mr. Clinton's overture by late evening. The state-controlled television broadcast a short report that outlined the proposals, saying they would ease the blockade "very little."
Some people with family members in the United States said they were happy to hear that additional people could send them money, though it was unclear to many who in addition to their relatives would be willing to do so.
Juan Miguel Carmona, 21, a chemistry student at the university, said although he would be happy to receive additional money from his uncle and other relatives in Miami, he would be even happier to hear that the embargo had been lifted.
"It would not only be very good for us, but it would be the just thing to do," he said. "The whole world outside the United States has realized there has to be a change toward Cuba."
Stalwart members of the Communist Party, many of whom have survived on meager Government salaries while watching other citizens receive cash from abroad, reacted to the news with predictable bitterness.
"All they want is that our opposition has more money to fight against the revolution," said one low-level official over a beer at a bar.
Another Government employee, who insisted on anonymity, said the proposals from Washington continued the same patronizing attitude that the United States had taken since the early 1960's. "For 40 years the United States has been imposing conditions on us," the official said. "They do not respect us. If the blockade had never existed the revolution would have solved all the problems we have now."

HEADLINE: Tenneco Expects Earnings Below Estimates

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., Jan. 5

 BODY:
Tenneco Inc. expects to report fourth-quarter earnings "substantially below" consensus estimates, primarily because of weak performance in its automotive aftermarket business and several charges related to the automotive business.
In a statement late today, the company said that Tenneco Automotive's original equipment business and Tenneco Packaging's specialty packaging businesses remained strong and would "essentially meet expectations." 
 Tenneco said consolidation among North American and European customers had delayed orders, which combined with an unseasonably warm winter worldwide and softness in South American and Asian economies, would reduce fourth-quarter operating income by about $25 million to $30 million from current estimates.
The company's announcement came after its shares rose $2.1875 today, to $35.9375.
Tenneco has 50,000 employees worldwide. Tenneco Automotive's brand names include Monroe and Walker. Tenneco Packaging makes Hefty trash bags and Baggies food storage bags.

HEADLINE: Economists Reject Notion Of Stock Market 'Bubble'

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
In all the talk at their annual meeting about the United States economy and what keeps it so robust, the nation's economists gave short shrift to one concern -- that the soaring stock market might be a speculative bubble that could burst, damaging the economy.
The stock market is neither a principal reason for the economy's strength nor a big threat to the nearly eight-year-long expansion, the economists said in their various sessions at the American Economic Association's three-day meeting, which ended yesterday, and in interviews. The majority view was that high stock prices probably reflect not a bubble but the economy's actual strength, although no one said that categorically. 
 "Is it a bubble?" said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist. "If the people here really thought this was a bubble market about to crash, that would have been a big topic of conversation at this meeting."
A bubble, if one exists, raises the odds that stock prices will eventually plunge and extinguish the wealth of millions of shareholders. They will respond by pulling back suddenly on their spending, damaging the economy. The Asian economic crisis raised concern that the market might be ignoring danger and thus in bubble territory. The spectacular run-up in the share prices of some high-technology companies also fed talk of a bubble market.
But the bubble talk largely disappeared after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times late last year. That action convinced many on Wall Street -- and also many of the economists gathered in Manhattan -- that the Fed stood ready to sustain the expansion, and stock prices, by cutting rates again if necessary.
"There is a sense now that if this is a bubble and it bursts, the Fed will lower interest rates and everything will be fine," Mr. Mankiw said. "Many economists have confidence in Alan Greenspan as the Fed's chairman."
In the minds of many economists, the stock market serves mainly as a gauge of the real economy and a stimulus for spending. What accounts much more for the strong economy, in this view, is the happy combination since 1995 of four factors: robust job creation, rising output, falling unemployment and minimal inflation. Usually the first three produce a rise in the fourth, the inflation rate. The Federal Reserve then raises interest rates to subdue inflation by slowing the economy, and the expansion ends or becomes much less vigorous.
This time, inflation has not risen, as it so often did in the past, particularly when the unemployment rate dropped below 5.5 percent. It is now 4.4 percent.
And the reasons? Considerable credit went to "lucky shocks," as Alan Blinder of Princeton University phrased it -- falling oil prices, for example, falling import prices, smaller-than-expected increases in health care costs and ever sharper declines in computer prices.
"There is absolutely no reason to predict that these favorable supply shocks will continue over the next year or two," said James Stock of Harvard.
But structural changes might be more enduring, allowing perhaps for a jobless rate of less than 5 percent without a rise in inflation. The growing use of part-time and temporary workers may help to explain the combination of low unemployment and minimal upward pressure on labor costs and prices, Mr. Stock said. Greater labor mobility may play a role, as well as job insecurity and the aging of the baby boomers. Older workers are less inclined to leave a job. Or so the reasoning went.
Only Edmund Phelps of Columbia University argued that the rising stock market played a leading role in driving the current expansion. "Rising share prices," he said, "create the incentive for enterprises to invest in more employees and more fixed capital. The worth of workers has gone up," when measured as the rising value of a company's stock.
But have share prices gotten too inflated? "I am an agnostic on that issue," Mr. Phelps said. "Maybe this is a time in which a big error is being made. But I don't think so."

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Making New Yorker Hotel New Again

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
The New Yorker Hotel -- yes, the New Yorker -- is a major tourist hotel again. A four-year, $20 million renovation is nearing completion, and the building at Eighth Avenue and 34th Street, which was once the largest hotel in the city and for many years housed followers of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, now has 860 functioning guest rooms -- with a total of 1,005 expected by June.
The elevators have been renovated and the lobby of the 69-year-old building, which once welcomed music lovers eager to hear the giants of the Big Band era, is being refurbished. There are three restaurants, four deluxe suites with terraces and 35 new tower minisuites with views of the river and downtown. 
 "Every time we open another floor, we sell out," said Barry S. Mann, the hotel's general manager. "Our occupancy rate last year was 88.6 percent."
The New Yorker is a midrange hotel that attracts many foreign tourists, with room rates for the winter season ranging from $129 to $169 and suites going for $225 to $595. About 60 percent of the hotel's business comes through travel brokers and wholesalers, "and that business is divided equally between Europe, South America and Asia," Mr. Mann said.
"We're also close to the Javits Center," he added, "and that is starting to give us corporate business."
Sean F. Hennessey, the New York director of the hospitality and leisure practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm, said that the hotel was benefiting from the positive economy and the city's tourist boom. "It's a good time to be offering additional rooms in New York," Mr. Hennessey said, adding that the city's hotel occupancy rate in the fourth quarter of 1998 was about 83.5 percent, "which is pretty close to capacity."
"The demand remains pretty strong," he said. "We continue to see many hotels in town reporting a lot of turn-away demand every night. And there certainly continues to be a lot of demand for midpriced rooms like the New Yorker's. So much of the emphasis in New York is on the luxury side of the business. But a lot of average tourists want to stay here as well."
He added that the New Yorker's neighborhood had also improved. "I think that side of town has become a lot more desirable over the last several years," he said.
When the New Yorker opened on Jan. 2, 1930, the 43-story, $22.5 million Art Deco tower was the biggest hotel in the city and one of the largest in the world. It had 2,500 rooms, 3 ballrooms, 10 private dining salons and 5 restaurants with 35 chefs. There were 92 telephone operators, 150 laundry workers handling thousands of articles daily, and a 42-chair barber shop with 20 manicurists. Benny Goodman, Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey and Woody Herman played at the hotel, and the Brooklyn Dodgers used it as their headquarters for their losing battle against the New York Yankees in the 1941 World Series.
But beginning in the 1950's, as the area around 34th Street became less desirable, the hotel's fortunes began to decline. It had several owners and went through a foreclosure, finally closing in 1972. It was bought in 1976 by the Unification Church, which used the hotel as its headquarters and housed its followers there. But in 1994 the church began turning part of the building back into a hotel again, renovating rooms, polishing the lobby's elegant crystal chandeliers and removing old yellow paint to reveal green marble underneath.
The renovation stemmed partly from the church's demographic changes. Many of the missionaries who used the New Yorker as a dormitory had paired off -- some were among the 2,075 couples married en masse at Madison Square Garden in 1982 -- and had moved to apartments and suburban homes.
At first only 175 rooms were converted, but as they kept being filled, more rooms were added to the hotel. Now the church uses only about 100 rooms for housing, Mr. Mann said, and about half a floor for office space. The church's headquarters are at 4 West 43d Street in a building that was once the Columbia University Club.
The 7th through 17th floors of the New Yorker building are commercial office space. The hotel's offices are on floors 5 and 6, the third floor is being converted to seven meeting rooms, the second floor has the hotel's two remaining ballrooms, and what was once the Terrace Room, where couples danced as the Big Bands played, is used by MSG cable television as a studio.
Next up, Mr. Mann said, is an exterior renovation that is scheduled to begin in 2000 and is to include new sidewalks, new marquees and restoration of the limestone facade on the lower floors.
"Our goal is to be the best three-star hotel in the city," Mr. Mann said. "There's no shame in being a three-star hotel as long as you're good at what you do."

HEADLINE: Miami Generally Welcomes Easing of Ban

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Hemley Gonzalez calls an aunt in Cuba every weekend, and he travels to the island once a year to take medicine and clothes to the scores of relatives he left behind when he moved here 10 years ago.
Mr. Gonzalez favors the American economic embargo against Cuba, he said, but that does not deter him from his personal mission, helping to ease his family's financial hardship and giving them a glimpse of "what's going on in the outside." 
 "My opinion has always been put people first and worry about politics later," he said.
For Cuban-Americans like Mr. Gonzalez, 23, a real-estate agent in Miami Beach, the Clinton Administration decision to allow additional contact between Americans and Cubans supports many individual efforts to sidestep the Cuban Government to break through the isolation of their families and friends.
But the announcement also pleased those who advocate keeping Cuba isolated because of the Administration's refusal even to study changing relations with the island.
The Cuban American National Foundation, the most politically prominent exile group and an unwavering advocate of the embargo against Cuba, was among those relieved that the policy was not fundamentally altered. The foundation objects to proposals to sell agricultural supplies to nongovernmental entities on the grounds that Cuba has "no true private businesses."
The organization has also opposed bills to allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba by American companies, fearing that such a move would weaken the 37-year-old embargo.
"Unfortunately what these steps may produce is that in the end American taxpayers would subsidize the Cuban regime," said the vice chairman of the foundation, Jorge Mas. "The Government can't pay. There'll be a need for credit and subsidies. It's a very dangerous step that may have the opposite effect than promoting democracy in Cuba."
Those who want to end the ban called the steps positive but said they fell short. Bishop Thomas Wenski, the auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami who has visited Cuba several times, called the restrictions Fidel Castro's "whipping boy" and "dull instruments that hurt the people."
"The embargo cannot be sustained morally," Bishop Wenski said. "Lifting the embargo would be both smart policy and a powerful humanitarian effort."
Silvia Wilhelm, executive director of the Cuban Committee for Democracy, a Cuban-American group that opposes the embargo, said lifting restrictions that had failed in their goal for 37 years would spur change in Cuba more quickly than gradual measures. Cuba would no longer have the United States to blame for all that is wrong with the country, Ms. Wilhelm said.
But she welcomed the Administration's announcement. "Anything that brings less dependency of the Cuban people on the Government is a step in the right direction," Ms. Wilhelm said, "because ultimately what we want is the people in Cuba to be empowered."
The relaxation will make a practical difference to Cubans on both sides of the Florida Straits. Vivian Mannerud, owner of one of two companies that offer charter flights to Cuba, said allowing flights from cities other than Miami would increase the number of flights and lower the cost of travel. Her Airline Brokers Company offers four Miami-Havana flights a week and carries a third of the estimated 100,000 Cuban-Americans who fly to Cuba each year, she said.
"Our passengers are not wealthy people," Ms. Mannerud said. "It costs them to come out from the West Coast just to catch the flight here."
Mr. Gonzalez, the real estate agent, predicted that rules allowing more cash to go to Cubans would expand capitalism in the midst of socialism.
"You can send a Cuban $1,000," Mr. Gonzalez said, "and he'd buy three VCR's in an electronics store and sell them on the street in the black market for $100 to about $150 more in Cuban currency. It will create more underground business, money for the people, not the Government."

HEADLINE: AT&T Wins At Home Deal and a Foothold as a Data Carrier

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Advancing its aspiration to become a major carrier of Internet data, the AT&T Corporation has won a long-term contract to provide the At Home Corporation, the nation's largest provider of cable modem service, with 15,000 miles of high-speed fiber optic lines.
The companies intend to announce the deal today. 
 At Home connects consumers to cyberspace using cable television systems, but it uses long-distance telephone systems to transmit huge amounts of data to local cable operators around the country.
AT&T is the nation's biggest communications company, but it has lagged in offering the high-speed data links used by Internet providers. C. Michael Armstrong, AT&T's chairman since 1997, is trying to change that.
So while the deal with At Home is marginal in immediate financial value for AT&T -- worth up to $100 million, according to analysts and to executives close to the deal -- it is a big leap strategically. The executives said the deal's financial value could increase if At Home exercised options to expand it in the future.
"This is a blue-chip Internet reference account for AT&T, which has not been an especially visible player in making backbone wholesale deals with new-age Internet companies," said Christopher Mines, an analyst for Forrester Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.
The deal is also a big technical step forward for At Home. Using the AT&T systems, At Home intends to become one of the first major data communications companies to connect Internet routers directly to fiber optic lines. That could give At Home an especially fast and advanced network.
Until now, At Home has mostly used systems provided by the Sprint Corporation that incurred a cost to At Home for each unit of data transmitted. Under the AT&T deal, however, At Home will essentially own an entire communications pipeline.
"They probably just bought themselves a 5 percent increase in their operating margin," said Richard A. Bilotti, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He estimated that those margins now are between 25 and 30 percent for At Home's residential business.
According to executives close to the deal, At Home asked long-distance companies to submit bids for its business last June, and other bidders were Sprint, Qwest, Level 3, Frontier, Williams and IXC.
But not all the bidders were on an equal technical footing when it came to winning the At Home contract, and that is not just because some of the new carriers have not yet completed their fiber optic networks.
At Home wants to connect Internet routers directly to a sort of fiber optic transmission gear known as wave-division multiplexing, or W.D.M., equipment. It is suited to systems that carry only data but also to those that carry voice traffic.
Some telecommunications equipment companies, primarily Northern Telecom of Canada, tend to build into their W.D.M. gear another sort of fiber optic technology known as Sonet, which facilitates voice traffic but costs more.
At Home, which only transmits data, did not want to pay for the use of Sonet, so carriers like Qwest, which uses a lot of Northern Telecom equipment, found themselves at a disadvantage, according to executives close to the deal.
Tele-Communications Inc., the big cable television company that has agreed to be acquired by AT&T, is also the largest shareholder in At Home. But Milo Medin, At Home's chief technical officer, said that was not a factor in its choice of AT&T.

HEADLINE: Qualms Over UConn's Big Plans

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

DATELINE: STORRS, Conn.

 BODY:
At the main campus of the University of Connecticut here, a building boom is under way that would be the envy of most university presidents.
UConn has built or will soon complete a $13 million fine arts center, a $56 million chemistry building, a $40 million library renovation and a $43 million residential complex. It is spending millions more for new satellite campuses in Stamford and Groton, and aims to upgrade three other branches to offer a variety of four-year degrees. 
 But across Connecticut, some educators are viewing UConn's expansion with more fear than envy. They say the growth, financed with $1 billion provided by the State Legislature, could threaten small private liberal arts colleges and the Connecticut State University system (the former state teachers colleges), which have long provided the state with institutional diversity.
Herman Lujan, the chief academic officer of the state university system, said he was concerned about competition from the expanded UConn satellites, and had registered a protest, which he expected to be taken up by the State Department of Higher Education at its next meeting on Jan. 20.
Speaking for the private colleges, Anthony J. Cernera, president of Sacred Heart University in Fairfield and chairman of the 16-member Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges, said the expansive plans of UConn, especially the upgrading of branches in Waterbury, Torrington and West Hartford, "duplicate what already exists" and "don't make a whole lot of sense."
Philip E. Austin, UConn's president, answered, "We are not trying to compete unfairly with anyone, but are responding to demographic changes in the state and following what the elected leadership and the business leadership have asked of us."
The struggle being played out in Connecticut is mirrored in many states, said Edward R. Hines, a senior associate of the Center for Higher Education at Illinois State University, who conducts an annual survey of state higher-education officials.
"We'll see more and more of a gap -- more stratification -- between, on the one hand, flagship institutions, and on the other hand the old regional former teachers colleges," he said. "All across the country, there's going to be intensive competition for students and for a share of the state budget pie."
As recently as three or four years ago, according to surveys, UConn students gave high marks to the university's academic programs but were put off by the "dilapidation" of the campus. Responding to these complaints, and news that Connecticut had become a leader among states that shipped college-bound students out of state, a coalition of university administrators and influential state legislators came up with a proposal, called UConn 2000, to rebuild the state's system of higher education.
The Republican Governor, John G. Rowland, who had come into office pledging to go slow on state borrowing, hesitated at first. But the plan gained momentum thanks to the much heralded success of UConn's basketball teams. In 1995, the university's men's and women's basketball squads were both ranked No. 1 in the nation, as they are again this year, and Husky fever gripped the state. UConn applications soared, and when the athletes appeared before the state legislators, it was the latter who asked for autographs.
That, plus an understanding of the symbiotic relationship between higher education and economic development, finally loosened the purse strings in Hartford, and the remaking of UConn began to take shape.
The payoff came last fall when UConn's admissions office reported a 17 percent increase in freshman enrollment, to 3,225 in 1998-99 from 2,760 in 1997-98.
Cries of pain from private and state institutions have been muted because, at least so far, the supply of college-age students -- swollen by the children of baby boomers -- has been large enough to insure plenty of applicants to go around.
The only private college in the state that lost enrollment this year was Wesleyan University in Middletown, where admissions dipped 1.19 percent -- and that was a deliberate effort to cap the incoming freshman class in the interest of improving the faculty-student ratio. Almost all private institutions in the state have seen their enrollment grow by at least 5 percent over last year.
Still, many educators -- especially those associated with less well-known institutions like Quinnipiac College in Hamden, for example, and state institutions like Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven -- look ahead with apprehension.
Some expect to be forced to accept less-qualified students in the future and, accordingly, are developing survival strategies like "niche marketing" -- offering specialized academic programs that will draw students with specific career objectives.
The University of Bridgeport, a small private institution that since 1992 has been affiliated with the Unification Church headed by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, practices this strategy with considerable success. As far back as the 1960's, the university swelled its enrollment by recruiting foreign students, chiefly from India and Japan. That practice established a path for many Asian students, and today fully 40 percent of the student body comes from other countries.
But even the parade of foreign students has not been enough to satisfy the university's needs. "The expansion of UConn forced us to do more aggressive niche marketing," said Donna Marino, a spokeswoman for the university.
The result is that the University of Bridgeport has recently developed a number of academic specialties in the health sciences, including a school of dental hygiene and a college of chiropractic medicine, both of which have drawn well.
"Last year," Ms. Marino said, "we started the College of Naturopathic Medicine, a four-year program which trains physicians in natural remedies. It's doing nicely because there are only three other such schools in the country."
Such strategies may work for some small colleges, but could undermine the tradition of the small liberal arts college that turns out broadly educated students.
"Niche marketing is a little frightening," said Barbara-Jan Wilson, dean of admissions at Wesleyan. "I don't think 18-year-olds really know what they want to do with their lives. These niche programs may help students to get their first job, but leave them unprepared for a second or third."
The University of New Haven, another small private school, is also engaged in niche marketing -- offering career-focused programs in sports management, forensic science, and music and sound recording -- but the school's main strategy this year is to reach beyond the borders of Connecticut.
"Yes, we feel the pressure from UConn, and we expect it to be even stronger in four or five years," said Patrick Quinn, dean of admissions at the University of New Haven.
"That's why we have just decided to recruit on Long Island, throughout New England and elsewhere," he added. "About 70 percent of our students are from Connecticut, but we expect competition from UConn to bring that down to 60 percent in a few years. Consequently, we will have nine recruiters next year, and only two of them will work Connecticut."
In-state tuition, room and board at UConn come to about $10,875 a year while the state universities charge an average of $9,000. But even with that price advantage, the state university institutions fear the UConn juggernaut.
It is not merely competition from the flagship campus in Storrs that worries them, but the UConn satellites in Stamford, Groton, Hartford, Waterbury and Torrington.
Since 1981, four of the five satellites have had the authority to grant only one four-year bachelor's degree created for adult students. (Stamford has had more latitude.) Today, however, Stamford and the Avery Point branch in Groton occupy new, multimillion-dollar campuses, and UConn is pressing the State Department of Higher Education to adopt proposals that would remake the satellites as mini-UConns, squeezing the state university system.
As a result, the state university leaders are preparing to fight. Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic is striving to carve a niche for itself as a small public liberal arts college. Western Connecticut State University at Danbury hopes to benefit from its location in a population center.
"Don't count us out," said Bill Cibes, chancellor of the C.S.U. system and a former member of the State Legislature. "We got a lot less from the state than UConn, but we never said we wouldn't keep asking."

HEADLINE: Japanese Is Sorry He Called U.S. a Bully

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 5

 BODY:
The Japanese Government backed away today from remarks by a Cabinet member suggesting that Japanese were unhappy with their "Peace Constitution" and that the United States bullied other countries.
The Cabinet member, Justice Minister Shozaburo Nakamura, apologized for his remarks and said he had not meant them. The comments were the latest in a long tradition of top Japanese officials making incendiary statements and then sheepishly retracting them after they become public. 
 "The so-called free-market economy cited by the U.S. is not real freedom," Mr. Nakamura told several hundred ministry officials at a New Year's party, Japanese newspapers reported. "It is a kind of freedom that lets loose atom bombs and missiles just when another country appears to gain an advantage."
Mr. Nakamura, 64, did not elaborate. But he specifically denounced the United States for threatening sanctions against countries accused of unfair trade practices.
To many Japanese the most striking comments by Mr. Nakamura were his suggestions that the Constitution was burdensome and should be changed to give Japan the right to use military force.
"We are struggling under a Constitution that prevents us from having an army and denies us the ability to revise" it, Mr. Nakamura was quoted by the daily Asahi Shimbun as saying. He added that the Constitution "was handed down by the Allied forces to the Japanese people" after World War II.
Hiromu Nonaka, the chief Cabinet secretary, said at a news conference today that Mr. Nakamura had made "very inappropriate remarks" and that the matter was serious. But he added that Mr. Nakamura had shown remorse, and the Government seems to regard the matter as closed.
Most historians agree with Mr. Nakamura's view that the Constitution was imposed on Japan by the United States in the aftermath of World War II, but legally Japan has every right to amend it. Such a move, though, would lead to protests around Asia among countries that Japan invaded during the war.
At a Cabinet meeting today, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi raised the matter of Mr. Nakamura's remarks and asked him to explain.
"The true meaning of these remarks I made on the occasion of the New Year ceremony at the Ministry of Justice was to explain various issues facing our country as well as the complicated international situation, in the context of emphasizing the need for judicial reform in Japan," Mr. Nakamura told the Cabinet. "I would like to apologize sincerely for the inappropriateness of my remarks, and I withdraw them."
Countries including China and South and North Korea get nervous whenever Japanese talk about changing their Constitution -- especially Article 9, which forever renounces "the threat or use of force." The article also says Japan will never maintain "land, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential."
In fact, Japan manages to have Asia's most impressive armed forces and the world's third-largest military budget by deploying what it calls self-defense forces, which it says are not banned by Article 9.
It is difficult to gauge how widespread Mr. Nakamura's views are. Many conservatives in Japan say that such views are common but that politicians do not feel free to express them because they get in trouble whenever they say such things.
Particularly in rural areas, which are hugely overrepresented in Japan's political system, Mr. Nakamura's sentiments seem to resonate with many ordinary voters.
There is deep resentment at what is perceived as American bullying and insistence on ruthless market policies, and many people also feel that half a century after World War II, it is time for Japan to stand up and adopt a more muscular constitution and foreign policy.
There have been growing calls for revision of the Japanese Constitution, but the issue is so sensitive at home and around Asia that it is expected to be many years before any changes might actually be enacted.

HEADLINE: Changed Terrain on Cuba

 BODY:
When the White House endorses the idea of a visit to Havana by the Baltimore Orioles it is clear the ground is starting to shift in United States relations with Cuba. After four decades in which Washington successively tried to remove Fidel Castro by invasion, assassination plots and rigid economic isolation, signs are multiplying that the long American siege of Cuba is starting to wind down.
There are good reasons for this welcome change. With the end of the cold war, Cuba no longer serves as a base for potential Russian military operations against the United States. American business leaders have become increasingly interested in the profit potential of Cuba as it moves toward the post-Castro era. Conservatives have taken up the plea made by Pope John Paul II to ease the American economic embargo for humanitarian reasons. Finally, generational changes in the Cuban-American community have increased the influence of those interested in easing the privations of ordinary Cubans, rather than worsening them in hopes of sparking a popular revolt. 
 The pity is that the Clinton Administration has been hesitant about seizing this opportunity. The steps it has proposed, including the visit by the Orioles and a return engagement in America by the Cuban national baseball team, fall well short of the change in direction that is now politically sustainable in Washington.
Athletic and cultural exchanges, more charter flights, direct mail service and broader permission for Americans to send food and money to Cuban families are fine. But the White House rejected appeals from prominent Republicans to form a bipartisan national commission on Cuba policy that might have proposed phasing out the embargo and moving toward normal diplomatic relations.
America should be doing all it can to break down the cultural and intellectual isolation of Cuban society through increased tourism, business and cultural and sports contacts. It should be defending human rights by strengthening its diplomatic presence in Havana. Mr. Clinton must go beyond useful tinkering with an outdated policy. He must lead the way to a more promising approach based on deeper American engagement, not continued isolation.

HEADLINE: Engineering School Names Its Founding President

 BODY:
The nation's newest engineering school, which will admit its first class in fall 2001, has announced that its founding president will be Richard K. Miller, the engineering college dean at the University of Iowa.
The college, the F. W. Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Mass., is being built adjacent to Babson College, the business institution. It will charge little or no tuition because of its healthy founding endowment, and it will take a new approach to engineering education, combining the standard science and math courses with entrepreneurship, marketing and product research. The colleges plan to share support services and certain facilities. 
 Frustrated with the state of engineering education, the F. W. Olin Foundation financed the new school with $300 million. The foundation -- not related to the John S. Olin Foundation, which supports conservative causes -- was established in 1938 by Franklin W. Olin, who died in 1951 after having made a fortune in the 1930's with a diversified industrial company that makes chemicals, munitions, sporting goods and metals.
At Iowa, Dr. Miller conceived the nation's first technological entrepreneurship certificate program for engineers. "It is an exceptional privilege and challenge to help Olin College achieve its vision of preparing the next generation of gifted engineers for leadership in the new global economy," Dr. Miller said.
The college plans to have an initial enrollment of 50 to 100 students and to grow to some 600 students by 2006.
The announcement regarding the founding president was made by Lawrence W. Milas, president of the F. W. Olin Foundation, who said Dr. Miller "has a very special commitment to integrating entrepreneurship into technological studies as a major component of the Olin College program."
Dr. Miller's background combines business with theory. His specialties include earthquake engineering and spacecraft structural design. With a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology, he has taught civil, mechanical, environmental and aerospace engineering at the University of Southern California and the University of California and has been a consultant to the Aerospace Corporation, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Hughes Aircraft Company and the Astro Aerospace Corporation.
Dr. Miller said the combined approach of theory and practice improved learning.
"Undergraduate engineers will have their eyes opened to the economic potential of their work," he said. "When students see the importance of their work in the broad sense, it increases their excitement and motivation."

HEADLINE: Pricing at Issue As U.S. Finishes Microsoft Case

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR and JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
The Government called its last witness in the Microsoft trial today after presenting 110 pages of his written testimony that amount to a summation of -- and economic justification for -- the Justice Department's sweeping antitrust suit against the software giant.
Much of the testimony by the witness, Franklin M. Fisher, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a detailed review of major allegations in the Government's case. But he also sought to advance the case and strengthen the argument for strong sanctions against Microsoft with his analysis of Microsoft's pricing tactics. 
 Mr. Fisher asserts that Microsoft commits predatory pricing by giving away its Internet Explorer browser. The doctrine of predatory pricing -- defined as a monopolist selling goods below cost -- has been generally rejected by courts in recent years on the theory that it is difficult to prove both the practice and any resulting harm to consumers.
But Mr. Fisher argued that Microsoft decided to give away its browser software only to thwart the threat to its dominance posed by its main rivals in Internet software, the Netscape Communications Corporation, developer of the Navigator Web browser, and Sun Microsystems Inc., creator of the Java programming language.
Besides, he added, the tricky matter of trying to determine if a price is below some technical definition of its cost to produce does not apply because "Microsoft distributes its browser at a zero price," though it has spent more than $100 million a year since 1995 on browser development.
"Classifying Microsoft's pricing as predatory and anti-competitive," he stated, "does not require reaching the difficult questions that are usually faced in predatory pricing cases."
Mr. Fisher also provided a pre-emptive rebuttal to an M.I.T. colleague and former student, Richard Schmalensee, who will testify next, as Microsoft's expert witness on economics. In his own report to the court, which has not been released, Mr. Schmalensee argues that the price of Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system is too low for Windows to be legally classified as a monopoly. The comparatively low price of Windows -- less than 5 percent of the total cost of an average personal computer -- has been cited by many economists as inconsistent with the Government's allegation of an enduring monopoly.
But Mr. Fisher contends that such analysis means only that Microsoft's management is taking the long view of monopoly. "The proper conclusion from Schmalensee's argument cannot be that Microsoft lacks monopoly power," Mr. Fisher wrote in his testimony. "If any conclusion can be drawn, it would be that Microsoft is not maximizing its short-run profits."
Microsoft's product pricing, Mr. Fisher testified, should be viewed as part of a "broader campaign to eliminate Netscape's browser and Java as sources of potential competition to Microsoft's operating system monopoly -- a campaign characterized by actions by which Microsoft lost money in order to raise rivals' costs and exclude them from the market."
In court today, a Microsoft lawyer, Michael Lacovara, opened his cross-examination of Mr. Fisher with more than an hour of detailed challenges to the methodology Mr. Fisher used to determine the market shares of competing Web browsers. Mr. Lacovara also introduced criticisms of Mr. Fisher by judges in previous cases in which he appeared as an expert witness.
Mr. Fisher, an assertive, 64-year-old economist, has testified in dozens of antitrust cases in the computer industry -- though he was on the other side the last time, as the chief economic witness for the International Business Machines Corporation in its marathon antitrust confrontation with the Justice Department, a case the Government dropped in 1982 after 13 years.
Microsoft's lawyers say the company is being attacked by Mr. Fisher for being much the kind of company I.B.M. was when he was defending it. "Monopoly profits are earned through high prices and inferior products," Mr. Fisher wrote in a 1983 book about the I.B.M. case. "The notion that acts showing a pattern of lower prices and better products are the behavior of a monopolist is a confusion of the workings of competition with its opposite -- monopoly."
Microsoft said in a statement that "Professor Fisher's testimony would give readers of his 1983 book whiplash."
This morning, Microsoft ended the cross-examination of William H. Harris, the chief executive of Intuit Inc., which makes the industry-leading personal finance software, Quicken. The Government also played excerpts from the taped deposition in which William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, was questioned last August about the company's dealings with Intuit.
Though Mr. Gates professed no knowledge of any of the interactions with Intuit that are at issue in the case, the Government introduced E-mail messages in which employees had briefed him on the negotiations in exhaustive detail.
Shown one such message and asked if he had been informed of its subject, Mr. Gates said, "In the sense that one of the E-mails that may have come into my mailbox might have related to that, I don't doubt it."
Much of the questioning of Mr. Harris had centered on Intuit's interest in becoming an even larger player in Internet commerce. Microsoft's lead trial lawyer, John Warden, asked him about America Online's proposed purchase of Netscape, a deal that Microsoft argues is proof of healthy competition in the software industry.
"Doesn't that change the entire landscape of the Internet industry?" Mr. Warden asked.
"No, I don't believe so," Mr. Harris said. "There's a great deal of merger activity in this industry. Microsoft is rumored to be in discussions for acquisitions. I don't think the AOL-Netscape deal will be the last one we hear of."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
'Little Push' Helps Family to Begin to Right Itself

BYLINE: By ADAM GERSHENSON 

 BODY:
Edward Hillman apologizes when visitors arrive at his family's basement apartment in the Richmond Hill section of Queens.
He says he is sorry that there is no doorbell, that the place is so small, and that guests have to duck on their way down the stairs. Yet, once he settles into his living room, with his wife, Ines, on the couch, and his 2-year-old son, Edward Jr., seated on his lap, Mr. Hillman starts to see things from a different perspective. 
 "It's not the lap of luxury, but it's a home, and we're together, and that's the most important thing," he said on a recent Sunday afternoon.
Mr. Hillman might have neither a home nor an intact family were it not for the help he recently received from the Community Service Society of New York, one of seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
When Mr. Hillman, 32, arrived at the charity's offices on Park Avenue South in August, he was visibly distressed. His troubles had begun in April, when, after months of working two full-time jobs, he collapsed from exhaustion. It took him weeks to recover, and by the time he did, he had lost his day job with a shipping company and his night job at 7-Eleven.
Ines found work as a cashier at a supermarket. The $6 an hour she earned was not enough to cover the $800 rent on their two-bedroom apartment in Jackson Heights where they lived at the time, but she was able to put food on the table.
Mr. Hillman said he had felt too ashamed to eat it. He felt he was draining resources that should have gone to his wife and child. Mr. Hillman tried to find a new job -- without success -- and by August became convinced that he was nothing but a burden to his family. Without warning, he left home.
He spent a few days walking through Manhattan, applying for jobs. Initially he spent his nights curled up in the shadows of the United Nations building on 42d Street, until he found short-term shelter in a church-run mission on the Lower East Side. Still unable to find work, Mr. Hillman was desperate, knowing that Ines needed money for rent. Finally, he went to the Community Service Society.
Ivette Gongon, a case manager at the agency, was determined to help.
"He was so distraught," she said, "and he kept talking about his wife and kid, and I really believed that if he got a little push, good things would happen to him."
Paying the Hillmans' back rent would have just postponed their problems, Ms. Gongon said. A steady income was essential. She suggested places where Mr. Hillman could find work, and assured him that if he found a job, the agency would help him with his financial problems.
With his spirits lifted, Mr. Hillman returned to the job search, and within days he had again taken two full-time jobs. He stocked sporting goods at a ski shop in midtown Manhattan in the daytime, and worked nights at a shipping company in Kearny, N.J.
When Mr. Hillman received his first pay check, he went to the supermarket where Ines worked and explained his absence. Ines said that he had behaved foolishly, but she loved him, and their son missed him badly. She took him back.
Yet there was little time for a romantic reunion. Ines and Edward Jr. were scheduled to be evicted in two weeks. Mr. Hillman quickly found the basement apartment on 121st Street in Richmond Hill. Together, Edward and Ines had the first month's $500 rent, but they had no money for a security deposit. The Community Service Society, which relies on the Neediest Cases Fund to provide direct services, supplied $500 to help the Hillmans start over in a place they could afford.
Last month, Mr. Hillman helped Ines get a job at the ski shop where he works, and then quit his night job in New Jersey so that he would not exhaust himself again.
The Hillmans' apartment is small, but they are comfortable there, and they pay all their bills in advance. On the rare occasions when Mr. Hillman has a little extra money left over at the end of the month, he takes Edward Jr. to McDonald's, or buys lilies and roses for Ines.
"I have to admit, I like it," Ines said. "It makes the house smell nice."

HEADLINE: Gun Marketing Is Issue in Trial Against Makers

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
On the night of July 27, 1993, Njuzi Ray, 17, was fatally shot in a dispute on a Brooklyn street. A suspect was later acquitted, and nobody else has been arrested for the killing.
Normally a case like this would have long disappeared from public awareness, lost in the city's crime statistics and recalled only by the victim's family and friends. But the slaying in Bedford-Stuyvesant is once more in the spotlight, as a subject of a potentially precedent-setting lawsuit against the gun industry. Opening arguments in the suit could begin today in United States District Court in Brooklyn. 
 In the case, Mr. Ray's mother, Freddie Hamilton, and the relatives of five other people killed in separate shootings in New York City and Yonkers in recent years are seeking to hold the gun industry collectively liable for the deaths, just as many recent suits have attacked the tobacco industry as responsible for deaths and illnesses from smoking.
At the heart of the claims is the argument that more than 30 gun manufacturers and distributors have marketed and distributed handguns so negligently that dealers in states with lax gun control laws are oversupplied with them. Many of those guns, in turn, end up in the hands of criminals and youths in states with tough gun laws, like New York, the suit contends.
The suit is considered potentially precedent-setting because it invokes the theory of "negligent distribution" of guns, rather than charging liability on the basis of the product's inherent harmfulness, said David Leebron, the dean of Columbia University Law School and an expert in tort litigation.
Or, as one supporter of the suit boiled down the argument, the defendants -- including Smith & Wesson, the Colt's Manufacturing Company and Beretta USA -- "knew or should have known that they were oversupplying the legitimate market, thereby creating a pool of weapons available for the illegitimate market."
That supporter, Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the Washington-based Educational Fund to End Handgun Violence, said past suits seeking to hold gun makers and distributors liable for intentional killings often focused on narrower issues, like whether a single gun was marketed in a way that made its producer or distributor culpable. These suits have been repeatedly defeated in court.
The trial will be closely watched not only by the gun industry and gun control advocates, but by lawyers for municipalities across the nation.
The City of Chicago, for instance, recently filed suit against nearly 40 gun manufacturers, distributors and retailers, accusing the industry of flooding suburban stores with many more guns than the lawful market could absorb, allowing many of the weapons to supply the illegal market in Chicago, where gun control laws are among the country's strictest.
Philadelphia, Boston, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles are among cities considering similar suits. And New Orleans has filed suit on different grounds, contending that gun makers failed to include enough safety devices in their weapons.
Dean Leebron of Columbia said, however, that the theory of negligent distribution "is a difficult theory to prevail." While he said the argument was not without legal foundation, the applicable laws in the case do not "particularly favor collectively imposing liability or imposing special duties on manufacturers regarding the distribution of the product."
And one of the defense lawyers in the suit, Anne G. Kimball, contended in an interview on Monday that there was no evidence of any illegal or careless sale by any manufacturer or distributor in any of the shootings, and that the plaintiffs had "no facts that connect" any of the gun makers or distributors to any of the seven crimes cited in the suit. They include the six homicides and a case in which a young man survived a brain wound in a Queens shooting. He, like the relatives of the murder victims, is seeking to hold the firearms industry collectively responsible.
But Mr. Horwitz said he was optimistic, contending the argument about the gun industry's marketing practices was easy to grasp and likely to persuade the average juror.
The Brooklyn suit was filed in 1995. A year later, Judge Jack B. Weinstein rejected the gun companies' motions to dismiss it, saying it was possible that the plaintiffs would "be able to show that a substantial cause for the killings that are at the heart of this suit is the operation of a large-scale underground market" stemming from a handgun sales system that is "without adequate concern over the channels of distribution and possession."
Among the evidence that Elisa Barnes and the three other plaintiffs' lawyers are expected to offer are economic consultants' statistics that show, the consultants say, that handgun sales in states with weak gun control laws -- like Virginia, Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina -- "are higher than can be explained by legitimate demand, suggesting that a substantial proportion of sales in such states are not for legitimate purposes but for resale to the criminal market."
But Richard Feldman, executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council, an Atlanta-based gun industry group, said in an interview that to hold makers, distributors or sellers liable "for the criminal misuse of a lawfully sold product is to turn our whole tort system upside down."
Ms. Barnes said the suit did not state a figure for damages in the trial, in which about a dozen lawyers are representing the gun companies.Jury selection began Monday.
Meanwhile, the woman who helped start it all, Freddie Hamilton, said on Monday that she was "apprehensive but optimistic" as she awaited the opening arguments and testimony.
Speaking by telephone from the office of a Brooklyn child welfare group where she is the executive director, she said the case was "about the number of young people who get murdered by guns." Her goal, she said, was "keeping guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them."

HEADLINE: Texaco Is Said To Set Payment Over Sex Bias

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Texaco Inc. has agreed to pay $3.1 million to 186 women who were found by the Labor Department to have been systematically underpaid relative to their male counterparts, people involved in the case said today.
The agreement is the largest under a Labor Department affirmative action compliance program. It was signed by Labor Department officials today and is scheduled to be made public on Wednesday. The agreement follows several years of efforts by Texaco to deal with separate allegations of racial discrimination made by minority employees. 
 The agreement covers women who were employed between 1993 and 1996 in managerial and support jobs at the petroleum company's headquarters in White Plains and in offices in seven other cities across the country.
It is based on an examination begun in May 1995 as part of a program under which the Labor Department audits employment practices of companies that do business with the Federal Government. Documents outlining the settlement stated that it was a result of a "joint effort" by Texaco and the Labor Department and that it "does not constitute an admission by Texaco" of violations of any laws or regulations.
In draft documents describing the settlement, Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman said the review "found that women in mid-level positions throughout the company were underpaid as a matter of course for years."
The 186 women found to have been underpaid represent 2 percent of the 9,000 women employed by Texaco in the United States. Texaco's total work force in the United States is 19,800.
Kelly McAndrew, a spokesman for Texaco, said the company "did work cooperatively with the Labor Department," and that Texaco was pleased that the agreement cited no violations of employment laws or regulations.
The agreement calls for $2.2 million in back pay to be distributed to the 186 women, in amounts from $1,500 to $51,000, depending on salary, length of employment and other factors. A further $816,000 has already been distributed as salary increases to bring the paychecks of the women into line with those of male counterparts, and a further $84,000 has been set aside to deal with any future claims of salary inequity.
The $3.1 million package is the largest resulting from an audit by the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, which monitors affirmative action programs in companies that do business with the Government. Last spring, the Corestates Financial Corporation agreed to pay $1.5 million in back pay and salary adjustments after the Labor Department found a pattern of inequities affecting women and minority employees.
Those agreements, though, are dwarfed by settlements reached in civil lawsuits and in other Government actions against employers. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission agreed to a $81.5 million discrimination settlement in 1997 with Publix Super Markets Inc. And Texaco itself settled a racial discrimination lawsuit in late 1996 for $176 million.
The racial discrimination allegations led Texaco to adopt a program aimed at promoting equality, diversity and tolerance within the company. Last month it hired Deval L. Patrick, a former head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, as its general counsel, making him the company's highest-ranking black official.
People involved in the Labor Department investigation said that it had no connection to the racial discrimination allegations, which drew wide attention two years ago after a former Texaco official provided lawyers with tapes of Texaco executives speaking contemptuously of minority employees and planning the destruction of documents demanded in the discrimination lawsuit.
The agreement signed today by the Labor Department requires Texaco to analyze the compensation of its entire salaried work force every year, and in particular to look at the salaries paid to men and women in the midlevel pay grades covered by the settlement.
The company also agreed to take steps to expand opportunities for women and to submit a report within 45 days discussing what it has done to bring more women into upper-level managerial jobs and to recruit more women.
Under the agreement, Texaco has 30 days to notify the 186 eligible women that they are owed money. The Government audit covered Texaco headquarters in White Plains and offices in Dallas; Houston; Denver; New Orleans; San Antonio; Belair, Tex., and Beacon, N.Y.

HEADLINE: About New York;
Neighborhood Is the Source Of Real Capital

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
ON Saturdays, the checkout line at the Elmhurst branch of the Queens Public Library looks like a rush-hour token booth crowd. Nearby every seat is taken at the tables, where Asian and Latino readers pass the time. A few people browse through the racks of compact disks in Korean, Spanish and Chinese.
Among the new books displayed by the entrance was Michael Walsh's "As Time Goes By: A Novel of Casablanca." Makes sense, since this neighborhood -- where there are more new arrivals browsing through the shelves than on them -- has a mix of nationalities that would rival Rick's Cafe Americain. Since 1960, Elmhurst and Corona have undergone such a transformation from being nearly all-white to being Latino, Asian, white and black, that some demographers call them the world's most ethnically diverse community. 
"As time goes by" is a fitting sentiment for Roger Sanjek, an anthropologist who spent 13 years in Elmhurst and Corona, studying their ethnic makeover and the lessons they have for the rest of the country where immigration will have similar effects. In his book "The Future of Us All" (Cornell University Press, 1998), Mr. San jek says that residents of these communities bridged ethnic divides to work for neighborhood improvement through community boards, neighborhood groups and business associations. In doing so, they reaffirmed his belief that nurturing a neighborhood's social and economic life is more vital to the city's future than giving billions of dollars in tax and real estate breaks to huge companies that hold city officials hostage with threats to move out of state.
"People here are making changes in a daily and ongoing way," Mr. Sanjek, a professor of anthropology at Queens College, said on a recent walk through Elmhurst and Corona. "They meet each other in day-to-day problem-solving situations, they go to school, they go to the library. In this city the power of the neighborhood, in schools and on shopping strips, is enormous and has staying power. Yet the city's policies seem to work against them."
Consider the recent deal to keep the New York Stock Exchange from becoming the Jersey City Stock Exchange. (There ought to be a law: If they leave town, they should leave the name, too.) City and state officials ponied up $900 million in cash, tax breaks and subsidies to seal the deal, which has the governments buying an entire city block, where they will build a new trading complex. Supporters of the deal said the new digs would give the currently-cramped exchange plenty of room in which to stay competitive and preserve lower Manhattan as the world's financial capital.
THAT depends on your perspective, which, if it happens to be from Queens, might make you wonder. Cramped space? Just take a stroll through the bustling shopping strips in Elmhurst and Corona, where shopkeepers and customers would like to see an end to their subsidizing local government by way of constant parking and sanitation fines. Staying competitive? Tell that to the mom-and-pop merchants -- of all nationalities -- who banded together to defeat city-sponsored zoning changes that would have allowed megastores in their neighborhoods. That's why Mr. Sanjek dismisses "Capital of the World" justifications for big-bucks corporate retention deals as taking money that could be better used in neighborhoods.
" 'Capital of the world' ideology is harmful if we're talking about the economic future of the city," he said, "because the transfer of technology has made it possible to be anywhere to do business that used to be in lower Manhattan alone. We are bribing people to stay, but the result is seen in library cuts, schools that are not built, parks that are not maintained and a neighborhood that becomes a place that nobody wants to live in."
Then again, just looking at the Elmhurst library and seeing how people came from all over to this swath of Queens, the title of "Capital of the World" might be right for this neighborhood. Mr. Sanjek's field work at civic meetings, community rallies and everyday interactions in schools and stores proved to him that at their best, residents of Elmhurst and Corona have a sense of the world that makes them as cosmopolitan as any high-society globe-trotter.
"They live in a neighborhood where their neighbor is Chinese or Dominican and deal with each other as individuals," he said. "They see other people as more than just bearers of exotic cultures."
They see them as neighbors. It's a fundamental thing that applies as time goes by.

HAYES CORP., MODEM INNOVATOR, IS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The Hayes Corporation, a company that once dominated the personal-computer modem business, is shutting down after failing to find a buyer. About 250 employees were laid off on Monday, leaving only a handful. The company sought protection from creditors in October, in its second trip to bankruptcy court in the 1990's, and attempted a reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code as it talked to potential buyers. But its primary lender notified the company that it would not continue efforts to keep Hayes alive. Hayes owes some $42 million to creditors that include Nationscredit, Lucent Technologies and Rockwell Semiconductor Systems.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL;
Players Vote Today on Endorsing Their Negotiators

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
In the most chaotic day of the six-month-old lockout, the National Basketball Association players' union was trying to arrange an almost impossible travel schedule for its 400-plus members while trying to prevent the group from falling into disarray on the eve of the threatened cancellation of the season.
Nearly 250 players are expected to vote in Manhattan today whether to endorse their negotiating committee's recommendation to reject the owners' latest proposal. 
 That decision could either seal the fate of the season or spur last-minute negotiations with Commissioner David Stern and the league.
Stern and his negotiating team have said that if no agreement is reached by tomorrow they would recommend to the league's board of governors that the season be canceled.
Some players arrived in Manhattan last night, unsure of how the vote would be taken. Only players who make it to Manhattan will be allowed to vote, and the ballot will not directly address the owners' offer. Instead, players will be asked whether they support the union negotiating committee's recommendation to reject that proposal.
Repudiating the committee would be tantamount to acceptance of the league's proposal.
"We're going to put it to the test," Patrick Ewing, the union president, said, "but we're going to make sure they stand by their negotiating committee."
The union will decide this morning how to conduct the vote. Union officials last night appeared to be leaning toward an open vote rather than a secret ballot.
Isiah Thomas, the former union president who has been openly critical of Billy Hunter, the executive director of the union, and its negotiating committee, was catching a flight to New York last night.
Thomas, the former All-Star guard who was a part owner of the Toronto Raptors and is now an NBC analyst, said he had been contacted by 30 to 40 players yesterday about taking a stronger role in the labor dispute. "I will do whatever they want me to do," he said. "My role will just be to help some of the players really understand the process and understand the deal."
Thomas implied he would assume an active role if the union's negotiating committee was repudiated.
League officials said they had heard reports that a number of players had trouble contacting the union regarding the time and place of the vote and that field representatives for the union had called designated players and told them that the specific purpose of the vote was to endorse the negotiating committee.
Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief legal officer, said, "If that's what's going on, then this so-called vote sounds more like a bargaining tactic rather than a striking example of a union democracy."
A union official, speaking on condition of anonymity, responded: "The N.B.A. has openly solicited for a vote and now it's a bargaining tactic? This is a simple case of, you better be careful of what you ask for because you might just get it."
Though the movement for accepting the owners' offer continues to grow, both sides were expecting the union to reaffirm its solidarity before requesting a last round of bargaining with Stern and the owners' negotiating committee.
Stern has said the deadline he imposed is firm but did not discount the possibility of a last-minute negotiating session if the union backed on his final offer. Yet the pervading sentiment among many union officials was that regardless of the deadline, a deal could be reached in the next two days. Stern characterized today's union meeting as a "pep rally."
One way that could unfold is if the union relents on its desire to receive 57 percent of revenue in the last year of a six-year agreement and gives in to the owners on a new rookie system. In exchange, the union will most likely want several exceptions to the salary cap that deal with player flexibility and free agency.
The two sides are moving to within striking distance on minimum salaries and capping the high-end players, though they remain nearly $3 million apart on the highest-salaried contracts.
Of course, there are issues other than economics that remain outstanding. The agent Keith Glass said the league's image had been severely hurt in the players' eyes. "If they're successful in ramming this deal down the throats of the players, no one wins," Glass said. "Let's face it, the damage has been done. The N.B.A. is no longer fantastic. Stern's attitude has alienated most of the players. Whether they vote yes or not, that's not going to quell that animosity. We're not the feel-good kind of league anymore. Those days are over."
Both sides will have their full negotiating committees in town by tonight, and the league's board of governors has scheduled a meeting for 11 A.M. Thursday.
Thomas said: "The players need to take control of their own union again and remember that all the people who supposedly are making their decisions were hired by them to work for them. I hope they can resolve this inside their union, without having to go outside. However, if they are willing to go outside, I would be more than willing to help."
 The union's negotiating committee met yesterday afternoon and then began telephoning as many players as possible with the intention of swaying them toward coming to Manhattan. But several agents wondered whether a representative body of players would be voting.
For example, Kebu Stewart, a second-round pick of the Philadelphia 76ers last season who made the minimum salary, was having a hard time finding a round-trip ticket from Los Angeles for under $1,800, according to his agent, Eric Rudolph.
"I'm not saying he would vote for the deal, but he is an example of somebody who hasn't gotten a paycheck in a long time," Rudolph said. "Right now, he's in California. His voice won't be heard from because he can't come."
The union is expected to hold the vote this afternoon after a series of slide presentations of both the union's and the league's final offer.
P. J. Brown of the Miami Heat said: "If you're going to speak out, just do it because this is the time. It's not the time to hold back. I do have a couple of things on my mind. I'm not going to be intimidated by anyone."
Stern has been pushing for a player vote, and the union finally agreed to one after the owners' negotiating committee voted, 9-0, Monday to reject the union's latest offer.
One member of the union's negotiating committee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: "It's a gamble, but it's time to take the pulse of our guys. Now we'll see how all those rah-rah types on the conference calls will respond. I just hope they're coming to New York to vote for a deal, not whether or not they need a paycheck today."
 Jayson Williams said he was leaning toward voting yes on the proposal by the owners. "I think the meeting is going to be interesting," he said. "I have gotten about 40 calls over the last two days from guys who all feel the way I feel. Billy Hunter has been good, and so we all need to listen to what he says and the committee says. But we should vote."
Asked how the vote would come out, he said: "If it's a secret vote, I think it will be close. And if it's an open vote, then the union will win. It's hard to say without knowing how the vote will be done."
Keith Askins of the Miami Heat told The Miami Herald: "I'm upset because you're asking guys to come from around the country on a day's notice when there are quicker means to do this. I think the union negotiating committee knows a lot of players won't be able to make it."
Askins is already on the record as favoring the owners' proposal and was one of the first to come out and ask for a vote on the proposal.

HEADLINE: In Euro's Leap, Some Look for Net

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The future of the euro, the new currency for most of Europe, may require a "great leap of faith" (Op-Ed, Jan. 4), but a more compelling reason for concern is the fact that two former chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers cannot agree on the precise risks created by the new currency. 
 Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the first Clinton Administration, worries that by focusing on inflation to the exclusion of growth when the two are perceived to be in conflict, and by insulating the European Central Bank from national leaders, Europe is placing itself in peril of a social crisis triggered by what would otherwise be a small recession.
On the other hand, Martin Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan Administration, worries that by replacing the discipline of the German central bank with a bank that is equally responsible to each country and that is without any power to prevent violations of the euro's charter by national legislatures, Europe is heading down the path of higher inflation. This presumably could lead to lower growth and political turmoil.
The stakes are high. Weakness in the European financial system would place far greater strains on the American economy than recent problems in Asia.

HEADLINE: To Vestige of Black Farmers, Bias Settlement Is Too Late

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: GREENSBORO, Ga., Jan. 5

 BODY:
Willie E. Adams, a fourth-generation black farmer, is raising 48,000 chickens here on the same land that his ancestors farmed, some 85 miles east of Atlanta. But with $150,000 in debt, $90,000 to the Federal Government and $60,000 to banks, Mr. Adams says he is "just keeping my head above water."
By Mr. Adams's reckoning, he could be raising more than twice as many chickens if only the United States Department of Agriculture had been more fair and more efficient in processing the farm loans he has applied for over the last 22 years. Three of his five chicken houses, each longer than a football field, have stood empty for more than three years because Mr. Adams cannot afford -- even with commercial loans that also carry a higher interest rate -- to modernize his feeding and watering equipment to meet the standards of poultry processors. 
 Like thousands of other black farmers, Mr. Adams maintains that he has not gotten a fair shake from Federal farm loan officials because of his race. Today, the Federal Government all but conceded as much when the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, announced the settlement of a class-action discrimination lawsuit that black farmers filed against the Government in 1997.
Though pleased by the public acknowledgment of their plight, many black farmers said today that the settlement would do little to reverse the stunning decline of independent black farming, a livelihood that has carried a special nobility ever since freed slaves were granted 40 acres and a mule.
The relief, which makes farmers who claim they were discriminated against eligible to receive $50,000 tax-free and to be forgiven their Federal debt, is too little, they said, and it has come too late, particularly for those who have lost their farms to foreclosure or whose children soured years ago on a life of farming. The settlement, granted preliminary approval this afternoon by a Federal judge in Washington, does not free the farmers of the burden of commercial debt they took on when they could not get Government money, nor does it punish the mostly white county agents who for decades denied them loans, they said.
In 1920, 14 percent of the nation's farms were owned by blacks, according to Federal statistics. By 1992, the number had dwindled to 18,816, or 1 percent, and now, hobbled by age, racism and corporate competition, even fewer blacks till the land.
Already, the black young people raised on farms have fled for other professions in other places, and nothing may lure them back.
"I want to see my children and other young blacks be able to have pride in agriculture," said Mr. Adams, while touring the rank-smelling sheds where his roosters are fattened before being processed into chicken nuggets. "But with the way the U.S.D.A. treated us, young people don't see any future in farming."
Mr. Adams, 48, and several other black farmers said today that the settlement did nothing to address the paradox created by the Government's discriminatory practices. When denied Federal loans or granted loans insufficient to meet their needs, black farmers often went to banks. But with the higher rates, the farmers' debt accumulated quickly.
Though the settlement will eliminate the farmers' debt to the Government, which typically ranges from $75,000 to $150,000, the $50,000 payments may not be enough to pay off or restructure the bank loans.
Black farmers have the option of forgoing the $50,000 and negotiating a higher settlement through an arbitrator, but that requires extensive documentation of discrimination.
"As far as the settlement, it's not going to be of help to me," said Charles Dennard, 47, a farmer in Pineview, Ga.
Mr. Dennard said that $72,000 of his $160,000 in debt is with the Government and presumably would be forgiven. That still leaves him with $88,000 in debt to private lenders. Had he been granted the Government loans he sought in the first place, he would never have applied for the commercial money, he said.
"They're on my neck at the bank to foreclose," Mr. Dennard added.
John DeCourdreaux, a blueberry farmer from South Haven, Mich., said he, too, was not satisfied with the settlement. "To me," Mr. DeCourdreaux said, "this is a pat on the back from the Agriculture Department, saying: 'We acknowledge what we did. Here's enough money to get out of our hair.' "
Mr. DeCourdreaux said $50,000 may appease those who are no longer farming. "But for people like me who are still currently farming and have all the documentation, $50,000 isn't going to buy me a good truck."
Gary R. Grant, 55, a farmer in Tillery, N.C., said it was unjust that the settlement did not include punishment for the Federal officials who denied loans to black farmers.
"These folks took our homes, took our credit rating," said Mr. Grant, president of the Black Farmers and Agriculturists Association. "These folks are not even getting slapped on the wrist as far as we know."
In most of the documented cases, racial discrimination came not from the Department of Agriculture bureaucracy in Washington, but from committees of local agents who administer Federal farm programs in their counties. These county committees, known as Farm Service Agencies, are usually elected and are usually all-white in the South, where most black farmers live.
In hundreds of complaints filed in Washington over the last 15 years, black farmers say they were routinely denied the aid granted almost automatically to whites. Sometimes, they say, Federal officials demanded evidence of agricultural and financial expertise that was not required of white farmers, or delayed processing loans until after the planting season had arrived. Other times, they contend, their applications were rejected with overt racial rebuffs.
The Farm Service Agencies lost much of their say over who is eligible for Agriculture Department aid in December 1997, when Mr. Glickman, seeking to repair the department's civil rights record, announced that decisions on loans would be made in Washington. He also required state executive directors of the department to review half of all rejected loan applications to minorities and women to insure that denials were for legitimate reasons.
At a news conference in Washington on Monday night announcing the settlement, Mr. Glickman said that he was embarrassed by the discrimination and that the department had a great deal of repair work to do. Though the settlement does not admit or deny any discrimination, he called civil rights the most important single issue facing the department.
He said the agreement "will close a painful chapter in U.S.D.A.'s history and open a more constructive front in our efforts to see this department emerge as the Federal civil rights leader in the 21st century."
Civil service rules make it difficult to discipline current employees who participated in the discrimination or oversaw it, Mr. Glickman said.
He said that the final cost to the Government would not be known until it was clear how many farmers would file claims, but that the 1,000 farmers now part of the class-action lawsuit were likely to receive about $200 million in payments and debt forgiveness. If, as expected, another 1,000 to 2,000 farmers file claims, that amount could double or triple.
Even those black farmers who were disappointed in the financial package praised the Government for seeking to redress past wrongs.
"I think it takes a lot of courage for the Government and Secretary Glickman to acknowledge that people have been treated poorly, and they should be commended for that," said Gary Cornelious, a vegetable grower in Boone, Iowa. "The act of discrimination is a devastating thing for any farm family to have to go through, and it can literally wipe a farm out."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 8, 1999, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the Agriculture Department's settlement of a discrimination lawsuit filed by black farmers in 1997 referred incorrectly to bonuses offered some black farmers after the Civil War. Although Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman set aside thousands of acres of confiscated and abandoned land in Georgia and South Carolina for settlement by blacks, with each family also receiving an Army mule to work it -- a program known as "40 acres and a mule" -- the offer was canceled by President Andrew Johnson, who returned the property to its prewar owners.

HEADLINE: How Much Military?

BYLINE: By Michael O'Hanlon; Michael O'Hanlon, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the author of "How to Be a Cheap Hawk."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
C ritics have likened today's United States military to the post-Vietnam "hollow force" of the 1970's. They are wrong, though they are right to point out that the military is in worse shape than it was a few years ago.
A decline in new recruits is a problem, along with cuts in training for some units and aging equipment. But the answer is not a drastically inflated Pentagon budget. In fact, President Clinton's proposed small increase for the year 2000 -- some $4 billion -- and slightly greater amounts in the years after for mundane things like spare parts should be enough to shore up military readiness. 
 Why, then, is he calling for an additional $110 billion in increases over the next six years? To please defense hawks. But it is really Mr. Clinton's successor who will be stuck with the bill -- and with a Pentagon expecting to have the money to buy all the gold-plated weapons still on its wish lists.
True, in recent years the Pentagon has spent about $45 billion a year on procurement, half what it averaged in the 1980's (adjusted for inflation). Just to keep the force reliable and safe, that figure needs to climb by more than $10 billion. However, existing Pentagon plans for new weapons will cost at least $70 billion a year in the next decade. That spending cannot possibly be offset by base closings and personnel cuts.
Congress, which is holding hearings on the matter, should urge a more sensible approach to updating the armed forces. We are already far ahead of our foes, real and potential, without stockpiling next-generation weapons like F-22 Raptor fighters, Comanche helicopters, Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and joint-strike fighters. Instead we should adopt a "high-low" technology mix, purchasing modest numbers of advanced weapons while also buying or refitting more of the kinds of weapons we already have.
The Pentagon's plan to modernize the force through better munitions, communications systems and reconnaissance systems like satellites and unmanned aircraft makes sense, as those improvements can be made economically.
Today's armed forces may be showing signs of strain, but their equipment remains safe and effective. They are suffering historically low casualty rates on test and training ranges and are still getting the job done when called to respond to crises in the Persian Gulf or the Balkans. Without a more realistic strategy for replacing and upgrading aging military equipment in the next decade, these accomplishments could be put in jeopardy.

HEADLINE: Arts Council Chairman Resigns

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
Earle I. Mack, an arts patron and former real estate developer who helped restore financial aid to the arts in New York State to a level not seen in nearly a decade, has resigned as chairman of the New York State Council on the Arts.
Mr. Mack, who was appointed in 1996 by Gov. George E. Pataki, said he would remain on the board but would resign as chairman as of Monday to spend more time with his family. 
 In his resignation letter to Governor Pataki, Mr. Mack said that the council had met virtually all of the goals that Mr. Pataki had envisioned. He said that before Mr. Pataki's first inauguration, the state arts budget had been cut by 56 percent over a five-year span, morale was low and the arts infrastructure at the council and around the state was eroding.
When Mr. Mack became chairman the council's budget stood at $31.6 million, after a series of cuts during the state's economic downturn; it now stands at $46 million. The increase "has not only resurrected the nonprofit cultural sector in New York State," said Mr. Mack's letter, dated Monday, "but also the council as well."
The council distributes grants ranging from hundreds to many thousands of dollars to more than 1,000 museums, cultural heritage groups and performing arts companies around the state. From April 1995 through December 1998, it gave $138.5 million for 9,000 grants to 1,300 arts organizations.
Norma P. Munn, the chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, a citywide advocacy group, said the general consensus among her colleagues was that Mr. Mack had served the council and the arts world well. A deliberately low-key man, he won a reputation for being energetic and finding common ground with upstate and city legislators for financing and programs, despite the initial suspicion that his appointment was a favor for financial support of Mr. Pataki's campaign.
"I found Earle to be extremely hard-working," Ms. Munn said. "I found him sophisticated about the political atmosphere in Albany. One would expect him to have connections to the Governor, but he had connections to the legislators."
"I'm devastated he's leaving," said Randall Bourscheidt, president of the Alliance for the Arts, an advocacy group in New York City. "He understood the bottom-line need was for a restoration of funding. In three years he's accomplished an incredible amount."
Because of his political connections, Mr. Mack assumed his post under the skeptical eye of many artists and arts organizations, who were well aware of his role in organizing a major fund-raiser for and making a $25,000 contribution to Mr. Pataki's 1994 campaign and top contributions to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's 1993 campaign. Although he served on the board of the City Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem, Mr. Mack was better known as a senior partner of a family-controlled real estate and investment business, the Mack Company of Rochelle Park, N.J., and for serving on the board of the state's Racing Association.
He also became chairman of the council at a time of intense frustration with Republican cuts to the arts at the national and local level. He had the additional challenge of succeeding the immensely popular Kitty Carlisle Hart, who served on the arts council through five administrations and was described once in The New York Times as "the state's premier campaigner for rural string quartets and inner-city dance troupes."
During Mr. Mack's tenure, though, Mrs. Hart called his budget increase victories "nothing short of miraculous." He also won points for organizing the first state arts technology conference; putting together three studies on the economic impact of the arts; establishing an arts partnership program in the public school system and helping to make available a license plate to salute and promote the arts in New York State. The $39.50 "State of the Arts" plate includes a $15 contribution to the council.

HEADLINE: Baltimore's Push on Crime Creates Backlog of Cases

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Jan. 6

 BODY:
More aggressive efforts by the Baltimore police to reduce the rate of homicides and other serious crime in the city has created such a backlog of cases that a circuit judge has dismissed first-degree murder charges against four men who had been awaiting trial for almost three years.
The Deputy State's Attorney for the city, Haven H. Kodeck, said today that his office intended to appeal the decision, by Judge Roger W. Brown. But Mr. Kodeck also said Judge Brown's ruling reflects "an overburdened court system" and an unintended consequence of recent efforts by Baltimore's Police Commissioner, Thomas C. Frazier, to drive down crime rates as the city tried to polish its image to attract new residents and economic development. 
 Mr. Kodeck applauded the police work but conceded: "There's not a whole lot we can do, and when the system fails, it's regrettable. We feel that that judge's decision was wrong."
Judge Brown's ruling, issued on Tuesday, followed a decision last month by a Maryland appeals court to overturn a sex-charge conviction against a man whose trial had been postponed nine times over 13 months because no judge was available on the next scheduled day for the trial to begin. In general, a felony trial is supposed to begin six months after arraignment, the court appearance in which charges are filed.
But as the Baltimore police grapple with about 300 homicide cases a year, as many as 1,500 nonfatal shootings and thousands of cases in which people are arrested for involvement with illegal drugs, the demand for judges, prosecutors and public defenders has grown to an overwhelming level.
The case on which Judge Brown ruled involved four men -- Jay Anderson, 30; William Harrison, 21; Donte Spivey, 22, and Stacey Wilson, 29 -- who were accused of shooting to death Shawn L. Suggs in October 1995, when he was 21.
The four men spent several months in jail and then were released on bail. While free, Mr. Spivey was arrested for another killing and was held, pending trial.
But Judge Brown dropped charges against them in the Suggs case after the trial date was postponed 12 times because of the unavailability of a judge, a prosecutor or a defender.
Judge Joseph H. H. Kaplan, chief judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore, said in an interview that the current backlog of felony cases exceeded 5,000, "and it is not inconceivable that some of them go back more than a year."
Contributing to the backlog, Judge Kaplan said, is the availability of only 11 courtrooms and a limited number of prosecutors and public defenders, who are vastly overmatched by the number of cases.
Mr. Kodeck said his entire office comprised 170 lawyers, only 18 of whom were assigned to violent crimes, each of them carrying as many as 18 homicide cases.
Michael N. Gambrill, the District Public Defender for Baltimore, said his office had only 109 lawyers, with 31 of them assigned to felony trials. Their average case load, Mr. Gambrill said, is 67 open cases, and some of the defenders are handling more than 100 open cases.
"We have to cover district courts, circuit courts and central booking," he said. "The need is tremendous."
Judge Kaplan said he tried to ease the pressure last May by adding two courtrooms for felony cases, only for them to go unused because the public defender's office, which is financed by the state, did not have the personnel to take advantage of them.
"There's a shortage on both sides," Judge Kaplan said. "It's more critical on the public defender side, but it's certainly a serious situation. It's like trying to put 10 gallons in a 2-gallon jar."
Mr. Gambrill said -- and Judge Kaplan agreed -- that much of the backlog had evolved from aggressive efforts by the police to reduce the level of illegal drug activities.
But problems arise, they said, when the police make sweeps, arresting dozens of people at one time and charging all of them with felony-level crimes, when the offenses by some might only be less serious misdemeanors. Unlike in some other jurisdictions where prosecutors determine the charges, in Baltimore the police do.
Those kinds of arrests, Mr. Gambrill said, "are clogging up the court."
"If one addict is passing a capsule to another addict, the police charge both with distribution, a felony," he said. "Technically, it is distributing, but the question is, do you want to put that case on the circuit court docket? We've got 60,000 drug addicts in the metropolitan area. You can't arrest all those people and not clog the system."
Robert Weinhold, a spokesman for the police department, disagreed with Mr. Gambrill's assertion, saying, "Officers are charging individuals within the legal framework set forth by state legislators."
Mr. Weinhold also said the police found it extremely frustrating that an overworked criminal justice system was allowing defendants to go free.

HEADLINE: The Great Pork Gap;
Hog Prices Have Plummeted. Why Haven't Store Prices?

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: PARK RIDGE, Ill.

 BODY:
Inside a giant Dominick's Supermarket here, Sam Ventura was buying some high-grade pork chops.
At $3.99 a pound, Mr. Ventura was not fretting. "This isn't a steal, but the price is fine," he said, unloading a cart of groceries at the checkout counter as his 5-year-old son, Vinnie, looked on. "We eat pork every week, and you never hear bad things about it -- none of that mad-cow stuff." 
 But to Rick Dean, a hog farmer in Leroy, Ill., two and a half hours south of this Chicago suburb, the price was a disgrace. While the pork products from just one of his hogs yields about $304 at the supermarket, he was paid just $29 apiece when he took his hogs to market a few weeks ago -- down from about $110 a year ago. "We've got a lot of financial stress," said Mr. Dean, a third-generation hog farmer. "It's pretty discouraging."
What is happening to all that money? Federal officials are looking into that question after hog farmers around the nation complained that something unusual was going on, something unfair -- perhaps even illegal.
For more than six months, a glut in the number of hogs being raised sent hog prices plummeting to Depression-era lows. Yet the price of pork at the meat counter has barely budged.
So while much of the nation is splurging on pork chops, ham and bacon, allegations of price-gouging are being leveled against the meatpackers that turn hogs into pork products, and to a lesser extent against the giant supermarket chains that sell them.
"We're very concerned about the prices producers are getting paid," said Cynthia Cunningham, a spokeswoman at the National Pork Producers Council in Des Moines. "Something isn't right."
Meatpackers and retailers counter that Government figures fail to reflect a significant drop in prices because they do not measure the amount of pork sold at a discount.
"Almost everything we sell moves at a special price," said Tim Hammonds, president of the Food Marketing Institute in Washington, a trade group that represents some of the nation's largest grocery chains. "Retailers are aggressively featuring pork."
They also argue, with the support of many economists, that the traditional market forces of supply and demand largely explain why hog prices have plunged even though the price of pork has not fallen nearly as much.
 Prices for live hogs have bounced off their lows in recent days, with prices reaching 19 cents a pound on Tuesday, according to the Department of Agriculture -- up from a low of 10 cents a pound in December.
 It is no surprise that the farmers' crisis has caught Washington's eye. Federal officials acknowledge that some pricing data could be faulty, but they are also concerned about the growing gap between hog prices at the farm level, which are down 65 percent, and pork prices at the retail level, which are down just 2 to 3 percent -- a spread that economists say is one of the widest on record.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has asked the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to look into possible price-fixing or anticompetitive pricing by meatpackers.
And the National Farmers Union is urging Federal officials to investigate competition in the pork industry, where 75 percent of the packing is controlled by just six companies -- Smithfield, IBP, Swift, Excel, Farmland and Hormel Foods.
Several large meatpackers say that they have cut prices about 30 percent from a year ago, and that they are working overtime to slaughter and process a record number of hogs, more than two million a week -- 10 percent more than a year ago.
"There are hogs everywhere," says Jens Knutson, a spokesman for the American Meat Institute in Washington, which represents meatpackers. "The prices are really what is necessary to clear the market; these are market forces at work."
Because of that glut, meatpackers are bidding down the prices when farmers call to say they want to deliver a truckload of pigs. Some farmers say they no longer shop around; they simply ask if and when a packer will take delivery. This gives packers tremendous leverage -- leverage that industry officials say may be battering farmers and enriching packers.
Several big meatpackers acknowledge that for them these are good times indeed. "There's no question packers are making good money," said Gary Mickelson, a spokesman at IBP in Dakota City, Neb., one of the nation's largest meatpackers. "But ultimately it's the law of supply and demand."
As a result, after two years of losses, IBP has been posting record profits, up more than 125 percent in the third quarter of 1998, and its shares jumped more than 37 percent in 1998. Hormel, the large meat processor based in Austin, Minn., also reported record profits of nearly $140 million in 1998.
Pure greed is hardly the issue, though. Economists say that a more complicated set of factors is at work.
"The probability of collusion or anything like it is near zero," said Glenn Grimes, a professor of agricultural economy at the University of Missouri at Columbia. "I just think the American people aren't that price-conscious."
One reason retail prices have not fallen sharply, economists say, is that soaring demand for pork means retailers are under less pressure to lower prices. But that is only part of the answer.
Much of the dispute can be traced to the data. According to the Agriculture Department, the price of live hogs -- which the farmer sells to the meatpacker -- has fallen as much as 65 percent from a year ago. The wholesale prices that the meatpackers get for their pork products, though, are down 30 percent. And the retail price of pork (an average of several products: ham, pork chops, sausage, bacon and pork roast) is down just 2 to 3 percent from a year ago, at $2.26 a pound.
Retailers said that the grocery-store data failed to reflect that most pork was sold at discount. Pork prices, they said, are actually down 13 to 19 percent from a year ago. Even so, the drop-off is nowhere near the plunge in farm prices.
Economists noted that farm and retail prices did not usually move in lockstep, because the cost of the raw commodity was only one component in the cost of delivering meat to consumers. But -- even if the retailers' figures are correct -- economists also said that the spread between the two did not usually bulge as large as it had been.
"There is reason to be concerned that retail prices are not behaving as they have in the past," said John Lawrence, a professor of agricultural economics at Iowa State University. "There's usually a two-to-four-month lag in the change in prices. But it's been over a year now and it's still not following."
Agriculture Department officials acknowledged that their data were incomplete, possibly even flawed. But economists said that data for 1994 -- when farm prices also declined sharply -- showed that the spread between retail and farm-level prices was far narrower, and the two sets of prices moved more in tandem than now.
But what really bothers hog farmers -- even those who say their production boom sparked this crisis -- is the way revenue has been divided.
In recent years, retailers received about 47 cents for every dollar of pork sold, while meatpackers took in 16 cents and hog farmers, who were enjoying hefty profits, 37 cents. But now, with live hog prices down from about 35 cents a pound a year ago to about 11 cents today, those percentages have been turned on their head.
Retailers now get about 60 cents of that dollar, meatpackers 22 cents and hog farmers just 18 cents, according to the Agriculture Department.
Meatpackers have taken the brunt of the criticism, but retailers are also coming under scrutiny.
"There are a segment of retailers who are taking advantage of the equation," said Dallas Hockman, a vice president at the National Pork Producers Council. "Right now, all the cards are in their favor. But I say to them, 'Are you willing to take significant margins today to disrupt the supply chain and hurt margins down the road?' "
Retailers dispute any suggestion of price-gouging. "We don't see anyone taking excess profits," said Mr. Hammonds of the Food Marketing Institute. "And the exercise in finger-pointing is not the way to solve the problem. We are conscious of what pork producers are going through. And we're trying to move pork.
"We are saying to consumers: 'Add ham and pork.' "
Indeed, when retailers met not long ago with Mr. Glickman, the Agriculture Secretary, they brought a large supply of grocery-store circulars promoting pork specials.
It's the same at many stores. At a Hyvee Foods supermarket in Iowa, for example, the meat section was plastered during the Christmas weekend with hand-written signs urging shoppers to "Try Our New, Low, Low, Low Pork Prices!"
Nearby, a Fareway's supermarket initiated "Operation Pork," offering pork loins with bones for 69 cents a pound.
But just as often, consumers say, they are seeing stocks of pork that are not discounted. Consequently, some shoppers here in the Midwest -- where hog farms are integral to the economy -- have begun to ask why the price of pork has not fallen as sharply as, say, the price of gas, which is now as little as 80 cents a gallon.
"None of us understand why they haven't lowered their price even more," said Jan Kline, who was shopping with her family at a Cubs Food outlet in Ames, Iowa, shortly after Christmas. "I guess they're just keeping the price up to make a profit."
John McMillin, a food-industry analyst at Prudential Securities, said prices may fall now that the holiday rush is over. But he also said supermarkets had every right to profit in good times, because they suffered when the meat or dairy or poultry equation turned against them.
"The hog growers of America have made inordinately high returns for several years," he said. "One reason there are so many hogs right now is that returns have been so high."
Another reason retailers have not been cutting prices more aggressively, Mr. McMillin said, is that consumers dislike price volatility, particularly in the meat aisle.
Still, the pork industry finds itself in a quandary. While officials would like to see lower prices help sell more pork -- and thus eliminate it from the supply chain -- pork consumption is soaring even at relatively high prices.
If pork industry officials press too hard for lower prices, some economists say, it could move the supply faster, but consumers could also get used to cheap pork -- pork that is less profitable for farmers and retailers.
So industry officials have been careful about attacking the retailers that are helping push pork consumption to record levels.
"We want people to buy pork because they like it and because it's a good value," said John Hargerla at the National Pork Producers Council. "We don't want to be the cheapest meat on the block."

HEADLINE: Northrop to Take a Charge; Profits SeenBelow Analyst Forecasts

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
The Northrop Grumman Corporation, the nation's largest maker of airframes for commercial aircraft, said yesterday that it would take a $125 million fourth-quarter charge and that 1999 annual profits would be about 20 percent below expectations because of the downturn in demand by Asian countries for Boeing 747's.
The Los Angeles-based Northrop produces the fuselage for the Boeing 747 jumbo jet, popular with Asian airlines. Last December, as Asian countries saw a dramatic downturn in air traffic as the region's economy weakened, Boeing announced it was cutting 747 production to two airplanes a month, from five a month just two years ago. 
 The ripple effect of the Asian economy has hit Northrop as it regroups after a proposed takeover by the Lockheed Corporation was called off last July because of Government objections. Northrop's stock traded as high as $108 a share just before the takeover was halted.
It then tumbled and had begun to recover slightly last fall before the Boeing announcement in December knocked it down again. Yesterday, the stock closed at $69.3125, down $3.9375.
For 1999, Northrop projected it would earn around $6.33 a share, or $1.18 a share less than the $7.51 consensus of equity analysts. "We believe the current analysts' consensus estimate of $7.51 is overstated," said Kent Kresa, Northrop's chief executive. The company will announce its 1998 earnings on Feb. 3. In 1997, the company had sales of $9.2 billion.
Of the $125 million fourth-quarter charge, a total of $105 million is due to the 747 production cutbacks along with an increase in costs of fuselages currently in production. The rest is due to delays in a series of tests on a joint defense program with the British and United States defense departments that have resulted in $20 million in unrecoverable costs.
"Northrop is being pretty up front in defining these numbers," said Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The hardest part was coming to a conclusion of what the numbers would be and Northrop has done a good job of quantifying it." Each of the 153-foot main 747 fuselages that Northrop makes generates around $10 million for the company, which has been the 747's principal airframe subcontractor since the 747 program began in 1966.
The new write-off adds to a previously announced 1998 accounting charge of $60 million.
The company is also in the midst of reducing its work force of 54,000 by about 17 percent, or 9,000 workers, in 1999, through layoffs and attrition.
The Asian downturn also caused Allied Signal Inc., the world's 10th- largest aerospace company, to realign its aerospace business to save $30 million to $50 million. The Morris Township, N.J., maker of aircraft equipment, facing the same slowdown in global demand for commercial aircraft, said it expected to reduce costs through layoffs and consolidation in its supply chain.
The company did not provide information on how the aerospace business would be realigned. But investors reacted more favorably, with the stock closing at $44.6875, up 87.5 cents.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Pledge $7 Billion For Missile Defense System

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Sixteen years after President Ronald Reagan envisioned a "Star Wars" program to protect the United States from ballistic missile attacks, President Clinton plans to pledge about $7 billion over six years to build a limited missile defense system, even though he will leave a final decision on whether to build it until later, officials said.
Mr. Clinton is not expected to decide whether -- and how -- to build a system until the summer of 2000. And at this point, no one has proved that such a system will work. 
 But the officials said the decision to set aside money in the Pentagon's budget now was meant to underscore the Administration's political commitment to the idea and to head off growing criticism from Republicans in Congress that Mr. Clinton was not doing enough to defend the nation from a missile strike.
Since Mr. Reagan unveiled his dream of creating an impenetrable shield against nuclear missiles in 1983, the nation has spent some $55 billion trying to develop a workable weapon -- so far to no avail. But never before has any money been put in the budget actually to build one.
The money, which officials put at roughly $7 billion, is part of the more than $100 billion in new spending Mr. Clinton is expected to propose giving the Pentagon between now and 2005 when he submits his budget to Congress next month.
The White House and Pentagon declined to discuss the spending proposal today, but the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, signaled the Administration's intent at an appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.
General Shelton said the Pentagon had the resources to continue to develop the program. The Administration is "also putting money into the program so that at the time that we have the technology, if in fact the threat justifies it, then we could go ahead with the fielding," he said when questioned about Mr. Clinton's commitment to a missile defense system.
The system now being developed and tested is a mere shadow of the space-based network of satellites and lasers that Mr. Reagan envisioned to knock out even the largest Soviet nuclear strike. The Pentagon officially abandoned that concept in 1993 and has since concentrated on using ground- or sea-based missiles to intercept perhaps a few missiles launched either accidentally from a superpower like Russia or deliberately by a hostile nation like North Korea.
Even with a pledge of money, the effort remains burdened with economic, technological, political and diplomatic problems. And there are lingering doubts that one will ever be feasible.
The system faces a pivotal test in June. The program's developers, led by the Boeing Company, plan to launch a dummy missile from Vandenberg Air Force Base, in California, and try to destroy it in space over the Pacific Ocean with an interceptor missile fired from Kwajalein Atoll, in the Marshall Islands.
Three more tests are scheduled before Mr. Clinton makes a decision next year. Previous tests of interceptor missiles have failed, as have tests of shorter-range missiles, like those in the troubled Theater High-Altitude Area Defense program, or Thaad, run by the Army. But officials at the Pentagon express confidence that a limited system may at last be technologically at hand.
"Those of us who work in the program are very confident we're going to have a working system, and we're going to have it soon," Lieut. Col. Richard A. Lehner, a spokesman for the National Missile Defense Program, at the Pentagon, said today.
Republicans in Congress have long wanted to revive at least part of Mr. Reagan's original vision. Faced with Republican-sponsored legislation mandating the creation of a national system, Mr. Clinton promised to proceed with research for three years and decide in 2000 on whether the threat justified building a system by 2003, a policy referred to a "three plus three."
A Pentagon official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Administration had to include money in the Pentagon's future budgets or its promise to consider building a system would ring hollow.
"This is a recognition that we can't have our cake and eat it, too," the official said.
Others said the White House and Pentagon had concluded that the threat from intercontinental missiles from hostile nations was growing, noting North Korea's test of a three-staged missile on Aug. 31. Although Mr. Clinton and his aides have not yet made a decision, one senior Administration official said, "they're coming closer."
Representative Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, a Republican and one of the strongest proponents of a national missile defense, said he would welcome a decision to put money in the budget. But Mr. Weldon said he remained skeptical about the President's motives and vowed to press again for legislation to build a system as soon as possible.
"It's certainly grudgingly coming around," Mr. Weldon said of the Administration. "I'm still not sure there's a solid commitment there."
Many arms control advocates argue that a system -- if someday workable -- would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1972, which sharply limited the number, type and placement of missiles that could be used to counter enemy missiles.
Other critics argue that the effort squanders resources that could better spent trying to keep terrorists or hostile nations from ever acquiring the technology to develop weapons in the first place. And even within the Pentagon, there are those who argue that the real threat of nuclear attack against the United States is a terrorist armed with a warhead in a car or truck, not a nuclear-tipped missile fired from thousands of miles away.
"This does not seem to be a wise and balanced approach to U.S. defense needs," said Spurgeon M. Keeny Jr., president of the Arms Control Association in Washington.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
TheN.B.A. Finally Returns and Marketers Yawn

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
The agreement in principle reached yesterday to salvage the National Basketball Association season is being welcomed by most marketers and agencies, particularly those that covet the younger male consumers who fervently follow the Bulls, Knicks, Lakers and all that Jazz.
But in an ominous sign for the long-term advertising appeal of the league, apart from those executives directly involved in marketing footwear and apparel, many others described little if any significant damage from the six-month lockout. And they expressed concern that the late start to the season, as well as lingering perceptions of players and officials more concerned about salaries and selling than statistics and scoring, would alienate fans. 
 "The N.B.A. got confused, thinking the fan base was the television audience," said Jon Mandel, co-managing director of Mediacom, the media services agency in New York owned by Grey Advertising, which buys time and space for marketers like Reebok International Ltd.
"But it's the fans who follow the game who are really in charge of your brand image," he added. "So if you tell them, 'Let 'em eat cake,' it's more than just a labor issue."
Donny Deutsch, chairman at Deutsch Inc. in New York, the agency for the Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker athletic retail chains owned by Venator Group, echoed Mr. Mandel's cautionary comments.
"All this bad will has the N.B.A. in trouble," Mr. Deutsch said. "I'm a huge fan, but I will not go to a game this season."
"Basketball is driven by individual athletes, more so than other sports," he added. "But the players are looking unlikable, like fools."
Gene DeWitt, the chairman at DeWitt Media in New York, a media services agency, compared the dispute between the players and league officials to "two sets of bankers having a battle."
The public's attitude, he added, "is like a pox on both their houses."
"People have formed other habits without N.B.A. games," he said. "The damage to the sport, certainly for this year, could be tremendous."
There were two reasons given for the widespread opinions that the difficulties inflicted upon advertisers were minimal. One was the breadth of media alternatives to professional basketball, particularly in an era of manufactured sports like the Winter X Games and myriad cable and broadcast networks.
"There's a variety of other male-targeted, very male-oriented programming," said Monica Karo, the Los Angeles media director for TBWA/Chiat/Day, a unit of Omnicom Group. "For clients like Sony, Apple, Kinko's, Nissan and Infiniti, we found other places to advertise.
"To reach men 18 to 24, 18 to 34, 25 to 49 and 25 to 54," she added, "we've used other sports, primarily college basketball and football, some cable like CNN and Discovery and syndication."
Andy Donchin, the vice president and director for national broadcast at Carat North America in New York, a media services arm of Aegis Group P.L.C., said that for advertisers like Alberto-Culver and Midas, "we re-expressed the money into appropriate programming to give us male viewership." He said that included the "male-oriented movies" scheduled by the TNT cable network, part of Time Warner Inc., in lieu of the N.B.A. games that were to have appeared on the network.
Bob Igiel, executive vice president and broadcast director at the Media Edge in New York, the media services unit of Young & Rubicam Inc., said: "Some clients just wanted pro basketball and held money back until play resumed. For those who needed media weight in January and February, we used prime time, football and college basketball."
"That tightened up the first-quarter TV market," he added, referring to the shrinking inventory of commercial time that has produced more robust demand than is usual for the post-holiday season. Indeed, the trade publication Mediaweek reported this week that commercials during network prime-time programs in the so-called scatter market -- the spots that were not bought before the 1998-99 season began -- were nearly sold out.
The other main reason given for the commonly held belief that the effect of the lockout on advertisers was slight was the rhythm of the pro basketball season: Earlier games attract less attention than later games and later games attract less attention than playoff games.
"Most of our attention is focused on the playoffs," said Brad Shaw, a spokesman for the Pepsi-Cola Company unit of Pepsico Inc. in Purchase, N.Y., "so the impact on us was minimal." To help introduce the Pepsi One soft-drink brand, aimed at younger men as well as women, "we've been largely on network prime time," he added, "which was the plan anyway."
A competitor that rarely agrees with Pepsi-Cola did so this time. "Ratings climb as the season progresses," said Scott Jacobson, a spokesman for the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta, which bills its long-term sponsorship agreement with the league as a "100-year partnership."
"In most seasons, we tend to have heavier media weight toward the end," he added, "so while we'll be figuring out a way to make up for some lost time, it was kind of business as usual; this was not disruptive at all."
Aware before the lockout began that "there might be a labor situation," Mr. Jacobson said, Coca-Cola executives planned so that their annual professional basketball promotion, for the Sprite soft-drink brand, would work with or without games being played. In fact, the promotion, called the Sprite Salary Cap, capitalized on the publicity for the dispute with satirical spots by Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York -- part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies -- showing players like Grant Hill and Tim Duncan pretending to need work.
One commercial, which showed players performing chores for callers to a make-believe job referral service, 1-800-TALL-MEN, generated "between 300,000 and 400,000 calls," Mr. Jacobson said, adding that callers heard a recorded message from Hill in which he said: "I can't believe you really called. It's a joke, a joke," then described details of the Sprite promotion.
Some advertisers, of course, need the N.B.A. more than others. Sales of sneakers and other athletic paraphernalia, especially for marketers that sponsor the N.B.A. or have a stable of player-endorsers, have been weakened by the lockout.
"It certainly has hurt the industry over all," said Vizhier Mooney, a spokeswoman for Nike Inc. in Beaverton, Ore., "and Nike is included in that." She said it was impossible to quantify the sales decline "because the industry was flat to begin with."
Nevertheless, Ms. Mooney said, "We're looking forward to being able to showcase again our footwear and apparel and our relationship with the athletes and the league."
Nike, too, parodied the lockout problems in advertising, running a campaign by Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., in which celebrity fans of pro teams, like the director Spike Lee and the actress Dyan Cannon, delivered spoof tributes to neighborhood pickup games and eighth-grade girls' basketball.
"There's nothing that will replace professional basketball," Ms. Mooney said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
As StocksRise on the Continent, Euro Falls Against the Dollar

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The euro fell sharply against the dollar yesterday, marring what was expected to be a pleasant honeymoon after the currency's introduction on Monday. A drop of 1.5 percent to a value of $1.15920 left the new currency below the initial reference rate of $1.16675 set on Dec. 31.
Its decline came despite a continued rally in European stock markets, some of which are up 8 percent in just the first three trading days of the year. 
 Analysts and traders said the euro selling was caused by several factors. One was rumors -- which were not confirmed -- that there were problems in settling trades in the new euro. A spokesman for the European Central Bank denied there were any problems.
In addition, the dollar rallied against the Japanese yen after a seven-day decline, a move that seemed to spill over into euro trading. And trading in the new euro is still cautious and relatively light, which means that its moves during one day can be exaggerated.
The dollar also got a boost from a sharp rise in United States stocks, which sent the Dow Jones industrial average and other indexes to new highs, and from automobile sales and housing data that showed that the American economy is still healthy.
"I don't think it means it has emptied the tank of the euro," said David Gilmore, a partner in Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. "There is still an argument for a stronger euro. But it is a setback."
He said he had expected the euro to climb steadily and quickly to a value of $1.20. So the decline was a surprise.
Another analyst said that traders were "jumpy" but that it was too early to say the decline would set a trend for the euro's value.
Given that the euro has not been able to hold its own in its first three days of trading -- its only up day was Monday -- Friday could be very important for the new currency. That is when the Labor Department releases the December employment report and Germany announces its employment data.
Given current expectations -- for a weak German report and moderately robust American data -- the euro could face some more selling pressure. "I would argue at this point that the U.S. economy has more momentum going into 1999 than Euroland does," Mr. Gilmore said.

HEADLINE: Chase Bank to Levy Fees on A.T.M. Users Without Accounts

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Chase Manhattan Bank, the largest bank in New York City, said yesterday that it would impose fees for non-Chase customers who use its automated teller machines. Chase had been one of the last holdouts among banks in the city in not imposing the fees.
Beginning on Saturday, Chase will charge a fee of $1 or $1.50 at its 1,499 A.T.M.'s in New York and New Jersey, but not in Connecticut, where laws bar such fees. Yesterday's announcement does not affect Chase's banks operated under a separate subsidiary in Texas, where fees are already imposed. 
 "What we charge will depend on what other folks are charging," said Jack Stack, executive vice president for consumer banking, referring to other banks.
In New York City, the fees will be $1, but they will be $1.50 in New Jersey and elsewhere in New York. Bruce Zimmerman, senior vice president for consumer banking, said the move was justified because "Chase customers shouldn't be subsidizing non-Chase customers."
There are exceptions to the fee. Of Chase's 430 branches in New York and New Jersey, 60 branches will not impose the fee.
In those branches, chosen on the basis of census data, 50 percent or more of the residents of the immediate area, in the words of a Chase prepared statement, belong to low- and moderate-income households. Non-Chase customers who receive public-assistance payments electronically will also not be charged, the bank's statement added.
Nationwide, as interest rates have stayed at historically low levels, banks have sought new sources of income to supplement interest from consumer loans like home mortgages.
Banks operating A.T.M. networks have been able to impose fees since April 1996, after settlement of a lawsuit challenging the fees.
"This is disappointing," said Jules Polonetsky, the city's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs. "Banks may claim that bank customers using A.T.M.'s subsidize nonbank customers, but it's the banks that really benefit because A.T.M.'s are more efficient than human tellers. Now they are charging a fee that is probably far more than their operating costs in order to turn A.T.M.'s into profit centers."
Mr. Polonetsky said a recent consumer affairs survey of 39 New York City banks showed that 30 of them imposed A.T.M. surcharges on noncustomers.

HEADLINE: Office Maintenance Strike Is Averted

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
After 25 straight hours of talks, negotiators representing the managers of 1,000 New York City office buildings averted a strike yesterday by reaching a tentative agreement with the union representing about 30,000 building maintenance workers.
Negotiators for the city's real estate industry agreed to a contract that gives janitors, handymen and elevator operators in office buildings a wage increase of 3 percent a year for the next three years without substantial union givebacks. That makes the contract considerably more generous than the agreement negotiated three years ago after a painful monthlong strike that created chaos in the city's office towers. 
 "It wasn't the same atmosphere as three years ago," said James F. Berg, chief negotiator for the Realty Advisory Board, the industry's bargaining group. "The industry is a little healthier, and we were able to find a solution where we were willing to go a little further."
Real estate industry officials said they did not feel the same pressures to demand major concessions as they did three years ago when the vacancy rate in Manhattan was nearly twice current levels and office rents per square foot were about 25 percent below today's.
Mr. Berg, an executive vice president at the Realty Advisory Board, acknowledged that in this year's talks, the industry gave up its demand to further reduce the workers' starting salary from the lower starting rate obtained in the 1996 round of talks.
Under the new agreement, the union gained a higher maximum pension after 20 years, rising to $1,000 a month from $850. The new contract does not apply to residential buildings.
Mr. Berg began a marathon negotiating session at noon on Tuesday with Gus Bevona, president of the building workers' local, and they ended their talks around 1 P.M. yesterday at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers in midtown Manhattan.
The previous three-year contract expired at 12:01 A.M. Jan. 1, and Mr. Bevona was threatening to begin a strike at 7 A.M. yesterday if no accord was reached by then.
Mr. Bevona, president of Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union, issued a news release saying he was "delighted with the results."
The union has long boasted that its workers are among the highest-paid janitors in the country -- a fact that industry officials complain pushes up their operating costs and rents, contributing to making the city's real estate industry uncompetitive.
The union's janitors earn about $32,000 a year on average, although in the last contract, the industry won the right to pay new workers 20 percent less than experienced workers, with new workers graduating to the rate of other workers after 30 months.
Under the new contract, which runs from the first day of this month to Dec. 31, 2001, the janitors' salaries will increase to just under $35,000 in the third year.
"We'd like to think we both kind of won here," Mr. Berg said. "We were pleased that we were able to achieve a settlement that is within national norms and that we were able to afford."
He said that one modest achievement for the industry was the clarification of some contractual language that he said would give building managers some more flexibility in holding down costs.
Union officials said they planned to poll their members over the next few days in a ratification vote. The real estate industry ratified the agreement yesterday, at a meeting held right after the talks ended, when the Realty Advisory Board's 37-member board of directors approved the agreement.
The contract was negotiated with a healthier backdrop for the city's real estate industry. Three years ago, the contract talks broke down and a strike erupted when Mr. Bevona balked at the industry's demands for a lower starting salary as a way to hold costs down.
The strike left the workers picketing for weeks in withering January cold and left office buildings in chaos as managers scrambled to find people to shovel snow and asked office tenants to carry their own wastebaskets to central garbage collection areas.
At the time, the industry was worried about a soft rental market, a high vacancy rate and competition from lower-rent communities like Jersey City and Stamford, Conn.
But with the city's economy doing better than three years ago, there is less concern about competition from the suburbs. Barbara Byrne, director of research at Colliers ABR Inc., a commercial real estate brokerage firm, said that the vacancy rate had declined to 8 percent for prime Manhattan office buildings, down from 15.2 percent three years ago. And the average rent per square foot in prime Manhattan commercial buildings has climbed to $44.80, up from $31.25 three years ago.
According to industry officials, when all wages and benefits are factored in, the workers' compensation will rise in the new contract by 2.9 percent in 1999, 3.02 percent in 2000 and 2.85 percent in 2001.

HEADLINE: November New-Home Sales Hit a High

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Sales of new homes rose in November to a record, which should bolster economic growth in coming months.
Low mortgage rates and consumer optimism pushed up sales of new single-family houses a stronger-than-expected 7.6 percent in November, to 965,000 units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, after a 6.4 percent gain in October, the Commerce Department said. That was far above expectations of a rate of 860,000. 
 "This isn't a fluke," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd. in Valhalla, N.Y. "This should give a big boost both to consumer spending on furniture and appliances in the first half of the year and to construction."
Through November, new-home sales are running 9 percent ahead of the 753,000 sold during the first 11 months of 1997.
When sales of existing homes are included, the housing market is on track to register a third consecutive yearly record in 1998.
Underscoring the housing market's vitality, October new-home sales were revised higher to a pace of 897,000 units from 851,000 units.
Unseasonable warm weather in October and November -- temperatures in the Midwest were 30 percent higher than normal -- also contributed to the stronger sales, analysts said, and the dry, mild December probably meant there were further gains last month.

HEADLINE: Financiers Plan To Put Controls On Derivatives

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON and TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
With the blessing of the Federal Government, some of the world's largest financial institutions reached an agreement today to try to set their own industrywide standards in the huge and volatile market of the complex securities known as derivatives.
By setting its own voluntary guidelines, the industry hopes to both lessen the chance of recurrences of problems in the derivatives markets and keep stricter regulations from being imposed by Washington. But previous attempts at self-regulation in the derivatives markets have met with limited success. They did little to stave off the near-collapse last September of Long-Term Capital Management L.P., the huge Connecticut hedge fund. Long-Term Capital had invested heavily in derivatives, which are financial contracts that are supposed to manage a company's risks, particularly during turbulent changes in the economic climate. 
 Executives involved in drawing up the agreement, which will be formally announced on Thursday, said that by late spring the group would begin to write a set of industry guidelines governing everything from trading practices to lending standards and disclosure requirements.
The agreement, which was reached in Manhattan at a meeting of top executives from 12 leading foreign and domestic institutions and senior Federal officials including Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was warmly embraced by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury Secretary. Mr. Rubin heads an interagency group that is considering what changes may be necessary in the largely unregulated and steadily growing market in derivatives, so named because their value is derived from underlying products such as stocks, bonds or currencies.
The agreement also reflects a decided policy position by the Treasury Department and regulators that both the underwriters and the traders of these financial instruments have a pivotal role in policing themselves, a view shared by Wall Street.
"This will enable practitioners to implement the latest improvements in risk management and to begin the cycle of innovation all over again," said one senior executive on the committee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Thomas A. Russo, an authority on derivatives regulation and managing director at Lehman Brothers, one of the companies serving on the group, said the formation of the group "is highly significant and a credit to the Government regulators for encouraging a private initiative to have global best practices in the risk-management area."
But some analysts disagreed and were either critical of the effort or skeptical of what it would ultimately achieve.
"I think it's the fox guarding the henhouse," said Charles Peabody, a banking analyst with Mitchell Securities Inc. in New York. "There's an inherent conflict because you won't police something too carefully if you're making a lot of money on it. That was the lesson of Long-Term Capital, and that's why you need an independent outside regulator."
Henry Hu, a derivatives expert and professor at the University of Texas Law School, said: "To the extent that it establishes norms about how people should behave, I think it is a good thing because the people being regulated know more about the products than the regulators. But a lot depends on whether it's merely aspirational or meant to be mandatory."
Others questioned whether a group of companies with deeply conflicting financial interests would be capable of mustering consensus on regulatory issues where agreement has proved to be elusive.
Government officials and industry executives praised the idea today. Administration officials involved in an interagency group set up after the collapse of Long-Term Capital and led by Mr. Rubin said that its conclusions would not be affected by the industry's work. Washington has so far moved cautiously in formulating any new regulations on the industry.
E. Gerald Corrigan, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York who is now a senior executive at Goldman, Sachs, and Stephen G. Thieke, a top official at J. P. Morgan, will be co-chairmen of the industry group. The other members of the group are Barclays, Bear Stearns, Chase, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and UBS.
Most of the group's members were involved in the bailout of Long-Term Capital. Th hedge fund, which borrowed heavily and threatened to wreak havoc on the financial markets when its investments began to sour, was rescued by Wall Street at the intervention of officials from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Several of the companies involved in the new group have recently taken significant hits on their earnings from either their investments in Long-Term Capital or their investments in derivatives.
In derivatives markets, an American company doing business in Britain, for example, might buy an option on the pound to protect itself against a decline in the currency that could hurt its profits, posted in dollars. Such a derivative is a standardized contract that trades on regulated financial exchanges. But many other kinds of derivative contracts are tailored for specific parties. In interest rate swaps, for example, one party agrees to exchange a fixed interest rate for a floating rate with another specific party for a specified period. These kinds of contracts are traded over the counter and remain off banks' balance sheets, making them difficult for regulators to handle.
The derivatives market has boomed over the last decade to become one of the most lucrative activities on Wall Street. About $37 trillion worth of privately traded derivatives contracts are outstanding, up from $865 billion in 1987, according to the International Swap and Derivatives Association. That figure, however, represents the paper, or "notional," value of all of the underlying financial products used to create a derivatives contract. The actual exposure of most banks to the derivatives contracts they carry is only a small percentage of the paper value, in most cases well less than 1 percent of that amount.
The impetus for the banks' derivatives proposal was a meeting convened in December by Mr. Levitt at Morgan Stanley's New York headquarters. Two other investment banking firms -- Goldman, Sachs and J. P. Morgan -- also were represented at that meeting, where it was decided that Mr. Corrigan and Mr. Thieke would oversee the working group assigned to create the self-regulatory proposal. Today's meeting was also held at Morgan Stanley's headquarters, and many of the group's chairmen attended.

HEADLINE: Republicans to Push for a Tax Cut of Up to $500 Billion

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Key Republicans in the House and the Senate said today that they planned to push for a tax cut of as much as $500 billion over the next decade, including cuts in income tax rates, to take advantage of Federal budget surpluses that appear to be growing faster than previously projected.
Even a general agreement on an approach would be a marked change from the bitter fight among House and Senate Republicans last year over how hard to push for tax cuts. The proposals are still in tentative form, and aides said working out the details would be difficult. 
 But the effort represents a concerted challenge to President Clinton's strategy of blocking any substantial tax cuts until after Congress and the Administration settle on a plan to shore up Social Security.
The tax cuts would probably be dependent on the surpluses actually materializing, and would be financed only by that part of the surpluses that does not come from excess Social Security tax revenue, members of Congress and their aides said.
Until now, nearly all of the surpluses over the next decade have been projected to come from Social Security taxes beyond what is needed to pay current beneficiaries. As a result, Republican tax-cutting plans have been attacked by the President and Congressional Democrats on the ground that they would endanger the retirement system, which is already facing long-term financial problems.
But new estimates of the surplus being developed by the Congressional Budget Office suggest that about $500 billion of the $1.8 trillion in surpluses likely to materialize in the next decade could come from outside Social Security, and that the non-Social Security surpluses could begin showing up in sizable amounts as soon as 2001, Republican aides said.
There is also mounting political pressure on Republicans. With their poll ratings plummeting as they pursue the ouster of Mr. Clinton, Republicans are scrambling to present a positive agenda. Most of the party's leaders see tax cutting as the most potent tool available.
But if they press ahead, they could find themselves in a heated battle with the White House.
The President announced today that the White House now expected the surplus for the current fiscal year to be $76 billion, as compared to the last estimate from the Congressional Budget Office of $63 billion. But Mr. Clinton vowed to continue opposing tax cuts and spending increases that use the surplus until the Government deals with Social Security's looming financial problems.
"Like any family with long-term financial needs and a little more earnings than expected, we can't go out and spend the surplus today," the President said in announcing the surplus forecast at the White House. "We have to plan for the future."
If the 1999 fiscal year ends in a surplus, it will be the second consecutive year after 29 years of deficits. In the fiscal year 1998 the Government recorded a surplus of $70 billion.
Republicans, whose tax-cutting efforts were paralyzed last year by Mr. Clinton's Social Security strategy, now say they are increasingly comfortable that they can cut taxes while assuring voters that they are setting aside more than enough money for any overhaul of Social Security. The White House had hoped to reach a bipartisan agreement early this year on dealing with Social Security, but negotiations on the issue have all but ceased because of the impeachment proceedings against the President.
Under a plan being considered by Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, across-the-board reductions in income tax rates could be phased in as the non-Social Security surplus grows in coming years.
Aides said one idea under consideration was to create a "trigger" that would put the tax cuts into effect only when the surpluses actually materialized, so the cuts would not push the budget into deficit if the economy and tax revenue faltered. The Congressional Budget Office will release updated surplus estimates at the end of this month.
House Republicans pushed hard last year for a big tax cut, but found little support from their colleagues in the Senate, who were more cautious about crossing Mr. Clinton on Social Security. Senator Domenici and his counterpart in the House, Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, were at odds throughout much of the year. Because of the impasse, Congress failed for the first time in 25 years to adopt a basic tax and spending blueprint.
But the approach being developed by Mr. Domenici and his staff appears to have support in the House as well. Mr. Kasich said in an interview that he had spoken with Mr. Domenici about the plan on Tuesday, and that although it was too early to say how House Republicans would respond, he was encouraged.
"The idea that Senator Domenici wants not only to reform Social Security but to have substantial tax relief is music to my ears," Mr. Kasich said, adding that an across-the-board cut in income taxes of as much as 10 percent "is something I believe in very strongly."
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has argued since last year that there is enough money to deal with Social Security and cut taxes at the same time. Although they would not be specific, aides to Mr. Archer said he wanted to focus this year on tax cuts that would promote economic growth, a phrase usually used to refer to rate reductions.
There is likely to be continuing tension among Republicans, though, over how hard to push for across-the-board tax cuts at the expense of tax breaks favored by social conservatives, particularly a reduction in the marriage penalty paid by many two-income couples.

HEADLINE: French Premier Assails U.S. Over Iraq Air Strikes

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 6

 BODY:
France's Prime Minister criticized American and British air strikes against Iraq in an interview published today and said that France would soon be ready to propose ways for ending the impasse with Saddam Hussein.
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin told Le Monde, "The United States often acts in a unilateral way that undermines its ambition of mobilizing the international community." 
 "That was clear in the conflict with Iraq," he said. "What's the reality after the Anglo-American strikes? We've gone from a situation where the entire international community, with the United Nations, was reminding Iraq of its obligations, to a direct confrontation between the Baghdad regime and our American and British friends. I don't see how that's progress."
France, he said, was working on ideas to end the crisis in a way that would insure "lasting regional security" but permit Iraq to resume oil exports.
"In general," Mr. Jospin said, "I believe there is a need for France to assert itself more on the international scene, not because of its power or wanting to teach anybody lessons, but because it has a different way of seeing a certain number of international realities."
"France, a friend of the United States, does not automatically share that great country's point of view," he explained.
President Jacques Chirac and other French officials expressed disappointment at the British and American decision to bomb Iraq last month after it stopped cooperating with United Nations arms inspectors, but the official French reaction held Mr. Hussein to blame for the crisis.
Mr. Jospin, a Socialist, observed in the interview with Le Monde that presidential pronouncements on policy did not carry the same weight now as they did when Mr. Chirac's conservatives controlled both the presidency and the Government, from 1995 to mid-1997.
Mr. Jospin is widely expected to run against Mr. Chirac in the next presidential election in 2002.
Put on the defensive by Le Monde about what effect his Government's plan to move to a 35-hour workweek would have on France's 11.5 percent unemployment rate, Mr. Jospin replied that joblessness stood at 12.6 percent when he was elected, with 190,000 more people on the unemployment rolls than at the end of last year. Healthy economic growth stimulated by Government measures created 350,000 jobs in 1998, he said.
As for the 35-hour week, he said it would encourage negotiations between workers and managers at all levels of the economy on all kinds of questions.
"But the 35-hour week is not the only way to reduce unemployment," he said, adding that the Government would use Government money to create jobs for young people who have the most trouble finding work.
Mr. Jospin said that reducing juvenile delinquency and crime would be his highest priority this year, after jobs. And asked about growing strains within his leftist coalition, which includes Communist and Greens ministers as well as Socialists, he said, "Maybe we've accomplished more in 19 months than wearing ourselves out."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Governor's Address to the Legislature

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Gov. George E. Pataki's State of the State Message to the Legislature in Albany yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
New York must have a constitutional amendment that says that if any legislature wants to raise taxes on the people of New York, if state government wants to take more of the people's hard-earned money, if the bureaucracy wants to get bigger and costlier and wants the families of New York to pay for it, it can't do it easily. It will take a two-thirds vote of each house of the Legislature for each and every state tax increase. . . . 
 As part of our ongoing efforts to fuel the economic engines of New York's tourism industry, we've launched an unprecedented effort to restore and to promote our state's historic landmarks. . . . That is why I will propose legislation and funding to create a New York Heritage Trail. From the French and Indian War to the American Revolution, from Fort Ticonderoga to the Erie Canal, from Washington's headquarters in Newburgh to Walt Whitman's birthplace on Long Island, from John Brown's farm in Lake Placid to the Michigan Avenue Baptist Church in Buffalo, which served as a stop along the road to freedom through the Underground Railroad, these are sacred places. They tie us to our past and make us proud. . . .
In a month we'll be selecting the best 30 Build Now construction-ready sites, bringing this unique job-creation tool to virtually every corner of our state.
To add to that success, I will propose targeted tax incentives to make these and other development sites more attractive to businesses looking to expand and create jobs in New York. . . . And one of the most fertile areas of high-tech job creation is in biotechnology. That's why today, I am proposing a plan that will make the city of Buffalo a national leader in biotechnology research and business development. . . .
We need meaningful court reform and we need to clean up the political process with campaign finance reform. We need to keep the doors of our schools open until 7 o'clock at night by expanding advantage schools. And we need to clean up the air we breathe inside as well as outside by providing tax credits for businesses that create environmentally sound "green" buildings.
If we convince ourselves that New York is the best that it can be, if we convince ourselves that we've changed all that needs changing, if we convince ourselves that the prosperous times we've created are prosperous enough, then we draw bounds around a people who are boundless and place limits on a destiny that is limitless. But if we have the wisdom to understand that we are only as good as what we leave behind, then one day, what you and I do here will help to fulfill the dreams of a child we'll never know in a time we'll never see.

HEADLINE: 4 Childbirth Specialists Challenge U.S. Goal of Reducing Caesarean Births

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
Four leading childbirth specialists in Boston are challenging the Federal Government's goal to reduce the rate of Caesarean births, saying the effort could in fact be endangering some mothers and their babies.
In 1990, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, concerned about unnecessary surgery and health care costs, set a goal to reduce the national Caesarean rate to 15 percent by 2000. At the time, 23.5 percent of babies were delivered by Caesarean section. The current rate hovers around 21 percent, down from a high of 25 percent in 1988 but still way above the 5 percent rate in 1970 and not likely to reach 15 percent anytime soon. 
 The Boston experts, who published their views as an opinion article in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, fear that economic forces are driving efforts to reduce the number of operative deliveries without sufficient study of how a lower rate of Caesareans would affect the well-being of mothers and babies in different situations.
"The assumption that lowering the Caesarean section rate would reduce costs and represent better care is too simplistic," said Dr. Benjamin P. Sachs, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and chief author of the journal paper. "To go above the current rate is probably unacceptable, but if we're going to go below that, we have to have a monitoring system and safeguards in place to assure the safety of mothers and babies. Quality of care, not costs, should matter first and foremost."
His collaborator, Dr. Frederic Frigoletto, chief of obstetrics at the Massachusetts General Hospital, said, "We should begin by identifying what the rate should be for given conditions: multiple births, breech presentation, diabetes in the mother, etc. We need data to determine this so we can establish rates based on the best outcomes, not rates set by bureaucrats with economically driven motives."
Dr. Sachs and his colleagues agree that a vaginal delivery is better and cheaper than an operative one, "but only if it is safe." For example, they said, the use of vacuum extraction to assist in cases of difficult labor results in brain bleeding in 6 percent of births.
Asked to comment on the views of Dr. Sachs and his colleagues, Dr. Roger Freeman, an obstetrician and perinatologist at Long Beach Memorial Hospital in California, agreed that in some cases, hospitals had "gone too far" in trying to bring down Caesarean rates.
Dr. Freeman said, however, that there was clearly room for improvement. He pointed out, for example, that in low-risk patients, "there is great variability in the Caesarean rate -- from a low of 5 percent to a high of 40 percent -- from doctor to doctor, hospital to hospital and region to region."
"This tells me," he said, "there is probably an opportunity to lower the rate of Caesareans, at least among ordinary low-risk patients. But what that rate should be, I have no idea."
A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, Damon Thompson, told The Associated Press that the 15 percent goal was based on consultation with hundreds of groups, and was only a target, not a quota. Mr. Thompson said studies had shown that hospitals could lower the C-section rate without compromising safety.
The 15 percent goal, established in the report Healthy People 2000, grew out of concern that far too many operative deliveries were being performed in this country, often for reasons not medically justifiable, like the convenience of the doctor or the pregnant woman. These reasons added to an already rising rate prompted by the growing use of fetal monitoring during labor. Monitors reveal when a fetus's health and survival are being jeopardized by letting labor continue toward a vaginal delivery, but they also sometimes falsely indicate difficulties, prompting Caesarean deliveries that turn out to have been unnecessary.
In addition, obstetricians facing skyrocketing malpractice costs and lawsuits when a delivery went awry, increasingly began practicing defensive medicine. Rather than take a chance that a baby would be injured during a difficult vaginal delivery, many doctors elected to perform Caesareans when faced with the slightest doubt about the baby's well-being.
Managed care companies are playing a major role in current efforts to reduce the rate of Caesarean births, which usually result in higher hospital and physician costs than a simple vaginal delivery. While agreeing that vaginal births were generally safer and cheaper, Dr. Sachs and his colleagues said growing pressures to avoid Caesareans were resulting in some ill-advised efforts at a vaginal delivery that often end up costing far more than a Caesarean and risk the health of mother and baby. They expressed particular concern about pressures on doctors to encourage every woman who has had a previous Caesarean delivery to try a vaginal birth.
"If the woman's uterus ruptures, which happens in 1 percent of these cases, the mom hemorrhages and may need a hysterectomy and the baby may end up brain-damaged or dead," Dr. Sachs said. Even if the baby is O.K., he said, the costs would be much greater than if a Caesarean had been performed.
Dr. Bruce L. Flamm, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center in Riverside, Calif., said that "the cheapest way would be to operate electively in every case, not that I'm an advocate of more Caesareans." Dr. Flamm explained that in calculating the costs of vaginal versus operative deliveries, experts often failed to take into account the time a woman having a vaginal delivery spent in the hospital in labor.
Several factors now stand in the way of a sharp reduction in the Caesarean rate. One is the growing number of women having medically assisted multiple pregnancies resulting in high-risk births and those having first babies late in life. Older women are more likely to encounter difficulties in labor and to have underlying medical conditions that warrant an operative delivery. In addition, they and their doctors tend to be less willing to risk fetal injury during a vaginal delivery.
"Anxiety definitely plays a part in the decision to do a Caesarean," Dr. Sachs said. "If a woman is having her first child at 46, neither she nor her doctor is willing to take any chances."
Both Dr. Flamm and Dr. Freeman pointed to yet another obstacle: the still large number of obstetrician-gynecologists who are in solo or small practices. A doctor facing a complicated operation or an office full of patients the next day is not going to want to stay up with a woman in labor all night awaiting a vaginal delivery. In a large group practice, one physician can be on call for deliveries at night and then go home to rest the next day because there are other doctors available to handle office and hospital demands.

HEADLINE: Sworn In as Senator, Schumer Promises Money for New York

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
With his left hand on his silver-and-jade-trimmed bar mitzvah Bible, Charles E. Schumer was sworn in today as New York State's newest United States Senator, vowing to be a legislator who not only passes bills but also -- in the tradition of the man he defeated, Alfonse M. D'Amato -- delivers money and services to the state.
On a bracingly cold and brilliantly clear day, Mr. Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn, also vowed not to let "the cloud of impeachment" distract him from working on what he said he considers the state's top issues: health care, crime, jobs, Social Security, education and campaign finance reform. 
 "Whether the trial lasts six days, or six weeks or even six months, I have six years to do the things that I want to do," Mr. Schumer told a group of about 50 friends and relatives at a cookies-and-coffee reception sponsored by the National Soft Drink Association on Capitol Hill.
Though he served nine terms in the House, Mr. Schumer sounded every bit the freshman legislator today, looking wide-eyed as he pumped well-wishers' hands and confessing to feeling "tingles down my spine" after passing the lighted Capitol dome the night before.
"I'm ready, excited and awe-struck at the chance to legislate," Mr. Schumer, 48, said at a news conference before he was sworn in by Vice President Al Gore.
Mr. Schumer was one of eight new Senators, four Democrats and four Republicans, sworn in to Congress today. On the House side, 40 new members were sworn in, 23 of them Democrats and 17 Republicans.
Mr. Schumer is the only new Senator from New York, New Jersey or Connecticut. There are six freshmen representatives from the region: four from New York and one each from the other two states.
It was a bit like homecoming week for several of the new members from the New York metropolitan region today outside the ceremonial room where representatives were being photographed with the newly elected Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, a Republican from Illinois.
There was Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat and former City Council member from Brooklyn who was elected to Mr. Schumer's old seat, talking to Representative Vito J. Fossella, a Republican who represented Staten Island in the City Council before being elected to Congress in 1997.
Farther down the line, Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, a Republican from the Buffalo area, slapped backs and shared congratulatory chatter with two other New York freshmen: Representative Joseph Crowley, a Queens Democrat, and Representative John E. Sweeney, a Republican from Troy. All three had been in Albany until they were elected last November, Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Crowley in the State Assembly, and Mr. Sweeney as an aide to Gov. George E. Pataki.
"It's good to be working again," Mr. Crowley said as he left the House chamber after casting his first vote. "I had been unemployed for five days."
Mr. Weiner, 34, gave his inaugural floor speech today, urging his colleagues to vote against reappointing the House managers who will argue the impeachment against the President in the Senate. But Mr. Weiner tripped a bit by calling for a no vote on the motion when he wanted a yes one. (The managers were reappointed).
"It's a shame I'll be revising my first remarks, but it was a bit of a nerve-racking experience," Mr. Weiner said.
Most of the new members brought bus loads of friends, relatives and former campaign workers to Washington to witness the solemn oaths, and then party afterward.
One of the largest contingents -- about 350 people -- came from New Jersey with Representative Rush D. Holt, 50, a physicist from the Princeton area who upset a Republican incumbent last November. During a midday reception, where the guests could be heard chatting about atomic elements and ocean warming over sandwiches, Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, quipped that 60 years after the Manhattan project was inaugurated to build an atomic bomb, "We finally have someone in the House who understands it."
Later, Mr. Holt, a Democrat, visited Representative Christopher Shays, a Republican from Stamford, to endorse Mr. Shays's efforts to enact legislation to toughen Federal campaign finance rules. "This is an issue that is particularly relevant to freshmen," said Mr. Holt, whose father was a one-term Democratic Senator from West Virginia during the 1930's. "We are the ones with the most recent exposure to the excessive demands of fund-raising."
Mr. Schumer, already known for his prowess as a bill writer, said today that he would work hard to help individual communities with their problems, echoing a theme President Clinton raised while campaigning for him in New York.
"One thing I never did was demean the title 'Senator Pothole,' " he said, referring to Mr. D'Amato's sobriquet. "I think that is an important role for a Senator."
Mr. Schumer then announced that he had already delivered for the town of Ogdensburg, near the Canadian border, by getting Clinton Administration approval for the town to use Federal transportation funds to renovate a Post Office into a commercial center.
Mr. Schumer, who received a relatively small share of the vote from north of New York City, said he had spent much of the post-election period traveling upstate and would make it one of his priorities to bring new jobs to that economically hard-pressed region. Among other things, he said, he would urge companies in New York City and other states to open branches in that region.
Mr. Schumer, who supports censuring but not removing the President, said he was deeply concerned that a drawn-out impeachment trial would leave a bitter partisan divide in the Senate. "It left a tremendous amount of rancor in the House," he said. "And one of my jobs, I think, is to try and prevent that from happening in the Senate. I think you can have strongly held views on this, which I do, without letting it get in the way of bipartisan relationships on other issues."
The new Senator, known for his aggressive pursuit of headlines, said he would try to hold regular news briefings with members of the New York press corps, as his fellow Democratic Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, did for many years. "I don't think too many people in the media are going to be griping that I'm not available," he said, prompting peals of laughter from the gathered reporters.

Remarks to Congress by Dennis Hastert in His First Day as Speaker of the House

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Following are the remarks today by Representative Dennis Hastert, the Illinois Republican who was elected Speaker, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription agency:
Thank you, Mr. Speak -- Mr. Leader for your kind and thoughtful remarks. I'm going to break tradition, and at this point I am going to ask you to hold the gavel so that I may go down to the floor. 
 Customarily a new Speaker gives his first remarks from the Speaker's chair. And while I have great respect for the traditions of this House and this institution, I am breaking tradition this once because my legislative home is here on the floor with you, and so is my heart.
To you, the members of the 106th Congress, to my family, friends and constituents, I say thank you. This is not a job I sought, but it is one I embrace with determination and enthusiasm. In the next few minutes I will share with you how I plan to carry out the job you have given me.
But first, I think we need to take a moment, and I want to say goodbye to a member of this House who has made history. Newt, this institution has been forever transformed by your presence. For years to come, all Americans will benefit from the changes you have championed -- a balanced budget, welfare reform, tax relief. In fact, this week families all over America are beginning to calculate their taxes and, to help them, they will find a child tax credit made possible by the Congress you led. Thank you, Newt. Good luck. And God bless you in your new endeavors.
Those of you here in this House know me, but Hastert is not exactly a household name across America, so our fellow citizens deserve to know who I am and what I'm going to do. What I am is a former high school teacher, a wrestling and football coach, small businessman and state legislator. For the last 12 years I have been a member of this House. I am indebted to the people of the 14th District of Illinois who continue to send me here to represent them.
I believe in limited Government, but when Government does act, it must be for the good of the people. Serving in this body is a privilege -- it is not a right -- and each of us was sent here to conduct the people's business. And I intend to get down to business. That means formulating, debating and voting on legislation that addresses the problems the American people want solved.
In the turbulent days behind us, debate on the merits often gave way to personal attacks. Some here have felt slighted, insulted or ignored. That is wrong, and that will change.
Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of bitterness. They can be found in an environment in which we trust one another's word; where we generate heat and passion, but where we recognize that each member is equally important to our overall mission of improving the life of the American people. In short, I believe all of us -- regardless of party -- can respect one another, even as we fiercely disagree on particular issues.
Speaking of people who find ways to work together across the political fence, let me bring the analogy to a personal level. Two good Illinois friends of mine, George Ryan, the Republican Governor-elect, and Richard Daley, the Democratic Mayor of Chicago, are in the visitor's gallery, and I'll ask them to stand to be recognized.
Those who know me well will tell you I am true to my word. To me a commitment is a commitment. What you see and hear today is what you will see and hear tomorrow.
No one knows me better than my family. My wife, Jean, and our sons, Josh and Ethan, are here today. They are my reason for being. And Jean, she keeps me -- helps me keep my feet on the ground. She and the boys are my daily reminder that home is on the Fox River, not the Potomac River. To Jean, Josh and Ethan, thank you for everything. I love you.
As a teacher, I explained the story of America year after year. I soon came to realize that it was a story, but a story that keeps changing, for we Americans are a restless people. We like to tackle and solve problems. And we are constantly renewing our nation -- experimenting and creating new ways of doing things. I like to work against a backdrop of American basics: freedom, liberty, responsibility, opportunity. You can count on me to be a workhorse.
My experience as a football and wrestling coach taught me some other lessons that apply here. A good coach knows when to step back and let others shine in the spotlight. President Reagan for years had a plaque in his office that said it all: "There is no limit to what can be accomplished if you don't mind who gets the credit."
A good coach doesn't rely on only a few star players. Everyone on the squad has something to offer. You never get to the finals without a well-rounded team. Above all, a coach worth his salt will instill in his team a sense of fair play, camaraderie, respect for the game and for the opposition. Without those, victory is hollow, and defeat represents opportunities lost. I've found this to be true around here, too.
So, where do we go from here?
Some media pundits say that we'll have two years of stalemate because the Republican majority is too small. Some say that a White House bent on revenge will not give us a moment's peace. And some say the minority in this House will prevent passage of serious legislation so they can later claim this was a do-nothing Congress.
Washington is a town of rumors, guesses and speculation, so none of this comes as a surprise. But none of it needs to come true -- that is, if we really respect the voters who sent us here.
To my Republican colleagues, I say: It is time to put forward the major elements of our legislative program. We will succeed or fail depending upon how sensible a program we offer.
To my Democratic colleagues, I say: I will meet you halfway, maybe more so on occasion, but cooperation is a two-way street, and I expect you to meet me halfway, too. The President and a number of Democrats here in the House have been saying it is time to address several issues head on. I'll buy that, but I think we should agree that stalemate is not an option; solutions are.
To all my colleagues, I say: We must get our job done, and done now. We have an obligation to pass all the appropriation bills by this summer, and we will not leave this chamber until we do.
I intend to be a good listener, but I want to hear ideas and the debate that flows from them. I will have a low tolerance for campaign speeches masquerading as debate, whatever the source.
Our country faces four big challenges which we must address. And next -- not next month, or next year, or the year after that, but now. Each challenge involves an element of our security.
First is retirement and health security. Both our Social Security and Medicare programs will run into brick walls in a few years if we don't do something about them now. We must make sure that Social Security is there for those who depend upon it and those who expect to. We must also consider options for younger workers so they can look forward to an even brighter retirement.
Nearly a year ago, President Clinton came here to give his State of the Union address. He called for reform of Social Security. This year, I invite him to return to give us his reform plan. He has my assurance that it will be taken seriously.
Second, we must insure a secure future for America's children by insisting that every child has a good school in a safe, drug-free environment. In my 16 years as a teacher, I learned that most of the decisions having to do with education are best left to the people closest to the situation: parents, teachers and school board members. What should the Federal Government's role be? It should be to see that as many education dollars as possible go directly to the classrooms, where they will do the most good.
Next is economic security. In the early 80's, we adopted policies that laid the foundation for long-term growth. And except for one brief period, that growth has continued ever since. And we want our economy to keep right on growing. Well, toward that end, it is time for us in Congress to put a microscope to the ways the Government takes money from our fellow citizens and how it spends it.
There is a culture here in Washington that has grown unchallenged for too long. It combines three notions. One is that Government has a prior claim to the earnings of all Americans, as if they worked for the Government and not the other way around. Another notion is that a Government program, once begun, will never end. The third notion is that every program must grow with each passing year. Well, to borrow a musical line, it ain't necessarily so. At least it won't be as long as I'm around here and have anything to say about it. We must measure every dollar we spend by this criterion: Is it really necessary?
This is important. For most Americans, money doesn't come easy. When I was a kid, to make ends meet, my dad had a feed business and he worked nights in a restaurant. My mom raised chickens and sold the eggs. When tax time came around, our family really felt it. What we need is a leaner, more efficient Government, along with tax policies that spur and sustain growth by giving tax relief to all working Americans.
Finally, there is the challenge of America's security in a world of danger and uncertainty. Without it, the other elements of our security won't be possible. And we no longer worry about Soviet nuclear bombs raining down on us. Today, there are different worries: the sudden violence of a terrorist bomb; the silent threat of biological weapons; or the rogue state that aims a deadly missile at one of our cities. We need a defense capability that matches these turn-of-the-century threats. We have asked the men and women of our armed forces to take on assignments in many corners of the earth. Yet, we have not given them the best equipment or preparation they need to match all those assignments. That must be corrected.
These are not Democratic or Republican issues. They are American issues. We should be able to reach agreement quickly on the goals. And yes, we will argue about the means, but if we are in earnest about our responsibilities, we will find common ground and get the job done. In the process, we will build the people's faith in the United States Congress.
As a classroom teacher and coach I learned the value of brevity. I learned that it is work, not talk, that wins championships. In closing, I want you to know I am proud to have been chosen by you to be your Speaker. There is a big job ahead for all of us, so I ask that God bless this House as we move forward together.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
A Robust Start To '99 Dazzles Stock Investors

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Nothing but up. So said stock markets around the world yesterday, wowing investors with one-day gains of better than 2 percent and in some markets, more than 3 percent.
Three days into 1999, the bull market in equities is alive and very well. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen 3.96 percent. The Nasdaq composite index, which gained just under 40 percent last year, is up 5.84 percent. Germany's benchmark DAX index has risen 8.28 percent, and the Bovespa index of Brazil, beaten down in 1998, has leapt 7.97 percent. 
 All the major United States stock gauges -- the Standard & Poor's 500, the Nasdaq composite index and the Dow industrials -- are trading at their highs. The Dow closed yesterday at 9,544.97, up 1.8 percent from its former peak of 9,374.27 on Nov. 23.
Driving this euphoria is investors' conviction that gloomy economic predictions have been overstated. "It's a show-me market," said John L. Manley Jr., senior equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. "Investors are saying, 'We've been waiting for this recession for so long now and it hasn't materialized.' Now they're saying, 'Prove to me we're going into a recession or I'm going to buy stocks.' "
Early January jumps in stocks are not unusual. In 1988, according to Birinyi Associates, the Greenwich, Conn., money managers, stocks rose 3.9 percent in the first day of trading. And in the first two days of 1987, stocks began the year up 3.9 percent.
One reason prices often rise in January is a tendency among investors to change where they put their retirement accounts when they open a new calendar. Though most can make changes in their asset allocation any time, investors often decide to switch investments with the new year.
The most common change is to shift more money into whatever performed best the previous year. It is likely then that investors who are moving money around are doing two things. They are probably increasing their holdings in technology stocks, which dominate the Nasdaq, and have given the biggest boost to that index. And they are likely shifting money from funds that have lagged behind the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- more than 90 percent of actively managed funds underperformed their benchmarks last year -- into those like the Vanguard 500 fund that mirror this index.
Evidence of these kinds of changes can be found in the disparity in the performance of big-company stocks and the small-company stocks in the Russell 2000 index, the "small cap" benchmark. While the Dow Jones and the S.& P. 500 have both blown through their former highs, the Russell 2000 is still 7.7 percent below its peak of last July, and is up less than 1.4 percent so far in 1999.
And although yesterday's advance in big stocks was fairly broad, it did not lift all boats. Roughly for every two stocks that gained, one declined; I.B.M. fell slightly. Mexican shares are down; Japan is barely even.
Several factors contributed to the broad market rally. The Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes rose in November to a record high, indicating the economy is strong and demand for appliances, furniture and other goods to fill these houses will continue to be robust.
Another lift came from oil prices, which rose more than 3 percent after news that inventories in the United States had taken their biggest decline in 18 years. "Higher oil prices, while a pain in the neck for consumers, are a positive for developing countries," said Jack Shaughnessy of Advest Inc. in Boston. "Anything that tends to ease their financial stress is good for world markets."
Indeed, the free fall in commodity prices, a sign of slow or no growth around the world, seems to have halted, leading some to conclude that the worst of global economic turmoil is behind. The Commodity Research Bureau's index, which stood at 187 on Dec. 15, closed yesterday at 197. "The C.R.B. was the last thing hanging out there that indicated a problem in world economic growth," said James Paulsen of Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. But firming commodity prices will also help American corporations, he argued, by allowing them to increase prices and bolster their profit margins. Companies have found it difficult to raise prices in recent years, which has slowed earnings growth.
Because corporate earnings felt the pinch of Asia's woes in the first quarter of 1998, investors suspect that the first quarter of this year will look good in comparison. For those who still care about old-fashioned things like earnings growth, improvements from a year earlier translate into higher stock prices.
As stocks ran away yesterday, some strategists speculated that the overall market had been infected by the fever that has Internet stocks sizzling. The reasoning? When investors are willing to pay 80 times revenue for Amazon.com or 366 times sales for Ebay, why not push Microsoft shares to 64 times estimated earnings?
Stocks and bonds also benefited yesterday by a sharp rise in the dollar against the euro. When traders in European markets went home, a lot of the support for the currency disappeared. When trading shifted to New York, the market dipped. With the dollar rising, the Treasury market bounced as well, and bonds closed at the day's highs. The move in the dollar also buoyed stocks.
But the biggest propellant for stocks so far this year is the explosive growth in the supply of money circulating in the United States -- a factor that has contributed to higher stock prices for months. The money supply is growing at an annualized rate of 11 percent, far above what's needed to finance the growth in the gross domestic product. An enormous amount of the excess money is finding its way into the stock market.
This makes for an interesting situation for the Federal Reserve, said Ned Riley, chief investment officer of BankBoston. "The Fed has resurrected the irrational exuberance it was trying to temper earlier," he said. "The creation of all this money and lower interest rates have tended to fuel more speculation." The next meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee, in February, "is going to draw a lot of attention to this speculative frothy market," he said.
Almost no one thinks the Fed will change its stance on interest rates, which is toward lower rates, not higher. And as long as the Fed isn't going to step in and spoil the party by raising rates, stocks seem likely to go up.
Still, many professional investors were puzzled by yesterday's move in stocks. Frederick E. Rowe Jr., head of Greenbrier Partners, a money management firm in Dallas, echoed the views of many big investors when he said, "I don't pretend to understand it, but I don't want to get in the way of it."
