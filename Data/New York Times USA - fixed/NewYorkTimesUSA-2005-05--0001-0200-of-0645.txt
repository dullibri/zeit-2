HEADLINE: With Dollar Still Weak, U.S. Bookings for Cruises in Europe Rise

BYLINE: By AUSTIN CONSIDINE

 BODY:
As the dollar continues to be weak against the euro, some cruise operators are promoting a vacation on the high seas as one of the best ways for Americans to see Europe this summer. That message seems to be paying off, with the numbers of people booking a European cruise up sharply. 
 ''You're prepaying in U.S. dollars, which gives you greater value,'' said Terry Dale, chief executive of Cruise Lines International Association, which represents 19 of the world's cruise lines. ''Last year, we had 1,900 European sailings, and in 2005 there's going to be over 2,200.'' 
 Even though some of the big cruise liners -- like Cunard's 2,620-passenger Queen Mary 2, which has four European itineraries this summer -- may already be benefiting from this trend, several small European cruise lines are trying to sweeten the deal by offering competitive discounts.
 For instance, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, (800) 477-7500, www.rssc.com, has extended its 20 percent early-booking discount for its seven-night summer Baltic cruises to encompass the entire summer booking season (prices start at $3,996 a person in double occupancy), which runs until late August. Similar discounts are available for their Stockholm-Dover cruises: the 10-night cruise starting June 10 starts at $5,516 and includes free economy-class flights from North America or an additional $1,000 off the cost of the cruise; the 11-night cruise starting Aug. 20 is 30 percent off, starting at $4,966. All itineraries are on the 700-passenger Seven Seas Voyager. 
 A cruise on a river boat in Europe is another alternative to the experience on an ocean liner. France Vacations, (800) 332-5332, www.francevacations.net, has cut its rates by up to 30 percent aboard many of its cruise barges, which range in accommodation space from 3 cabins to 25. A 10-night trip through northern France aboard the 25-cabin Anacoluthe, which includes stops in Paris, Giverny and Bougival, is now $1,290 a person, down from $1,890.
 Looking ahead, Peter Deilmann Cruises, (800) 348-8287, www.deilmann-cruises.com, is offering a 15-night voyage at summer's end, Sept. 22, aboard the 513-passenger Deutschland, above, from Lisbon to France, for $2,826 -- 20 percent off the original price. They are also offering free air fare from 16 departure points on the East Coast, including New York and Miami, and rebates beginning at $100 for passengers flying out of other airports.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 15, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Travel Advisory column on May 1 about promoting vacations at sea as a way to reduce the cost of a European vacation misstated the final destination of a 15-night voyage departing from Lisbon on Sept. 22 and offered by Peter Deilmann Cruises aboard the Deutschland. It is Venice, not France.
 Because of an editing error, the report also misstated the length of a river cruise through northern France aboard the Anacoluthe, offered by France Vacations. It is six nights, not 10.

HEADLINE: '55 and Out' Comes Home To Roost

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
INTEREST rates are ticking up while stock prices are trending down, eroding 401(k) savings. The president says that the Social Security system is in trouble, suggesting that the retirement age must be increased or that benefits must be scaled back for the well-off. 
 General Motors wants to rein in skyrocketing health costs for retirees. Retired coal miners have lost company-paid health insurance in bankruptcy proceedings. Even robust Fortune 500 companies are groaning under the weight of spiraling retirement costs. 
 For many middle-age, middle-class workers, retirement planning has become an exercise in high anxiety -- except perhaps for a group that makes up about 11 percent of the American work force: public employees. Public employment has always connoted a certain dull stability -- the promise of unexciting pay, but a secure pension. That modest idea has expanded over time. With the help of eager-to-please politicians, protective state laws and potent labor unions, many of the nation's state and local employees have only added to their benefits. They receive among the best, most rock-solid pensions and retirement health benefits of any workers in America. Many can retire before 65, with generous cost-of-living adjustments built into their pensions and full medical benefits for life. 
 More and more of them -- the baby boom bulge -- are doing just that, leaving states and localities scrambling to pay the cost, at taxpayer expense. In Oregon, state workers who joined the pension system before 1996 are guaranteed an annual 8 percent return on their pension accounts. In Pembroke Pines, Fla., police officers and firefighters can retire after 20 years with 80 percent of their pay. And in Philadelphia, some city workers, including the mayor, are eligible for early pension payments even when they remain on the city payroll.
 These obligations are playing havoc with state budgets. Four years ago, what one economist called ''a perfect storm'' of plummeting stock prices and weak tax revenues wrecked state budgets, and now scores of government pension funds remain in the red, prompting calls in statehouses for pension overhauls.
 A recent survey by the National Association of State Retirement Administrators found the nation's largest pension systems were collectively facing a $267 billion shortfall. A separate study released last month by Wilshire Associates, a consulting firm, found that the asset shortfall for state pension plans was worse than for corporate plans.
 No one, of course, is expecting governments to declare bankruptcy and dissolve their pension systems, the way many steel companies did in the 1980's and 1990's. But expensive pensions are squeezing budgets at a time when other costs -- education, transportation and particularly health care -- are rising rapidly. 
 In Rhode Island, where state payments into pension funds are projected to increase by 45 percent, or about $90 million, in the 2006 fiscal year, the governor has proposed increasing the retirement age and trimming cost-of-living increases for new workers. West Virginia, Mississippi and other states are considering selling bonds worth billions of dollars to close pension shortfalls. 
 And in California, which must pay $2.6 billion this year into the state plan, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed -- then withdrew after loud protests from public employee unions -- a plan to shift workers from pension plans with guaranteed payments into 401(k)-style plans where workers assume greater investment risk.
 ''We're at a crossroads with public pension systems,'' said Sujit M. CanagaRetna, senior fiscal analyst with the Southern office of the Council of State Governments, which does research for state legislatures. ''It's a cumulative problem amounting to a fiscal tsunami for states.''
 Though government officials can justifiably blame the weak economy for many of their current problems, the downturn also shed light on missteps of the past.
 Just last week, the mayor of San Diego, Dick Murphy, resigned amid a scandal involving the city's deficit-ridden pension system. Federal officials are now investigating whether Mr. Murphy and other officials acted illegally in awarding generous new benefits to retirees while severely underfinancing pension funds. 
 In Missouri, the state legislature this year ended a policy that allowed appointees to quasi-judicial positions to retire with lucrative pensions after only short stints on the job. The policy caused an uproar when news reports revealed that the pension of a former state senator jumped to $47,600 from $28,700 after he served just five months as chairman of a labor commission. ''The vast majority of state employees don't get that kind of benefit,'' said State Representative Todd Smith, a sponsor of legislation that closed the loophole. ''There was a perception of abuse.'' 
 More commonly, cities are struggling to pay for decisions made years or even decades ago, whose compounding costs are coming due as the retirement pool swells. 
 A report issued last week by the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit fiscal research group, shows that New York City's contributions to its pension funds tripled in four years, to $2.3 billion in fiscal year 2004 from $615 million in 2000. The study also projected that the cost of retiree health benefits will rise to $6.3 billion in 2008, up 50 percent from 2004.
 The group calls for requiring city and state employees to pay half their retirement health insurance premiums, increasing the retirement age and moving toward 401(k)-style plans. But this is a mayoral election year, and commission officials are not optimistic about change. 
 State and local governments have historically defended generous retirement packages as crucial to recruiting and retaining good workers, arguing that public sector employees are typically paid less than similarly qualified private sector workers.
 ''Qualified people came to public sector work because of the benefits, and pensions were at the heart of that,'' said Gerald W. McEntee, president of the 1.4 million-strong American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees. ''But whenever we are in hard economic times, they come after workers in general, and public sector workers in particular. And they go after their pension funds.''
 But public pensions have also long been used by elected officials to curry favor with powerful unions. And pension sweeteners could be offered in lieu of wage increases when times were tight, since costs could be deferred. Nowhere has that been clearer than in West Virginia, where the Legislature for years expanded pension benefits for teachers without adequately increasing contributions into the pension system, leaving it with a $5 billion shortfall.
 ''You could say they did it to help retain and recruit teachers,'' said Judith Hale, president of the American Federation of Teachers of West Virginia. ''But they also did it to help them get elected.''
 In many ways, the debate over state pensions mirrors the debate over Social Security. Critics of public systems say a crisis is looming, while defenders contend the current problems are part of a cyclical downturn that will resolve itself as the economy improves.
 Officials with the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, for instance, say that most public pension funds are better managed than in the past, and that the huge shortfalls caused by the market downturn of 2001 have shrunk since the market began strengthening in 2003.
 Oregon reflects both sides of the argument. In 2003, the state trimmed benefits and sold bonds to close a projected $17 billion gap in its pension funds. By 2004, that deficit had shrunk to $6 billion because of improving investment returns, officials with the pension system said.
 But in March, the state's highest court threw out some of those cost-saving measures, prompting critics to contend that the next market downturn will send the state into financial turmoil once again.
 Yet such turmoil is not likely to worry state workers too much. ''We have never been in a year when people felt they wouldn't have a pension,'' said Ms. Hale of the West Virginia teachers' union. ''Because they knew the government was never going out of business.''

HEADLINE: And All the Trains Run on Time

BYLINE: By ALEX MINDLIN

 BODY:
FOR a fan of mass transit, life in a North Dakota monastery can be trying. ''We've got a new bus system here in Bismarck, and that's got eight routes and one bus an hour,'' said Elias Thienpont. ''To me that's not helpful.'' 
 As the resident technology expert at Assumption Abbey, in Richardton, N.D., where he is a monk, Brother Thienpont spends plenty of time on computers, and so in his spare time, he has begun revisiting a hobby from his Long Island boyhood -- drawing fantastic maps of the New York City subway system.
 Using computer graphics programs, Brother Thienpont charts a subway that exists only in his head. ''I work at the thing like a puzzle,'' he said. ''How do tracks cross or connect with each other? Exactly where are the stations to be built?'' One of his recent maps features a new line that links eastern Queens to Midtown, barreling through Queens on concrete risers and crossing the East River through a four-track tunnel.
 Brother Thienpont posts his maps to Web sites like railroad.net, where they can be examined by other fans of the hobby known as fantasy mapping, a kind of computer-aided daydreaming about subway routes. Message boards on these Web sites are thick with comments, countercomments and queries regarding fictional maps. In a typical post on railroad.net last June, one user expressed dismay with another user's map: ''The 8 line on a concrete viaduct over Randalls Island? No! Put it on the (now-abandoned) northernmost track of the Hell Gate Bridge!''
 Many fantasy mappers are ex-New Yorkers who, like Brother Thienpont, are trying to keep a connection to the subway they love. Some are motivated by frustration with existing service, like James Haynes, who added lines to the Bronx after growing up on Webster Avenue, far from any trains. ''I was trying to point out the improvements that could be made,'' he said.
 And all belong to the vast fraternity of subway fans, sometimes called ''foamers'' for the way they supposedly foam at the mouth. Mappers take pride in knowing enough about the subways to create a plausible map: a good mapper thinks about how many trains per hour can pass along a given segment of track, how much it costs to bore tunnels, where the storage yards are and which stations have the highest ridership.
 Then again, sometimes a mapper thinks about all that and chooses to disregard it. A mapper called ''matt1168'' recently posted a map on railroad.net that included a spur line to City Island, tunneled deep underground. ''Stations have 100-foot-high soaring roofs and colored lights,'' he wrote, ''and are elevator-only.'' When other mappers protested, he responded: ''That's why it's called a fantasy map.''
 As for Brother Thienpont, he is grateful to have an outlet for his ideas, because most of his fellow monks aren't particularly interested in transit. ''Occasionally I can pique someone's interest,'' he said, ''but usually they don't want to hear about it again.''


GRAPHIC: Chart: ''The Other M.T.A. (Matt Transportation Authority)''If matt1168 oversaw New Yorks subways, changes would occur citywide. Here is a sampling of his proposed alterations, as he has spelled them out on a real M.T.A. map.1. Really Uptown''The 1 line has been extended from 242nd Street in the Bronx to Radford Street in Yonkers, via a new concrete elevated structure/embankment.''2. The Green Line''The 86th Street S train runs in a deep, deep tunnel below 86th Street and Central Park, and has individual tube stations with narrow platforms and elevators only. It would be hard to build a cut-and-cover tunnel underneath Central Park. The only logical way...would be to bore a hole with a tunnel boring machine, deep under the surface, so as not to distract Central Park itself at ground level.''3. Better Than the Bus''The Roosevelt Island bus is extremely slow and in many ways ineffective. This light rail would be a much faster, not to mention more economically and environmentally effective, way to get people from one end of Roosevelt Island to the other.''4. Harbor View''The R line has been extended over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. I think there is room for a single track in the center of the lower level of the bridge. If not, maybe one lane could be taken away or something. Because of the single track, the service would start out being peak direction only. The only problem is that the trains going to Tottenville would have no place to go until the afternoon peak, and this could bring about a shortage of trains and lack of storage space.5. Finally, the 8 Train''The brand new 8 line runs from Queens Plaza to the Bronx via the N/W and a concrete structure over Randalls Island. It then runs with the 6 to Pelham Bay Park, where it branches off onto a new, deepbore, subway line to City Island.''6. The Long Island Subway''The V line has been extended to New Hyde Park, Long Island, via a subway with utilitarian island platform stations from Merrick Boulevard to Hempstead Avenue, and then on an embankment to New Hyde Park, with utilitarian side platform stations.''7. Dead End''Both the 105 Street station on the L line and the Beach 105th Street station on the A line have been eliminated due to low ridership. Stations such as Beach 105th Street (the least used station in the system) do little for the system but increase cost, when they get an average of just a few riders per day. On the other hand, we could also argue that constantly closing little-used stations would eventually lead to a meltdown of the entire system.''

ON the second floor of the Bay Ridge Funeral Home in Brooklyn, on the desk of the owner, Alex Marchak, there sits a stack of prayer cards bearing words from the Book of John: ''I am the Resurrection and the Life; He who believes in me even if he die, shall live, and whoever lives and believes in me, shall never die.''
 The cards, dated Sept. 8, 2000, look just like the ones Mr. Marchak passes out at funerals almost every day. But these he has held onto, because they celebrate immortality of a different kind. ''In Loving Memory,'' they read, ''of Livia Soprano.'' 
 Ms. Soprano, the high-strung mother of her mob-boss son, Tony, lived and died entirely in a New Jersey of the mind, on the HBO series that bore her fictional family name. Even so, she was one of a string of famous customers for Mr. Marchak, who supplements his work as a funeral director with a healthy sideline in Hollywood magic, helping make television funerals look and feel more like the real thing.
 Mr. Marchak's office is scattered with mementos of past projects. ''They just sent me this from Whoopi Goldberg's show,'' he said with evident pride recently, pointing to a plaque and a thank-you letter. ''I built a casket for them.''
 Mr. Marchak, a gregarious 48-year-old native of Sunset Park, has spent more than enough time around funerals to qualify as an expert. He grew up above his family's funeral home at 19th Street and Fourth Avenue, and he followed his grandparents and his mother into the business.
 His got his start in show business later, at the height of 1970's disco fever. Mr. Marchak, a regular in Bay Ridge's disco scene, befriended a writer who was doing research for a movie about dancing. The movie became ''Saturday Night Fever,'' and Mr. Marchak, who served as an extra, is visible, if only blurrily, in the iconic disco image of a white-suited John Travolta pointing skyward.
 The work stood in sharp contrast to his day job. Mr. Marchak is typically comforting and solicitous with his funeral home clients, but the work takes its toll. ''The funeral business can be depressing,'' he said. ''All you're doing is dealing with people in the worst time of their life, every day.''
 By contrast, the movies became something to look forward to. Mr. Marchak now advertises in trade directories, under ''funeral supplies,'' and he has done work for the soap opera ''Guiding Light,'' the short-lived newspaper drama ''Deadline'' and the 1999 film ''Mickey Blue Eyes.'' He helped build an embalming room for ''Law & Order,'' and he once helped create an entire funeral home set so producers could crash a car through it. 
 He even had a brush with fame. Mr. Marchak was associate producer of a short 1997 film called ''Dearly Beloved,'' which he describes as a comedy about death. The film, set in a funeral home and with a cast that included Eric Stoltz, did well on the festival circuit but soon faded away. Years later, the similarly themed HBO series ''Six Feet Under'' became a hit and raised the public profile of funeral directors, while Mr. Marchak looked on from the sideline with a degree of envy.
 ''The project that I was involved with definitely would have been a better project than 'Six Feet Under,''' he said. ''It would have been great.''
 He still hopes for a big break. Until then, he has found his niche. He turns up on ''The Sopranos'' as an extra in scenes set in the Bada Bing nightclub; funeral-related props like coffins and urns are shipped off and returned; and every now and then the funeral home, which is also known as Trzaska Funeral Home, on Fourth Avenue near 76th Street, finds its way into an episode, in an exterior shot, or a brief scene showing people carrying a coffin, or a moment inside the chapel.
 And the funeral business itself is, happily for Mr. Marchak, recession-proof. Funerals these days are more personalized, he is finding, more of a celebration of life than they used to be. And Mr. Marchak is an attentive producer.
 Walking downstairs into his showroom, he paused by a display coffin and lifted a fringe of fabric hanging out the front. ''Every time I see funerals on TV, this part is always tucked in,'' he said, fussing with the material. ''You want to jump on the screen and tell them it should be out.''
 In the chapel, boxes of tissues stood at attention next to rows of empty padded chairs. At the front of the room there sat a kneeler and a pedestal for a coffin, momentarily unused. 
 ''They used this for 'Law & Order' up here,'' he said, walking briskly through the room. ''They like the old look. It's like a house.''

HEADLINE: The Greediest Generation

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
As a baby boomer myself, I can be blunt: We boomers won't be remembered as the ''Greatest Generation.'' Rather, we'll be scorned as the ''Greediest Generation.''
 Our influence has been huge. When boomer blood raged with hormones, we staged the sexual revolution and popularized the Pill. Now, with those hormones fading, we've popularized Viagra. 
 As we've aged, age discrimination has become a basis for lawsuits, and the most litigated right has become the right to die. The hot issue of the moment is Social Security, and the newest entitlement program is a prescription drug benefit for the elderly.
 Our slogan has gone from ''free love'' to ''free blood pressure medicine.''
 But I fear that we'll be remembered mostly for grabbing resources for ourselves, in such a way that the big losers will be America's children.
 Traditionally in America, the people most likely to be poor were the elderly. As recently as 1966, for example, 29 percent of Americans over 65 were below the poverty line, compared with only 18 percent of American children.
 But that same year, Medicare took effect to provide medical care for the elderly, and Social Security adjustments steadily reduced poverty among them. We were suitably embarrassed that old people were eating cat food or scavenging garbage cans for food, so we reallocated resources to the elderly.
 As of 2003, the share of elderly below the poverty line had fallen by two-thirds to 10 percent -- representing a huge national success. Retirement in America is no longer feared as a time of destitution, but anticipated as a time of comfort and leisure.
 On the other hand, the proportion of children below the poverty line is still 18 percent, the same as it was in 1966. And while almost all the elderly now have health insurance under Medicare, about 29 percent of children had no health insurance at all at some point in the last 12 months. 
 One measure of how children have tumbled as a priority in America is that in 1960 we ranked 12th in infant mortality among nations in the world, while now 40 nations have infant mortality rates better than ours or equal to it. We've also lost ground in child vaccinations: the United States now ranks 84th in the world for measles immunizations and 89th for polio.
 With boomers about to retire, I'm afraid that national priorities will be focused even more powerfully on the elderly rather than the young -- because it's the elderly who wield political clout.
 ''The elderly are retired, and it's easier to get them to go to rallies or write their congresspeople,'' notes Heather Boushey of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. ''Children can't vote, don't give money and have no power, and neither do their parents.''
 We boomers are also preying on children in a more insidious way: We're running up their debts, both by creating new entitlement programs and by running budget deficits today. Laurence Kotlikoff, an economist and fiscal expert who with Scott Burns wrote the excellent and scary book ''The Coming Generational Storm,'' calls this ''fiscal child abuse.''
 The book says that the Treasury Department commissioned a study by two economists of the United States' long-term liabilities, for inclusion in the 2004 federal budget. The study found that the government faces a present value ''fiscal gap'' -- the excess of expected payments over expected revenues -- of $51 trillion. That's 11 times our official national debt and also greater than our total net worth, meaning that in some sense we're bankrupt.
 Not surprisingly, the Bush administration took a look at the study, blanched, and declined to publish it.
 In coming years, we'll hear appeals for better nursing homes, for more Alzheimer's research and for more wheelchair-accessible office buildings, and those are good causes. But remember that American children are almost twice as likely as the elderly to live in poverty, and that you get much more bang for the buck vaccinating a child than paying for open-heart surgery. 
 The solution is not to force the elderly to get by on cat food again. But we boomers need to resist the narcissistic impulse to ladle out more resources for ourselves. Our top domestic priorities should be to ensure that all children get health care and to get our fiscal house in order.
 Otherwise, we boomers may earn a place in history as the worst generation.

HEADLINE: A Roll Call Around the World In Mansfield School District

BYLINE: By GAIL BRACCIDIFERRO

 BODY:
SHAMIM PATWA remembers sometimes feeling isolated growing up in a northern New Jersey town where hers was the only family from India. Ms. Patwa said she didn't want her children to relive those experiences in the rural town of Mansfield.
 ''It was a shock to come here at first,'' said Ms. Patwa, who was born in India and came to Mansfield, in eastern Connecticut, about a decade ago as a University of Connecticut doctoral degree student. ''People talked about septic tanks, field mice and well water. I worried about this being a small town.'' 
 What she discovered, however, was a town that not only is ethnically, racially, economically and religiously diverse, but one whose public school system is determined to build on this advantage. It does this through a foreign language program that extends to its youngest students, multicultural celebrations, cultural exchanges and trips for both students and teachers, assistantships aimed at bringing minority teachers to the district and a keen sensitivity to racial, ethnic and religious differences.
 ''Three of the 13 kids in my daughter's third-grade classroom are Muslim,'' said Ms. Patwa, who has served on the town's school board for six years. ''When my daughter mentions names, they are from all over the world.''
 District statistics for the 2003-4 school year show that nearly 10 percent of Mansfield's students have a non-English home language and about 17 percent are members of a minority group. In the 37 other school districts that the state Department of Education identified as having demographics similar to Mansfield's, an average of only 1.5 percent of the students have non-English home languages, the statistics show.
 Mansfield Middle School's principal, Jeffrey L. Cryan, said the minority population in town is also on the upswing.
 ''We did a five-year comparison and there was a 5 percent growth in the minority population,'' he said.
 Gordon Schimmel, Manfield's school superintendent, said there were usually 15 to 25 different home languages spoken among the students in kindergarten through grade 8.
 ''We have an international community as a result of being a university town,'' said Mr. Schimmel, who has been the superintendent for 18 years. ''That is one of the things that attracted me here. I had been a Peace Corps volunteer.'' Mansfield includes the community of Storrs, home to the main campus of the University of Connecticut, and is also close to Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic.
 While Mansfield may be a rural island of diversity in a region where most school districts are overwhelmingly populated by white middle-class Christian students, the town's school administrators and the Board of Education have also decided they needed to go beyond the simple fact of accepting that diversity exists.
 ''They've done a lot of good things,'' said William A. Howe, consultant for multicultural education for the state's Department of Education. ''They actively see it as a strength. We've been working to promote exactly the kind of work that's going on in Mansfield.'' 
 A visit to one of the town's schools is a United Nations experience. The ethnic and racial diversity is evident among the students themselves. Also, many signs are posted in English and another language, bulletin boards promote coming international celebrations, information is posted for parents about multicultural programs in the region, and classrooms bloom with decorations from cultures ranging from Mexican to Native American and French Canadian. 
 A commitment to teaching foreign languages is one way the district works to demonstrate that Mansfield is part of a global community. Mansfield is one of only five Connecticut towns with similar demographics that teach foreign languages in the primary grades, according to Department of Education statistics. Statewide, 28 town or regional school districts teach foreign languages to primary-grade students.
 In Mansfield, all children in grades two through five learn Spanish, Mr. Schimmel said. Sixth graders have an opportunity to sample four foreign languages: Spanish, French, German and Latin.
 Students in grades seven and eight choose to concentrate in one of these four languages.
 Kathy Siddons, whose high-spirited Spanish lessons combine traditional foreign-language vocabulary such as weather terms, numbers, colors and shapes with plenty of student participation, singing and movement, teaches students in grades two through five at the Dorothy C. Goodwin Elementary School, just west of the UConn campus. She said she was hired 10 years ago as the town's first elementary school foreign-language teacher. 
 There is now a Spanish teacher at each of the town's three elementary schools and four foreign-language teachers at the town's middle school.
 ''There was a ground swell of support from parents and the Board of Education,'' said Gayle Hightower, who teaches a middle-school Latin class. ''They really wanted this.''
 Twelve Connecticut school districts offer Latin to middle-school students. 
 ''I have kids waiting in line for this,'' Ms. Hightower said of her Latin classes. ''Part of that is that it has become a tradition here.''
 Beyond the study foreign languages and cultures, the school system encourages international trips and exchanges. For 12 years the middle school has had a sister school in Germany, and students from each school have visited the other on several occasions, said Mr. Cryan, the middle school principal. Mansfield students also frequently write to international pen pals and both teachers and students also travel to places such as Quebec, Chile, Ukraine and China on school trips. 
 ''This expands our children's sense of the world,'' said Mr. Cryan, who spent time earlier this winter at a middle school in China. ''When I was a kid, I never thought I would go to China or have a professional relationship there, but I found we have so much in common.''
 The school district also has recognized the importance of recruiting minority faculty members and for about six years has supported assistantships for two minority students from UConn who are studying to be teachers, Mr. Schimmel said. The UConn students work for 30 hours a week with a regular teacher on a project in the Mansfield schools, he said.
 ''We've put up $13,000 a year for this, and UConn matches that amount,'' Mr. Schimmel said. ''I don't know any other school district that has used local funds for such a thing.''
 Ms. Patwa said board members, administrators, teachers and students all are open to new multicultural ideas, she said.
 ''I do remember racist remarks as a child, but I can't imagine that happening here,'' she said. ''Here there is a spirit of there being a larger world. It is very natural.''

HEADLINE: Confidence Is Beginning To Wear Thin

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
GUESS what? That R word is sneaking into conversations again.
 Some economists and market analysts are daring to utter ''recession,'' although they are not predicting one -- yet. It is a sign of how quickly confidence in the economy has eroded. Just a month ago, the outlook for growth was still quite robust. 
 ''Is it time to dust off the R word?'' asked Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors, as the stock market tumbled last Thursday. ''My answer is no. But it's not too early to worry.''
 With Federal Reserve policy makers scheduled to meet on Tuesday and the report on April employment due on Friday, this could be a pivotal week for the R word, even if it is still being tossed about as black humor, not stark reality.
 Fed policy makers are expected to raise their benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter-point, to 3 percent. It would be the eighth quarter-point increase since the end of last June.
 Investors will be more interested, however, in what policy makers say in their statement about recent signs that the economy is slowing. If growth is slowing, investors will also want to know if they can worry less about inflation.
 On employment, Wall Street analysts are predicting that 173,000 jobs were created in April, according to Bloomberg News. That is up from the unexpectedly weak gain of 110,000 in March. Economists pointed to the March figure as one of the first signs of slower growth. 
 While economists say that there is no recession on the horizon, some growth forecasts fell sharply last week. Goldman Sachs reduced its forecast for second-quarter growth to 3 percent from 4 percent after a report on the first-quarter gross domestic product pointed to a slowdown ahead. Morgan Stanley trimmed its already weaker forecast for this quarter to less than 3 percent from 3.2 percent.

OTHER DATA -- On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing index. Analysts forecast that it slipped to 55 in April from 55.2 in March. (A reading of more than 50 means that the manufacturing sector is still growing.)
 A much bigger decline than that, combined with a weaker-than-expected jobs report, would be a nightmare for stocks.
 But it would be a help for the bond market, where bad news is often good. Such a combustible mixture could send the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note back down to near 4 percent, an unlikely prospect just six weeks ago, when it was 4.64 percent.

HEADLINE: The War We Could Have Won

BYLINE: By Stephen J. Morris. 
Stephen J. Morris, a fellow at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, is writing a book on the Vietnam War in the Nixon years.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE Vietnam War is universally regarded as a disaster for what it did to the American and Vietnamese people. However, 30 years after the war's end, the reasons for its outcome remain a matter of dispute. 
 The most popular explanation among historians and journalists is that the defeat was a result of American policy makers' cold-war-driven misunderstanding of North Vietnam's leaders as dangerous Communists. In truth, they argue, we were fighting a nationalist movement with great popular support. In this view, ''our side,'' South Vietnam, was a creation of foreigners and led by a corrupt urban elite with no popular roots. Hence it could never prevail, not even with a half-million American troops, making the war ''unwinnable.'' 
 This simple explanation is repudiated by powerful historical evidence, both old and new. Its proponents mistakenly base their conclusions on the situation in Vietnam during the 1950's and early 1960's and ignore the changing course of the war (notably, the increasing success of President Richard Nixon's Vietnamization strategy) and the evolution of South Vietnamese society (in particular the introduction of agrarian reforms).
 For all the claims of popular support for the Vietcong insurgency, far more South Vietnamese peasants fought on the side of Saigon than on the side of Hanoi. The Vietcong were basically defeated by the beginning of 1972, which is why the North Vietnamese launched a huge conventional offensive at the end of March that year. During the Easter Offensive of 1972 -- at the time the biggest campaign of the war -- the South Vietnamese Army was able to hold onto every one of the 44 provincial capitals except Quang Tri, which it regained a few months later. The South Vietnamese relied on American air support during that offensive.
 If the United States had provided that level of support in 1975, when South Vietnam collapsed in the face of another North Vietnamese offensive, the outcome might have been at least the same as in 1972. But intense lobbying of Congress by the antiwar movement, especially in the context of the Watergate scandal, helped to drive cutbacks of American aid in 1974. Combined with the impact of the world oil crisis and inflation of 1973-74, the results were devastating for the south. As the triumphant North Vietnamese commander, Gen. Van Tien Dung, wrote later, President Nguyen Van Thieu of South Vietnam was forced to fight ''a poor man's war.''
 Even Hanoi's main patron, the Soviet Union, was convinced that a North Vietnamese military victory was highly unlikely. Evidence from Soviet Communist Party archives suggests that, until 1974, Soviet military intelligence analysts and diplomats never believed that the North Vietnamese would be victorious on the battlefield. Only political and diplomatic efforts could succeed. Moscow thought that the South Vietnamese government was strong enough to defend itself with a continuation of American logistical support. The former Soviet charge d'affaires in Hanoi during the 1970's told me in Moscow in late 1993 that if one looked at the balance of forces, one could not predict that the South would be defeated. Until 1975, Moscow was not only impressed by American military power and political will, it also clearly had no desire to go to war with the United States over Vietnam. But after 1975, Soviet fear of the United States dissipated.
 During the war the Soviets despised their North Vietnamese ''friends'' (the term of confidential bureaucratic reference, rather than ''comrades''). Indeed, Henry A. Kissinger's accounts of his dealings, as Nixon's national security adviser, with President Thieu are models of respect when compared with the bitter Soviet accounts of their difficulties with their counterparts. 
 In secret internal reports, Hanoi-based Soviet diplomats regularly complained about the deceitfulness of the North Vietnamese, who concealed strategic planning from their more powerful patron. In a 1972 report to Moscow, the Soviet ambassador even complained that although Marshal Pavel Batitsky, commander of the Soviet Air Defense Forces, had visited Hanoi earlier that year and completed a major military aid agreement, North Vietnamese leaders did not inform him of the imminent launch date of their Easter Offensive.
 What is also clear from Soviet archival sources is that those who believed that North Vietnam had more than national unification on its mind were right: Its leaders were imbued with a sense of their ideological mission -- not only to unify Vietnam under Communist Party rule, but also to support the victory of Communists in other nations. They saw themselves as the outpost of world revolution in Southeast Asia and desired to help Communists in Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and elsewhere. 
 Soviet archives show that after the war ended in 1975, with American power in retreat, Hanoi used part of its captured American arsenal to support Communist revolutions around the world. In 1980 some of these weapons were shipped via Cuba to El Salvador. This dimension of Vietnamese behavior derived from a deep commitment to the messianic internationalism of Marxist-Leninist ideology. 
 Vietnam today is not the North Vietnam of 1955, 1965 or 1975. Like post-Mao China it has retreated from totalitarianism to authoritarianism. It has reformed its economy and its foreign policy to become more integrated into the world. But those changes were not inevitable and would not necessarily have occurred had Mikhail Gorbachev not ascended to power in Moscow, and had the Soviet Union and its empire not collapsed. Nor would these changes necessarily have occurred had China not provided a new cultural model for Vietnam to follow, as it has for centuries. 
 Precisely because Vietnam has changed for the better, we need to recognize what a profoundly ideological and aggressive totalitarian regime we faced three, four and five decades ago. And out of respect for the evidence of history, we need to recognize what happened in the 1970's and why.
 In 1974-75, the United States snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Hundreds of thousands of our Vietnamese allies were incarcerated, and more than a million driven into exile. The awesome image of the United States was diminished, and its enemies were thereby emboldened, drawing the United States into new conflicts by proxy in Afghanistan, Africa and Latin America. And the bitterness of so many American war veterans, who saw their sacrifices so casually demeaned and unnecessarily squandered, haunts American society and political life to this day.

HEADLINE: Americans Are Flocking to Canada's Pristine Gulf Islands

BYLINE: By CAITLIN KELLY

DATELINE: Salt Spring Island, British Columbia 

 BODY:
JUST 35 minutes after leaving Vancouver, the small white ferry glides into Fulford Harbor, one of two entrances to the island. The largest of Canada's southern Gulf Islands, Salt Spring offers 70 square miles of lush green fields and steep, pine-forested hillsides, and only three towns: Ganges, Vesuvius and Fulford Harbor. 
 The few roads are narrow and winding, and local hitchhikers, including children, often rely on their neighbors for transport, because there is no bus service. Canadians have long revered Salt Spring as a pristine refuge for the eccentric and creative. 
 It was founded in 1859 by African-Americans and Portuguese who carved out homesteads in the fertile valleys. Tiny St. Paul's Catholic Church was built largely with labor from the Hawaiian community that was established in the late 1880's. In the 1970's, Americans avoiding service in the Vietnam War arrived and put down roots. And for many years, Americans in search of affordable second homes, and looking forward to retirement, have also chosen this island -- a rarity with year-round ferry and seaplane service, a hospital and more urban amenities than neighboring islands.
 But times are changing, and changing fast. Fueled by the still-strong American dollar (around $1.20 to the Canadian dollar) quick leaps in real estate prices and new housing development, tensions are growing between longtime islanders desperate to preserve their quiet way of life, and real estate agents, developers and investors who know a good thing when they see it.
 The island's population has tripled in 30 years, and growth presents many challenges, from increased water pollution of its eight lakes and a falling water table that leaves some wells dry by summer's end to a school week that has shrunk to four days because of a budget crunch.
 For years, Salt Spring was an affordable haven. But now a cottage with water views is 700,000 Canadian dollars, (about $560,000) more than double its 320,000 Canadian dollars price of five years ago. That rate of increase is typical for properties on or near the water, brokers say. 
 Two forces have accelerated the surge in prices: there are few properties to buy and two layers of government place restrictions on development. 
 Many of the new buyers are Americans. ''There's been a huge increase in the past three years in the number of Americans coming here, which we predicted on Sept. 12, 2001,'' says Dick Stubbs, the provincial government's local building inspector.
 John Sorensen, a developer whose town houses in the town of Ganges sell for 260,000 Canadian dollars to 420,000 Canadian dollars (or around $208,700 to $337,100) says half of his buyers are from the United States. 
 Li Read, a broker in business since 1989 on the island, says that 60 to 70 percent of her clients are now American. ''I think, after 9/11, people began to revise their life scripts,'' she said. ''We've always had U.S. buyers, and people who prefer to invest in real estate, and people who want to get away from it all, but now there's a lot of things coming into play.''
 In addition to coming from the United States, buyers are coming from the prosperous economies of Ontario and Alberta within Canada, and from the United Kingdom.
 Surging real estate values are also shutting out the very people who have built the island, often literally. ''Every morning on the ferry arriving from Vancouver Island, you'll see at least 40 guys coming to do construction; they live off the island but work here,'' said Myles Wilson, a broker who has lived on the island for 30 years. For blue-collar workers, this island paradise has become a place for the wealthy, not a place to raise their own children. 
 ''Salt Spring is getting out of reach for the first-time buyer,'' Mr. Wilson said.
 Houses on Vancouver Island, an easy commute, cost 129,000 Canadian dollars.
 Peter Levitt, 59, a poet who had been living in California, moved to Salt Spring in 2000 with his wife, Shirley Graham, a psychologist, and their 8-year-old son, Tai. That year, the Canadian currency was even weaker in relation to the American dollar than it is now. They bought a 2,800-square foot home with a separate 400-square foot studio and an 850-square-foot barn for 400,000 Canadian dollars, then about $259,000. ''We could not move here now,'' Mr. Levitt said. He had heard about Salt Spring from a friend, and after visiting for several years, moved here, a change made easier by his wife's dual American-Canadian citizenship. 
 While Americans can easily buy property here, they must maintain residence in the United States, and can stay in Canada each year for a total of only six months minus a day. Those wishing to become full-time residents must apply for landed immigrant status, which can take up to three years. 
 Since settling in Salt Spring, Mr. Levitt said, he has been disheartened by some of the changes. Development-related pollution has so contaminated his local water source, a lake facing his house, that his family must now drink bottled water. ''I attended a water meeting the other day,'' he said. ''There were four of us in the room, and between us we sit on 15 committees, all trying to fight for the environment here. It's gotten completely out of hand.'' 
 Caught between the competing demands of real estate professionals and part-time residents and frustrated, less-affluent locals is the Islands Trust, a federation of local governments created in 1974 with the explicit mandate to ''preserve and protect'' the more than 400 Gulf Islands. 
 Depending on whom you ask, the trust is either moving too quickly, allowing overdevelopment and associated environmental degradation and density -- or too slowly, failing to address the pressing, growing demands for affordable housing and increased services for an aging population.All development must be approved by the Islands Trust and the Capital Regional District, a branch of municipal government of the city of Victoria, on Vancouver Island. Salt Spring, which is unincorporated, has no mayor or city council. It elects two representatives to the Islands Trust and one to the Capital Regional District to speak for its interests.
 One big development is Channel Ridge, a 1,400-acre project that will contain as many as 305 houses by 2010. 
 Some residents view with alarm the increasing density and demand for services. ''Water is finite,'' Mr. Levitt said. ''On an island there is only so much space, only so much water. With added density also comes traffic, air pollution and parking issues. Can this community sustain itself?''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the National Perspectives article last Sunday, about development on Salt Spring Island, in British Columbia, misstated the time it takes to travel to the island from Vancouver. The ferry takes two to three hours, depending on the route, not 35 minutes. It takes about 35 minutes to travel from Swartz Bay on Vancouver Island to Fulford Harbor on Salt Spring Island.

HEADLINE: It's Not Just About the Baseball

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

DATELINE: LAKEWOOD 

 BODY:
A NEW blue Hawaiian-print shirt hangs on a bat in a corner of Geoff Brown's office. He is the general manager of the Lakewood BlueClaws, the most popular minor league baseball team in New Jersey, and the shirt represents a kind of pledge.
 Although the BlueClaws have drawn almost 2 million fans in their first four seasons, Mr. Brown wants to keep the look fresh, make his employees stand out in a crowd and remind fans that they are only 10 miles from the Shore.
 The crowds at FirstEnergy Park in Lakewood, where the BlueClaws opened their fifth season on April 7, are as large as ever. While teams in Newark and Atlantic City have struggled to lure fans to their games, the BlueClaws have been the state's top-drawing team among its eight minor league teams in each of their four full seasons. 
 Last season, for instance, the BlueClaws drew 440,521 fans -- nearly 40,000 more than the Trenton Thunder, who are a rung higher on the minor league ladder, and more than twice as many as the independent Newark Bears, whose new ballpark sits in the middle of the largest city in the state.
 Even when attendance dipped at BlueClaws games by 1.2 percent in 2004 from the previous season -- they were still playing to 99.8 percent of capacity -- it dropped by 9.4 percent at Newark Bears games and by 20.3 percent at Atlantic City Surf games.
 ''There are a lot of new ballparks in the minor leagues, but there are a lot of teams that don't fill a new ballpark like they do,'' said Kurt Landes, general manager for the Hagerstown Suns, an affiliate of the Mets and one of the BlueClaws' South Atlantic League opponents. ''A lot of people who get new ballparks rest on their laurels.''
 If a fan has a question or a complaint, Mr. Brown wants to hear it. So every BlueClaws' employee wears a new blue Hawaiian-print shirt to the new ballpark, which opened in spring 2001 and is distinguished by a crisp brick facade and imposing entrance.
 Good will and marketing gimmicks aside, the BlueClaws' popularity is a bit mystifying since they have had just one winning season, and quickly dropped below .500 so far this season. 
 ''The level of play on the field doesn't determine what we do,'' Mr. Brown said during a recent interview in his office.
 What the BlueClaws can do is weigh down their 70-game home schedule with promotions, and they have done so with a flair that would shame a boardwalk pitchman. For instance, the 34-year-old Mr. Brown is currently excited about the giveaway of a 10 percent share of a locally bred racehorse at Thursday's game, another franchise first.
 So while the team has come up short in bringing home a championship, its persistence in providing something new and alluring for fans has helped the BlueClaws win the South Atlantic League Club Merit Award three times. And in 2002 the team won the Larry McPhail Award, given to the minor league team with the best promotional effort.
 Still, the BlueClaws' full-time staff of 25 knows it has no time to rest on its accomplishments. Besides offering a different promotion every night, the team offers a cavorting yellow fuzzy mascot named Buster, a picnic area and a food court, lucky-number drawings, seat upgrades, food giveaways and a race among fans wearing gigantic eyeballs. And the team not only has a flashy Web site (www.blueclaws.com), but a theme song, ''BlueClaws Rock.''
 Along with the task of selling more tickets, which range in price from $6 to $9, and giving families their money's worth comes the responsibility of tightening the BlueClaws' ties with the community.

Lakewood's Ups and Downs
 Lakewood --in northern Ocean County with a diverse population of 60,000 -- was struggling economically until the state made the township an urban enterprise zone in 1994. Indeed, even Lakewood's biggest boosters say time had passed the town by.
 ''For a lot of years, a lot of companies would try to hide the fact that they were in Lakewood," said State Senator Robert W. Singer, whose district includes Lakewood.
 These days, the BlueClaws have so many sponsors that they had to build two new billboards -- beyond the outfield fence but visible from the stands -- to accommodate all the advertising. And Senator Singer insists that Exit 89 of the Garden State Parkway might not have been built if the BlueClaws had not been so successful.
 For their part, the BlueClaws want to be regarded as just as important a part of summertime entertainment at the Jersey Shore as the Six Flags Great Adventure theme park or the beaches, where airplanes drone overhead with banners promoting BlueClaws games.
 ''It takes a couple of years to get on the map for tourists,'' Mr. Brown said.
 It takes easily as long to sort out the various levels of minor league ball being played around the state. Of the eight minor league teams in New Jersey, the BlueClaws are one of only three affiliated with a major league club -- the BlueClaws with the Phillies, the Trenton Thunder with the Yankees and the New Jersey Cardinals with St. Louis.
 There are six steps to the major leagues: rookie, short-season Class A, low Class A, advanced Class A, Class AA and Class AAA. The Blue Claws are a low Class A team, the third step; the Cardinals, of the New York-Penn League, are a short-season Class A team; and the Thunder, of the Eastern League, are a Class AA team.
 The other five teams in the state are independents, made up of former major league players or prospects who hope to latch on to a big-league team or affiliate. The Newark Bears, Somerset Patriots, Atlantic City Surf and Camden Riversharks are members of the Atlantic League; the New Jersey Jackals are in the Can-Am League.
 In each of their four seasons, the BlueClaws have drawn at least 440,000 fans despite the fact that they and a team in Lake County, Ohio, are the only franchises in the South Atlantic League north of the Mason-Dixon Line. 
 ''I don't think the distance is as much of a factor as it was years ago,'' John H. Moss, president of the South Atlantic League, said in a telephone interview from his office in Kings Mountain, N.C. ''You just don't have the rivalries you did years ago. I've been around a few seasons, and we had to go to where the markets and the facilities were.''
 Yet just because New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the country, that does not guarantee a packed house at a minor league ballgame. The BlueClaws, the Thunder (whose average attendance last season was 6,095) and the Patriots ( average attendance, 5,376) were the only teams in the state to average 5,000 fans at each game last season.

Bears Are Struggling
 In fact, the beleaguered Newark Bears averaged only 2,746 fans at home games last season, down from 3,032 in 2003. And the attendance at home games for the two other Atlantic League teams also dropped: the Surf attracted an average of 2,054 fans last season, down from 2,576, and the Riversharks drew an average 4,309 down from 4,547.
 The Patriots gained 215 fans a game last year. But the New Jersey Cardinals, in Augusta, and the New Jersey Jackals, in Little Ferry, each drew an average of fewer than 3,000 fans, though they do play a shorter schedule.
 John Clark, the assistant general manager for the BlueClaws, said unpredictable weather last season caused the slight dip in attendance. As Tony Torre, the New Jersey Cardinals general manager, said, there is no way around a poor forecast ''unless you have a dome.''
 Of course, on a beautiful summer night with children to care for and a few dollars to spend, it's not just about the baseball. 
 FirstEnergy Park -- a smart-looking stadium with seating for 6,588 fans and wide, grassy banks just beyond the outfield fence that can accommodate another 6,500 -- has had several face lifts in its five years. 
 The park was built to be a gathering place, and has slowly become one. For instance, a room on the second floor is rented out for business meetings. In July, when the BlueClaws are on the road, a three-on-three basketball tournament is scheduled. And on Fridays in spring and summer, a flea market is held outside the park.
 ''It boosts civic pride quite tremendously,'' said Sheldon Wolpin, chairman of the Lakewood Heritage Commission.
 At the turn of the 20th century, before the days of airplanes, Lakewood was a bustling winter resort with more than 100 hotels and thriving shops. The town was a playground for the rich and famous who took horse-drawn carriages or the train from New York. John D. Rockefeller had an estate in Lakewood that later became Ocean County Park.
 Then, in 1944, a prominent rabbi named Aron Kotler moved to Lakewood from Eastern Europe, and a large Orthodox Jewish community evolved that still numbers about 20,000. But after World War II, travel became immeasurably easier, and hotels and businesses began to close as vacationers opted for more exotic destinations.
 ''The attraction of Lakewood as a winter resort kind of went downhill,'' Mr. Wolpin said.
 In the late 1990's, downtown Lakewood went through a revitalization, and tenants began to fill a 2,200-acre industrial park near the parkway. The next step was to create a focal point in a town in which baseball had been stitched into the fabric of life.

A Township 'Into Sports'
 "Everybody around here seems to be into sports, especially into baseball," said Craig DiBella, the general manager at Pine Belt Chevrolet, a BlueClaws sponsor.
 In 1896 and 1897 and again in 1943-45, the New York Giants -- who would later move to San Francisco -- held spring training here. And as recently as 1975 and 1998, teams from Lakewood and nearby Toms River won the Little League World Series.
 Although a wave of minor league expansion swept past Monmouth and Ocean counties in the late 1990's, the township was convinced -- with nearly 1.5 million people living within a 35-minute drive -- that it could support a team. 
 ''The old expression, 'Build it, and they will come,' may have worked in the movies with a cornfield, but when it comes right down to it, you still need a market,'' said Russell Corby, the executive director of the Lakewood Development Corporation.
 The township had a spot for its ballpark -- a 250-acre plot of pineland adjacent to the industrial park. Civic leaders hoped that a ballpark could become the centerpiece of a sprawling office complex.
 ''I would say, prior to 1999, you probably didn't hear too many people say, 'I'm going to Lakewood tonight,' for any reason,'' Mr. Corby said.
 The township approved a bond sale that over 10 years would raise the $20 million needed to build the ballpark. In the meantime, the town had begun to look for a team. 
 Senator Singer said that Lakewood wanted to have a farm club rather than an independent team like the ones in Atlantic City, Camden, Newark and Somerset. That way, he said, the risk would be substantially lower.
 The parent clubs are responsible for paying the salaries of the managers, coaches and players they send to their farm clubs. The affiliates, in turn, receive good young prospects. The BlueClaws, for instance, have only one player born before 1980.
 ''People definitely want to see these guys when they're pups,'' said Mr. Brown, who worked for the Thunder, the Yankees' Class AA affiliate, when Nomar Garciaparra played for the team in 1994.
 As a major-league farm club, said John Clark, the assistant general manager for the BlueClaws, there is a little bit more legitimacy: ''The guys playing for us were drafted by the Phillies, and the guys playing for the other teams we play were also drafted by big league clubs.''
 Had Lakewood only been able to attract an independent team, Senator Singer said flatly that the ballpark would not have been built. But that failed to become an issue, he said, because the project began almost immediately to attract the attention of minor league clubs.
 The ownership of the Thunder in Trenton, 40 miles west of Lakewood, took an interest. And the Phillies, who owned a struggling team in Piedmont, N.C., wanted to move it to New Jersey, where it would be guided by the Thunder ownership.

Management Team Is Born
 Next, Mr. Brown, who was working in the front office of the Yankees' former Class AA farm club in Norwich, Conn., was hired in November 1999. Then Mr. Clark, who worked with him in Norwich, joined him in Lakewood.
 They set up an office near the Lakewood airport, where they had one telephone and 40 feet of cord. As Mr. Brown remembered with a smile, ''Whoever ended up with the phone on their desk had to be the secretary.''
 Today the BlueClaws have a spacious office in the ballpark, and the two men have offices with windows that look out on the diamond.
 And last month, the developers of the business park announced that they had signed their first tenant not too far from that very diamond.
 ''This becomes an exciting place you want to be near,'' Senator Singer boasted.
 But the public is fickle, and the BlueClaws know they have to keep hawking their product. Besides the racehorse giveaway, the team is inviting fans to bring their dogs -- who can roam in the grass outside the outfield fence -- to next Saturday's game against the Hickory Crawdads.
 Before the home opener on April 7, the team saluted 20 area residents who had served in the military in Iraq. For Mr. Brown, the ceremony was more touching than he could have imagined.
 ''Everyone was so hyped up, we gave up five runs in the first inning,'' he said with a smile.
 The BlueClaws went on to lose, 10-2. But 6,804 fans came out, and the legion of employees in new blue Hawaiian-print shirts reported that everyone had a good time -- according to plan.

HEADLINE: Bid Leaders Share Fraternal Bond, and a Furious Pace

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
Sebastian Coe has endured trying moments in the job of leading London's bid for the 2012 Olympics, with its public relations tempests and punishing travel schedule, but none quite so trying as the day of his mother's funeral. As hard as it was to mourn her death, he immediately bade his family goodbye and left for a 23-hour plane trip to Australia to help pitch London's bid to a gathering of International Olympic Committee members in early April.
 Exhausted emotionally and physically, Coe walked into the lobby of his hotel in Brisbane, and the first person he saw was the NYC2012 founder, Daniel L. Doctoroff. They sat together for 15 minutes, stealing a break in their frenzied schedules simply to empathize. 
 ''He was very understanding; he had lost a parent recently, too,'' Coe said in a telephone interview from London last week. ''It was a great display of humanity.''
 The five men leading the bids for the 2012 Olympic finalist cities are an unusual peer group, sharing what has become a grueling job, only one of which will end happily when the I.O.C. picks the 2012 city on July 6. The task of selling 117 I.O.C. members on their city falls largely on these five men.
 Coe, a two-time Olympic 1,500-meter champion, plugs London tirelessly. Doctoroff, who doubles as New York's deputy mayor, does the same for his city. Paris leans on Philippe Baudillon, Madrid on Feliciano Mayoral and Moscow on Valery P. Shantsev, the city's vice mayor.
 ''We could create a trade union of bidders,'' Baudillon said jokingly during a telephone interview.
 In the new era of I.O.C. rules, members are not allowed to travel to the bidding cities, an attempt to avoid the corruption unearthed in Salt Lake City's bid. So wooing the hearts and votes of the committee members requires the bid leaders to chase them around the world, to every event deemed an appropriate meeting. And with the competition so fierce among five powerhouse cities, no one dares miss even the smallest opportunity.
 The five men hopscotch the globe in pursuit of votes, squeezing sales pitches into every meeting, no matter how short. Their schedules look like a flight attendant's.
 Doctoroff, long familiar with an arduous work schedule in his years as an investment banker, has given up wearing a watch. One day last month, before leaving for another trip, he put one on but had not bothered to set it. At 11:45 a.m., he glanced at it. It read 6:15.
 ''I barely know what time zone I'm in, so I'm always waking up at funny hours,'' he said. ''But I love it. I can honestly say I have not regretted once the decision to do what I'm doing. People say, 'How do you keep going?' But I say, 'When you love what you do, it's a lot easier.'''
 The effort has heated up over the past year, with each city required to develop and file its bid book, play host to the evaluation commission and plunge into the most important work: persuading the I.O.C. members who will decide their fates.
 This is the part that got the I.O.C. into trouble before awarding the 2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake City: the process devolved into a free-for-all of personal favors. The committee responded by expelling 10 members and rewriting its bidding rules. In came the restrictions on when and how bid leaders could approach members. The evaluation commission was created to judge the bids and to help the larger body choose.
 ''The I.O.C. is trying to make sure the decision is made on the technical merit of the bids, but I don't think that is realistic,'' said Charlie Battle, NYC2012's international relations director, who was involved in Atlanta's successful bid for the 1996 Games. ''It is still a political and a personal decision.''
 That is where the bid leaders come in. They know I.O.C. members judge the cities partly on whether they trust the people in charge. So, into the slivers of time the I.O.C. allows contact, the bid leaders try to build relationships with voters, to build that trust.
 Baudillon got a head start on the field, having been part of Paris's bid for the 1992 Games, which went to Barcelona, Spain.
 Coe is known throughout Olympic circles as a champion who has pushed for athletes' involvement in the I.O.C. Among Mayoral's many posts in the Olympic movement, he has been on two Games coordination commissions. Shantsev is the former head of Russia's ice hockey federation.
 Doctoroff is the relative newcomer to I.O.C. circles. It is one of the reasons he turned to Battle for help.
 Doctoroff, 46, not only does the traveling and schmoozing, but he also pays for it. New York's bid, unlike the others, is financed exclusively by private money. Doctoroff pays all of his expenses. He said his BlackBerry bill alone had topped $2,000 a month.
 He juggles this pursuit with being deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding. (He is also a husband and father of three.) 
 Coe, 48, had to deal with his mother's illness and death, taking over the London bid when it was foundering. He is a husband and father of four, all under 13.
 ''I told them, 'You won't see a lot of me,''' Coe said. ''They said, 'It's O.K., because we want the Games.' It's the first job I've had that they really understand.''
 Those are the kinds of stories the bid leaders share. They are among the few people who can understand the demands of their jobs. So when they see each other at I.O.C. gatherings, they often go out to dinner. By all accounts, they put aside their rivalry.
 ''We've actually developed nice relationships that I hope will survive this process,'' Doctoroff said. ''There is a shared experience. We always have a good time when we get together.''
 Empathy, after all, is a valuable thing.

HEADLINE: Bowling for Democracy

BYLINE: By Orlando Patterson and Jason Kaufman. 
Orlando Patterson is a professor of sociology and Jason Kaufman is an associate professor of sociology at Harvard. Their paper on cricket appears in the next issue of The American Sociological Review.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, MASS. 

 BODY:
CRICKET, the quintessential English game, is nonetheless one of the most international of sports. It is a dominant game in more countries than any other sport except soccer, in lands as varied as Australia, India, Pakistan, South Africa and the Commonwealth Caribbean. But a glance at the global map of cricket poses a remarkable cultural puzzle.
 Why, on the one hand, does the game flourish in lands like Pakistan and India, where a hard-fought series can transfix two nations and even lead to improved diplomatic relations? (Last month's series, in which Pakistan defeated India by 159 runs, concluded with a historic meeting between Pakistan's president and India's prime minister.) And why, on the other hand, is cricket not much played in other former British colonies like Canada -- or, for that matter, in the United States, with its heritage and ''special relationship'' with Britain? 
 The puzzle only deepens when one considers that cricket was once popular in both Canada and the United States. It rivaled baseball for most of the 19th century, with as many stories in the sports pages of The New York Times until 1880. Indeed, the world's first international test match was played between Canada and the United States in 1844. So the puzzle is not so much why it was never adopted in North America, but why in the early 20th century it was subsequently rejected.
 Many popular explanations are flawed. Climate has nothing to do with it; cricket emerged as a summer game, and is easily played in North America during mild weather. North American multiculturalism is hardly a factor, given the game's popularity in the multicultural societies of the Caribbean and South Africa. Ethnicity cannot be the answer: while the Scots, with their preference for curling, predominated among early Canadian immigrants, there was a far greater proportion of English in North America than in India or the Caribbean; meanwhile, the preponderance of the Irish in Australia did not prevent cricket from becoming that country's national pastime. Why is it, then, that hockey and baseball eventually trumped cricket in Canada and the United States?
 The most common argument is that cricket was too long and slow for fast-paced North America; formal test matches last for five days. This explanation at least has some merit -- though not in the manner usually understood.
 Cricket lost ground in North America because of the egalitarian ethos of its societies. Rich Americans and Canadians had constant anxiety about their elite status, which prompted them to seek ways to differentiate themselves from the masses. One of those ways was cricket, which was cordoned off as an elites-only pastime, a sport only for those wealthy enough to belong to expensive cricket clubs committed to Victorian ideals of sportsmanship. In late 19th-century Canada, according to one historian, ''the game became associated more and more with an older and more old-fashioned Anglo-Saxon elite.''
 This elite appropriation played into the hands of baseball entrepreneurs who actively worked to diminish cricket's popularity. A.G. Spalding, described in the Baseball Hall of Fame as the ''organizational genius of baseball's pioneer days,'' was typical. ''I have declared cricket is a genteel game,'' he mocked in ''America's National Game,'' his 1911 best seller. ''It is. Our British cricketer, having finished his day's labor at noon, may don his negligee shirt, his white trousers, his gorgeous hosiery and his canvas shoes, and sally forth to the field of sport, with his sweetheart on one arm and his cricket bat under the other, knowing that he may engage in his national pastime without soiling his linen or neglecting his lady.''
 Baseball, in contrast, was sold as a rugged, fast-paced, masculine game, befitting a rugged, fast-paced economic power. Americans of all classes swallowed the chauvinistic line. It was also great business for Spalding. By inventing elaborate baseball gear and paraphernalia, he created a market for his new sporting-goods company.
 In the remaining British colonies, however, the opposite happened. In these rigidly unequal societies the colonial elites and their native allies never had any anxieties about their status, and the British actively promoted the game -- first to native elites, then to the masses.
 In India, the wealthy Parsis first took up the game in emulation of their British masters. Soon, royalty throughout the subcontinent adopted it. English-style grammar schools were an important source of exposure to upwardly mobile native men. In the Caribbean, grammar schools made the imperial game a core feature of their education and made competition possible between different classes and ethnic groups without disrupting the social fabric. As C.L.R. James, the famed Trinidadian intellectual and cricket enthusiast, wrote in his memoir: ''I haven't the slightest doubt that the clash of race, caste and class did not retard but stimulated West Indian cricket.''
 Both colonizer and colonized developed a stake in the popularization of the game. To the British colonists, the ''imperial game'' was the perfect vehicle for civilizing the colonial masses (as it had previously, they imagined, civilized generations of upwardly mobile British schoolboys). For elite members of the colonized, it was a way to curry favor. And for the masses, who quickly mastered the game, it was a symbolically powerful and clandestine form of political liberation as they soon learned to literally beat the British and their native surrogates at their own game.
 The game itself partly facilitated this process. Cricket requires no contact between players, and its strict and complex rules, dress code and officiating largely eliminate any risk of embarrassment in play with those of different ranks or castes. So did the careful allocation of positions; less glamorous roles like bowling and fielding were assigned to social inferiors while those of specialist batsmen and team captain were reserved for elites.
 Much the same was true of 19th-century Australia, at the time a highly stratified colony whose masses were descended from prisoners. Cricket helped antipodean elites cultivate their Englishness, but the size and isolation of their European settlements limited the extent to which they could be truly exclusive. North American-style upper-class appropriation of the game was out of the question. Cricket became a powerful unifying force, and prowess at the game, according to one cricket historian, was ''the mark of an amateur gentleman'' from any class.
 As in the Caribbean, cricket was also a major element in the formation of Australian nationalism. The biennial matches with England solidified the link between colony and mother country even as it fostered Australian national pride when the Australians increasingly came to whip the British at their imperial game.
 WHAT broader lessons might the history of cricket have for the globalization of Western cultural practices? It shows that such practices can be promoted or discouraged from the top down; it is not necessarily a bottom-up process, as is commonly believed. Nor does such downward dissemination require the point of a gun. The passion for cricket in places like Pakistan and India also shows that a complex Western cultural practice can be adopted in its entirety by very different cultures, even when highly identified with its country of origin. 
 Might the same be true of other Western cultural practices, like democracy?

HEADLINE: U.S. Recruits A Rough Ally To Be a Jailer

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr.; Souad Mekhennet contributed reporting from Frankfurt for this article, and Stephen Grey from London.

 BODY:
Seven months before Sept. 11, 2001, the State Department issued a human rights report on Uzbekistan. It was a litany of horrors.
 The police repeatedly tortured prisoners, State Department officials wrote, noting that the most common techniques were ''beating, often with blunt weapons, and asphyxiation with a gas mask.'' Separately, international human rights groups had reported that torture in Uzbek jails included boiling of body parts, using electroshock on genitals and plucking off fingernails and toenails with pliers. Two prisoners were boiled to death, the groups reported. The February 2001 State Department report stated bluntly, ''Uzbekistan is an authoritarian state with limited civil rights.''
 Immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, however, the Bush administration turned to Uzbekistan as a partner in fighting global terrorism. The nation, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia, granted the United States the use of a military base for fighting the Taliban across the border in Afghanistan. President Bush welcomed President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan to the White House, and the United States has given Uzbekistan more than $500 million for border control and other security measures. 
 Now there is growing evidence that the United States has sent terror suspects to Uzbekistan for detention and interrogation, even as Uzbekistan's treatment of its own prisoners continues to earn it admonishments from around the world, including from the State Department. 
 The so-called rendition program, under which the Central Intelligence Agency transfers terrorism suspects to foreign countries to be held and interrogated, has linked the United States to other countries with poor human rights records. But the turnabout in relations with Uzbekistan is particularly sharp. Before Sept. 11, 2001, there was little high-level contact between Washington and Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, beyond the United States' criticism. 
 Uzbekistan's role as a surrogate jailer for the United States was confirmed by a half-dozen current and former intelligence officials working in Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The C.I.A. declined to comment on the prisoner transfer program, but an intelligence official estimated that the number of terrorism suspects sent by the United States to Tashkent was in the dozens. 
 There is other evidence of the United States' reliance on Uzbekistan in the program. On Sept. 21, 2003, two American-registered airplanes -- a Gulfstream jet and a Boeing 737 -- landed at the international airport in Tashkent, according to flight logs obtained by The New York Times.
 Although the precise purpose of those flights is not known, over a span of about three years, from late 2001 until early this year, the C.I.A. used those two planes to ferry terror suspects in American custody to countries around the world for questioning, according to interviews with former and current intelligence officials and flight logs showing the movements of the planes. On the day the planes landed in Tashkent, the Gulfstream had taken off from Baghdad, while the 737 had departed from the Czech Republic, the logs show.
 The logs show at least seven flights were made to Uzbekistan by those planes from early 2002 to late 2003, but the records are incomplete.
 Details of the C.I.A.'s prisoner transfer program have emerged in recent months from a handful of former detainees who have been released, primarily from prisons in Egypt and Afghanistan, and in some cases have alleged they were beaten and tortured while being held.
 The program was created in the mid-1980's as a way for the C.I.A. to transfer crime suspects arrested abroad to their home countries. After Sept. 11, the C.I.A. used it to send prisoners suspected of being senior leaders of Al Qaeda to a half-dozen countries for detention. American intelligence officials estimate that the United States has transferred 100 to 150 suspects to Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Uzbekistan. 
 A senior C.I.A. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he would not discuss whether the United States had sent prisoners to Uzbekistan or anywhere else. But he said: ''The United States does not engage in or condone torture. It does not send people anywhere to be tortured. And it does not knowingly receive information derived from torture.''
 Ilkhom Zakirov, a spokesman for the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry in Tashkent, also declined to comment on whether Uzbekistan accepted terror suspects from the United States. He declined to address the accusations from human rights groups. But human rights activists say that because Uzbekistan's record is well known, it raises questions about why the C.I.A. would send suspects there. 
 ''If you talk to anyone there, Uzbeks know that torture is used -- it's common even in run-of-the-mill criminal cases,'' said Allison Gill, a researcher for Human Rights Watch who is working inside Uzbekistan. ''Anyone in the United States or Europe who does not know the extent of the torture problem in Uzbekistan is being willfully ignorant.''
 Craig Murray, a former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, said he learned during his posting to Tashkent that the C.I.A. used Uzbekistan as a place to hold foreign terrorism suspects. During 2003 and early 2004, Mr. Murray said in an interview, ''C.I.A. flights flew to Tashkent often, usually twice a week.''
 In July 2004, Mr. Murray wrote a confidential memo to the British Foreign Office accusing the C.I.A. of violating the United Nations' Prohibition Against Torture. He urged his colleagues to stop using intelligence gleaned in Uzbekistan from terrorism suspects because it had been elicited through torture and other coercive means. Mr. Murray said he knew about the practice through his own investigation and interviews with scores of people who claimed to have been brutally treated inside Uzbekistan's jails.
 ''We should cease all cooperation with the Uzbek security services -- they are beyond the pale,'' Mr. Murray wrote in the memo, which was obtained by The Times.
 Mr. Murray, who has previously spoken publicly about prisoner transfers to Uzbekistan, said his superiors in London were furious with his questions, and he was told that the intelligence gleaned in Uzbekistan could still be used by British officials, even if it was elicited by torture, as long as the mistreatment was not at the hands of British interrogators. ''I was astonished,'' Mr. Murray said in an interview. ''It was as if the goal posts had moved. Their perspective had changed since Sept. 11.''
 A Foreign Office spokesman declined to address Mr. Murray's allegations. Last year, Mr. Murray resigned from the Foreign Office, which had investigated accusations that he mismanaged the embassy in Tashkent. An inquiry into those allegations was closed without any disciplinary action being taken against him.
 The strategic partnership between Washington and Tashkent, based initially on the Americans' use of Uzbekistan's military base, was formalized at a March 2002 Oval Office meeting between President Bush and President Karimov. Muhammad Salih, the leader of Uzbekistan's pro-democracy Erk Democratic Party, who is living in exile in Germany, said the relationship had strengthened Mr. Karimov's hand.
 ''It's been a great opportunity for Karimov,'' Mr. Salih said. ''But President Bush has to also think about human rights and democracy. If he wants to have a collaboration on antiterror matters, he should not close his eyes on other things that Uzbekistan is doing, like torture.''
 At a news conference last month, President Bush was asked what Uzbekistan could do in interrogating a suspect that the United States could not. 
 ''We seek assurances that nobody will be tortured when we render a person back to their home country,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 The State Department and human rights groups have continued to report on human rights abuses against Uzbeks in prison.
 The State Department's latest human rights report on Uzbekistan, issued in February, said: ''Torture was common in prisons, pretrial facilities, and local police and security service precincts.'' In addition, the State Department report noted that in 2003 the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture ''concluded that torture or similar ill-treatment was systematic.''
 Amnesty International and other groups have documented specific cases. In the summer of 2002, Amnesty International reported, Fatima Mukhadirova, a 62-year-old Tashkent shopkeeper, was sentenced to six years of hard labor after denouncing the government for the death of her son, Muzafar Avozov, in a Tashkent prison. 
 An independent examination of photographs of the body, conducted by the University of Glasgow, showed that Mr. Avozov died after being immersed in boiling water, human rights groups reported. The examination said his head had been beaten and his fingernails removed.
 Human rights activists pressed for Ms. Mukhadirova's release. She was freed shortly before a planned visit by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld in February 2004.
 Human rights activists say that the United States has a difficult balancing act to maintain in its dealings with Uzbekistan. 
 ''The relationship between the U.S. and Uzbekistan is problematic,'' Ms. Gill of Human Rights Watch said. ''It can be useful that the U.S. is powerful enough to push for certain concessions. That being said, the U.S. should not be saying that Karimov is a partner, is an ally, is a friend. The U.S. should send the message that Uzbekistan won't be considered to be a good ally of the United States unless it respects human rights at home.''
 The delicate diplomatic balance played out in the early spring of 2004, after a series of suicide bombings in Tashkent killed 47 people, many of them Uzbek police officers. The government cracked down against people on religious grounds, setting off international condemnation. 
 Three months later, despite the urgings of the Uzbek foreign minister, Sodik Safoyev, the State Department said it would cut $18 million in military and economic aid to Uzbekistan because of its failure to improve its human rights record.
 But the next month, on Aug. 12, 2004, Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chief of Staffs, visited Tashkent. He met with President Karimov and other officials, and he announced that the Pentagon would provide an additional $21 million to help Uzbekistan in its campaign to remove its stockpile of biological weapons.
 General Myers said the United States had ''benefited greatly from our partnership and strategic relationship with Uzbekistan.''
 While he noted that there were genuine concerns about Uzbekistan's human rights record, General Myers said: ''In my view, we shouldn't let any single issue drive a relationship with any single country. It doesn't seem to be good policy to me.''

HEADLINE: Floating Below Politics

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
IRAN had its moment, Finland and Korea too. But at film festivals around the world these days, much of the talk is focused on Argentina and the emerging crop of young directors who have been winning prizes and praise from Berlin and Rotterdam to Toronto and Miami.
 That flowering began here in the late 1990's and is still more an art-house phenomenon than a commercial one. Its most recent product is Lucrecia Martel's ''Holy Girl,'' which opened in New York on Friday, and hopes to build on the momentum established by Fabian Bielinsky's ''Nine Queens,'' a deft crime caper released five years ago (and recently remade by Hollywood as ''Criminal''), and Daniel Burman's poignant comedy ''Lost Embrace,'' which had a successful run in the United States earlier this year. 
 Yet other than their age, their nationality and a proclivity for setting up their production companies in somewhat run-down buildings on the fringes of chic neighborhoods here, the new directors, ranging in age from late 20's to early 40's, don't have all that much in common. They do not share an aesthetic, the way the French New Wave or Brazilian Cinema Novo did, and some of them did not even know one another until they met at film festivals in Europe or North America. ''To call us a movement or something like that would be excessive, because it isn't that yet and I don't know if it ever will be,'' Ms. Martel, 38, said during a recent interview at a bookstore and cafe near her home in the suburbs here. ''We've been nurtured by the same crisis, but that's about it,'' she added, referring to the recurring political and economic turmoil that has characterized Argentine life for decades.
 In both ''The Holy Girl'' and her first feature, ''La Cienaga,'' Ms. Martel has shown an ability to make the ordinary seem bizarrely unsettling. In ''The Holy Girl,'' the story, which Ms. Martel wrote, moves back and forth between a medical conference at a somewhat tatty provincial hotel and the sexual and religious conflicts experienced by the teenage daughter of the hotel's manager. It is as if ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' were being filmed by David Lynch or Luis Bunuel, two directors Ms. Marteladmires. On the other hand Pablo Trapero and Adrian Caetano, directors with whom Ms. Martel is sometimes lumped, have a marked realist streak. And Martin Rejtman, who has a parallel career as an Iowa Writers' Workshop-trained author of short stories, makes urbane, wry and slightly off-kilter comedies like ''The Magic Gloves'' and ''Silvia Prieto.'' Their dialogue-heavy films stand in contrast to Lisandro Alonso's two films, ''La Libertad'' and ''Los Muertos,'' which are almost wordless, relying on visual imagery for their power.
 ''I believe that Argentine cinema today is defined more by what it isn't than by what it affirms,'' said Mr. Trapero, 33, whose best-known film is probably ''El Bonaerense,'' a drama about police corruption released in 2002. ''What we have in common is that many things are excluded from our films, such as the notion of the omniscient discourse of a director who knows the truth and interprets and illuminates it for the spectator.''
 Surprisingly perhaps in view of Argentina's turbulent history, there is also an aversion to overtly political themes in favor of more intimate and personal ones. ''Smaller stories and a smaller focus'' is the way Mr. Alonso, 29, puts it.
 Diego Lerman, for example, was born on March 24, 1976, the same day the Argentine military overthrew the Peron dynasty and ushered in seven years of brutal dictatorship that came to be known here as ''the Process.'' His father was a labor leader and his earliest years were spent in hiding, moving from one refuge to another with his parents, a situation similar to that portrayed in ''Kamchatka,'' a popular movie by Marcelo Pineyro released here in 2002. But when Mr. Lerman had a chance to make his first feature at the age of 25, he chose to make the Argentine version of a road movie. ''Tan de Repente'' (''All of a Sudden'') tells the story of lesbian punks named Lenin and Mao who abduct a shop clerk and end up traveling with her to visit an ailing relative in a provincial city.
 ''Movies that try to be instructive or enlightening annoy me, because they divide things clearly and simply into good and bad, which is a lie,'' Mr. Lerman said. ''Many of the people who criticize the dictatorship now supported it then, so to divide things up that way is a simplification and reductionism that seem to reflect a lack of intelligence.''
 Yet the experience of having grown up under military rule is not entirely absent from these filmmakers' work. Ms. Martel, whose movies have been praised as lacerating portrayals of middle-class decadence and hypocrisy, said the impact of those years was reflected more in the underlying ethic and approach to making films than in the subject matter itself.
 ''During the dictatorship, we were children, living a reality in which the middle class above all denied what was going on, a reality that was sustained with great effort because there was no way to maintain such deceitfulness,'' she said. ''To discover all of those falsehoods generated a desire to find truthfulness and credibility, whether in the stories we tell, the way we use dialogue or even in the way we cast actors.''
 The film boom here is also a result, if indirect, of the economic crisis that flattened this once-prosperous country in the late 1990's, culminating in the collapse of the economy in December 2001. ''It used to be that in Argentina having a profession like that of a doctor, lawyer or engineer was a guarantee of a certain economic stability,'' said Mr. Trapero, who was an architecture student before shifting to film. ''But that guarantee ceased to be true, and for me and a whole generation we decided that if a profession isn't going to guarantee me a future, well, then I'm going to do what I really want to do, which is to tell stories.''
 The crisis has also had an unexpected impact on the financing of movies. With money so scarce in recent years, many Argentine filmmakers have ended up looking abroad for support -- whether to the Hubert Bals Fund, affiliated with the Rotterdam International Film Festival; the Sundance Film Festival; or Pedro Almodovar's production company in Spain, all of which have been active in the resurgence.
 Forcing directors to look outside Argentina for money actually has given them more creative latitude than if they were working with production companies based here, many of which are linked to television channels. In addition, since 1994 Argentina has had a so-called cinema law that imposes a 10 percent tax on movie tickets and video sales. The tax is meant to provide money for local productions, but some of the movies that have been most praised abroad have received only minimal support through this system.
 ''As regards numbers, many films do better in Europe than here,'' said Lita Stantic, a veteran director and producer. Daniel Burman, the 32-year-old director of ''Lost Embrace,'' goes even further: ''Movies that don't make a dollar here are the ones that sell best abroad.''
 Perhaps that is because movies that do well in Argentina tend to be glossy and sentimental, featuring actors who are well-known here, like Ricardo Darin and Norma Aleandro. The newer crop of directors, in contrast, can be unsparingly candid in their assessments of society and behavior, which appeals to sophisticated moviegoers abroad who want to be challenged, as well as entertained. To save money, some of the new crop of directors have shot in black and white, or on weekends. Others (Mr. Trapero in particular) have also worked on each other's films as producers, editors or even cameramen. 
 One thing that all the young directors here have in common is scoffing at the notion that they are pioneers. Instead they emphasize that Argentina has a strong cinematic tradition, to which they feel connected. Back in the 60's and early 70's, for instance, Leopoldo Torre Nilsson and Ms. Bemberg were writing or directing films outside the commercial mainstream that forced Argentines to confront the contradictions in their society. But that blossoming of talent ended with the ''dirty war'' that culminated in the military dictatorship. When democracy returned in the early 80's, filmmakers felt that they ''should talk about important themes, with heroes,'' as Mr. Lerman put it. The best example is probably ''The Official Version,'' which tells the story of a military officer's wife who discovers that her adopted baby is actually the child of leftist militants who have been made to disappear. It won the Academy Award for best foreign-language film in 1986. 
 ''Coming out of the dictatorship, it was a tricky situation,'' Mr. Rejtman said. ''Creating art is not a naive occupation, and there is a difference between expressing ideas and creating art. My objective is to tell the story but not impose it, which is the opposite of what happened in the 1980's, when all the films were very explicit.''
 With foreign producers and festival directors now turning up regularly at festivals here to scout for promising films and directors, everything seems to indicate that the current resurgence will continue and strengthen. For instance, Ms. Stantic, who has come to specialize in first films by young directors, is currently working with Lucia Cedron, 30, who three years ago won the top prize at the Berlin International Film Festival for a short and is now working on her first feature, ''Lamb of God.''
 ''I sold my film in countries that had bought 'Nine Queens' and so had become curious about Argentine cinema,'' Mr. Burman said of ''Lost Embrace.'' ''It's like a chain reaction. Once you generate interest in one place, it becomes easier to interest others.''

HEADLINE: Uniforms Losing Stigma on Elite Campuses

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Every Friday afternoon, four undergraduates from Columbia University put on military uniforms and travel to the Bronx campus of Fordham University. There, the students -- cadets in the Army's Reserve Officers Training Corps, a military leadership program that has been banned from Columbia's own campus since 1969 -- study topics not listed in the course catalog, including land navigation and marching in formation. 
 But their commute could soon be as short as a walk across campus. Emboldened by a high-turnout student referendum two years ago that put support for ending the R.O.T.C. ban at 65 percent, a politically eclectic group of undergraduates has raised the program's profile. 
 The debate has done more than expose predictable fault lines over the Pentagon's ''don't ask, don't tell'' regulations and the war in Iraq. It has also signaled a shift in student attitudes toward the military and encouraged vigorous conversation on campus. 
 ''From the point of view of a veteran of '68 here, which I am, it's a different world,'' said Allan A. Silver, a professor of sociology, referring to the year that student protests convulsed the campus. Mr. Silver, who has taught at Columbia for more than four decades, favors the R.O.T.C.'s return. ''There is very little overt antimilitary sentiment. The major issue is the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy on the service of open homosexuals in the military.'' That is a far cry from the atmosphere of Vietnam era, when police once battled protesters at an R.O.T.C. awards ceremony, and many students and faculty members at Columbia rejected any hint of accommodation with the ''military-industrial complex.'' 
 More than three decades after the Vietnam War drove a wedge between America's military and many of its elite colleges, the divide is beginning to narrow, and not just at Columbia. In recent years, several Ivy League universities have begun revisiting policies put in place during the late 1960's to prohibit or limit R.O.T.C. programs.
 ''There certainly is opposition, and there are issues that need to be dealt with,'' said Michael M. Segal, a neurologist and Harvard alumnus who runs Advocates for R.O.T.C., an umbrella group for campus R.O.T.C. supporters. ''But there's more interest now than there has been at any time since the early 1960's.''
 The interest has been greatest by far at Columbia, where the original decision to phase out a Navy R.O.T.C. unit followed several years of sit-ins and building takeovers linked to protests over Vietnam, the university's research for the Pentagon and other issues.
 Since then, periodic attempts by students and alumni to bring it back in some form or another have been rebuffed, though Columbia -- like most Ivy League schools that dissolved their R.O.T.C. programs -- eventually began allowing students to ''cross-enroll'' at nearby colleges that still offered the military training. (Along with the four Columbia students in Fordham's Army R.O.T.C. unit, five others serve in the Air Force R.O.T.C. unit at Manhattan College, also in the Bronx.) 
 But that began to change in 2003, when Sean Wilkes, a soft-spoken Columbia undergraduate who trains with the R.O.T.C. unit at Fordham, began organizing an effort to change how his fellow students viewed military life and culture.
 ''All they could think of was people marching back and forth like in Monty Python,'' recalled Mr. Wilkes, now a junior and the head of Advocates for Columbia R.O.T.C. ''We got them to think about the importance of having college-educated officers in the military, and that Columbia should be part of that.'' 
 He and his fellow advocates soon found support not only from alumni who had served in the military, but also from many fellow students. That April, Mr. Wilkes and his group persuaded the student council of Columbia College, the university's largest undergraduate division, to include on its election ballot a question about whether the university ''should prohibit R.O.T.C. from having a chapter at Columbia.'' Most students who voted opposed the prohibition, and the following year, the university senate -- a body of faculty members and students who help set policy -- agreed to form a task force to look into the matter.
 Last month , the task force's 10 members deadlocked on whether to favor letting the R.O.T.C. return to campus next year. But significantly, all but one voted in favor of inviting the program back should Congress reverse the military ban on service by people who are openly gay. ''I don't think this is a partisan issue,'' said Nathan C. Walker, a doctoral student and a co-chairman of the task force. Mr. Walker voted against the R.O.T.C.'s immediate return; like many students, he feels that the arguments favoring it do not outweigh the potential violation of the university's nondiscrimination policies. But, he says, ''I think reasonable people have come to all different conclusions based on different rationales.''
 Many students and faculty members, for example, point to Sept. 11 and the war in Afghanistan as events that promoted growing sympathy on campus for military men and women.
 ''People were certainly more willing to speak up in favor of military service during the war in Afghanistan and even during the war in Iraq,'' said Shane Hachey, an Army veteran who graduated from Columbia last May and was active in Advocates for Columbia R.O.T.C. ''They might not respect the Bush administration or its motives there. But they still respect soldiers.''
 That sentiment is echoed among today's young people, a generation that was weaned on volunteerism and has never faced a military draft. In July 2001, according to national surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center, 29 percent of respondents aged 18 to 29 had a ''very favorable'' opinion of the military. By June 2004, that number had risen to 45 percent.
 Some partisans in the Columbia debate focus on the responsibility they say the university owes to the country; others say reviving the R.O.T.C. could help liberalize the ranks and promote acceptance of service by homosexuals.
 ''My grandfather was in the military, and my father encouraged me to apply to the Naval Academy,'' said Lars Dabney, a Columbia sophomore. ''I tend to be a liberal-minded thinker, and my dad said, 'We need more people with your perspective in the armed forces.'''
 The thousands of dollars in financial assistance that the R.O.T.C. provides cadets is also a major factor in the debate at Columbia, where tuition and board came to $39,276 this year.
 ''Two values which are important to Columbia students -- nondiscrimination and open educational opportunities for everyone -- are put into opposition,'' said Matthew Harrison, president of the student council of Columbia College.
 The military has its own concerns about a potential move to bring R.O.T.C. to those Ivy League schools that do not have a program on campus, which besides Columbia are Harvard, Yale, Brown and Dartmouth.
 ''We want to be represented in every segment of our society, and to have all those segments represented in the military,'' said William Carr, the Defense Department's deputy under secretary for personnel matters. ''But when a campus is less than interested in the military, it shows up in student enrollment and in turn makes the school less attractive to the military.''
 That was one reason the Pentagon did not put up much of a fight against anti-R.O.T.C. protests during the Vietnam era; instead, it opened more R.O.T.C. units in the South, and instituted cross-enrollment arrangements elsewhere.
 ''It became obvious that many small liberal arts colleges were not going to be economically viable as R.O.T.C. units, both because they were producing relatively few officers and because these students didn't need the money,'' said Michael Neiberg, author of ''Making Citizen-Soldiers: ROTC and the Ideology of American Military Service.''
 But soaring tuition, along with the emotional appeal of service, has helped boost the R.O.T.C.'s attractiveness at elite schools like Columbia and Harvard, where student participation is strong in the Army R.O.T.C. battalion at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 ''We have access to campus and quite a good working relationship with the president of the university,'' said Lt. Col. Brian L. Baker, the unit commander, referring to Lawrence H. Summers of Harvard, who has attended the R.O.T.C.'s commissioning ceremonies and hired a bus line to shuttle Harvard's cadets to M.I.T.
 Dartmouth has also taken steps to strengthen its relationship with the R.O.T.C.
 Students there are formally attached to the R.O.T.C. unit at Norwich University, but Dartmouth provides classroom and meeting space to reduce the cadets' travel. The R.O.T.C. instructor now attends monthly meetings with other student advisers, and Dartmouth has even begun pushing to increase the cadets' scholarship amounts.
 Though a decision on R.O.T.C. has yet to be made at Columbia, small gestures have made life easier for its cadets. Columbia's financial aid Web page now includes information on R.O.T.C. scholarships, and in 2003 the school began listing R.O.T.C. classes on the transcripts of Columbia students cross-enrolled at other schools, though the classes do not earn course credit.
 The senate will hold a nonbinding vote this month, leaving the issue before the university president, Lee C. Bollinger, and the trustees.

HEADLINE: 30 Years Later, Cake and Credit Cards in Saigon

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, April 30 

 BODY:
The beggars are mostly gone. So are the streetwalkers. Shops by Bulgari and Cartier are at the newly elegant Caravelle Hotel in the center of town. A Hyatt is opening soon only a few yards away.
 To the eyes of visitors here, including international journalists gathered for a reunion, the market economy and capitalism seem to be doing just fine in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. But on Saturday, the 30th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the mood in the pulsingly hot city was revolutionary -- to a degree. 
 Red flags with yellow stars were everywhere. The face of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam's revolutionary leader, was on billboards around the city. Near the Presidential Palace -- where North Vietnamese tanks smashed down the gates on April 30, 1975, leading President Duong Van Minh to surrender unconditionally -- government workers and soldiers marched in a parade. The country's leaders, including the legendary war hero Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, who also defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu, turned out to watch.
 But there were no tanks or missiles in the parade. Instead, a four-ton cake was rolled out, for the more than 1,000 people who were born on the country's ''Liberation Day'' and were celebrating their 30th birthday. 
 In fact, the parade seemed pointedly designed to depict a benign nation seeking friendship, notably with the United States, Hanoi's biggest trading partner. Some floats carried the logos of American credit card companies. Near the parade route, the Diamond department store, as upscale a department store as any in the United States, was open for business. And tight security left most people watching the parade on television, if at all. 
 As if to underline Vietnam's openness, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai sent out a message on Friday reaching out to the nation's former enemies and those who fought on the side of the former South Vietnam, urging all sides to ''close the past, look to the future.'' (While local newspapers and magazines happily depict the attack on the Presidential Palace 30 years ago, it is almost impossible to find anything about the assault on the American Embassy, which was several blocks away.)
 The anniversary of Saigon's fall, which ended a war that left 55,000 Americans dead and claimed as many as three million Vietnamese lives, also was the occasion for a return to the city of dozens of American, British and Australian journalists who covered the war from the mid-1960's until 1975. The informal five-day reunion was both a melancholy and an upbeat affair: many of the journalists had not seen each other since their 20's.
 Richard Pyle, the Saigon bureau chief for The Associated Press, said, ''This may be the last hurrah. Who knows? The next one may be held in our wheelchairs.''
 Certainly one of the more bittersweet reminders of changing times was the slide of the Continental Hotel, whose outdoor terrace used to be a bastion for the French, who came to drink, according to Somerset Maugham, ''sweet and sickly beverages'' while talking politics. The terrace was a setting for Graham Greene's ''The Quiet American,'' a locale for assignations and intrigue over Bombay Sapphire martinis. It was taken over by journalists in the 1960's. Now the terrace is gone, replaced by an Italian restaurant.
 Mr. Pyle said Vietnam was, for many journalists, an indefinable experience that altered their lives. ''Vietnam was a magnetic force -- you can't define it,'' Mr. Pyle said. ''It wasn't just the best story of our careers, it transcended that. We all moved on to other things, but we all have Vietnam in our systems forever. You never really get away from Vietnam. It's always there.''
 Authors as varied as Mr. Maugham and Mr. Greene have used similar words to describe a city that changes but doesn't really, a city thick with the scent of jasmine and spice and motor fuel, a city that seems mysterious even when it's not. 
 The narrow street adjacent to the Continental and Caravelle Hotels in downtown Ho Chi Minh City reflects some of the city's transformation. The French knew the street as Rue Catinat, a street whose cafes and shops served as the center of colonial life for decades. After the French left in 1954, the South Vietnamese changed the street's name to Tu Do, or Freedom. The influx of American soldiers led to a flood of bars and prostitutes. After the war, the Vietnamese changed the street's name to Dong Khoi, or Uprising. In recent years, the street has mirrored the nation's economic confidence, with upscale shops and boutiques interspersed with more modest ones. The remnants of colonialism and the G.I.'s are gone.
 For some of the foreign journalists here, one attempted meeting was a visit to the home of Pham Xuan An. Mr. An was one of the more celebrated Vietnamese journalists working in Saigon in the 1960's and 1970's, a reporter for Reuters before joining Time Magazine, and especially popular with journalists for the larger newspapers and magazines, and visiting editors and columnists. Mr. An was elegant, candid and seemed highly informed about the inner workings of the South Vietnamese government. He was also an espionage agent for North Vietnam.
 According to an English-language paperback book purchased here, ''Pham Xuan An: a General of the Secret Service,'' by Hoang Hao Van and Tan Tu, Mr. An was actually a retired major general and a top intelligence officer in the Vietnam People's Army. The book said Mr. An was trusted by the Central Intelligence Agency and extremely close to the Saigon government run by Nguyen Van Thieu. But how Mr. An operated as a journalist and intelligence agent and what he accomplished as a spy remains a mystery.
 By phone, Mr. An said he had emphysema and took ill at the moment to chat. ''I was born in 1927,'' he said. ''I'm 78. I'm the same age as Fidel Castro. I'm two years older than Arafat, but he's gone now.''

HEADLINE: SECURITY ISSUES FORCE A REVIEW AT GROUND ZERO

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
Security concerns outlined last month by the New York Police Department have set off a serious reassessment of plans for the World Trade Center site. People involved in the rebuilding effort say that the revisions that need to be made to the site's most prominent feature, the Freedom Tower, could delay the start of construction from several months to a year.
 As a result, the lead developer at the site, Larry Silverstein, has proposed seeking public financing -- possibly hundreds of millions of dollars -- to pay for addressing the Police Department's security concerns. Such a development would be a significant shift for a project that has relied largely on private insurance money.
 In addition, the Police Department's most recent security analysis has moved those involved in the rebuilding effort to examine yet again what might be done to safeguard the site and the people visiting it, if plans go forward to reopen the area's street grid. 
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the agency set up to direct the rebuilding, had each hired security consultants to assess the safety of the plans for the site. But it is clear that the Police Department's assessment was more disturbing.
 Indeed, interviews in the past week show that David Childs, the lead designer of the 1,776-foot Freedom Tower, has already begun rethinking fundamental elements of what is planned to be the successor to the twin towers: its precise location on the 16-acre site -- long planned for the northwest corner -- and its distance from heavily traveled West Street.
 The redesigned tower is expected to look different from the current model familiar to the public, but it is too early to characterize the extent of the changes, according to a person who has been briefed on the development team's concerns.
 It is clear, however, that three and a half years after the 9/11 attack, and 16 months after the tower's design was unveiled, police officials, unintentionally or not, have set off a storm of blame and accusations.
 George E. Pataki, who views the Freedom Tower as his greatest legacy as governor, is said by state officials to be angry with the police, and some of those officials have accused the department of having been late in laying out the scope of its concerns. They say the effect could unduly worry New Yorkers and possible tenants of the buildings. Mr. Pataki did not reply to an interview request.
 At the same time, some state and development officials are angry at the Bloomberg administration, saying it should have delivered the police concerns earlier, but may have been distracted by its proposal for a stadium for the Jets on the Far West Side of Manhattan.
 Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, dismissed that assertion as silly and said that the city and the police had devoted enormous time to assessing the site's security with the latest intelligence and counterterrorism data.
 ''This is a remarkably complex security question, and every time you turn one dial, you end up turning many other dials on the security issue,'' Mr. Doctoroff said.
 Mr. Pataki said last November that major work on the foundation for the Freedom Tower would begin in February this year, with steel and concrete to arrive last month. Neither has happened; the tower was to be completed by 2009.
 Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly would not be interviewed about the department's security assessment, a multipage document that was given to Mr. Silverstein and the development agency on April 8. Other officials involved in the security discussions said that the department had raised concerns since at least last summer, but that the other camps involved in planning had not provided detailed information on which to make an assessment.
 Paul J. Browne, the department's deputy commissioner for public information, said, ''We understand that the Police Department's security concerns will be addressed in any redesign.''
 According to state officials who have reviewed the department's concerns, the police, most simply, do not see the tower as a normal commercial building; from the police's point of view, the officials say, the tower would replace the trade center, felled by terrorists, with a patriotic symbol that could be a new target. Heightening the concern is the fact that hundreds of uninspected 18-wheel trucks would rumble by the tower daily.
 That the police concerns are only now front and center, though, has exasperated senior development officials, many of whom fear that the mere public discussion of security worries could damage what they regard as a hard-won optimism about the site's future.
 ''I don't want to say the police have been irresponsible, but where were they until this month?'' said John C. Whitehead, a Pataki ally and chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. ''I wish they had called attention to the seriousness of the problems earlier, rather than at this late stage.''
 All of the principals involved at ground zero, from the politicians to the builders, remain keenly determined to make the Freedom Tower as secure as possible. But the degree of concern about the site's vulnerability clearly varies, and almost everyone involved in the rebuilding effort wonders if there ever could be a perfect formula for balancing security needs with civic ambitions at a site that has been attacked twice.
 The police, for their part, want the tower built to conform with security criteria based on standards used by the Department of Defense and other federal agencies, which would require the Freedom Tower to be as much as 100 feet away from the street. The site plan now calls for a minimum distance of 25 feet. The desire for greater distance is based on an analysis of the impact of a large blast.
 Over the last year, according to state officials involved in the project, security specialists at the Police Department suggested some provocative but relatively impractical ideas: ideally moving the Freedom Tower some 200 feet away from the street, for example, or moving the tower to another part of the site altogether.
 A government official involved in the security deliberations, echoing others, suggested that ''basically nothing can satisfy'' the police. But the official also acknowledged that the Freedom Tower inescapably required a security plan unlike that for almost any other building in the United States, given the site's hallowed ground and history.
 ''Here's the dilemma,'' the official said. ''If you put too much security into the building, it's going to look like Fort Knox and no one will rent it. If you don't put enough, it could end up with catastrophic results, not only catastrophic for the tower but for the surrounding buildings as well.''
 Referring to the current battle over security, the official said, ''What is going on is the argument over those issues.''
 The arguments over the months have included thinking imaginatively about security. Last summer, government officials at ground zero spoke with former security specialists from MI-5, Britain's domestic intelligence service, who advised that future attacks by terrorists would most likely come not in the form of a truck bomb, but rather with biological or chemical weapons.
 ''These guys were laughing at us, at the idea that Jersey barriers and bollards would protect the tower when terrorists have become more sophisticated,'' said one official involved in the redevelopment project.
 Some have already begun to reimagine: Daniel Libeskind, the master planner for the site, has drawn up new sketches on his own to show that the tower could be moved between 40 and 140 feet from West Street/Route 9A in order to solve police concerns.
 Mr. Libeskind played down the significance of the redesign, which will be done by Mr. Childs.
 Not surprisingly, some people involved in the rebuilding are urging calm, suggesting that security was inevitably going to cause delays for a grand civic project with so many elements, including a memorial for Sept. 11 victims, a performing arts center, and new office towers.
 ''It's all been very quiet, as it should be, because these are very delicate matters and you don't want to advertise them to the world,'' Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, an influential private research group, said of the behind-the-scenes security discussions. ''But it's all coming to a head around the design of the Freedom Tower.''
 Depending on who is talking, security concerns have loomed over the site since the fall of 2001, and were discussed in fits and starts for years, competing for attention with other issues, like the tower's design, and the memorial competition.
 But in the last several months, as the start of construction neared, the security talks intensified.
 ''The police would say, 'Based on our knowledge and our intelligence, we think you can do more to make the building safer,''' said one official involved in the security discussions. ''We would say, 'Tell us what.' The cops would say, 'We're not engineers.' We would say, 'O.K., tell us what we need to tell our engineers to protect against.' And it became this long, drawn-out back and forth.''
 The talks came to a head at a one point several weeks ago when the parties met with officials of the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs to discuss its proposed 40-story headquarters, just to the northwest of the Freedom Tower.
 Stunning many in the room, Goldman representatives showed a film of a vehicle, packed with more than 10,000 pounds of explosive material, blowing up and leaving a huge crater. While some participants viewed the film as an insensitive move by Goldman, it also prompted discussion about the amount of explosives that the buildings would be protected against. At that moment, the talks began moving toward clearer standards for ''hardening'' buildings to blasts.
 One government official said that as the police concerns became more apparent, the breadth of their issues took many people aback. In addition to the distance from the street, the official said, ''there is the strength of the glass, the strength and the thickness of the concrete walls.''
 ''The way the building is constructed will determine how many casualties there will be if a bomb of X size is blown off at Y location,'' the official said.
 Just how radical the revisions to the tower will be is far from clear. Some officials said the altered design, in the end, might not look different to the eye. But it is also possible that changes could be so significant that a new environmental impact statement might be needed, according to one person who has been briefed on some elements of the redesign.

HEADLINE: Bush, the Great Shiite Liberator

BYLINE: By LEE SMITH. 
Lee Smith is writing a book on Arab culture.

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon 

 BODY:
IF one of the Bush administration's strategic goals was to shake up the established order in the Middle East, the formation of Iraq's new government last week was a raging success.
 To be sure, any sort of democratic government in Iraq is groundbreaking. But after nearly 1,400 years of Sunni-dominated Islamic history, for a predominantly Shiite government to preside over an Arab state is utterly revolutionary. 
 Coming in the same week that the last Syrian troops withdrew from Lebanon, which is 40 percent Shiite, the developments in Iraq seemed likely to have repercussions that the Middle East will feel for some time to come -- in ways that even the sagest observers cannot foresee. 
 In the Arab world, Shiites have largely been second-class citizens since A.D. 656, when Hussein, a grandson of Muhammad, was tortured and beheaded after a climactic battle with the Sunnis. That social order persisted through Mongol invasions, the Ottoman Empire and British occupation, until now. 
 For Sunni Arabs, then, the triumph of the Iraqi Shiites is a calamity. The tables have been turned in a manner reminiscent of the South during Reconstruction, when former slaves not only were freed and granted civil rights, but also briefly won political power in some states. So one easily foreseen consequence of the Shiites' triumph could be a redoubling of the Sunni insurgents' efforts to disrupt and, ultimately, defeat the democratic government in Iraq. 
 Yet, even Jordan's progressive Sunni ruler, King Abdullah II, warned last year of a greater danger, a ''Shiite crescent'' of political power emanating from Iran and now Iraq, spreading from the Persian Gulf states to Syria and Lebanon, that could disrupt the balance of power in the Middle East. Before February 2005, 18 of the 21 Arab countries were ruled by Sunnis.
 The rise of the Shiites is normally ascribed to the American push to democratize the Middle East. But many Middle East experts and intelligence analysts, like George Friedman, author of ''America's Secret War,'' say it is more directly the result of the Bush administration's strategic planning for its global campaign against terrorism. The idea, they say, is to use regional threats like the Shiites to gain leverage over some of America's Sunni allies, especially Saudi Arabia, and force them to crack down on home-grown Islamic radicals and preachers. 
 According to that analysis, Washington was encouraged and not at all surprised when Saudi Shiites, about 10 to 15 percent of the kingdom's population, were emboldened by events in Iraq to demand some rights. But then came the assassination of a close Saudi ally, the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, which complicated the administration's plans. 
 The murder immediately threatened the stability of Syria -- not something the White House is seeking at this time -- because the Saudis deemed the Syrian Alawite regime to be responsible for it, and the Alawites are a somewhat esoteric offshoot of Shiism. Hence, the Saudi royal family, as Michael Young wrote in The Daily Star, an English-language Lebanese newspaper, is now eager for ''regime change in Damascus.'' That would both redress the crime and restore Syria's Sunni majority to power, tipping the regional scales back in favor of the Sunnis. 
 Syria is the largest and most immediate source of instability raised by the Shiite revival, but hardly the only one. Potential problems loom throughout the region: 
 Lebanon. Shiites are now the single largest ethnic bloc in a country traditionally dominated by Arab Sunnis and Christians. Hezbollah, the Shiite group Washington considers a terrorist organization, is one of the most strenuously anti-American forces in the Middle East, and, more troublingly for Lebanon, the country's only armed political party.
 With Syria now apparently out of the political picture, Lebanese now have begun to negotiate their political future, which will include elections that may well elevate Shiites to power. The picture is clouded, of course, by the presence of Hezbollah; most Lebanese are understandably unwilling to sit down and bargain with a militia, and it remains unclear whether the group will disarm or what political role it might play. 
 Bahrain. Sunnis have long governed here, although the nation is estimated to be 75 percent Shiite. To date, some Shiite activists report, the government has disguised the demographic imbalance by giving citizenship to Saudis who have tribal affiliations with the Bahraini Sunni elite.
 It is unlikely that the White House will push too hard in Bahrain, a strategic ally in the gulf, especially since the Saudis have a powerful interest in maintaining the status quo there and more than enough influence to enforce it.
 Saudi Arabia. Shiites make up only 10 to 15 percent of the population, but most of them live in the Eastern Province, where the kingdom's major oil fields are located. To the House of Saud, which not unreasonably sees enemies everywhere, a rebellious Shiite minority near the kingdom's one strategic asset would be a potential fifth column.
 Perhaps even more troubling for the Saudis, their official form of Islam, Wahhabism, regards Shiism as a heresy, so granting rights to the Shiites would be a de facto renunciation of Wahhabism. A Princeton history professor, Michael Scott Doran, wrote last year in Foreign Affairs that some Saudi hardliners ''are now arguing that the Shiite minority in Saudi Arabia is conspiring with the United States to destroy Islam.''
 Nonetheless, soon after the invasion of Iraq, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah received Shiite notables petitioning for religious freedom in a document called ''Partners in the Homeland.'' The petition, Mr. Doran wrote, could be ''as important for Saudi Arabia as Martin Luther King Jr.'s 'I Have a Dream' speech was for the United States.''
 In the complex and fluid politics of the Middle East, it is impossible to predict how these issues will play out. It seems plausible that the United States will one day be regarded by Shiites not as the Great Satan but as the Great Liberator, and that the new Shiite ascendancy will open the region to democracy and economic reform. 
 But it seems equally plausible that Washington, by stirring up long dormant hatreds and unleashing uncontrollable political firestorms, will ultimately be regarded as one in a line of powers that suffered painfully for the view that it had the answers to the region's problems.

HEADLINE: The Outer Limits Of National Debt

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
SOMETIMES, if you stand too close to a picture, you can't tell what it shows. That can be a particular challenge for economists, who spend their days up to their elbows in data. 
 Consider the budget deficit. As the United States runs large deficits year after year, the national debt increases. Some prominent analysts warn that debt levels are out of control and that an imminent, Argentina-like crisis is looming. Others say debt is simply not a problem. 
 Shouldn't economists be able to sort this one out?
 They could start with straightforward questions: How much can the federal government borrow, and how close is the nation to that limit?
 It's a pretty simple concept, really. If you have a mortgage, you probably remember checking with your lender to find out how much you could borrow. Your credit cards have limits, too. And companies face similar restrictions. Rare is the chief financial officer who borrows money without first checking her debt ratios and credit limits.
 But who can tell what the limit is for the federal government? Most experts have been content to answer the question this way: At some point, lenders will stop lending, and that's when we know we've hit the limit.
 Not very satisfying, is it?
 Of course, it's not as if someone can call the bank to check. But with a few simple tools, one can establish a rough sense of where American borrowing stands and how much headroom is left.
 Here's a way to approach the question: 
 Because the federal government borrows in the global credit market, it's not possible to check with all the participants to learn their limits. But the ability of any borrower to get credit depends on its ability to repay the money. So by looking at other countries that have stumbled into financial trouble, one can draw a few reasonable conclusions.
 One astounding example of national debt was that of Britain after World War II, when it owed debts representing about 250 percent of its gross domestic product. It's worth noting that Britain later paid down the debts to a level near 50 percent of G.D.P.; in contrast, more recently, Argentina hit the wall at around 65 percent.
 According to Moritz Kraemer, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor's in London and an expert on sovereign debt, it's not easy to exceed debt burdens of around 150 percent of gross domestic product. ''There are not many countries that can sustain debt at that level for any length of time,'' he has found.
 Of course, as the leading economy in the world, the United States has certain advantages over a smaller country in handling its debt burdens. And as Britain's experience shows, it is possible for debts to exceed temporarily the level of 150 percent of G.D.P. But at high debt levels, the risk of a lending crisis, perhaps prompted by recession or rising interest rates, becomes significant. And any Argentine will tell you that a lending crisis is worth avoiding.
 So assume that debt of 150 percent of G.D.P. is a sound limit for borrowing by the United States. It could probably borrow more, but that doesn't seem prudent, given the experience of other countries. Based on America's G.D.P. today, that translates to an $18 trillion debt ceiling.
 HOW close is the nation to that limit? It depends on what you count as debt.
 The most simplistic view counts only what the Treasury calls ''debt held by the public.'' That amount is $4.6 trillion, about a quarter of our prudent limit. That doesn't sound too bad.
 Unfortunately, it's not the whole story. The government counts an additional $3.2 trillion owed by some government agencies to others. It's tempting to ignore this. After all, so what if Uncle Sam owes himself money? But about $2 trillion of that amount represents the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. It's a good bet that the workers who have paid in those dollars expect to be repaid in full, with interest.
 If you count those trust funds as legitimate debts, you get to a current debt of $6.6 trillion. But that's not all. President Bush has been telling us about the looming crisis in Social Security. The problem is that the trust fund, large as it is, isn't big enough to cover the expected obligations ahead. 
 According to government figures, to make the Social Security trust fund big enough to cover its obligations, we'd have to pay in an additional $4 trillion or so today. And that's only for the next 75 years. To put Social Security on a sound basis indefinitely, significantly larger sums are needed. One can quibble about whether this amount is, strictly speaking, a debt, but it is certainly an obligation under current law. To reflect that, add the $4 trillion -- and our current debt stands at $10.6 trillion.
 Which brings us to Medicare, by far the largest of our future obligations. Because nearly everyone expects health care costs to keep rising faster than economic growth, the trustees of the Medicare fund warn that the nation faces an enormous shortfall. They report that the country would have to pay in $9 trillion today to make the trust fund big enough to cover its future obligations, and set aside an additional $21 trillion to cover supplementary obligations -- for example, the prescription drug benefit -- that lie outside the scope of the trust fund. Again, these are traditional 75-year figures; the amounts needed to put things on a sound basis indefinitely are even larger.
 Add up all the figures, including those for Medicare, and the aggregate debt is $40.6 trillion in present dollars, well over that prudent limit of $18 trillion.
 What is the upshot of all this debt? A look at the entire picture shows clearly that additional borrowing doesn't seem prudent. And while exceeding the nation's limits doesn't guarantee a credit crisis, it certainly highlights the risk.

For the United States, that would translate into a so-called sound debt limit of $18 trillion. Depending on the way debt is counted, current obligations may far exceed that figure.Total U.S. obligations: $40.6 trillionDebt held by the public: $4.6 trillionSocial Security and Medicare trust funds (government debt held as assets by the two trust funds): $2 trillionSocial Security shortfall*: $4 trillionMedicare Part A shortfall* (hospital insurance trust fund): $9 trillionMedicare supplemental obligations*: $21 trillion''Sound debt limit''150 percent of gross domestic product.$18 trillion*Amounts needed now to insure trust fund solvency for 75 years, according to the trustees of the fund.(Sources by Treasury Department

HEADLINE: Waste Not Wanted

BYLINE: By DAVID SCHARFENBERG

DATELINE: YORKTOWN 

 BODY:
THE flood was not of biblical proportions, but on that September night nearly six years ago, workers at the Yorktown Heights Water Pollution Control Plant could be forgiven for wondering if God was a little angry with them.
 It was the night Tropical Storm Floyd bore down so furiously on the region, and the defenders of the aging sewage treatment plant, situated in a flood plain, could do little to deflect the assault. Within hours, hundreds of thousands of gallons of raw and partly treated sewage had been washed into nearby Hallock's Mill Brook -- part of the region's watershed, which nine million residents of New York City and Westchester, Putnam, Orange and Ulster Counties rely on for drinking water.
 ''Everything happened too fast,'' said Edward Mahoney, assistant superintendent of the plant.
 The flood strengthened resolve in white, wealthy Yorktown to scrap the long-troubled plant and divert local sewage away from the watershed, pumping it seven miles west to a facility in multiethnic, blue-collar Peekskill. There it would be treated, dumped into the Hudson River and carried out to the Atlantic Ocean -- rather than back into the drinking-water supply, which many experts consider vulnerable to contamination, even by thoroughly treated sewage effluent. 
 The plan seemed simple enough, and in 2002 the New York City Department of Environmental Protection agreed to earmark millions of dollars for the so-called ''sewage diversion'' project. With County Executive Andrew J. Spano also expressing support, the project seemed destined to win approval from the county board of legislators.
 Three years later, its prospects seem bleak. Stalled by charges of environmental racism and beset by political infighting, it has not generated much action either by the governor's office or in New York City's environmental circles, even though water quality is at stake. Yorktown, meanwhile, remains reliant on an ever-creakier treatment plant, and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, concerned about persistent problems at the plant, has urged bickering local officials either to proceed with diversion or spend millions on an upgrade. 
 Among those being urged to act is Linda G. Cooper, Yorktown's supervisor. She supports the diversion plan and is fighting for its future. ''One never says never,'' she said, ''but this could be it.''
 The Yorktown facility is one of more than 100 treatment plants in the watershed, a 1,972-square-mile network of rivers, reservoirs and aqueducts that extends 125 miles north and west of the city.
 On a normal day, when the plants are not battling otherworldly storms and raw-sewage overflows, they are treating waste and dropping the effluent into the watershed. But the Environmental Protection Agency says even treated waste can generate trace amounts of suspected carcinogens and encourage outbreaks of waterborne diseases like giardiasis or cryptosporidiosis. 
 In addition, new research by scientists in the United States and Britain is raising questions about the impacts of long-term exposure to pharmaceuticals, insect repellent and other products that make their way into human waste, flow into sewage treatment plants and wind up in the water supply in trace quantities.
 Some scientists have cautioned against overplaying these threats. Runoff from streets and parking lots poses a bigger challenge than sewage treatment plants, they argue, and it would not make sense to raise serious alarms about the impacts of tiny amounts of Prozac or bug spray when so little is known.
 But experts starting with New York City's watershed inspector general, James M. Tierney, have argued for years that removing treated waste from the water supply is good public policy. And the top priority, all along, has been getting rid of the Yorktown plant, the largest and most troubled in the region.
 DREW CLAXTON, a Peekskill Democratic councilwoman with political ambitions, has done what she can to thwart that effort. An economist and statistician reared by a white mother and black stepfather at the height of the civil rights movement, she says she is acutely attuned to the impact of racism, both overt and subtle. 
 In a recent interview, Ms. Claxton, 49, put the diversion proposal in the second category. Adding at least 1.5 million gallons of waste a day to a sewage treatment plant that already generates odor complaints may not be part of a racist plot, she said, but it certainly has a discriminatory impact on the city.
 In 2000 Ms. Claxton founded a citizens group opposing the plan and reached out to environmental groups across the county. Some, like Riverkeeper, leaned toward diversion, concerned about the presence of treated waste in the water supply.
 But critics like the Sierra Club noted that treatment plants in the watershed area have sharp limits on growth, which effectively discourages development of high-density buildings like malls and condominiums. Scrapping a plant and diverting sewage out of the watershed, they argued, would simply open the door to sprawl. 
 Officials promised to place caps on growth, but environmentalists saidpoliticians or lawsuit-happy developers could undo any curbs in the future.
 Ms. Claxton also won support from N.A.A.C.P. representatives in Peekskill and in Yonkers, which was resisting a more modest plan to handle sewage from affluent New Castle. And when Suzannah Glidden, a New York environmentalist, reached out to Julian Bond, an old high school classmate who is chairman of the N.A.A.C.P.'s national board of directors, the movement to halt diversion finally achieved critical mass. 
 ''It just seemed to be a kind of classic environmental tragedy,'' said Mr. Bond in a recent telephone interview. ''These things happen all over the country. You've got something you don't want -- put it in the black people's neighborhood.''
 By 2001, Ms. Claxton was starting a second bid, this one successful, for a Peekskill City Council seat. Activists on both sides of the issue agree that the diversion plan focused her campaign, bringing racial-justice concerns to the fore and playing a role in stalling the project. Ms. Claxton's allies find much to celebrate in that, while supporters of diversion take a more cynical view. 
 They say the charges of environmental racism that gained currency at the time are unfair, given that effluent from the Yorktown plant currently flows into a portion of the watershed serving 186,000 Westchester residents, some of them black and Hispanic, and hundreds of thousands of low-income minority residents of Manhattan and the Bronx.
 But they do not limit their critique to Ms. Claxton and her Democratic allies. They also say Peekskill Republicans have turned up the volume on their opposition to the plan, so as not to be outflanked by the Democrats.
 Larry Schwartz, a Democrat who is deputy county executive, says George Oros, the Republican legislator representing Peekskill, was willing to cut a deal before diversion became a cause celebre, asking in early 2000 for $5.1 million in sewer projects in Peekskill in exchange for agreeing to accept diversion from Yorktown. 
 An April 14, 2000, memorandum from Mr. Schwartz to several other county officials lends credence to this account. In it Mr. Schwartz urges several county officials to ''review the 'shopping list' that was submitted to me by George Oros in order to get Peekskill's cooperation'' on diversion and itemizes 11 local projects he wanted money for.
 Mr. Oros says he recalls no such list and suggests that if there were any deal on the table, it was proposed by Mr. Schwartz in an effort to buy off local leaders. Like many Peekskill-area Republicans, Mr. Oros says he has always firmly opposed diversion because it would eat up precious capacity at the Peekskill plant and curb growth in a city trying to emerge from years of economic depression. 
 By early 2003, the campaign against diversion was in full stride. And when the county held a series of public hearings on the proposal, residents of Peekskill and Yonkers packed the meetings to voice their opposition. 
 That spring, Mr. Oros and a group of black county legislators opposed to diversion were able to block a vote on the environmental review required to move the project forward.
 ALARMED at the developments in Westchester and convinced that diversion was vital to water quality, Christopher O. Ward, then commissioner of New York City's Department of Environmental Protection, reached out to Gov. George E. Pataki, a former Peekskill mayor, and the state's Department of Environmental Conservation to ask for help brokering a deal, according to current and former city employees and Ms. Cooper, the Yorktown supervisor. 
 But a conservation department spokeswoman, Maureen Wren, said in a recent interview that the state was eager for local officials to deal with the Yorktown plant's problems, which include excess ammonia and copper in effluent. The method -- diversion or upgrading -- is strictly up to them, she added. 
 Michael Kaplowitz, a Democratic county legislator representing Yorktown, Somers and New Castle and a leading proponent of diversion, sees the matter as more than a local concern. With the safety of the region's water supply hanging in the balance, he said, the governor's failure to intervene in his own backyard has been a major disappointment. ''It makes us wonder where the leadership is at the top,'' he said.
 Eileen Burke knows as well as anyone the agony of the plan's slow decline. Ms. Burke, 43, a homemaker, and her husband, Michael, own one of the thousand or so Yorktown homes that have been forced to remain on septic systems, many of them old and leaching sewage into the watershed, while the diversion debate drags on.
 Strict watershed regulations forbid new hookups to the overworked Yorktown sewage plant; the Burkes can only hope diversion becomes a reality, so they can install a sewer system.
 In the meantime, they say, they have sunk $14,000 into septic system repairs over the last 11 years, worrying constantly that smelly, soggy patches in the yard may ruin family events and pose health risks for their three children. ''Every penny we put into the ground is a hardship and every flush of the toilet is a hardship,'' said Mrs. Burke, standing in her backyard on a recent afternoon.
 Pressure from her and others has kept Yorktown politicians like Linda Cooper in pursuit of diversion, and today they are taking a new tack.
 Ms. Cooper says the town is working with the state to commission a study that will lay out, in great detail, both the plant upgrade and diversion options. She expressed hope that the study would make the definitive case for diversion.
 Some of the likeminded add, privately, that they are setting aside the smaller New Castle-to-Yonkers diversion proposal in the hope of winning support from Yonkers politicians who have been implacable foes of diversion in the past.
 But to break the impasse, diversion proponents may need help from New York City elected officials and environmentalists who so far have paid the issue little attention. 
 James F. Gennaro, the New York City councilman who heads the committee on environmental protection, says he has always supported diversion but has had a hard time getting his colleagues interested. He adds that he has recently been working to persuade Adolfo Carrion Jr., the Bronx borough president, that city leaders should throw more political weight behind the project.
 But whatever they decide, if history is any indicator, New York City and Westchester residents could still be wondering for years what, exactly, is in their water.

The Pall in Peekskill
PEEKSKILL
 WHEN Thomas Tinsley drives home on a warm summer evening, he does not anticipate the smell of freshly baked bread or mowed grass.
 Mr. Tinsley, 71, a retired food worker who lives in the Dunbar Heights public housing complex here, waits for something not quite as pleasant to reach his nose: the stench wafting from the Peekskill Wastewater Treatment Plant nearby.
 ''You're driving in and the first thing you get is that odor,'' he said, seated on his couch on a recent afternoon. ''You don't want that stuff in your car.'' 
 Mr. Tinsley, who has lived at Dunbar Heights for 43 years, said residents had been coping with odors off and on for as long as he could remember, closing windows or cutting barbecues short to avoid the smell. And, like most tenants, he is unhappy about plans to pump in an additional 1.5 million gallons of waste per day, or more, from Yorktown. 
 That concern has pushed a handful of residents to protest the plan -- but just a handful. ''I think they're intimidated or too busy with their lives,'' said John Gilleo, 47, president of the Dunbar Heights Tenants Association. ''You figure, you're low-income, they're not going to listen to us.''
 Westchester officials say they are listening to the Dunbar Heights tenants and other neighbors. Having sunk $2 million into odor-abatement projects thus far, officials are proposing $13.5 million more in plant improvements, including odor-control elements like tank covers, said Adam J. Zabinski, first deputy commissioner of the county's department of environmental facilities.
 But at this point, most tenants say they are resigned to the lingering smells. ''I still do what I've got to do,'' said Leonard Holliman, 44, a bus driver who lives in Dunbar Heights with his wife and two of his children. ''It doesn't affect my life.'' DAVID SCHARFENBERG

HEADLINE: Outsourcing Revisited

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Outsourcing as a Sign of Strength'' (Armchair M.B.A., April 24) was about as concise and clear a defense of outsourcing as I have read. But several questions remain unanswered about the bad consequences of outsourcing:
 Do chief executives think about the long-term social consequences of their short-term economic decisions?
 What do C.E.O.'s suppose happens to tossed-out workers who cannot climb up the employment pyramid to those presumably more secure high-skill jobs?
 Why are there no costs to the corporation for disrupting the economic well-being of workers? Their livelihoods and plans for the future may be ripped to shreds by a decision to outsource their jobs. 
 A corporation is not only a mechanism for delivering ''value'' to customers and shareholders. It should also fulfill all the obligations of good citizenship.

HEADLINE: Little Giant

BYLINE: By Toby Cecchini

 BODY:
In the beer world, the humble brew has always enjoyed lucrative cachet. Pabst Blue Ribbon still flouts its Milwaukee pedigree even though it closed down its plant there years ago and is currently made in Texas. Rheingold sold its name and is now being remarketed as the Brooklyn underdog that it once was. But the latest downmarket darling, suddenly asked for everywhere -- from underground parties to serious brew pubs -- also happens to be America's oldest: with no advertising and a broken-nose work ethic, Yuengling is taking its place as a small-town survivor.
 Sunk in the coal-mining hills of Schuylkill County, Pottsville, Pa., is a place that wears the tattered clothes of better times. Large stone buildings, mostly unoccupied, line the streets. Near the top of a steep climb up Mahantongo Street, the old D.G. Yuengling & Son Brewery looms over the town, an improbable hub of spit-shined industry. Yuengling was founded in 1829 as the Eagle Brewery and kept afloat during Prohibition by brewing ''near beer'' -- what is now called nonalcoholic -- and ''pharmaceutical'' beer sanctioned by the government. It has always been owned by the Yuengling family, now in its fifth and sixth generations in the form of Dick Yuengling and his four daughters, who all work at the brewery. 
 In the last 10 years, Yuengling's annual sales have grown by about 25 percent, a remarkable resurgence for a beer long ago dismissed as a reliable but fusty regional brew. This initially led to a lot of headaches for Dick Yuengling, but the risks he has taken appear to have been well rewarded. The company has a five-year-old plant on the outskirts of Pottsville and another in Tampa, Fla., that it took over from Stroh's. The little guy may not exactly be taking on the giants, but he is at least shouldering beside them.
 Entering the monolithic red-brick brewery through a carved walnut door, I climbed up a set of flagstone steps that were worn in the middle from nearly 180 years of use. Beside them ran an antique escalator with an oak chair affixed to a massive chain, once installed for a Victorian-era scion. At the top, outside a glass and walnut-partitioned office, was an old, weathered sign stating that the company was not accepting applications for employment. Turning the heavy brass knob and forging ahead was to feel what generations of unemployed miners in this town must have felt, hat in hand. 
 I found Dick Yuengling in the office, a bull of a man in jeans, boots and a faded work jacket. He advanced toward me and growled, ''You from New York?'' I wasn't sure I should say yes. On the brief drive from the old, chaotically picturesque brewery to the enormous, immaculate, state-of-the-art one just outside town, Yuengling held forth behind the wheel of a 1980's Buick sedan that belonged to his mother. Yuengling is a chain-smoking dervish, a top-down capo straddling both plants and the one in Tampa, as well. He is up for the early shift, naps midday and returns to oversee the night crew. He keeps no office, preferring to elbow aside some papers on his daughter Jennifer's desk when he needs one. Consequently we were both riding on piles of cardboard, calendars and poster tubes, empty Vantage cartons and burger wrappers. That his car is like a teenager's is somewhat appropriate; at 61, Yuengling exudes the feckless ebullience of a slightly weathered quarterback. He seems as amazed by the current success of his label as anyone: ''Twenty years ago we were almost out of business, hanging on by a thread,'' he said. ''There used to be dozens of these little breweries around here. Every town had at least one. Pottsville had three at one point. We just kept picking up a few more accounts every time another one closed: Reading, Allentown. We're just the last guy standing.''
 Yuengling likens the new generation of microbrewers to his own generation of regional brewers. ''We all knew one another,'' he said. ''Those guys were friendly with my father and my grandfather, and they all shared knowledge to some degree. But each one had its own flavor, and that's what was great. That's what these young guys are doing now.'' In principle he applauds the movement, but he acknowledges that he is in an unusual niche between those grassroots brewers and the huge producers. ''I had no choice; it was either expand or sell out.''
 When he purchased the brewery from his father and uncle in 1985, he recreated a rich, slightly amber lager the brewery hadn't made in decades to take advantage of the spike in lighter-style beers. The company expanded its market to Philadelphia, and that's when the deluge began. Younger urban drinkers gravitated to its old-school feel and tenaciously low price. By the early 90's, the company was racing to supply New York and Boston as well. ''We were turning 620,000 barrels a year out of this old plant,'' Yuengling recalled unfondly, his feet up on his daughter's desk. ''Running the line 19, 20 hours a day; things were breaking down, the managers were pulling their hair out. It was crazy!''
 Faced with overwhelming demand and courted by several larger companies, including Anheuser-Busch, Yuengling queried his daughters to see if they were interested in carrying on the company. When all four agreed, he decided against selling and made a plan that could have proved catastrophic. He closed off distribution outside Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware until he could build a new brewery, which would take three to four years. To New Yorkers and other East Coast converts, it seemed that this tasty small-town beer had magically appeared, and just as quickly evaporated. I learned of it as a Philly secret from a friend attending Temple University's medical school in the early 90's and was elated when I first found it in New York. However, when I tried to order it for my own bar, Passerby, the distributor told me that he couldn't get enough. I recall thinking, Who stops selling beer because too many people want it?
 But the gamble has paid off handsomely. Though few seem to know what the holdup was, grateful customers have a long memory. The three plants produced more than 1.4 million barrels last year. The lager is the star, accounting for 80 percent of the production; standouts among its other brews are a rich porter, a lovely lighter beer called Premium and a true pale ale called Chesterfield Ale. Availability outside Yuengling's home market can still be spotty, but all of them are on the shelves at 
 B & E Quality Beverage on West 23rd Street, among other serious retailers.
 With the heat off for now and the beer rolling out happily, Yuengling bragged that he sold more beer in 10 states than Samuel Adams did in 48. His daughter Jennifer, the plant coordinator and apparent future of the company, smiled cautiously and rolled her eyes, acknowledging that even in a family business drenched in history, the work was all ahead for her and her sisters.

There are no clocks at Temple Bar, no visible windows, only heavy velvet drapes, dark Honduran mahogany, spotlights, club rugs, comfortable stools. There is no sign out front on Lafayette Street, nothing to alert passersby to the notion of the pleasures within. There is only a piece of art stuck to the brick -- a chameleon's skeleton -- and a stout green door.
 A hint of spring may be in the air, a tang of the city carried through the neighborhood on a breeze, but temporal details do not intrude upon this bar. Inside there is only the faint smell of luxury, furniture polish mixed with bourbon and the Chanel on the woman down the bar. That and the sound of ice in a shaker, the welcome redress of a manhattan served straight up, no fruit. 
 Temple opened in 1989, the child of an oncologist restaurateur and his artist wife, and soon developed a reputation among a certain subset of Manhattan affluence as a destination in what was then an unreconstructed neighborhood north of the art markets of SoHo. It had a run, as the boys from Wall Street would put it, the place packed three deep down the zigzag bar and the back room crowded with a particular kind of youthful beauty. People went to Temple on rivers of silk, aboard rafts of Italian leather. They drank cocktails the size of milk bottles and winked at the world.
 And when recession came to them a year later, they drank some more. Liquor is a good thing to sell in a bear market, and a bar where time does not matter is an excellent place to do it. Things scudded along like that for a good long while, not that anyone was marking the years. Hardly anyone, anyway. 
 A flickering memory from the middle of that stretch: 
 Early evening, and a woman was drinking a Champagne cocktail beneath the glow of a pin light. Her friends smiled, toasted the occasion of her birth, tamped Camels against the marble inlay on the mahogany bar. Cigarette smoke began to swirl about her head in the manner of a scarf. Later there would be dinner at a restaurant uptown, 30 years on earth celebrated by oysters followed by steaks. In the meantime, there were more smiles, another cocktail, a few more smokes. The whole room glowed.
 The bartender that night was a kind and handsome fellow named Tony Ray, who came to New York in 1979 to dance, an avocation he still pursues a couple of times a week. To otherwise support himself, he took a job waiting tables at Elephant and Castle, a charming downtown restaurant that was the oncologist's first venture in the hospitality game. It is a job that Ray still has, though after the owner, George Schwarz, and his wife, the artist Kiki Kogelnik, opened Temple a decade later, he took on responsibilities there as well. Currently, he tends Temple Bar with a benevolent efficiency on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday nights.
 ''Temple hasn't ever changed,'' Ray said. ''It's just the same.'' 
 Which is not entirely true. Waitresses and fellow barkeeps have come and gone. There is no smoking. Ketel One vodka has given way in the public imagination to Grey Goose, and now to Belvedere (though the generic cosmopolitan, made with fresh juice, is still a best seller). The kitchen in back has closed, and the brief menu of bar snacks now comes from yet another of Dr. Schwarz's holdings, the NoHo Star up the block, sprinted through a basement tunnel by busboys young enough to have parents who had the same jobs.
 And Kiki Kogelnik, who designed the place, died in 1997. Her famous pin lights have been exchanged for wider spots, which fuzz at the edges of their beams. It makes the bar seem at once older and a trifle brighter than it was before.
 Ray belies this, though, standing with a dancer's grace behind the bar. He is out of Minnesota 25 years now, but looks for all the world just as he did that birthday night a decade ago, pouring drinks for those who have traveled to see the beauty of his bar and who find themselves suspended somewhere between drinks and more drinks, between comfort and joy.
 The bar seemed quiet, save for the low rumble of the Lexington Avenue subway in the tunnel beneath the street. Ray shrugged, offered a shy smile. It was a Tuesday night, and though a clock might have read 1 a.m., it was barely 6. ''It's a cycle,'' he said. ''It's not the business.''
 The door swung inward, and customers began to arrive.

Manhattan

4 ounces bourbon
3/4 ounce sweet vermouth
5 drops bitters.
 In a cocktail shaker, pour the ingredients over ice and stir. (Do not shake, as the bitters will make the drink unattractively cloudy.) Strain into a chilled martini glass -- or two!

Jennifer Steinhauer
''It made me a snob toward commercial perfume because it smells so good,'' says Jennifer Steinhauer on the marriage of essential oils and entrees in ''Of the Essence'' (Page 88), as presided over by the Berkeley-based perfumer Mandy Aftel and the San Francisco chef Daniel Patterson. (When she confided to Patterson that she baked almost entirely from ''Joy of Cooking,'' ''he was completely appalled.'') Steinhauer reports on the New York economy for The Times (which isn't as exhausting as her previous assignment as City Hall bureau chief, but, she says, ''this isn't a marabou-slipper job''). While in the Bay Area, Steinhauer also visited Boulette's Larder (Page 22), a cafe and store that caters to demanding cooks. Though she enjoyed the West Coast, Steinhauer says she draws much of her inspiration from New York, where the ''neighborhoods are a constant inspiration for stories -- and places to eat.''

Phillip Toledano
''I love the idea that there are secret things happening in apartment buildings,'' says the photographer Phillip Toledano, who went to Brooklyn, Paris and Berlin to capture the underground dining clubs in ''Psst . . . Alice Waters Sent Me'' (Page 80). After a decade working as an advertising art director on accounts like JetBlue and Coca-Cola, Toledano found photography as a second career three years ago, and he now shoots for Wallpaper, City and Surface. His first book, ''Bankrupt'' (Twin Palms Publishers), which came out last year, takes a look at offices vacated by insolvent companies. ''It's like Pompeii: sometimes it was like they'd just left, and sometimes it was barren,'' he says. ''I went into one, and everything was gone except a deflated 'Happy Birthday' balloon.''

Paula Disbrowe
Upon relocating to the Lone Star State from Manhattan with her boyfriend three years ago, the writer and chef Paula Disbrowe immersed herself in local trappings. ''With our first paycheck, we got our boots,'' she says. ''Third was our pickup. Horses came a few checks later.'' In 2001, Disbrowe was researching an article on a bakery in Fredericksburg, Tex., when she stopped in at the nearby Hart & Hind Fitness Ranch in Rio Frio. The chef had just quit, and she was offered the job. Before her flight home, she called her boyfriend (now fiance) and asked him what he thought of the title ''ranch manager.'' ''I like to tell people Martha Stewart and I both made life-changing phone calls from the San Antonio airport,'' she jokes. For this issue, Disbrowe followed the McKay Brothers band as they ate and played their way across the state (Page 92). ''The food they like and their music are sort of the authentic, vanishing Texas,'' she says. Disbrowe is writing two cookbooks for early 2006: ''Cowgirl Cuisine'' (HarperCollins) and a collaboration with the New Orleans chef Susan Spicer (Knopf).

Toby Cecchini
''This life is such a freak show, if you wrote it as fiction, it wouldn't be quite as hairy,'' Toby Cecchini (near left) says of his 2003 barkeep memoir, ''Cosmopolitan: A Bartender's Life.'' For this issue, Cecchini, a contributor to The Times Magazine, uncovered two mysteries: the resurgence of Yuengling lager (Page 44) and the origins of maraschino cherries (Page 60). (The cherry liqueur is pictured at far left.) Interviewing the down-to-earth brewery owner Dick Yuengling was a welcome change for Cecchini, who also writes feature stories for GQ. ''Vintners always try to squeeze themselves into this concept of what people think they should be, wearing ascots, et cetera,'' he says. ''It's always refreshing to talk to brewers, because they're very seldom putting on airs.'' When not writing about alcohol, Cecchini is serving it twice a week at Passerby, the Chelsea bar that he co-owns.

Charlie Welch
''People threw out words like 'Alice in Wonderland,' 'lush' and 'organic,''' says Charlie Welch, who created the sets for the portfolio ''To Market'' (Page 70). Welch, who sees his work as a kind of on-the-spot collage, honed his design skills at Barneys New York, where every December he helped give the windows their holiday cheer. ''I had a lot of fun there and learned a lot -- and a lot of good tricks,'' he says. From there it was uptown to the highly visual world of Ralph Lauren. In between, Welch discovered set design. ''It kind of found me,'' he refutes. These days, a large portion of Welch's time is spent finding the right props -- in this case, plants from California and chickens from upstate New York. While some items may be put into storage afterward (and others eaten), Welch searches for people with gardens to take any leftover greenery. After the shoot wrapped, he says, ''a lot of the plants went to good homes.'' JAMIE WALLIS

HEADLINE: High Priest of the Pasture

BYLINE: By Todd S. Purdum

 BODY:
The little dirt road is called Pure Meadows Lane, and to follow it across the slatted wooden cattle guard over the Middle River and into the 550 acres of Polyface farm in Swoope, Va., is to enter a peaceable kingdom, out of time and up-to-date. The oldest wing of the snug white clapboard farmhouse up ahead was built in 1750, and Polyface is just a newfangled name for an idea so old-fashioned as to be revolutionary. In fact, the man who owns and runs this farm may well be Virginia's most multifaceted agrarian since Thomas Jefferson. The big sign above his thrumming computer and cluttered desk reads, ''Joel Salatin: Lunatic Farmer,'' but he is crazy like a fox.
 For 44 years on the western edge of the Shenandoah Valley, three generations of Salatins (of which he's the middle) have raised grass-fed livestock on rough and hilly land without recourse to an ounce of chemical fertilizer or a fistful of seed, in close touch with the soil, the seasons and themselves, using methods meant to mimic nature. The result is lush fields of unusual greenness -- even in the sodden melting snow of a late winter morning -- and pork, eggs and poultry of uncommon cleanliness and indescribably good taste. 
 Along the way, Salatin, a 47-year-old onetime newspaper reporter who calls himself a ''Christian libertarian environmental capitalist,'' has become, in many ways, the high priest of the pasture. He is one of the natural-food movement's most prolific authors, having written numerous articles and five popular how-to books with titles like ''Family Friendly Farming''; his latest is ''Holy Cows and Hog Heaven: The Food Buyer's Guide to Farm Friendly Food'' (Polyface, 2004). He has inspired scores of family farmers to adopt his techniques for raising beef, pork and poultry and attracted admiring visitors from around the world. His services as a motivational speaker and educator are in high demand wherever organic farmers and foodies gather to talk shop, from the University of California at Berkeley to the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture in Pocantico Hills, N.Y.
 In his wide, webbed suspenders and used service-station shirt, Salatin is part Louis Bromfield and part John the Baptist. And like Bromfield, the mid-20th-century novelist and farmer who was bold enough to doubt ''that the impulse of our time toward regimentation, centralization, mechanization and industrialism necessarily represented progress,'' he is a rebel -- and an evangelist -- at heart. He is also a red-blooded, robust rebuttal to the notion that the sustainable-food movement is a preoccupation of a pampered and unrealistic elite. Nothing could be further from his business philosophy or personal life. With his wife, Teresa, 47; their children, Daniel, 23, and Rachel, 18; daughter-in-law, Sheri, 25; baby grandson, Travis; and Joel's 81-year-old mother, Lucille, Salatin inhabits an ecosystem straight out of Ecclesiastes: there is a season and a time to every purpose. Nothing is wasted. Everything matters, and everyone works, including the four trusty barn cats, diligent mousers all. The farm is pretty, but not precious, and Salatin has mud on his boots and dirt on his hands, ''the happiest of men,'' as Bromfield wrote, ''for he inhabits a world that is full of wonder and excitement over which he rules as a small god.''
 Salatin's own description of his mission is at once humble and grand. ''We don't aspire to an empire,'' he said over a lunch of Teresa's hearty soup (made from their frozen beef chuck) in their knotty-pine kitchen, where a log the size of a small child was ablaze in the big fireplace. ''What we aspire to is to have the best food available.'' And by all evidence, they are succeeding. Their approach is deceptively simple, relying on age-old precepts of organic agriculture, up-to-the-minute technology and, most of all, Salatin's ingenuity. He eschews the government's seal of approval, because he distrusts the bureaucracy and disdains the large-scale officially ''organic'' 
 farms that he said have ''compromised the movement's values'' in favor of mass production. He describes his methods as ''beyond organic'' and has pioneered techniques that admiring colleagues and competitors describe as above reproach.
 ''He's not following anybody's blueprint,'' said Jo Robinson, an expert on the advantages of raising grass-fed livestock, the principal writer for eatwild.com and the author of ''Pasture Perfect: The Far-Reaching Benefits of Choosing Meat, Eggs and Dairy Products From Grass-Fed Animals'' (Vashon Island Press, 2004). ''He's not going back to the old model. There's nothing in county extension or old-fashioned ag science that really informs him. He is just looking totally afresh at how to maximize production in an integrated system on a holistic farm. He's just totally innovative.''
 Salatin's secret is the grass, and it is in the pasture that everything begins and ends. He believes that every square yard of sward should contain at least 40 varieties of plants, and he calls his fields a ''salad bar,'' a riot of fescues and clovers and earthworms churning the soil. Cattle graze freely on a patch of this super-rich pasture, held in by an electrified wire. Every day or so, they are moved to a new patch, and a succession of chickens (or turkeys, in season) are moved into the plot that the cows just left. Both laying chickens and broilers -- raised for their meat -- have portable shelters for shade and are protected from predators by portable webbed polyethylene fencing interlaced with electrified wire. Buried, pond-fed plastic pipes channel pressurized water, virtually anywhere, on demand. The chickens dig through fresh cowpatties for nutritious grubs and worms, and then scratch the manure into the dirt, aerating the soil and creating compost, so the cycle of growth can begin all over again.
 In winter, the approach is, if anything, even more ingenious. Cattle are sheltered in open-sided barns -- with hand-hewn log poles and timbers milled from the Salatins' oak trees. They rest on a thick bed of straw and are fed hay in V-shaped troughs designed by Joel to be raised and lowered on ropes and pulleys. Every couple of days, fresh straw is tossed onto the barn floor, where the cattle each deposit an average of 50 pounds of manure and urine a day, and the feed troughs are raised to keep pace with the rising straw on the floor. As the pile gets higher, sawdust, wood chips and whole shelled corn are mixed in. The result is a sweetly decomposing heap that gives off heat to keep the cattle warm and no odor worse than the pleasant dampness of a breast-fed baby's diaper. Then the cows are turned out, and the pigs (which in summer forage freely on the pasture's wooded hillsides and are moved around with more electric fencing) come in, rooting around through the layers of straw for the nuggets of fermenting corn. Voila: more aerated compost to be spread over the pasture when spring comes. Joel calls these living machines his ''pig-aerators'' and proudly notes that, unlike most farm equipment, which depreciates, rusts and costs money to repair or replace, they actually appreciate, get fatter and bring a fine price at slaughter, while doing work for which only their own internal-combustion engine is needed.
 All over the farm, some version or another of this system prevails. When Daniel Salatin was 8, he decided he wanted to raise rabbits. He got a book and went to work, while Joel devised a plan for waist-high cages, suspended over the dirt floor of the airy, sunlit, Quonset-style structures where the egg-laying chickens are raised in winter. The rabbit droppings, notoriously high in noxious ammonia, fall onto the straw, where hundred of chickens pick through them and scratch them into -- what else? -- harmless compost. There is a cacophony of clucking and scratching and pecking, but only the soft scent of feathers and fur. ''You don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water,'' Salatin said simply. ''There's a big difference between industrializing production of tractors and industrializing production of food. We like technology, but we really like technology that allows us to do better what nature does itself.''
 That philosophy has made Salatin ''sort of the high prophet of sustainable family farming,'' said Fred Walters, the editor of AcresUSA, the nation's oldest monthly magazine on sustainable agriculture, who has often published Salatin's articles. ''I like that he aims for low-tech, simple systems. While conventional agriculture is trying to make agriculture a factory or a physical system, in the end it's a biological system: there's life involved. Joel recognizes the life behind the system. And in doing so, he's created a model that can save the family farm, where people don't have to have thousands of acres and millions of dollars of debt.''
 If anyone knows how hard it is to make a go of family farming, it's Salatin. His grandfather, an avid backyard gardener and beekeeper in Indiana, was an early devotee of J.I. Rodale, the founder of regenerative organic gardening. In 1961, Salatin's parents bought the land that would become Polyface after losing a farm they had started in Venezuela to political turmoil there. They began raising cattle using organic methods, but decided that, at least until the mortgage was paid off, they could not make a living on the farm, so Joel's father worked as an accountant for other farmers while his mother taught high school physical education.
 In high school, Joel began his own business raising chickens. He and Teresa, who grew up on a nearby farm, were sweethearts and went off to Bob Jones University, the fundamentalist Christian school in South Carolina, where she majored in home economics and he in English. They married in 1980, but Joel said: ''I didn't really see a way to make a living on the farm. I always loved writing. I was the guy who won the D.A.R. essay contest and things like that, and it was the era of Watergate, and I decided I would be the next Woodward and Bernstein, and then retire to the farm.''
 So he took a job in Staunton, eight miles from home, at The News Leader (''The Daily Misprint,'' he calls it now), and Teresa worked in a fabric store. But he grew tired of having his stories spiked when they offended the local powers that be and decided to try farming full time. Joel and Teresa lived in an apartment in the attic of his parents' farmhouse on $300 a month. They had a $50 car and produced their own meat, milk and butter on the farm. Teresa canned applesauce and made bread. They bought their clothes in thrift stores and spent perhaps $50 a week on groceries, mostly for things like shampoo and detergent. ''I always said if I could figure out a way to grow Kleenex and toilet paper on trees, we could pull the plug on society,'' Joel said. When the children came, Teresa schooled them at home, at small desks in the upstairs hallway, and Joel's parents moved into a mobile home a few yards away, where his widowed mother still lives. At 19, Daniel became the president of the state chapter of 4-H, and last year he built his own house, with lumber from the farm and some help from neighbors, on the hillside above his parents' home. Rachel is now at the local community college, interested in culinary training and interior design.
 Year by year, as Joel improvised his novel techniques and Teresa kept the books, the farm began to prosper. Now it harvests 30,000 dozen eggs, 10,000 to 12,000 broilers, 100 head of cattle, 250 hogs, 800 turkeys and 600 rabbits a year -- as well as a smattering of blackberries, grapes, vegetables and tree fruit mostly for home use. For some years, it has been classified as a commercial farm under the United States Agriculture Department's definition, meaning its gross annual sales exceed $250,000 (Polyface grosses $350,000). The average net income for such farms nationwide is $156,324, and Salatin said Polyface's runs about that, which he said is proof positive that sustainable farming is not some rarefied niche business serving elite consumers but a viable way to keep family farms together while producing healthy food in harmony with the environment.
 Patrick Martins, the president and a co-founder of Heritage Foods USA, an online market clearinghouse for heirloom and artisanal foods, said Salatin has succeeded in part because he is unusually articulate but mostly because he can back up his compelling talk with simple methods, low overhead and equipment costs and indisputable results: ''He is a real beacon for farmers all over the place, and yet it comes from how successful he is on the most local of levels.''
 Organic farming accounts for less than 1 percent of the country's agricultural output, or $393 million in sales of the total $207 billion in 2002, the last year for which comparative data is available. Of 2.1 million farmers, just 12,000 were making certified organic products. But Keith J. Collins, the Agriculture Department's longtime chief economist, said the sector is growing fast. ''A lot of people doing what this guy's doing are doing something that adds value in terms of what some consumers want,'' he said. ''Maybe it's quality in taste, maybe it's quality in the way it's produced. How much bigger can this become in American agriculture? I don't really know the answer. I think there's certainly a lot of scope for it to grow.''
 The Salatins work hard to keep prices more like a supermarket's than a specialty store's by cutting out middlemen wherever possible and eliminating anything that smacks of fancy packaging. Many customers buy directly from the no-frills on-farm sales office, where a giant walk-in freezer holds the inventory. A perfect six-pound chicken; a dozen bright-orange-yolked eggs; a 2.5 pound bone-in pork roast; a pound of sweet Italian sausage; a pound of chicken livers; and two New York strips all cost just under $50 on my recent visit. Restaurant accounts are served by a wholesaler, and every six to eight weeks, a Salatin delivery van takes food to seven ''buying clubs'' in Virginia and Maryland, where neighbors come with coolers to pick up their custom orders. The Salatins ship nothing by mail, both because it would be too complicated and because they want customers elsewhere to patronize their local farmers.
 Elaine Lindholm, the communications director for the Virginia Agriculture Department, with which Salatin has tangled repeatedly, seemed to go out of her way to avoid provoking him, saying, ''He provides a very valuable service.'' But she added: ''His is a specialty-niche market. Not everyone could do it. Not everyone would want to do it.''
 The Salatins see such talk as defeatist. But they concede that many of their own neighbors share that view, though they make no better or steadier income. ''They think we're nuts but try to get along with us,'' Teresa said.
 Salatin himself makes no secret of his feelings about the agribusiness bureaucracy: he hates it. A favorite line is, ''Everything I want to do is illegal,'' and he will readily regale a visitor with tales of his travails in keeping the right to process his own chickens in an immaculate, open-air backyard operation (Virginia argued that it was ''inherently unsanitary'' because it didn't have walls). He bemoans the fact that federal meat-processing regulations force him to send his cattle and hogs to commercial locker-plants and thus surrender control over the final stage of a process throughout which he has tended them with such care. (He thinks the government should allow mobile abattoirs that could do on-farm slaughtering for small-scale operations.) At a time when homeland-security experts warn of the vulnerabilities of a food-supply system based on large-scale production, centralized processing and long-distance transportation, he complains that politicians of both parties call for only ''more centralization.''
 ''Not only is there not government support for what we do,'' he said, ''there is a profound antagonism at every level for what we do.''
 Salatin is not easy to pigeonhole. He speaks with equal contempt of the early American settlers' disregard for Native American agriculture and modern ''gene splicing, irradiation and all sorts of things we don't understand.'' He sprinkles his book with the wisdom of motivational gurus like Stephen Covey and Zig Ziglar and sensible child-rearing advice about the painful dangers of ''fussy dads,'' who drive their children from their farms (and from their arms). He concedes that his views are too Christian for some liberals, too environmentalist for many conservatives, too libertarian for conformists. He greets his hogs with a tender ''Hey, piggles,'' and confesses to an occasional pang when it comes time to kill an especially kindly old cow, but he speaks of the cycles of life in terms that any Eastern mystic might understand. Just as agriculture was the last occupation to enter the industrial age, Salatin believes it will be the last to leave it, and not without a fight. ''I would love to sit down on Oprah Winfrey or Tim Russert, across from Don Tyson, and ask him whether it matters if a chicken can express her chickenness!'' he exclaimed at one point.
 Teresa interrupted with a dry ''Of course not!'' but Joel continued, undeterred. ''Because as soon as you posit any moral constraints, then you have to be able to articulate them.''
 Salatin has no trouble articulating the Joelness of Joel. ''I see myself today as Sitting Bull,'' he said, ''trying to bring a voice of Easternism, holism, community-based thinking to a very Western culture. If we fail to appreciate the soul that Easternism gives us, then what we have is a disconnected, Greco-Roman, Western, egocentric, compartmentalized, reductionist, fragmented, linear thought process that counts on cleverness. Now, how's that for a mouthful?''

HEADLINE: Exporting Estee

BYLINE: By Mary Tannen

 BODY:
Shanghai
The three faces -- English, American, African-American -- press against one another in a sisterhood of pulchritude. They are the three graces, Estee Lauder's iconic model trio. The reason you are feeling so lost in translation is that you are seeing them on posters screaming down Nanking Road, the Fifth Avenue of Shanghai. Such is the interface between the quintessential American cosmetics company and the land of Confucius and Mao.
 Earlier this year, Lauder introduced Future Perfect Anti-Wrinkle Radiance Cream to the women of Shanghai. An elaborate Lucite pavilion featuring models of human cells and the double helix of DNA was constructed in the Westgate Mall -- a dramatization of the science behind the formula. ''Chinese people are looking for a reason to believe,'' explains Carol Shen, general manager of the Estee Lauder Companies' China affiliate. But it would seem that Lauder is preaching to the converted. Shen was raised in Taiwan, holds a degree from Northwestern University and has lived in mainland China for only three and a half years. Nevertheless, she considers herself Chinese and speaks with authority about what the Chinese customer wants -- which right now is anything with a big Western brand on it. 
 The Western faces assure customers that they are not being sold Chinese counterfeits, a strategy that all of the major Western brands understand well. In the race to establish a strong image, Estee Lauder began advertising in China Elle five years before any actual products became available. When Lauder finally opened in a Shanghai department store in 1993, with the offer of a free lipstick, ''waves and waves of people'' waiting outside smashed a display case in their enthusiasm, Shen recalls. ''That's the difference between China before and China today,'' she says. ''Now they know the brand is accessible. It's not going to create a riot.'' (Still, when Lauder recently repeated the lipstick giveaway in another city, store security was forewarned.)
 The Lauder saleswomen seem surprisingly young -- and, according to Shen, their enthusiasm is second to none. It's as if, for this generation, a powerful Western brand had the same galvanizing effect as Mao's Little Red Book had for their parents. Estee Lauder, which appeals mainly to over-40's elsewhere, wants to capture the loyalty of the up-and-coming generation in China. In this city of 17 million, where the average white-collar worker earns about 5,000 yuan ($604) a month, this is the group most likely to have the 690 yuan, or $83.50, for a 50-milliliter jar of Future Perfect. 
 For women who buy into the more expensive Re-Nutriv line, there is the Karat Club, which offers members free seminars on topics like how to buy a diamond. Shen describes her brand as ''aspirational.'' Looking around at customers dressed in Chanel and Armani, you would find it hard to believe that until recently the men and women of Shanghai dressed identically in drab proletarian garb.
 Today, polished limos glide past men on bicycles stacked high with recycled cardboard. A window featuring Italian leather abuts an open stall crawling with live crabs. Look over the plane trees and low terra-cotta roofs to skyscrapers of reflective glass with undulating walls in Candyland colors. They are so shiny and new that they look like a mirage, but it is old Shanghai that is disappearing like a soap bubble before your eyes.
 Transformation is the only constant in Shanghai. Its name literally means ''on the sea.'' Hardly more than 150 years ago it was a fishing village on a mud flat. Then the British won the battle to share the joys of opium with the Chinese. The Treaty of Nanking in 1842 opened the fishing village to foreign trade, and the mud flat of the Huangpu River became a port, drawing in opium and dispersing it to the mainland, gathering up products of the interior and sending them out on ships -- tea, silk, porcelain and even workers kidnapped for the railroads and mines in the American West (hence the word ''shanghaied'').
 This Paris of the East -- or Sodom and Gomorrah -- abruptly devolved into a drab backwater after Mao's peasant army took over in 1949. About 15 years ago, China's leaders decided to make the city a showcase of the new economic policy, and Shanghai, money capital of China, burst into being.
 Shen sees little of the aftereffects of the Cultural Revolution in China. ''It's almost like it didn't happen,'' she says. And to the land that won't look back, Lauder offers up its own legacy. The entire Lauder family -- living and dead -- is regularly featured in the press. Last September, Aerin Lauder, a granddaughter of Estee's and a senior vice president, visited Beijing to bestow the Defining Beauty Award on the singer Wang Rong. ''We want to position Aerin'' -- who has two young boys -- ''as a role model for working mothers,'' Shen says. ''Chinese are very interested in history and the family. Because Estee Lauder has family behind it, it has more recognition.''
 Clearly, Lauder is banking on China -- the lure of 1.3 billion consumers must be irresistible. But the company has not lost sight of the convictions of its founder. While Mao was busy propagandizing, Estee Lauder herself was creating a world in her black-and-white ads of chiseled beauties eager to express their new economic status. She watched over her name, making sure it never failed to epitomize taste and elegance. Now in its long march into China, Estee Lauder is putting its best face forward.

HEADLINE: A Jolt to Team Japan: Bonus Demands

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: ANAN, Japan 

 BODY:
In a country better known for copying and improving others' creations, the invention that was born here in rural Japan in 1993, at a 400-employee company surrounded by farmland, promised nothing less than a better light bulb.
 In fact, it was the Holy Grail of lighting technology: the blue light-emitting diode, or L.E.D., which made white light a reality. It offers the prospect of a cheap, long-lasting light source that is expected to, someday soon, replace Edison's incandescent light bulb.
 The invention spurred rapid growth at the company, Nichia, which now has 3,500 workers and enjoys a 50 percent profit margin on $1.8 billion revenues. But in keeping with the Japanese belief that all salarymen are equal and that the company stands above all, the man who led the inventing team was awarded a bonus of merely $200. 
 But the man, Shuji Nakamura, did not take the move in Japanese stride. He quit, left for a new job in America, and eventually sued. The lawsuit was settled recently, though not amicably, for $8.1 million.
 Almost a generation after the peak of Japan's economic might, companies here are being forced to struggle with ways to reward their most talented workers while hewing to their intrinsic egalitarianism. As globalization has allowed talented workers to job-hop across continents, some here -- who would have willingly sacrificed themselves for their companies until a few years ago -- are saying that all salarymen are not equal. 
 About 10 other inventors have also sued their employers, doing the unthinkable in this society that values teamwork above individual talent. Arguing that their individual talent led to huge discoveries and profits at companies like Toshiba, Canon, Hitachi, Ajinomoto and Mitsubishi Electric, they have sought money. A lot of money.
 ''The lawsuit changed the system in all companies in Japan in which scientists and engineers were poorly treated,'' Mr. Nakamura, now a professor of materials at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said in an interview during a recent visit to Tokyo. ''I'm very much satisfied by the results that the lawsuit has brought about.''
 Experts agree that the effects of this lawsuit -- which was led by Hidetoshi Masunaga, a lawyer who is also involved in some of the other suits -- will reach beyond the treatment of inventors.
 ''Such scientists are the forerunners of a changing mind-set among Japan's salarymen,'' said Shigeru Tanaka, president of the Hay Consulting Group in Japan. ''They have ownership of their own career development. Nakamura is not an ordinary person, but his case forecasts change among Japan's ordinary salarymen.''
 Time was, most employees' pay rose according to seniority inside companies where they enjoyed lifetime employment. More recently, to encourage and reward good employees, many companies have introduced performance-based pay systems.
 But the new systems have not been considered successful. They had the opposite effect of lowering morale among employees, who, thinking that missing a target would hurt their careers, tended not to set high goals in the first place.
 ''Now with the performance system, frustration seems to be everywhere, with some people not receiving what they expected or some people getting younger colleagues as bosses,'' said Taisuke Kato, general manager of the intellectual property division at Toshiba Corporation. ''In the United States, companies can keep employees with high ability and lay off employees not so highly regarded. But in Japan you cannot do that. There are employees who are no good. But we should consider how to survive as a whole.''
 Toshiba's employees can now choose to have their salaries tied to seniority or performance. The company, which is being sued by a former employee over the development of flash memory technology, has also established clearer guidelines to reward its most talented engineers. Every year, nearly 100 of its researchers receive bonuses of more than $10,000 and several of them get more than $100,000.
 The sums, though, pale next to what their American counterparts would get in stock options or the amounts claimed in the recent lawsuits. Last year, for instance, Ajinomoto had to pay more than $1 million to a former worker. But it was Mr. Nakamura's case that drew the most attention through the size of the award, though it was significantly lower than the $200 million that a lower court had initially awarded. The lower court had estimated at 50 percent Mr. Nakamura's contribution to the profits earned by his former employer, but the higher court said it was actually closer to 5 percent.
 In the end, both sides agreed to settle, with Mr. Nakamura receiving $8.1 million from Nichia. But the settlement satisfied neither side as it left unresolved the crucial question of whether it was the individual or the company that was behind the invention.
 Although it has grown considerably in the last decade, Nichia, a longtime maker of fluorescent devices before the L.E.D., has not changed much, employees say. It is an hour's drive from the nearest airport in Tokushima, on Shikoku, the smallest of Japan's four main islands. Its owner famously lives in a modest house. The lives of its bachelor engineers follow an arc that goes from their homes to work to the convenience store and back.
 The consensus at Nichia was that though he was the project's leader, Mr. Nakamura could not have invented the L.E.D. in 1993 without the support of the company or colleagues. Until he left, Mr. Nakamura, though a hard-driving boss, had been respected here.
 Masayuki Senoh, 39, and Shinichi Nagahama, 38, both worked under Mr. Nakamura on the L.E.D. team.
 ''Anyone can see that it was not accomplished just by Mr. Nakamura,'' Mr. Senoh said. ''No one can do it alone. There was data that I created, data that Nagahama created.''
 Mr. Nagahama said he still had fond memories of the Mr. Nakamura who worked here. ''Now he's changed,'' he said. ''Now his eyes have dollar marks in them.''
 Although Nichia's rapid growth has drawn many employees from other companies, there remains a deep belief here that one should not put individual interests before the company's and that it is unseemly to demand a greater share of profits. In a country where the stock market still draws few individual investors, Mr. Nakamura stood out here for his interest in money.
 ''He did like money,'' Ichiro Matsushita, 45, an assistant senior manager who was considered Mr. Nakamura's best friend here and spoke of being ''betrayed.'' ''During the bubble years of the early 1990's he was talking about stocks.''
 Mr. Nakamura said it was natural to receive compensation commensurate to ability. ''There are still people in Japan who think money is something evil,'' he said. ''But why are they working then? If they do not need money, they should donate it. You work to earn money. But in Japan, that idea has a bad image and you're not supposed to say that. It's your real feeling against what you say in public. I say what I really feel.''

HEADLINE: Theories on New Jersey's Wacky Math, Where Nothing Adds Up

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
WE have reached the point in the scholastic year when our young people's math proficiency has been tested, assessed, quantified and certified so heavily that the state's supply of No.2 pencils may be in jeopardy. And this barrage of testing has again proved conclusively that this year's third, fourth and eighth graders are incrementally better, or perhaps microscopically worse, at math than last year's batch. 
 None of them, however, have been taught anything about the kind of math that's really important in this state: the math in which 2 plus 2 equals 5 and average is exceptional. New Jersey Math, you might call it. 
 Perhaps you've been encountering New Jersey Math in your daily activities or your local news. It consists of the following principles, each contributing to the overall notion that here in the Garden State, numbers are not the reliable, immutable, rational things that they are elsewhere:

THE KIDD-CARTER POSTULATE -- In the broader world, 50 percent may be average, but under the Kidd-Carter Postulate, 51 percent is outstanding. That's the percentage of regular-season games won this year by the Nets, a legacy of mediocrity that had Vince Carter, the star-who-finally-showed-up, proclaiming a few days ago, ''It's just great to be a part of it.'' Hey, why strive for undefeated when 42-40 gets you into the playoffs?

GILMARTIN'S AXIOM -- Closely related to the view that undistinguished is laudable is the idea that downright bad is even more laudable. The axiom is named for Raymond V. Gilmartin, chairman and chief executive of Merck & Company, the guy who was at the helm when the company's arthritis drug, Vioxx, famously flamed out last year. His punishment: a $1.38 million bonus for 2004.

SCANNAPIECO'S COROLLARY -- One step beyond Gilmartin's Axiom, this mathematical rule states that the only thing more deserving of reward than a bad job is a criminal one. It's named for Matthew V. Scannapieco, former mayor of Marlboro, though a thousand other public-servants-turned-convicts could be used instead. Mr. Scannapieco recently pleaded guilty to accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, but, as The Asbury Park Press has been reporting, he could still receive a state pension. It's apparently not unusual for our public officials gone bad to retire just before they're convicted of something and then claim a pension, because one assemblyman, Anthony Chiappone, is pushing a bill that would squash the practice.

CODEY'S SUPPOSITION -- This principle of budgetary economics, named for our short-term governor, states that at a time when money is desperately needed for health care, highway repairs, education and foster care, the best thing a governor can do is strike an unfathomably complex multimillion-dollar deal that supports a hobby enjoyed by only a teeny fraction of New Jersey residents, preferably a hobby that's actually named after another state. Texas hold 'em poker, for instance, or Tennessee waltzing or -- New York Giants football!

THE 11.5/2/3 EQUATION -- This rule of thumb, proved just days ago by the personal experiences of this columnist, holds that in any week in which New Jersey Transit announces an 11.5-percent fare increase, two of the five commuter trains you try to take will be canceled out from under you, and the other three will be at least 20 minutes late.

THE VERIZON THEOREM -- While perhaps not technically confined to New Jersey, this states that any unlimited long-distance calling plan promoted as costing $54 a month will, when the actual bill comes, cost $72.

KINGDA KA'S CAT -- Like Erwin Schrodinger's famous quantum-theory paradox, this one involves placing a cat in a box. The box is then taken to Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, which for months has been advertising its new roller coaster, Kingda Ka (''the tallest, fastest roller coaster on earth''). If the box is taken 456 feet up to the peak of Kingda Ka and dropped, when it smashes into the ground, can the cat be said to have ridden the coaster?
 On the one hand, yes, because the cat paid the park's $47.99 admission fee and will no doubt want to feel it got something for its money. On the other hand, no, because as of this writing Kingda Ka still had not opened, resulting in who knows how many disappointed roller-coaster pilgrims, drawn by ambiguous advertising. (At one point Six Flags promised an April 23 opening for the coaster and was even auctioning the first seats on eBay.) 
 Not that this columnist would ever ride such a coaster. But I did buy a Lil' Darlings children's meal at the park the other day, advertised as costing $5.99. The bill: $11.64.

BYLINE: By Dwight Garner

 BODY:

GRAD SCHOOLING: The funniest graduation speech delivered thus far in the 00's was probably Tony Kushner's, given last spring at Columbia. Kushner had discovered he was not the university's first choice to speak (Jon Stewart was), and he stepped up to the podium and said: ''I think I should begin by acknowledging your disappointment that I am not Jon Stewart. Think how I feel. Your disappointment that I am not Jon Stewart will last one morning; I am disappointed at not being Jon Stewart every morning of my life.'' Funny graduation speeches, alas, are rarely turned into bite-size books to be marketed around the time of later graduations. Earnest speeches frequently are. Anna Quindlen's new book, ''Being Perfect,'' is based on the graduation speech she gave at Mount Holyoke in 1999. And Maria Shriver's new book, ''And One More Thing Before You Go . . . ,'' is expanded from a luncheon speech she delivered not long ago to graduating high school girls and their mothers. (Shriver's bold advice includes ''Learn from your mistakes'' and ''You'll need a lot of courage.'') Shriver's book hits the hardcover miscellaneous list this week at No. 3, pushed along by an appearance on ''Oprah,'' during which Oprah introduced her by intoning the 11 words every woman with a new book dreams of hearing from her: ''My old girlfriend, old, old, old, we go so far back.''

FREAK FACTOR: ''If Indiana Jones were an economist, he'd be Steven Levitt.'' That's a Wall Street Journal reviewer's take on Levitt, a 37-year-old University of Chicago economist whose new book, ''Freakonomics,'' written with Stephen J. Dubner, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 5. But ''Freakonomics'' is so sly, finicky and micro-observant that the Indiana Jones comparison feels a little off -- Levitt is more like the Nicholson Baker of economists. His specialty is asking some unusual questions: ''How is the Ku Klux Klan like a group of real estate agents?''; ''Why do drug dealers still live with their moms?'' The answers tend to be provocative. The most eye-popping assertion in ''Freakonomics'' may be that the drop in crime during the 1990's had little to do with a strong economy or new police strategies. The real reason, Levitt says, was Roe v. Wade. ''An entire generation came of age minus the children whose mothers had not wanted to bring a child into the world,'' he and Dubner write. ''Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness; unwantedness leads to high crime.'' On NPR, Scott Simon asked Levitt if it was true he'd been offered a job in the Bush administration. Yes, Levitt said, then added, ''I told them you better go back and look at the study I did on the link between abortion and crime and if you're still interested, call me back, and I never did get that return phone call.''

HEADLINE: A Chef Who Wears Two Toques

BYLINE: By Louise Kramer. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
JIM BOTSACOS sweeps into the kitchen of Molyvos, a Greek restaurant near Carnegie Hall. The cooks stand to attention. He plucks some spinach out of a saute pan to test the seasoning, then checks the inventory sheet to make sure there are enough baby octopuses on hand for a popular appetizer. A quick sample of a new halibut creation, and Mr. Botsacos, the executive chef, disappears into the basement. 
 He appears calm, but his night is just beginning. He ducks into his office and quickly changes from his Molyvos jacket into one with a logo for an Italian restaurant, Abboccato. He dashes out a side entrance, crosses West 55th Street to Abboccato, and rushes into that kitchen. There was no emergency. This is what Mr. Botsacos does nearly every night of the week. 
 He has been executive chef at Molyvos, on Seventh Avenue at 55th Street, for seven years. Like many chefs who labor for long periods at the same stove, Mr. Botsacos longed for a new challenge.
 ''I wanted the growth and the stimulation,'' said Mr. Botsacos, 37, a veteran of some of New York's most successful restaurants, including the ''21'' Club and Blue Water Grill. ''It was time.''
 He found his next career move just around the corner. A restaurant space was available at the Blakely Hotel on West 55th, and it was the perfect spot, he realized, to showcase a neglected part of his culinary heritage: his father is Greek and his mother is Italian, and both always encouraged their son's interest in cooking, which had emerged by age 3.
 So last fall, the Livanos Restaurant Group, the owners of Molyvos and the upscale Oceana in Midtown, and Mr. Botsacos joined forces to open Abboccato, an 85-seat high-end restaurant, in the hotel. Abboccato means ''pleasing to the mouth.'' 
 ''It gives me growth potential for earnings,'' Mr. Botsacos said of his two-toques situation, ''and growth potential for creativity.'' Mr. Botsacos has a family, and a mortgage on an Upper West Side apartment, and as a partner in Abboccato he will reap a share of the profits. 
 Livanos likes the arrangement, said a company partner, Nick Livanos, because it has kept a talented chef who knows the management style and who can train employees to grow into bigger roles. ''At this point we own seven restaurants and we can't run them all ourselves,'' Mr. Livanos said. ''We need our chefs to grow beyond their stove and saute pans into management.''
 It is a move many executive chefs are making, including Tom Colicchio, the chef-owner at Craft, who has expanded to Craftbar and 'Wichcraft, all in the Flatiron district, while maintaining his chef-owner duties at Gramercy Tavern, and the celebrity chefs Mario Batali and Bobby Flay, who have their hands in many pots across the city.
 Few executive chefs, however, try to supervise more than one place so closely on the same night, and there are risks. ''It can be hard to serve two masters,'' said Arlene Spiegel, a Manhattan restaurant consultant. ''What happens if both places are screaming for him at the same time?'' 
 And of course, for any restaurateur, chef or no, the competition is formidable. New Yorkers can choose from among an unimaginable 24,600 restaurants, including almost 2,000 deemed worthy of inclusion in the 2005 Zagat Survey. If a chef stumbles, the customer may never return. 
 Mr. Botsacos admits to some rough patches. He gave John Piliouras, his longtime chef de cuisine (the No. 2 spot), more responsibility at Molyvos, and hired a new chef, Jake Addeo, as chef de cuisine at Abboccato. Both report to him and have strong reputations and ideas of what works best, he said. ''In the beginning we were butting heads a little bit,'' Mr. Botsacos said. For example, Mr. Botsacos likes to soak fish in milk before breading it and Mr. Piliouras does not. The boss won that argument. 
 Otherwise, Mr. Botsacos said, the setup is working. On most nights, he dashes between the restaurants to make sure everything is running smoothly, after switching jackets. ''Once in a while I forget to change,'' he said during a recent dinner rush. He said he had ordered new jackets with both logos on them to eliminate this step. 
 The executive chef's office at Molyvos is decorated with family photos, including some showing Mr. Botsacos with his catch of the day (he has been fishing since he was a boy). 
 His 4-year-old daughter, Sofia, is showing an interest in cooking. ''Every place she goes she wants to meet the chef,'' he said.
 To visit her father, she goes to two places, and soon maybe more. ''I'm already talking to Nick,'' Mr. Botsacos said, ''and saying we have to do a steakhouse or meze place.''

HEADLINE: The Way of the Commandos

BYLINE: By Peter Maass. 
Peter Maass, a contributing writer, is the author of ''Love Thy Neighbor: A Story of War.'' He has reported extensively for the magazine from Iraq.

 BODY:
Getting to Know the General
In a country of tough guys, Adnan Thabit may be the toughest of all. He was both a general and a death-row prisoner under Saddam Hussein. He favors leather jackets no matter the weather, his left index finger extends only to the knuckle (the rest was sliced off in combat) and he responds to requests from supplicants with grunts that mean ''yes'' or ''no.'' Occasionally, a humble aide approaches to spray perfume on his hands, which he wipes over his rugged face.
 General Adnan, as he is known, is the leader of Iraq's most fearsome counterinsurgency force. It is called the Special Police Commandos and consists of about 5,000 troops. They have fought the insurgents in Mosul, Ramadi, Baghdad and Samarra. It was in Samarra, 60 miles north of Baghdad in the heart of the Sunni Triangle, where, in early March, I spent a week with Adnan, himself a Sunni, and two battalions of his commandos. Samarra is Adnan's hometown, and he had come to retake it. As the offensive to drive out the insurgents got under way, the only area securely under Adnan's control was a barricaded enclave around the town hall, where he grimly presided over matters of war and peace, but mostly war, chain-smoking Royal cigarettes at a raised desk in the mayor's office. With a jowly face set in a permanent scowl, Adnan is perfectly suited to the grim realities of Iraq, and he knows it. When an admiring American colonel compared him to Marlon Brando in ''The Godfather,'' Adnan took it as a compliment and smiled. 
 Early one evening, I was sitting in his office when an officer entered with a click of his heels -- an Iraqi salute of sorts. He reported to Adnan that a rebel weapons cache had been discovered, and Adnan congratulated him -- but issued a warning. ''If even one AK-47 is stolen,'' he said, ''I will kill you.'' After a pause, he smiled and refined the threat. ''No,'' he said, ''I will kill your'' -- and he used a coarse word that referred to the officer's most private body part. There was nervous laughter. Everyone seemed certain that not a single gun, or single anything, would go missing.
 Not long ago, hard men like Adnan, especially Sunnis, were giving orders to no one. Six weeks after the fall of Baghdad, the Coalition Provisional Authority dismissed the Sunni-led Iraqi Army, and the United States military set out to rebuild Iraq's armed forces from the ground up, training new officers and soldiers rather than calling on those who knew how to fight but had done so in the service of Saddam Hussein. By late last year, though, it had become clear that the new American-trained forces were not shaping up as an effective fighting force, and the old guard was called upon. Now people like Adnan, a former Baathist, have been given the task of defeating the insurgency. The new strategy is showing signs of success, but it is a success that may carry its own costs.
 A couple of hours after Adnan issued his AK-47 threat, I sat with him watching TV. This was business, not pleasure. The program we were watching was Adnan's brainchild, and in just a few months it had proved to be one of the most effective psychological operations of the war. It is reality TV of sorts, a show called ''Terrorism in the Grip of Justice.'' It features detainees confessing to various crimes. The show was first broadcast earlier this year and has quickly become a nationwide hit. It is on every day in prime time on Al Iraqiya, the American-financed national TV station, and when it is on, people across the country can be found gathered around their television sets.
 Those being interrogated on the program do not look fearsome; these are not the faces to be found in the propaganda videos that turn up on Web sites or on Al Jazeera. The insurgents, or suspected insurgents, on ''Terrorism in the Grip of Justice'' come off as cowardly lowlifes who kill for money rather than patriotism or Allah. They tremble on camera, stumble over their words and look at the ground as they confess to everything from contract murders to sodomy. The program's clear message is that there is now a force more powerful than the insurgency: the Iraqi government, and in particular the commandos, whose regimental flag, which shows a lion's head on a camouflage background, is frequently displayed on a banner behind the captives.
 Before the show began that evening, Adnan's office was a hive of conversation, phone calls and tea-drinking. Along with a dozen commandos, there were several American advisers in the room, including James Steele, one of the United States military's top experts on counterinsurgency. Steele honed his tactics leading a Special Forces mission in El Salvador during that country's brutal civil war in the 1980's. Steele's presence was a sign not only of the commandos' crucial role in the American counterinsurgency strategy but also of his close relationship with Adnan. Steele admired the general. ''He's obviously a natural type of commander,'' Steele told me. ''He commands respect.''
 Things quieted in the office once the episode of ''Terrorism in the Grip of Justice'' began. First, a detainee admitted to having homosexual relations in a mosque. Then several other suspected insurgents made their confessions; two of them had been captured by Adnan's commandos in Samarra, and their confessions were taped, just hours before, in this very office. Adnan sat smoking Royals and watching the show like a proud producer.
 ''It has a good effect on civilians,'' he had told me, through an interpreter. ''Most civilians don't know who conducts the terrorist activities. Now they can see the quality of the insurgents.'' Earlier he said: ''Civilians must know that these people who call themselves resisters are thieves and looters. They are dirty. In every person there is good and bad, but in these people there is only bad.''
 The episodes of the program I have seen depict an insurgency composed almost entirely of criminals and religious fanatics. The insurgency as understood by American intelligence officers, is a more complex web of interests and fighters. Most of the insurgency is composed of Sunnis, and it is generally believed that Baathists hold key positions. But the commandos, who are the stars of ''Terrorism in the Grip of Justice,'' are also led by Sunnis and have many former Baathists in their ranks, so the Sunni and Baathist aspect of the insurgency is carefully obscured. 
 Of course, propaganda need not be wholly accurate to be effective. The real problem with the program, according to its most vocal critics -- representatives of human rights groups -- is that it violates the Geneva Conventions. The detainees shown on ''Terrorism in the Grip of Justice'' have not been charged before judicial authorities, and they appear to be confessing under duress. Some detainees are cut and bruised. In one show, a former policeman with two black eyes confessed to killing two police officers in Samarra; a few days after the broadcast, the former policeman's family told reporters, his corpse was delivered to them. The government's human rights minister has initiated an investigation.
 ''Terrorism in the Grip of Justice'' is a ratings success because it humiliates the insurgency, satisfying a popular desire for vengeance against the men who spread terror and death. Yet the program plyas rough not only with its confessing captives but also with the rules and laws that govern the conduct of war. As I learned in Samarra, this approach was not just for television. It was Adnan's effective yet brutal way of conducting a counterinsurgency.

Building a Home-Grown Counterinsurgency
Most of the Pentagon's official statements in the past two years about the ability of Iraqis to police their own country have been exaggerated. But now reality is beginning to catch up with rhetoric. In the months that followed the January elections in Iraq, attacks on allied forces reportedly fell to 30 to 40 a day in February and March, from 140 just before the vote. It's hard to tell whether this trend will continue; in late April the insurgency showed signs of renewed strength. But the successes that the counterinsurgency has enjoyed are in no small part because of Adnan's commandos. With American forces in an advisory role, the commandos, as well as a few other well-led units, like the Iraqi Army's 36th Commando Battalion and its 40th Brigade in Baghdad, inflicted more violence upon insurgents than insurgents inflicted upon them. That is much of what fighting an insurgency amounts to. But successful counterinsurgencies, if history is a guide, tend not to be pretty, especially in countries where violence has been a way of life and rules governing warfare and human rights have been routinely ignored by those in uniform.
 The template for Iraq today is not Vietnam, to which it has often been compared, but El Salvador, where a right-wing government backed by the United States fought a leftist insurgency in a 12-year war beginning in 1980. The cost was high -- more than 70,000 people were killed, most of them civilians, in a country with a population of just six million. Most of the killing and torturing was done by the army and the right-wing death squads affiliated with it. According to an Amnesty International report in 2001, violations committed by the army and its associated paramilitaries included ''extrajudicial executions, other unlawful killings, 'disappearances' and torture. . . . Whole villages were targeted by the armed forces and their inhabitants massacred.'' As part of President Reagan's policy of supporting anti-Communist forces, hundreds of millions of dollars in United States aid was funneled to the Salvadoran Army, and a team of 55 Special Forces advisers, led for several years by Jim Steele, trained front-line battalions that were accused of significant human rights abuses. 
 There are far more Americans in Iraq today -- some 140,000 troops in all -- than there were in El Salvador, but U.S. soldiers and officers are increasingly moving to a Salvador-style advisory role. In the process, they are backing up local forces that, like the military in El Salvador, do not shy away from violence. It is no coincidence that this new strategy is most visible in a paramilitary unit that has Steele as its main adviser; having been a key participant in the Salvador conflict, Steele knows how to organize a counterinsurgency campaign that is led by local forces. He is not the only American in Iraq with such experience: the senior U.S. adviser in the Ministry of Interior, which has operational control over the commandos, is Steve Casteel, a former top official in the Drug Enforcement Administration who spent much of his professional life immersed in the drug wars of Latin America. Casteel worked alongside local forces in Peru, Bolivia and Colombia, where he was involved in the hunt for Pablo Escobar, the head of the Medellin cocaine cartel. 
 Both Steele and Casteel were adamant in discussions with me that they oppose human rights abuses. They stressed that torture and death-squad activity are counterproductive. Yet excesses of that sort were endemic in Latin America and in virtually every modern counterinsurgency. American abuses at Abu Ghraib and other detention centers in Iraq and Afghanistan show that first-world armies are not immune to the seductions of torture. 
 Until last year, the United States military tried to defeat the insurgency on its own, with Iraqi forces playing only a token role. The effort did not succeed. For every Iraqi detained by G.I.'s, 10 more seemed to join the insurgency, thanks to questionable American tactics: shooting at the whiff of a threat, yelling at civilians, detaining Iraqis indiscriminately, placing hoods over the heads of detainees. With insurgent attacks becoming more frequent and also more gruesome in the spring of 2004, American generals realized that they needed to create, or find, effective Iraqi forces.
 Last June, Lt. Gen. David Petraeus, who commanded the 101st Airborne during the invasion, returned to Iraq to take charge of the sputtering training effort. He arrived in the wake of a major embarrassment -- when the first U.S.-trained battalion of Iraqi troops was ordered to Falluja to support an offensive by the Marines, many of them deserted or refused to fight. General Petraeus was given the resources and clout to turn things around, but in the months that followed things did not appear to be improving. When insurgents attacked the northern city of Mosul in the fall, the U.S.-trained police force there collapsed, abandoning its stations. Across the country, police officers were being killed by the dozens in mortar and car-bomb attacks; demoralized and outgunned, they retreated to fortified stations or simply stayed home.
 A scathing report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, still in draft form but posted on the center's Web site, blames senior American officials for these failures of Iraqi will. ''The police and the bulk of the security forces were given grossly inadequate training, equipment, facilities, transport and protection,'' states the report, written by Anthony Cordesman, a military expert and former Pentagon official. ''These problems were then compounded by recruiting U.S. police advisers -- some more for U.S. domestic political reasons than out of any competence for the job -- with no area expertise and little or no real knowledge of the mission that the Iraqi security and police forces actually had to perform.'' The report seems to be referring to, among others, Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner, who was the first police adviser to L Paul Bremer III, administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority. Kerik left after three and a half months. Although the report notes some progress in recent months, it concludes: ''Unprepared Iraqis were sent out to die. . . . The fact that some died as a result of U.S. incompetence and neglect was the equivalent of bureaucratic murder.''
 A key problem early on was that United States officials focused on the number of recruits rather than on their quality. Not only was the wrong metric being used to measure progress; the metric was being manipulated. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, at her confirmation hearing in January, stated that 120,000 Iraqis were trained and equipped. Senator Joseph Biden countered that no more than 14,000 of them were reliable fighters. Biden had a point: many of the Iraqis in Rice's head count barely knew how to fire a weapon. A recent report from the Government Accountability Office said the Pentagon's tallies have included tens of thousands of police officers who did not even report for duty. ''If you are reporting AWOL's in your numbers, I think there's some inaccuracy in your reporting,'' Joseph Christoff, the G.A.O. official who presented the report to Congress, commented to The Los Angeles Times.
 Last summer, with the security situation deteriorating, some Iraqi and American officials began to argue that the time had passed for a ''clean hands'' policy that rejected most of the experienced people who had fought for Saddam Hussein. The first official to take action was Falah al-Naqib, interior minister under the interim government of Ayad Allawi. In September, Naqib formed his own regiment, the Special Police Commandos, drawn from veterans of Hussein's special forces and the Republican Guard. As its leader, he chose General Adnan, not only because Adnan had a useful collection of colleagues from Iraq's military and security networks, but also because Adnan is Naqib's uncle.
 Naqib did not ask for permission or training or even equipment from the United States military; he formed and armed the commandos because the U.S. military would not. ''One of the biggest mistakes made by the coalition forces is that they started from zero,'' he told me in his office in the Green Zone in Baghdad. ''Our army and police are 80 years old. They have lots of experience. They know more about the country and the people, and about the way the insurgents are fighting, than any foreign forces.''
 Initially, Petraeus wasn't even told of the commandos; Iraqis and American civilians at the Ministry of Interior had lost faith in the U.S. military. The American who was most involved in the commandos' creation was Casteel, Naqib's senior American adviser. Casteel, who previously worked for Paul Bremer in the Coalition Provisional Authority, realized that the de-Baathification policy had to be altered and that Naqib was the person to do it. ''He was not looking for top Baathists or people with blood on their hands,'' Casteel said. ''But a tremendous amount of people who worked in the government or army weren't either of those. So why start from scratch when we can start in the middle? That's where the commando idea was formed.''
 After the commandos set up their headquarters at a bombed-out army base at the edge of the Green Zone, Petraeus went for a visit. He was pleasantly surprised, he told me, to see a force that was relatively disciplined and well motivated. He knew the commandos were officers and soldiers who had served Saddam Hussein, he knew many of them were Sunni and he certainly knew they were not under American control. But he also sensed that they could fight. He challenged some of them to a push-up contest. He was not just embracing a new military formation; he was embracing a new strategy. The hard men of the past would help shape the country's future. 
 Petraeus decided that the commandos would receive whatever arms, ammunition and supplies they required. He also assigned Steele to work with them. In addition to his experience in El Salvador, Steele had been in charge of retraining Panama's security forces following the ousting of President Manuel Noriega. When I asked him to describe Adnan's leadership qualities, Steele drew on the vocabulary he learned in Latin America. Adnan, he said approvingly, was a caudillo -- a military strongman.

Doing It the Iraqi Way
Adnan's offensive turned Samarra into a proving ground for this new strategy, the most comprehensive effort to date in which United States-backed Iraqi forces sought to retake an insurgent city. Code-named City Market, the offensive has involved weeks of raids by commandos and their American advisers. After the first wave of raids, a new corps of police officers and Interior Ministry troops known as Public Order Battalions were deployed to take command of the streets.
 Samarra has a population of a quarter million, though many have fled after two years of warfare. The population is divided among seven tribes whose rivalries created fertile soil for the insurgency to take root. Since 2003, the city has often been under the control of the insurgents. In October, the United States launched an offensive to retake the city, but the moment the Bradleys and Humvees departed, the insurgents returned. (Voter turnout in the election in January was less than 5 percent.) 
 When I arrived in March, the part of Samarra under American and commando control -- the City Hall and a Green Zone around it -- was a small parcel of land ringed with a phalanx of concrete barriers, barbed wire and shoot-to-kill lookouts. The main roads into the city were blocked by checkpoints at which Iraqi soldiers searched every vehicle. American and Iraqi forces rarely left the Green Zone on foot, conducting their patrols in heavily armed convoys, and the Green Zone was hit by mortars almost every day.
 There were just a few hundred G.I.'s in Samarra, living in the Green Zone on two bases, Razor and Olsen. The conditions were spartan; soldiers were housed in cramped rooms, they used portable toilets as latrines and hot dinners were served just three nights a week. At Olsen, a former casino that is home to troops of the Wisconsin Army National Guard and the Third Infantry Division, the soldiers I met spent most of their off-hours lifting weights, e-mailing loved ones back home or playing Halo on Xboxes, unwinding from real combat by engaging in simulated combat. Three teams of a dozen or so G.I.'s went out on the raids with the Iraqi commandos. (The other soldiers in the city performed logistical, administrative and perimeter-security duties.) One team was composed of Special Forces soldiers, another was drawn from the Wisconsin National Guard and the third, with which I spent most of my time on patrol, was staffed by soldiers of the Third Infantry Division. The squad leader was Capt. Jeff Bennett, a 26-year-old whose father is in the Air Force.
 Captain Bennett was on his second tour in Iraq. During the invasion, he was among the Third Infantry Division troops who captured Baghdad airport against stiff resistance from Republican Guard forces. Bennett wears his division patch on the shoulder of his uniform, and soon after he arrived in Samarra, the patch was recognized by a few of the Iraqi commandos, who informed him that they had been in the Republican Guard unit at the airport that fought his unit. Initially, Bennett was leery about going into combat with men he had tried to kill, and who had tried to kill him, but after their first battle together, fighting shoulder to shoulder against insurgents, his doubts disappeared.
 ''That's the great equalizer,'' Bennett said. ''You get into a firefight with someone, they come to your side, return fire, cover another person. That kind of seals the relationship.''
 Many of the commando raids occurred at night. One evening, I watched as preparations began on the street outside City Hall. A group of about 50 Iraqis strapped on their body armor, inserted bullet clips into their AK-47's and listened to heavy metal on the stereos of their American-supplied Dodge pickups, which now bore coats of camouflage paint and machine guns on their flatbeds. The commandos talked and joked loudly, exuding an alpha-male confidence. Bennett's squad mixed easily with the commandos, exchanging greetings in the Arabic phrases they learned. 
 The commandos cultivate a vaguely menacing look. They wear camouflage uniforms, but also irregular clothing, like black leather gloves and balaclavas -- not to hide their identities but to inspire fear among the enemy. It is a look I saw among the Serbian paramilitaries who terrorized Croatia and Bosnia during the Balkan wars in the 90's, and it is the look of the paramilitaries that operated in Latin America a decade earlier.
 When it was time to go, the commandos moved out in their Dodges, and Bennett's team followed in three armored Humvees. Bennett was not sure of the precise destination that evening; though the Iraqis and Americans had swapped lists of high-value targets, the commandos generally decided which ones would be pursued. The patrol moved out with lights off, slipping through Samarra's barren streets; there was a curfew in effect, and even the city's many stray dogs seemed to have taken shelter. The patrol eventually pulled to a halt at a house a few miles from the Green Zone. A man there, apparently willing to cooperate, said he knew where a number of insurgents could be found, and he led the way to a nearby house. Those inside were brought out, one by one. The man identified one as an insurgent, and he was flex-cuffed, blindfolded and thrown into the back of a truck.
 The convoy moved on and made many more stops. House after house was searched. Sometimes the commandos broke down doors or shot off locks. Other times they entered with a polite knock and had friendly discussions, departing with handshakes and smiles. The commandos are far more skilled than American troops I've spent time with at knowing, intuitively, whether someone represents a threat. A few men were detained as the evening unfolded, and when they offered resistance or didn't provide information as quickly as the commandos desired, they were punished with a quick kick, slap or punch.
 A little after 2 a.m., the commandos rolled into a neighborhood where the homes were surrounded by walls and had satellite dishes on their roofs. A man who was detained earlier in the night pointed the commandos toward one house. They entered and soon emerged with a confiscated computer, but whomever they hoped to find inside was not there.
 The officer in charge of the raid -- a Major Falah -- now made it clear that he believed the detainee had led them on a wild-goose chase. The detainee was sitting at the side of a commando truck; I was 10 feet away, beside Bennett and four G.I.'s. One of Falah's captains began beating the detainee. Instead of a quick hit or slap, we now saw and heard a sustained series of blows. We heard the sound of the captain's fists and boots on the detainee's body, and we heard the detainee's pained grunts as he received his punishment without resistance. It was a dockyard mugging. Bennett turned his back to face away from the violence, joining his soldiers in staring uncomfortably at the ground in silence. The blows continued for a minute or so. 
 Bennett had seen the likes of this before, and he had worked out his own guidelines for dealing with such situations. ''If I think they're going to shoot somebody or cut his finger off or do any sort of permanent damage, I will immediately stop them,'' he explained. ''As Americans, we will not let that happen. In terms of kicking a guy, they do that all the time, punches and stuff like that.'' It was a tactical decision, Bennett explained: ''You only get so many interventions, and I've got to save my butting in for when there is a danger it could go over the line.'' But even when he doesn't say anything, he explained, ''they can tell we're not enjoying it. We're just kind of like, 'O.K., here we go again.'''
 Though the commandos and their American advisers were working together in Samarra, their approaches were decidedly different. The American way of combat is heavily planned, with satellite maps, G.P.S. coordinates and reconnaissance drones. The Iraqi way is improvisational, relying less on honed skills and high-tech than gut instinct and (literally) bare knuckles. It is the Americans who are learning to adapt. At the bottom of printed briefings that American soldiers receive at the bases in Samarra, a quotation from T.E. Lawrence is appended: ''Better the Arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly. It is their war, and you are to help them, not to win it for them.''

Threatening to Kill a Suspect's Son
On March 8, I went on a series of raids with the commandos, traveling in a Humvee with Maj. Robert Rooker, an artillery officer based in Tikrit who was dispatched to Samarra to serve as my escort. The leader of the American squad was Andrew Johansen, a 30-year-old lieutenant in the Wisconsin Army National Guard. The commandos led the way in a half-dozen Dodges, with Johansen's team following in three Humvees. The target was a house outside Samarra where Najim al-Takhi, thought to be the leader of an insurgent cell, was believed to be hiding.
 The commandos reached an isolated farmhouse and detained al-Takhi's son, who looked to be in his early 20's. This was an excellent catch. The son of a suspect usually knows where the suspect is hiding; if not, he can be detained and used as a bargaining chip to persuade the father to surrender. With al-Takhi's son flex-cuffed in the back of one of the pickups, the commandos, excited, drove to another farmhouse less than a mile away. They believed that al-Takhi might be there, but a quick search yielded nothing. The leader of this raid was a short, chubby captain who was enthusiastic and, as I noticed on previous raids, effective at leading his men. (When I later asked his name, he refused to give it.) The captain was convinced that al-Takhi was nearby, but the son was telling him he didn't know where his father was. Was he lying? 
 The captain's methods were swift and extreme. He yelled at the son, who was wearing a loose tunic; in the tussle of the arrest the young man had lost one of his sandals. The captain pushed him against a mud wall and told everyone else to move away. Standing less than 10 feet from the young man, the captain aimed his AK-47 at him and clicked off the safety latch. He was threatening to kill him. I was close enough to catch some of the dialogue on my digital recorder.
 ''Where is your father?'' the captain shouted. ''Say where your father is!''
 ''He left early in the morning,'' the son responded, clearly in terror. ''I told my father to divorce my mother, to not leave us in such a state.''
 The son asked for mercy. ''I swear, if I knew where he is, I would for sure take you to him.'' He looked around. ''Oh, God, what should I do?''
 The captain was not persuaded.
 ''Just tell us where he is, and we will release you now,'' he shouted.
 ''I swear to you, though you did not ask me to make an oath, instead of enduring all these beatings I would tell you where he is if I knew.''
 Major Rooker was just a few feet from the angry captain. He moved closer and nudged the captain's AK-47 toward the ground.
 ''You are a professional soldier,'' Rooker told him. ''You know and I know that you need to put the weapon down.''
 The captain scowled but ended the execution drama.
 ''O.K., guys,'' he shouted to his men, ''let's ride back.''
 As the commandos pulled their prisoner away, Lieutenant Johansen conferred with Rooker. ''They don't operate the way we do, that's for damn sure,'' Johansen said. ''We have to be nice to people.'' Especially in the aftermath of Abu Ghraib, they both knew that threatening a prisoner with death, they both knew, was illegal under the Geneva Conventions. 
 ''I think it was all an act to try and get him to talk,'' Rooker said. ''But for a fraction of a second I didn't know that. I thought the guy was going to cap him.''
 The commandos moved about 100 yards away, where they interrogated the young man again, this time without an AK-47 in his face. With an execution no longer in the offing, Rooker decided to not further irritate the captain. ''They'll shake him down a little bit more,'' he said to the driver of his Humvee. ''Stay back and let them do their job.''
 Later, I asked Johansen about what had happened.
 ''I'm about 99 percent sure it was intimidation to put fear into the guy,'' he told me. ''I know they use different means of interrogation, but I didn't expect them to raise a weapon at a detainee. I don't think they know the value of human life Americans have. If they shoot somebody, I don't think they would have remorse, even if they killed someone who was innocent.''

Inside the Detention Center
In Samarra, the commandos established a detention center at the public library, a hundred yards down the road from the City Hall. The library is a one-story rose-hued building surrounded by a five-foot wall. There is a Koranic inscription over its entrance: ''In the name of Allah the most gracious and merciful, Oh, Lord, please fill me with knowledge.''
 These days, the knowledge sought under its roof comes not from hardback books but from blindfolded detainees. In guerrilla wars of recent decades, detention centers have played a notorious role. From Latin America to the Balkans and the Middle East, the worst abuse has taken place away from the eyes of bystanders or journalists. During my first few days in the city, I was told I could not visit the center; I was able only to observe, discreetly, as detainees were led into it at all hours. But one day Jim Steele asked whether I wanted to interview a Saudi youth who had been captured the previous day. I agreed, and he took me to the detention center.
 We walked through the entrance gates of the center and stood, briefly, outside the main hall. Looking through the doors, I saw about 100 detainees squatting on the floor, hands bound behind their backs; most were blindfolded. To my right, outside the doors, a leather-jacketed security official was slapping and kicking a detainee who was sitting on the ground. We went to a room adjacent to the main hall, and as we walked in, a detainee was led out with fresh blood around his nose. The room had enough space for a couple of desks and chairs; one desk had bloodstains running down its side. The 20-year-old Saudi was led into the room and sat a few feet from me. He said he had been treated well and that a bandage on his head was a result of an injury he suffered in a car accident as he was being chased by Iraqi soldiers.
 A few minutes after the interview started, a man began screaming in the main hall, drowning out the Saudi's voice. ''Allah!'' he shouted. ''Allah! Allah!'' It was not an ecstatic cry; it was chilling, like the screams of a madman, or of someone being driven mad. ''Allah!'' he yelled again and again. The shouts were too loud to ignore. Steele left the room to find out what was happening. When returned, the shouts had ceased. But soon, through the window behind me, I could hear the sounds of someone vomiting, coming from an area where other detainees were being held, at the side of the building.
 Earlier, I spoke briefly with an American counterintelligence soldier who works at the detention center. The soldier, who goes by the name Ken -- counterintelligence soldiers often use false names for security reasons -- said that he or another American soldier was present at 90 percent of the interrogations by the commandos and that he had seen no abuse. I didn't have an opportunity to ask him detailed questions, and I wondered, in light of the beatings that I had seen soldiers watch without intervening, what might constitute abuse during interrogation. I also wondered what might be happening when American intelligence soldiers weren't present.
 The Saudi I interviewed seemed relieved to have been captured, because his service in the insurgency, he said, was a time of unhappy disillusion. He came to Iraq to die with Islamic heroes, he said, but instead was drafted into a cell composed of riffraff who stole cars and kidnapped for money and attacked American targets only occasionally. When I asked, through an interpreter, whether he had planned to be a suicide bomber, he looked aghast and said he would not do that because innocent civilians would be killed; he was willing to enter paradise by being shot but not by blowing himself up. He gladly gave me the names of the members of the cell. One was a Syrian who had been arrested with him.
 That evening, as I was eating dinner in the mess hall at Olsen base, I overheard a G.I. saying that he had seen the Syrian at the detention center, hanging from the ceiling by his arms and legs like an animal being hauled back from a hunt. When I struck up a conversation with the soldier, he refused to say anything more. Later, I spoke with an Iraqi interpreter who works for the U.S. military and has access to the detention center; when I asked whether the Syrian, like the Saudi, was cooperating, the interpreter smiled and said, ''Not yet, but he will.''
 One afternoon as I was standing near City Hall, I heard a gunshot from within or behind the detention center. In previous days, I saw or heard, on several occasions, accidental shots by commandos -- their weapons discipline was far from perfect -- so I assumed it was another negligent discharge. But within a minute or so, there was another shot from the same place -- inside or behind the detention center.
 It was impossible to determine what was happening at the detention center, but there was certainly cause to worry. A State Department report released last month noted that Iraqi authorities have been accused of ''arbitrary deprivation of life, torture, impunity, poor prison conditions -- particularly in pretrial detention facilities -- and arbitrary arrest and detention.'' A report by Human Rights Watch in January went further, claiming that ''unlawful arrest, long-term incommunicado detention, torture and other ill treatment of detainees (including children) by Iraqi authorities have become routine and commonplace.''
 When I returned to the United States, I asked the American authorities in Samarra for a comment about potential human rights abuses at the detention center. They forwarded my e-mail message to a spokesperson for the Iraqi Interior Ministry, who wrote in reply: ''The Ministry of Interior does not allow any human rights abuses of prisoners that are in the hands of Ministry of Interior Security Forces. . . . Reports of human rights violations are deeply investigated by the Ministry of Interior's Human Rights Department.''

The Uses of Fear
In El Salvador, a subpar army fought an insurgency to a standoff that eventually led to a political solution. Kalev Sepp, who was a Special Forces adviser in El Salvador and is currently a professor at the Navy's Center on Terrorism and Irregular Warfare, said he believes that the handful of United States-trained Salvadoran strike battalions made the difference. ''Those six battalions held back the guerrillas for years,'' he said in a recent phone interview. ''The rest of the army was guarding bridges and power lines.''
 In Iraq, the insurgency does not fight everywhere; most attacks occur around Baghdad and in the Sunni Triangle. This allows a small and agile counterinsurgency force to play a disproportionately large role, and the commandos are precisely that kind of force. As a paramilitary unit, they are not slowed down by heavy weapons, and they do not engage in the attrition warfare of lumbering army regiments with thousands of troops and tanks and artillery pieces. Instead, they go wherever there is trouble, racing up and down the highways at 90 miles an hour in their Dodge trucks (so quickly, in fact, that Humvees cannot keep up with them). When Mosul erupted in November, with local police officers fleeing their stations as insurgents took control of the streets, several battalions of commandos sped to the city and restored order (or what passes for order in Iraq). When National Guard troops collapsed in Ramadi earlier this year, a battalion of commandos was rushed in. The commandos in Samarra will return to their base in Baghdad once their mission is completed -- or they will head to the next hot spot.
 Intriguingly, a reputation for severity can accomplish as much as severity itself. One day a troublesome local leader, Sheik Taha, arrived for a meeting with Adnan at Samarra's Town Hall. Lt. Col. Mark Wald, who commands the Third Infantry Brigade in the city, told me that Taha supported the insurgency but was reconsidering his options now that Adnan had arrived with his commandos. I assumed that Adnan conveyed a message to the sheik that was not dissimilar to his warning to the commando who found an arms cache -- do as I say or you will lose a precious body part. 
 After the meeting, I asked Adnan whether the sheik had agreed to fall in line.
 ''It is not important whether he is with us or against us,'' he growled in response. ''We are the authority. We are the government, and everybody must cooperate with us. He is beginning to cooperate with us.''
 Adnan's remarks were put into context for me by Wald, a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley. He pointed at the door behind which Adnan and Taha met. ''This is what I consider an Iraqi solution,'' he said. ''The beauty of an Iraqi solution is that they know how justice has been dealt with in the past years. They know what they are subject to. We are bound by laws. I think they are, too, but that doesn't mean a guy like Sheik Taha doesn't go in there fearing it's an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.''

No End in Sight
Paramilitary forces have a tendency to become politicized. Whereas the mission of army troops is national -- they exist to defend against foreign threats -- paramilitaries are used for internal combat. In the Middle East and elsewhere, they often serve the interests of the regime or of whatever faction in the regime controls them. (It is no accident that the commandos are run out of the Interior Ministry and not the Defense Ministry.) In a country as riven as Iraq -- with Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds and Turkmen vying for power -- a paramilitary force that is controlled by one faction can be a potent weapon against others. That is why the commandos are a conundrum -- in the country's unstable military and political landscape, it is impossible to know where they are heading.
 The commandos and their leaders insist that they are loyal to the government rather than to any political or religious group. ''There is no Sunni or Shia,'' Adnan told me, meaning that he does not pay attention to the religious origins of his men or the insurgents they hunt. ''Anyone who tries to stop Iraq from moving forward, I will fight them.'' Adnan's statement is predictable, but is it convincing? The commando chain of command is largely Sunni -- they were set up by a Sunni minister (Naqib) and are led by a Sunni general (Adnan). At this point, the commandos consist mainly of two brigades. The commander of one brigade is Rashid al-Halafi, who is Shiite but is regarded warily by other Shiites because he held senior intelligence posts under Saddam Hussein. The other brigade was founded by Gen. Muhammed Muther, a Sunni who commanded a tank regiment under Hussein.
 Of course, the commandos are an effective fighting force precisely because of their Sunni background. Sunnis occupied the top positions in Hussein's security apparatus and are, as a result, the country's most experienced fighters. They are particularly well suited to fight in the Sunni Triangle -- they have deep ties there and can extract more intelligence than outsiders, which is what Shiites and Kurds are considered in Samarra, Baqubah, Falluja, Ramadi and other insurgent strongholds. The Iraqi government improves its ability to fight the insurgents by bringing veteran Sunni military men on board.
 Their presence is useful politically, too: it makes it hard for the insurgency to claim that the government ignores Sunni interests. History has shown that the best way to end an insurgency is to bring insurgents or potential insurgents into the political system. The Salvadoran war ended with a 1991 peace accord between the government and the F.M.L.N., the rebel movement, which then grew into a legitimate political party. Similarly, the conflict in Northern Ireland came to an end with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which provided for power sharing with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army.
 The true loyalties of the commandos remain unclear, however. It is difficult to generalize about the reasons ex-Republican Guard generals and soldiers who are Sunni have joined the commandos. Loyalty to the Shiite-dominated government is a possibility. A larger consideration among the rank and file is a good paycheck (by Iraqi standards). Captain Bennett said that their desire to once again earn a living in their old line of work -- fighting in a professional military and being paid to do it -- is more important than warm feelings for the government.
 ''For some, there's definitely a desire to make Iraq better, but for a lot of them, it's just the life they know,'' he said. ''For most of them, the cause isn't really that important. They're more used to working in this role. This is what they know, this is all they know. I think they feel a lot better that their actions now are against genuine threats, as opposed to threats against the regime,'' meaning Hussein's government. ''But I think for a lot of them, they couldn't fathom doing something different with their lives.''
 Whatever the motivations, the integration of the commandos into the security forces stanches one flow of experienced fighters into the insurgency. Some commandos, and perhaps many of them, might have gravitated to the other side if their unemployment endured. ''It's human nature,'' said Casteel, the adviser to Naqib, the interior minister. ''If you cannot feed your family, you will find a way to feed your family.'' Naqib, Casteel explained, sees the commandos ''as a way to re-employ people who could be on the other side but have skills that can be used.''
 Yet their presence in the new security forces is not universally welcomed. Shiites and Kurds faced mass murder during Hussein's regime, and they are understandably concerned about giving a share of military power to Sunnis, especially those who served Hussein. They worry that a Sunni-led security force could be a Trojan horse for the return of oppression by Sunnis. Because Naqib chose Hussein-era military figures to lead the commandos, he made few friends among Shiites and Kurds in the interim government, and he is not expected to retain his portfolio in the government being formed by the new prime minister, Ibrahim Jafari, who is Shiite. As Haydar al-Abadi, an influential member of Jafari's Islamic Dawa Party, told The Wall Street Journal: ''The Baathists believe they are back, and that they can behave as before. People are afraid again.''
 If Jafari purges former Baathists, the commandos may lose their leaders, including Adnan. That would almost certainly test their loyalties. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, on a visit to Iraq in April, evoked those concerns, telling reporters, ''It's important that the new government be attentive to the competence of the people in the ministries, and that they avoid unnecessary turbulence.'' In the worst case, a purge could prompt some commandos to join the insurgency or evolve into a Sunni militia beyond government control. Already, Iraq has a Kurdish militia, the 90,000-strong pesh merga, outside the control of the central government; there is also the Badr Brigade, the Iranian-trained wing of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, which is Shiite; and there is the Mahdi Army, loyal to the Shiite militant Moktada al-Sadr. The last thing the country needs is another militia.
 It is a fraught situation -- a country at war without a unified and competent national army. And despite the improved security forces and the reduction in attacks on coalition forces, it is hard to see an end to the war any time soon. Just as the right political developments can tame an insurgency, so too can the wrong developments give new life to it. Arriving at the correct calibration of military force and political compromise is an excruciatingly difficult process. Historically, insurgencies have tended to last for at least 5 to 10 years; the endgame tends to begin when one or both sides become exhausted, and that rarely occurs after only a year or two.
 In El Salvador, Honduras, Peru, Turkey, Algeria and other crucibles of insurgency and counterinsurgency, the battles went on and on. They were, without exception, dirty wars.

HEADLINE: Never Shy, Bolton Brings a Zeal to the Table

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30 

 BODY:
In the tumultuous days before John R. Bolton graduated from Yale University in 1970, he and his roommates leaned mattresses against the windows to keep out stray tear gas shells.
 The trial of a top Black Panther in New Haven had ignited riots and set off a national uproar. The National Guard patrolled the campus in tanks. A bomb went off at the hockey rink.
 At commencement, student speakers compared the United States to pre-Nazi Germany and called for an immediate end to the war in Vietnam. 
 But one student sounded a contrarian theme.
 ''The conservative underground is alive and well here,'' Mr. Bolton told his classmates and their parents, scorning a handful of hecklers. ''If we do not make our influence felt, rest assured we will in the real world.''
 Mr. Bolton's prediction would prove true, and for no one more than for this brainy son of a Baltimore firefighter whose nomination as ambassador to the United Nations is now bitterly contested. Ten years after graduation, he would join the Reagan administration to begin what would become nearly two decades of service in Republican administrations.
 Seemingly untroubled by self doubt, Mr. Bolton, whom former Senator Jesse Helms once called ''the kind of man with whom I would want to stand at Armageddon,'' has never shied from a dispute nor hesitated to shatter a consensus. In his office he displays a grenade designating him as ''Truest Reaganaut,'' a telling gift from former colleagues at the United States Agency for International Development.
 From his battle, as a Justice Department official, for the doomed Supreme Court nomination of Robert H. Bork to his dramatic declaration to poll workers tabulating presidential ballots in Florida in 2000 -- ''I'm with the Bush-Cheney team and I'm here to stop the count'' -- Mr. Bolton has proved himself a fighter, fiercely committed to a bedrock American nationalism.
 But now his brash performance as under secretary of state threatens his nomination, as government officials high and low who have clashed with Mr. Bolton strike back. Complaints that he bullied intelligence analysts who rejected his views have particular weight with Congressional critics, who are still fuming that administration claims about Iraq's arsenal and Al Qaeda turned out to be wildly inaccurate.
 But as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee extends its consideration of Mr. Bolton's candidacy, President Bush has shown no sign of wavering in his determination to win confirmation for this least diplomatic of diplomats. 
 ''See, the U.N. needs reform,'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference on Thursday night. ''If you're interested in reform in the U.N. like I'm interested in reform in the U.N., it makes sense to put somebody who's skilled and who's not afraid to speak his mind at the United Nations.''
 Mr. Bolton, 56, has won loyalty from other bosses, too. They include former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, whom he served at the White House and the State Department and who summoned him to Florida for the recount, and Vice President Dick Cheney, who told an American Enterprise Institute audience after the 2000 election that Mr. Bolton deserved ''anything he wants'' in the new administration.
 He wins such plaudits partly because of an extreme work style that sometimes has him firing off e-mail messages to subordinates from home at 4 a.m. before arriving at the office at 6. In his current job, he has required staff members to stand -- along with him -- at morning meetings, to discourage long-winded discussions.
 ''When you go in to brief John Bolton, as I found out early, you better be prepared,'' said Thomas M. Boyd, who was Mr. Bolton's deputy when he was assistant attorney general in the Reagan Justice Department and who remains a friend. ''He's kind of like an appellate judge. He will read everything. If you have holes in your argument, he won't work with you.''
 He has also impressed superiors with his dogged pursuit of goals he believes in. As assistant secretary of state in the administration of the elder George Bush, he took on the task of repealing a United Nations General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism, long resented by Israel and its American supporters. 
 For several weeks in 1991, Mr. Bolton devoted himself to what he called the ''ZR campaign,'' according to one person who worked on it. Countries were singled out one by one, with Mr. Bolton systematically pursuing their ambassadors and tracking the results on charts until the vote -- an unexpectedly lopsided 111 to 25.
 ''He's tough and he's relentless and he's very logical,'' said Frank J. Donatelli, a Republican consultant who has worked with Mr. Bolton both in government and party operations. ''But I've never observed any kind of abusive behavior.''
 What really puts off Mr. Bolton's critics, Mr. Donatelli said, are his firm views. ''Even in the Reagan administration, John would usually be the most conservative person in the room,'' he said.
 The drive and ideological certainty that admirers believe make Mr. Bolton effective strike his critics as excessive. Avis T. Bohlen, who worked under Mr. Bolton as assistant secretary of state for arms control, said she agreed with several of his initiatives, including scuttling a protocol to the international ban on biological weapons. But she thought the United States should work with European allies to find a better approach to preventing biological weapons. Mr. Bolton did not.
 ''He was absolutely clear that he didn't want any more arms control agreements,'' Ms. Bohlen said. ''He didn't want any negotiating bodies. He just cut it off. It was one more area where we lost support and respect in the world.''
 In handling disagreements, too, Ms. Bohlen said, Mr. Bolton sometimes went over the line. ''What I find unfortunate is that he had a tendency to go after the little guys,'' she said. ''I think Bolton is a bully.''
 The same traits, and the same divided views of them, go all the way back to Baltimore's McDonogh School, where Mr. Bolton discovered his intellectual gifts and his fascination with politics. 
 Raised in a working-class row house neighborhood in southwest Baltimore called Yale Heights -- a far cry from the university where he would earn undergraduate and law degrees -- Mr. Bolton won a scholarship to McDonogh, then an all-male military school. 
 That modest background is a key to his personality, some associates say. ''He didn't come from money,'' said Mr. Boyd, his former subordinate. ''Sometimes when you push the rock up the hill, you're hungrier. You have more of a drive to succeed.''
 From seventh grade on, he boarded at McDonogh, returning home on weekends to his father, Jack, who had been wounded in Normandy on D-Day, and his mother, Virginia, a homemaker. They also had a daughter, Joni, who is nine years younger and now works as a nurse near Baltimore.
 ''He had the same attitudes and beliefs then and now,'' said Marty McKibbin, 77, who taught at McDonogh for 46 years but still recalls clearly his debates with John Bolton about the Vietnam War in Asian history class and at lunch. ''It's kind of surprising that Yale and Yale Law School and Washington, D.C., didn't change him much.''
 In 1966, Mr. Bolton, who has said he privately called the liberal teacher ''Mao McKibbin,'' wrote an editorial for the school paper titled ''No Peace in Vietnam,'' warning against ''spurious'' hopes for a settlement. When he stepped down as associate editor after his senior year, an unsigned notice of thanks said: ''John Bolton has attacked his duties with the fervor of a political fanatic. His efficient, if sometimes controversial, management of the editorial page deserves more than conservative applause.''
 Ed Wroe, another McDonogh scholarship student, recalls John Bolton's fervor for the 1964 presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater. ''When you hear people describe him as abrasive, you think, 'That sounds like John Bolton,''' said Mr. Wroe, an attorney in Idaho. ''He didn't worry about what people thought of him.''
 But Dr. Bruce K. Krueger, his Yale roommate for five years and now a physiologist at the University of Maryland medical school, recalls Mr. Bolton as a far more pleasant character. ''He might say something provocative -- everyone else in the room might disagree with it -- but he'd have something solid and well-reasoned to back it up.''
 Dr. Krueger said Mr. Bolton was the only conservative in their six-member suite and one of a shrinking minority of such students on campus. Yet Mr. Bolton seemed to enjoy his status as David versus the campus's liberal Goliath, Dr. Krueger said. ''I thought he kind of liked that role -- the loner, the sole counterpoint in the room.'' 
 Mr. Bolton joined the National Guard, in which he served for six years, before graduation. ''I confess that I had no desire to die in a Southeast Asia rice paddy,'' he wrote in a recollection for his 25-year Yale reunion, in part because he felt that the war in Vietnam was ''already lost'' because of antiwar sentiment among Americans. 
 Today, associates describe Mr. Bolton as an avid reader, particularly of history and biography, and a political junkie. They describe him as a very private person who is devoted to his wife, Gretchen, a financial planner, and their daughter, Jennifer, who now attends Yale. When mother and daughter head off on ski trips, he stays behind.
 ''He can appear to be very stern,'' said Mr. Boyd, his former Justice Department colleague. ''I think that's a product of his reserve. He's got a great sense of humor, a great cackle of a laugh -- but he has to trust you.''
 In the loose shorthand of the news media, Mr. Bolton has sometimes been described as a neoconservative. That's wrong, said Gary Schmitt, executive director of the Project for a New American Century, a conservative strategy group.
 The neoconservatives believe in spreading democracy; Mr. Bolton, with a less idealistic view of other countries' potential, prefers to focus on threats to the United States, Mr. Schmitt said. ''He's a straightforward, traditional, national security conservative,'' he said.
 On the Balkans, for instance, ''John's view was that we didn't have a dog in that fight,'' Mr. Schmitt said. In Iraq, Mr. Bolton favored overthrowing Saddam Hussein. But, Mr. Schmitt said, ''I think he would say we should not be in the business of transforming Iraq.''
 In a recent interview with the McDonogh School magazine headlined ''The Patriot,'' Mr. Bolton, who is not talking to reporters during the confirmation period, defined his job as keeping American interests clearly in sight.
 ''Frequently you hear diplomacy described as a skill of keeping things calm and stable and so on, and there's an element of that,'' he said. ''But basically, American diplomats should be advocates of the United States. That's the style I pursue.''

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Sunday with an article about the background and career of John R. Bolton misidentified the Senate committee before which he was testifying about his nomination as ambassador to the United Nations. It was the Foreign Relations Committee, not Armed Services.

A front-page profile on May 1 about John R. Bolton, President Bush's nominee as ambassador to the United Nations, referred incorrectly to National Guard deployment near Yale during riots related to a Black Panther trial just before Mr. Bolton graduated there in 1970. Contemporary news accounts reported that guardsmen were deployed in armored personnel carriers, not tanks. Those accounts also said the personnel carriers patrolled the outskirts of New Haven, not the actual campus.

HEADLINE: For Buffett, The One That Got Away

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
TOMORROW morning, Warren E. Buffett and his board will gather in Omaha to consider the merits of three executives he considers likely to succeed him one day as Berkshire Hathaway's chief executive. Their names are still a closely guarded secret, but all the candidates work for Berkshire and none are older than 60. 
 The directors' conclave is routine, part of an assessment of potential successors that Mr. Buffett conducts after Berkshire's annual meetings, the most recent of which was yesterday. But as Mr. Buffett approaches his 75th birthday, the financial powerhouse he began assembling 40 years ago confronts challenges that are anything but routine.
 Berkshire has amassed a $43 billion stockpile of cash and other liquid assets that it has been unable to unleash. Its core insurance operation is emerging from an unusually tumultuous period. And then there is the General Re Corporation, its largest acquisition -- and its biggest black eye. Not only has the payoff from that 1988 purchase failed to materialize, but General Re has also been swept up recently in regulatory investigations of insurance industry abuses. 
 Berkshire is expected to overcome each of these challenges, some sooner than others. And Mr. Buffett, whose personal fortune exceeds $40 billion, has a rare combination of discipline and insight that has allowed him to produce stellar returns for decades. But in the unforgiving argot of insurance actuaries, there is now both mortality and morbidity risk surrounding this legendary money manager. This year, perhaps more than in others of recent memory, his longevity looms large. 
 ''A lot of what makes Berkshire tick is Mr. Buffett,'' said Keith Buckley, a managing director at Fitch Ratings, a firm that monitors insurers. ''They are one of the only companies I can think of where they can have that much cash and can say to investors to be patient because they know when the time will come to use it properly. That's entirely because of Mr. Buffett's presence.''
 Fitch recently downgraded Berkshire's credit outlook to ''negative'' from ''stable,'' noting in a research report that Fitch ''does not believe that Mr. Buffett's talents can be easily replaced, or that Berkshire's current strategies would be sustainable in his absence.''
 Like a veteran poker player with deep pockets, Mr. Buffett is known for pushing in his chips whenever he believes he holds great cards -- and for simply folding until he sees a deal that meets his standards. But what happens to the game, and to a company that so directly reflects its founder's fertile imagination, when the champion no longer sits at the table? 
 While there are many avenues for exploring Mr. Buffett's storied career, the $22 billion General Re acquisition is instructive for what it says about Berkshire's operations, strategic goals and future.
 ''I think Buffett's had a remarkable track record as an acquirer, and I don't think it's one that should or will be overwhelmed by what's happened at General Re,'' said Robert F. Bruner, a finance professor at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business. ''But how is it that the world's greatest investor would buy such a Pandora's box of problems?''
 INSURANCE is an industry with about as much outward magnetism as drying paint. It is loosely regulated, prone to lax underwriting standards and, of course, cash rich. But Mr. Buffett saw many years ago that if he could get his hands on the torrents of money washing through an insurer, while cautiously managing the underlying business to prevent losses, he would have hefty sums to do what he loves most: buy great stocks and companies.
 ''The typical 'entrance' strategy for acquisitions at Berkshire is to buy a company with great economic characteristics: no debt, a robust balance sheet and positive cash flow,'' he writes in the foreword to ''The Pampered Chef,'' a soon-to-be-published book about the company of the same name that was one of his recent small acquisitions. ''That's important because here at Berkshire we have no 'exit' strategies. We buy great businesses to keep. My job is to stay out of the way.''
 Mr. Buffett has already made long-term investments in an assemblage of well-known companies: Gillette, Coca-Cola, American Express, the Washington Post Company, Moody's, Wells Fargo and H&R Block, among others. When Anheuser-Busch announced 10 days ago that Berkshire had bought a stake in it, the company's shares jumped.
 Mr. Buffett's scorecard as an investor-manager is so statistically anomalous as to be almost freakish. Since 1965, Berkshire's stock has annually outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in all but six years (and Mr. Buffett had already racked up huge returns as a private money manager starting in 1956). No other thoroughbreds of modern investing -- including Peter Lynch and William H. Miller III -- have come close to that achievement. Mr. Buffett is the industry's Secretariat.
 Despite the passage of time, Mr. Buffett, who has said he enjoys his craft so much that he tap-dances to work, remains sharp-witted, and he is clearly itching to leap into the fray again. ''What Charlie and I would like is a little action now,'' Mr. Buffett said in Berkshire's annual report this year, referring to the company's vice chairman, Charles T. Munger, who is 81. ''We don't enjoy sitting on $43 billion of cash equivalents that are earning paltry returns. Instead, we yearn to buy more fractional interests similar to those we now own or -- better still -- more large businesses outright. 
 ''We will do either, however, only when purchases can be made at prices that offer us the prospect of a reasonable return on our investment,'' Mr. Buffett added.
 General Re, a large insurance concern, certainly seemed to fit that bill when Mr. Buffett bought it seven years ago. It specializes in reinsurance, which is what larger insurers buy to protect themselves from outsized losses on risky policies. Mr. Buffett knew General Re well: it had helped to bail out Geico when that company was on verge of bankruptcy and Mr. Buffett had begun accumulating Geico stock.
 Mr. Buffett's rationale for buying General Re centered on the company's ''float'' -- the difference between policy premiums it collected and payments it had to make on claims. As long as the underwriting business could produce float at a break-even cost, the excess cash could land in Mr. Buffett's hands and be put to work, ideally for outsized returns. 
 In 1998, the year it bought General Re, Berkshire had earnings of $2.8 billion on revenue of about $13.8 billion, a clear indication that it had swelled into a much larger enterprise than the tiny textile maker it was in the 1960's. And it would balloon even more: last year, the company earned $7.3 billion on revenue of $74.4 billion. 
 Many money managers can be strangled by success. As they chalk up large gains, they have more money to put to work. But as their portfolio blossoms, it becomes more difficult to find investments that deliver big enough returns to have much effect on overall performance. They become victims of size, forced to steer an aircraft carrier when they once maneuvered a destroyer.
 Mr. Lynch, after a heady 13-year run at the Fidelity Magellan fund, gave up the reins in 1990 because he found it infinitely harder and more exhausting to be at the top of the charts than when he began. (Those who have run Magellan after him haven't matched his performance.)
 Mr. Buffett first confronted that kind of quandary years ago but stayed in the game, adding to his legend by continuing to post strong results. His ability to pick winning stocks and well-run companies did not falter, and General Re appeared to be a large acquisition that would make good use of Berkshire's resources. General Re's buoyant float and its pristine, conservative reputation seemed to match up well with Mr. Buffett's skills. 
 But little went right at General Re after Berkshire took over.
 The insurer was slammed by an almost ceaseless series of underwriting losses, totaling about $7.5 billion from 1999 to 2002. Troubles that began with a thorny debacle involving workers' compensation claims culminated with the collapse of the World Trade Center towers in the September 2001 terrorist attacks. General Re, a major insurer of the twin towers, absorbed nearly $2 billion in claims on the tragedy.
 As dowdy as the insurance business may seem, beneath the surface it can often be a financial chess match that engages gifted oddsmakers like Mr. Buffett. The borders of high-stakes insurance matches are defined by catastrophes like hurricanes and earthquakes. For companies to play the match well, however, requires accurate assumptions about the likelihood of various disasters and the proper pricing of policies and establishment of reserves to reflect those assumptions.
 At the time Mr. Buffet bought it, General Re was playing a bad game of chess. It priced policies poorly, set inadequate reserve levels and had bloated expenses because of the desire of the company's chief executive, Ronald E. Ferguson, to grow the business relentlessly, according to analysts and insurance industry executives. Mr. Ferguson declined repeated interview requests.
 Instead of enhancing Berkshire's performance, General Re inflicted financial damage on it. Berkshire earnings fell to $795 million in 2001 from $3.3 billion a year earlier. And Mr. Buffett, while not the primary author of many of General Re's operating woes, accepted responsibility for some of them in his 2001 letter to Berkshire shareholders.
 ''We had either overlooked or dismissed the possibility of large-scale terrorism losses,'' he wrote. ''Why, you might ask, didn't I recognize the above facts before Sept. 11? The answer, sadly, is that I did, but I didn't convert thought into action. 
 ''I violated the Noah rule: Predicting rain doesn't count; building arks does. I consequently let Berkshire operate with a dangerous level of risk, at General Re in particular.''
 While General Re's huge losses hurt Berkshire, they did not wipe out the company, as they might have any other franchise that lacked its thick financial armor.
 But other standards at General Re were also slipping. The company is now under regulatory investigation in the United States and abroad for possible financial manipulation several years ago involving the American International Group and other insurers. Australian regulators have banned several executives of General Re from the insurance market there; none of its United States executives have been charged with wrongdoing.
 Mr. Buffett is not a target of those investigations, but he has cooperated as a witness. People with direct knowledge of the inquiries say that there is no evidence Mr. Buffett had prior knowledge of any questionable transactions involving General Re or other Berkshire insurance subsidiaries.
 Mr. Buffett has weathered other Berkshire insurance scandals, including a dust-up in the 1970's involving rogue salesmen selling bogus policies. That episode rattled Mr. Buffett, who values his reputation as much as he does his stock-picking prowess. There have been other bad acquisitions, too, including loss-plagued buyouts in the early 1990's of shoe companies that ignored the threat of competition from abroad.
 NONETHELESS, Mr. Buffett has astute faculties for assessing the financial promise of companies he screens and well-developed antennas for evaluating more intuitive matters, like market dominance, customer loyalty and quality of management.
 Because Mr. Buffett has been right so many more times than he has been wrong, he tends to have an unshakable faith in his own judgment when making an acquisition. Unlike other big acquirers, he doesn't send in swarms of investment bankers and auditors to evaluate a target. Berkshire bought General Re without exhaustively scrubbing the company for potential problems, people with direct knowledge of the transaction say.
 Munger, Tolles & Olson, Berkshire's law firm, represented the company in the General Re transaction. Ronald L. Olson, a Munger, Tolles partner, is a Berkshire board member and is said by people close to the company to play an influential role in helping Mr. Buffett anoint a successor. Mr. Olson, who also represents Berkshire in the various regulatory investigations, did not return calls seeking comment.
 Kevin Lampo, an insurance analyst at Edward D. Jones & Company, said: ''Warren Buffett's due diligence is about having faith in the management of the team he acquires. But I'm not sure they could have done the kind of due diligence at General Re that they needed to do anyway because it took a number of years for these problems to come out.''
 Insurance executives with direct knowledge of the matter say Mr. Buffett may have faltered in the General Re acquisition by placing too much faith in Mr. Ferguson. According to three people with direct knowledge of the events, Mr. Ferguson, who has a reputation for Calvinistic rectitude, was not running his business as conservatively as he appeared to be and had a clearer understanding than Mr. Buffett that some of General Re's highflying sales representatives and executives had been granted too much latitude.
 Even after problems began to surface, Mr. Buffett stood by Mr. Ferguson, in keeping with his belief in total loyalty to the management of companies he acquires. When Mr. Ferguson suffered a brain hemorrhage in 1999, Mr. Buffett chose not to use the occasion to relieve him of his responsibilities. Instead, he waited until Mr. Ferguson offered to step down in early 2001 before replacing him with Joseph P. Brandon.
 Since Mr. Brandon took the helm, General Re has been running its business more cautiously. The company has booked strong underwriting gains in the last two years and is poised to deliver on the potential it held when Mr. Buffett acquired it. But that reintroduces another wrinkle: Mr. Buffett's advancing years.
 The market conditions that have prevented Mr. Buffett from deploying Berkshire's mountain of cash have also prevented him from taking advantage of General Re's $23 billion float. Unless a crop of big bargains emerges relatively soon, it may be Mr. Buffett's successor who has to go shopping with Berkshire's billions.
 For as large as Berkshire is, it is run almost like a sprawling family business, and a successor will inherit that structure as well. ''It's an unusual company because so much of what Buffett does is on the investment side; he has people who report to him but he doesn't run the businesses,'' said David Schiff, an insurance analyst who publishes a newsletter, Schiff's Insurance Observer. ''It's hard to say what the corporate model is because it's been unique to him. It's run by nice, honest people who don't care about earnings per share and do care about the long-term creation of value.''
 So far, Berkshire's model has not been flawless, but it has worked enormously well. Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, a group that analyzes corporate governance issues, gives Berkshire top marks for its compensation, accounting and decision-making practices. She gives the company's board, which includes one of Mr. Buffett's sons, low marks for having too many directors who are close to Mr. Buffett. (One son, Howard, is designated to become nonexecutive chairman when Mr. Buffett dies.) But she said Berkshire's overall performance trumps cronyism on its board.
 ''You can't apply the same standard to Berkshire that you use for almost every other company, because Berkshire's primary asset is Warren Buffett's brain,'' said Ms. Minow, who owns three Berkshire shares her father gave her years ago. ''I think he is as committed to creating shareholder value as anyone who's ever lived. I'd be happy to clone him and make him C.E.O. of every company.''
 WHETHER Berkshire can create an actual clone of Mr. Buffett is doubtful, but analysts and others close to the company speculate that there are three well-regarded executives who are front-runners to succeed him: Mr. Brandon; Ajit Jain, who runs Berkshire's other core insurance operations; and David L. Sokol, chief executive of another Berkshire subsidiary, MidAmerican Energy Holdings. 
 Among the three, Mr. Jain has drawn the most lavish public praise from Mr. Buffett over the years, but regulators in Australia are examining one of Mr. Jain's insurance units in connection with possible regulatory problems there. It is unclear whether that investigation could complicate Mr. Jain's ascent. Mr. Buffett is said by people close to him to retain an unwavering confidence in Mr. Jain's integrity and abilities.
 A more realistic complication for Mr. Jain or others who may step into Mr. Buffett's shoes is that they will inevitably have their investing performance measured against Mr. Buffett's. Perhaps to dampen expectations, Mr. Buffett suggested four years ago that given how much both Berkshire and the world had changed, even Warren Buffett would have trouble competing with Warren Buffett.
 ''One final thought about Berkshire: In the future we won't come close to replicating our past record,'' he wrote in his 2001 letter to shareholders. ''To be sure, Charlie and I will strive for above-average performance and will not be satisfied with less. But two conditions at Berkshire are far different from what they once were: Then, we could often buy businesses and securities at much lower valuations than now prevail; and more important, we were then working with far less money than we now have.''

HEADLINE: Social Security: Help for the Poor Or Help for All?

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and EDUARDO PORTER; Edmund L. Andrews reported from Washington for this article, and Eduardo Porter from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30 

 BODY:
In attempting to fix Social Security's long-term problems without raising taxes, President Bush has chosen to recast the 70-year-old retirement program as one that would keep the lowest-income workers out of poverty but become increasingly irrelevant to the middle class and the affluent.
 Under Mr. Bush's approach of ''progressive indexation,'' a typical low-income worker who earns about $16,000 a year today would be entitled to retirement benefits equal to about 49 percent of his or her wages, the same amount that is promised today.
 But those earning an average income, about $36,500 in today's dollars, would see big changes. Instead of replacing 36 percent of that person's working pay, as promised under today's system, benefits would cover only 26 percent of pay by 2075. And people who earn $90,000 a year in today's dollars would continue to pay as much as ever in taxes but would receive benefits equal to only 12 percent of their pay. 
 From the beginning, Mr. Bush has adamantly opposed alternative plans that would restore Social Security's solvency by raising taxes. While Mr. Bush has not ruled out an increase in the ceiling on income that is subject to payroll taxes, now $90,000, the idea is anathema to him and most Republicans.
 ''I know some rich people, and if you ask them whether they would rather have a tax increase or their benefits cut, they'll immediately say, 'Cut the benefits,''' said Representative Bill Thomas of California, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 In choosing to preserve benefits for the less well off and not raise taxes on more affluent people, Mr. Bush sought to cast himself in the Democrats' traditional role as a defender of the poor. In his radio address on Saturday, he said: ''By providing more generous benefits for low-income retirees, we'll make good on this commitment: If you work hard and pay into Social Security your entire life, you will not retire into poverty.''
 But critics, including most Democratic lawmakers, say that such an approach would undermine a central bargain conceived during the New Deal: that Social Security is not just a welfare program for the poor but a form of social insurance that people at all income levels pay into and reap rewards from.
 ''Social Security is not a poverty program, it is a retirement system people have worked hard for, paid into and have earned,'' said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan.
 If it becomes increasingly irrelevant for middle-income people, the critics warn, Social Security will eventually become little more than an empty shell.
 Democratic lawmakers have refused to propose an alternative plan unless Mr. Bush abandons his demand for replacing part of Social Security with individual investment accounts.
 But one of the most widely discussed alternatives is still on the table: imposing Social Security taxes on earnings above $90,000 a year.
 That one change would affect 6 percent of all workers, the very highest earners, but actuarial experts estimate that it would raise almost enough money to eliminate the projected shortfall without needing to cut benefits at all.
 The two competing approaches -- concentrating future benefits on the poor, versus raising taxes on the wealthy -- are almost mirror opposites.
 Under ''progressive indexation,'' an idea developed by Robert C. Pozen, an investment executive in Boston, the role of Social Security would gradually shrink over the next century. Adding private accounts to the smaller guaranteed payments for retirees, supporters say, would soften the blow from scaling back the system to keep it fiscally sound. 
 By contrast, raising the ceiling on payroll taxes would maintain the system's solvency just as well, if not better, while allowing it to pay out substantial retirement benefits to the 30 million more people expected to be added to the rolls from the ranks of the nation's aging baby boomers.
 How would the president's ''progressive indexation'' work?
 As envisioned by Mr. Pozen, a Democrat who served on Mr. Bush's Social Security advisory commission in 2001, benefits for about 70 percent of workers would be indexed, at least in part, to increases in consumer prices rather than to increases in average wages.
 Because wages have been rising about 1 percentage point a year faster than prices, the change would mean that retirement benefits for middle- and upper-middle-class Americans would climb in nominal terms much more slowly than currently promised.
 While the buying power of those monthly benefits, adjusted for inflation, would remain steady, they would replace smaller and smaller shares of a person's working wages.
 As a result, people without other sources of retirement income would experience a sharp plunge in their living standards as soon as they stopped working. Compared with future working Americans, such retirees living during the same period would slip further and further behind. 
 Under Mr. Pozen's plan, for example, Social Security benefits for a typical low-income worker -- someone making $16,000 today -- would keep pace with wages and continue to replace about 49 percent of the person's working income.
 But people with incomes in the top 70 percent of the earnings ladder would experience big changes. Where Social Security benefits now replace about 36 percent of earnings for an average-income worker, who earns about $36,500 a year, the Pozen plan would replace only 26 percent of earnings by 2075. According to calculations by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, using Social Security Administration projections, that would translate to a cut of 28 percent, or $7,629 a year, compared with benefits promised under current law.
 For a person who consistently earns $90,000 a year, in today's dollars, promised benefits would be trimmed 49 percent by 2075 and would replace only 12 percent of earnings.
 For all the partisan warfare over Social Security, both supporters and opponents of Mr. Bush's effort increasingly emphasize the need to strengthen the ''progressive'' aspect of the program to provide disproportionate benefits to low-income workers.
 In an interview earlier this week, Mr. Pozen said that today's retirement system is unfairly tilted in favor of the affluent. Not only do high-income people have longer life expectancies, meaning they collect Social Security benefits for more years, but they also benefit disproportionately from tax breaks for pensions and individual retirement plans like 401(k) plans.
 ''Low-wage workers depend almost entirely on Social Security for retirement income,'' Mr. Pozen said. ''Today, we have a very regressive system from the point of view of government support for retirement.''
 But Democratic opponents of Mr. Bush's approach say the issues of fairness and inequality could be just as easily addressed by raising taxes on the wealthy. Josh Bivens, an economist at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said Social Security revenues had been undermined because income inequality has dramatically increased over the past 20 years.
 One consequence, he said, is that more and more wages are spilling over the ceiling on income that is subject to Social Security taxes. In 1983, when the ceiling was set at $37,500, 90 percent of wages and salaries were subject to taxes. But in the last four years, only 85 percent of wages have been covered.
 If the ceiling were raised to cover 90 percent of earnings, Mr. Bivens estimated, the government would cover about one-third of its projected shortfall over the next 75 years. 
 Instead, under Mr. Pozen's approach, benefits would be gradually curtailed for anybody earning more than $25,000 a year. Peter A. Diamond, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a co-author of a rival plan to shore up Social Security, noted that about two-thirds of people over the age of 65 rely on Social Security for more than half of their income.
 ''While the presentation makes it sound as if the benefit cuts only happen to people who can afford it,'' Mr. Diamond said, ''in fact the implications are wider and deeper and more important than appears on the surface.''
 Representative Jim McCrery, Republican of Louisiana and chairman of the House Subcommittee on Social Security, said progressive indexation was in some ways a return to the original idea that Social Security should be a safety net for the elderly.
 ''The purpose of Social Security was to prevent the elderly from falling into abject poverty,'' Mr. McCrery said on Friday. ''To me, the president's remarks indicated he wanted to make sure that the primary purpose of Social Security remains a central goal of any reform.''


GRAPHIC: Chart: ''Who Would See Reduced Benefits''Under a proposal for Social Security called ''progressive indexation,'' which Mr. Bush embraced last week, workers at the lower end of the income range would receive the full benefits promised them under current law. Workers with higher incomes would see reductions in the benefits they are currently promised. Both the White House and Robert C. Pozen, an investment executive who first proposed the idea, argue that a more relevant comparison is with the lower benefits that workers would see after the Social Security trust fund runs out in 2041, when benefits are projected to be less than 75 percent of what is currently promised.Low$16,428 in 2005Worker's earnings: $16,428Year(s) of retirement at age 65: 2015, 2025, 2035, 2045, 2055, 2075Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 100%Reduction: 0Medium$36,507 in 3005Worker's earnings: $36,507Year of retirement at age 65: 2015Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 99%Reduction: -1%Worker's earnings: $36,507Year of retirement at age 65: 2025Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 94Reduction: -6Worker's earnings: $36,507Year of retirement at age 65: 2035Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 89Reduction: -12Worker's earnings: $36,507Year of retirement at age 65: 2045Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 84Reduction: -16Worker's earnings: $36,507Year of retirement at age 65: 2055Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 79Reduction: -21Worker's earnings: $36,507Year of retirement at age 65: 2075Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 72Reduction: -28High$58,411 in 2005Worker's earnings: $58,411Year of retirement at age 65: 2015Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 99%Reduction: -1%Worker's earnings: $58,411Year of retirement at age 65: 2025Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 90Reduction: -10Worker's earnings: $58,411Year of retirement at age 65: 2035Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 83Reduction: -17Worker's earnings: $58,411Year of retirement at age 65: 2045Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 76Reduction: -25Worker's earnings: $58,411Year of retirement at age 65: 2055Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 69Reduction: -31Worker's earnings: $58,411Year of retirement at age 65: 2075Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 58Reduction: -42Maximum$90,000 or more in 2005Worker's earnings: $90,000 or more in 2015Year of retirement at age 65: 2015Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 99%Reduction: -1%Worker's earnings: $90,000 or more in 2005Year of retirement at age 65: 2025Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 89Reduction: -11Worker's earnings: $90,000 or more in 2005Year of retirement at age 65: 2035Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 80Reduction: -21Worker's earnings: $90,000 or more in 2005Year of retirement at age 65: 2045Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 71Reduction: -29Worker's earnings: $90,000 or more in 2005Year of retirement at age 65: 2055Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 63Reduction: -37Worker's earnings: $90,000 or more in 2005Year of retirement at age 65: 2075Benefits under progressive indexing as a percentage of benefits promised under current law: 51Reduction: -49Figures may not add to 100 because of rounding(Source by Social Security Administration [changes in benefits]

HEADLINE: Is There Life After 'Star Wars' for Lucasfilm?

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
HERE is a question fit for Yoda: Now that the director George Lucas has finished the last of his six ''Star Wars'' movies, what will become of his company, Lucasfilm, the entertainment empire that Anakin Skywalker built?
 To hear Mr. Lucas tell it, Lucasfilm will be less ambitious, not more. There will be no more live-action, blockbuster movies, he said, and that means fewer peaks and troughs. In the past, the company's profits would soar during years when a ''Star Wars'' film was released, only to fall off a cliff between movies. 
 From now on, he said, Lucasfilm will be a ''widget driven'' enterprise, churning out books, video games and television shows, with a more predictable rate of return of 10 to 20 percent a year. Eventually, he said, the hit-driven cult of personality surrounding both him and ''Star Wars'' will give way to ''a sane reality.'' 
 ''I have no intention of running a film company,'' said Mr. Lucas, whose new film, ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith,'' will be released this month. ''That is the last thing in the world I'd do.''
 ''I'm trying to get back to that place that the company functions without me and 'Star Wars,' where they don't need some genius at the head to run the company,'' this multibillionaire added. ''What I am doing is so I don't need to be a visionary.''
 But as Lucasfilm enters its post-''Star Wars'' phase, it is far from clear whether the handpicked executives who have worked so closely with Mr. Lucas for decades will emerge as leaders in their own right. More to the point, those who know him wonder how much control he is ready to give up. 
 Mr. Lucas, 61, started the company in 1971 in Marin County, north of San Francisco, as a production vehicle for his movies, but he has since compiled a dizzying array of entertainment businesses that would make any Hollywood studio chief jealous. They include video games (LucasArts), special effects (Industrial Light and Magic), sound editing (Skywalker Sound) and ''Star Wars'' product licensing (Lucas Licensing).
 As the sole owner of Lucasfilm, a company that analysts estimate has nearly $1 billion in annual revenue and virtually no debt, Mr. Lucas has no one to answer to -- and he can manage the transition from ''Star Wars'' as he sees fit. ''I don't have to do anything,'' he said in an interview last week from his office at Skywalker Ranch near San Rafael, Calif. ''I can work for a year to get the company in gear without rationalizing it.'' 
 Over the next several months, he said, he plans to concentrate on revving up future projects, including two recently announced ''Star Wars'' television series. The goal, he said, is to build the Lucasfilm archives with hundreds of hours of digital programming, so that one day the company's executives can start their own television channel or form some other new concern. 
 COLLEAGUES who have known Mr. Lucas the longest said a revamping of the company -- including a rethinking of his own role -- was inevitable. ''Is it a time of change? Yes,'' said Jim Morris, a 17-year Lucasfilm veteran who oversaw its special effects and sound divisions before he joined Pixar Animation Studios last year as a producer. ''Are there issues with him letting go? Probably. But when you take the whole package, I wouldn't bet against him. In George's mind, he would see, over time, building a creative bench.'' 
 Above all, he said, ''George wants options.'' And those options include, of course, taking the company public one day. 
 This summer, Lucasfilm's roughly 1,500 employees will move into the Letterman Digital Arts Center, the company's newly built headquarters in San Francisco. Mr. Lucas spared no expense in designing the $350 million campus, which is in the Presidio, a former military base, and offers sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge. He added, among other things, a serpentine creek constructed from the remnants of a stream bed he bought from a Northern California farmer.
 Some Lucasfilm employees have protested the move to the new headquarters, saying they would have to uproot their families in Marin County or suffer a commute of an hour or more. But several top executives say that having nearly all the employees together in one facility for the first time, far from the mystique of Skywalker Ranch and Mr. Lucas, may aid the evolution to a less Lucas-dependent environment.
 ''It makes clear sense to be looking at a life without George to some degree,'' said Howard Roffman, president of Lucas Licensing, who joined the company in 1980 and has served both as Lucasfilm's general counsel and chief operating officer over the years. 
 Alan Keith, vice president for administration at Lucasfilm, added: ''George's challenge is coming up with the next creative generation.''
 Over lunch at the dining hall at Big Rock, Lucasfilm's corporate campus next to Skywalker Ranch, Micheline Chau, the president and chief operating officer, said Mr. Lucas began thinking about overhauling the company in 2002, just after the release of ''Attack of the Clones,'' the fifth ''Star Wars'' film made.
 Back then, the company was criticized for several missteps, she said. Licensees were stung by lackluster merchandise sales after the release of ''The Phantom Menace'' in 1999 and were worried about more of the same with ''Attack of the Clones.'' Poorly conceived ''Star Wars'' video games flooded the market, turning off fans. And I.L.M., the special-effects division, was facing increasing competition as filmmakers became more adept at creating their own effects. 
 Lucasfilm executives were getting antsy, too. Some left; others sought new opportunities. ''We wanted to set ourselves up after 'Episode III,''' said Mr. Keith, referring to the new film, ''Revenge of the Sith,'' the sixth in the series but third in the chronology.
 Mr. Lucas faced a similar quandary before and after the release of ''Return of the Jedi'' in 1983, when many people were predicting the demise of both ''Star Wars'' and Lucasfilm. During a noon meeting in 2002 in Mr. Lucas's office overlooking a vineyard and an artificial lake, Ms. Chao recalled recently, she posed this question to him: ''What do we want to be?'' 
 In a sense, Lucasfilm has always served two masters: Mr. Lucas and everyone else. I.L.M., and Skywalker Sound earn the bulk of their revenue working for people other than Mr. Lucas. Skywalker Sound, for instance, derives at least 90 percent of its business from audio post-production for films. In the last 10 years, almost 90 percent of I.L.M.'s business has been for non-''Star Wars'' movies.
 By contrast, the video game maker LucasArts and Lucas Licensing have concentrated mainly on creating and distributing ''Star Wars'' merchandise. 
 Indeed, the ''Star Wars'' movies and products have generated most of the profits. All told, the movies have earned revenue of more than $3.4 billion at the worldwide box office, which includes $1.8 billion in the United States. The company has reported sales of $9 billion in merchandise. Lucasfilm has also sold 130 million ''Star Wars'' DVD's. ''The success of 'Star Wars' has allowed George to do many things,'' said Jim Gianopulos, chairman at Fox Filmed Entertainment, which distributes Mr. Lucas's movies.
 Ms. Chau's conversation with Mr. Lucas prompted two years of talks involving them and other top executives, resulting in the mandate to make the company driven less by both ''Star Wars'' and Mr. Lucas. While major decisions are not made without consulting the director, Ms. Chau and others have much leeway. ''We are not a democracy,'' she said. Still, she added, ''We've never been, 'What would George think?' We've never run our businesses like that. We have to stand on our own two feet.'' 
 THE technological heart of Lucasfilm is I.L.M., the place where many of Mr. Lucas's most interesting concepts are born. Pixar Animation Studios, for one, got its start there. (It was sold to Steven P. Jobs, the Apple Computer co-founder, in 1986.) Some of I.L.M.'s advanced film-editing technology was sold to Avid Technology in 1991 and became a cornerstone of that company.
 I.L.M. has worked on the ''Harry Potter'' and ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' movies, among others. But in recent years, the division's dominance in special effects has been tested as competitors have blossomed.
 Chrissie England, the president of I.L.M., said the effects division would be more flexible in the future. It has already lent some visual-effects supervisors and producers to work specifically with directors outside Lucasfilm on special-effects projects, she said, and has been sharing proprietary information. And once I.L.M. moves to San Francisco this summer, its executives expect to work more closely with the video game division and the new television animation team. 
 ''The key here is to be able to share people and technology,'' Mr. Keith said. ''Ultimately, there will be crossover when we get further down the road.''
 One division ripe for an overhaul was LucasArts, the video game business that was formed in 1982 and is vital to the post-''Star Wars'' success of the company. Last year, Ms. Chau interviewed several candidates to run the division and handed the job, after a three-month tryout, to Jim Ward, who joined Lucasfilm in 1997 to head a newly formed marketing division.
 For inspiration, Mr. Ward keeps two 12-inch-high figures on the credenza behind his desk: one of Gen. George S. Patton, the other of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, also a general. In the corner of the office, Mr. Ward has a life-size replica of a red-and-black-tattooed Darth Maul from ''Phantom Menace.'' 
 Under Mr. Ward, LucasArts has shown signs of renewed life, although it is facing brutal competition. It will distribute five or six video games a year, some made by outside developers. Last August, Mr. Ward streamlined the division, laying off 31 people. He demanded that game developers meet their proposed deadlines and develop better stories. And he is adamant about creating new intellectual property. 
 ''It's not without challenges,'' he said. ''We can't sit here and say we've got everything figured out.''
 In January, LucasArts released one of its fastest-selling non-''Star Wars'' video games in recent history, a combat game called ''Mercenaries''; 1.1 million have been sold. Mr. Ward also wants to revive the ''Indiana Jones'' franchise. 
 Ms. Chau, who was recruited in 1991 to be chief financial officer, brings a solid corporate sensibility to Lucasfilm. When Mr. Lucas wanted to buy a corporate jet in the early 1990's, she said, she told him that it was too expensive. (He still asks for one, she said, but less often. Instead, she charters him a jet.) More recently, she told Mr. Lucas to stay away from the unfinished site of the San Francisco headquarters unless he was invited. So far, he has been asked to drop by three times. 
 ''George and I had a conversation about freedom and letting go,'' she said. Still, she acknowledged that the detail-obsessed Mr. Lucas had seen hundreds of photographs and illustrations for the new complex, and that the two had pored over 20 outside window designs and more than 100 fabric swatches for the material-lined walls of the main movie theater.
 But as much authority as is afforded to Ms. Chau, Mr. Lucas remains the arbiter of all things ''Star Wars.'' And that is unlikely to change. Mr. Roffman recalled that in 1990, he asked Mr. Lucas for permission to hire science-fiction writers to create novels based on the series. Mr. Lucas was skeptical at first but finally agreed. Mr. Roffman has released more than 65 titles, and the books have become a steady profit center.
 ''You know we're unusual in the sense that we're bounded by this visionary legend who has created things that have stretched the boundaries of this world's culture,'' he said.
 It is precisely that sentiment, though, that may limit Lucasfilm. Critics warn that the company is so tied up in the ''Star Wars'' mythology that it will be difficult for Mr. Lucas to distance himself.
 INDEED, despite his stated desire to pull back, Mr. Lucas announced at a ''Star Wars'' fan convention in Indianapolis two weeks ago plans to make two television series based on -- what else? -- ''Star Wars.'' These include a 3-D, animated, half-hour show based on the ''Clone Wars'' series, which Lucasfilm created for the Cartoon Network, as well as a live-action series based on supporting ''Star Wars'' characters.
 What is more, Lucasfilm's new animation team will be located at Skywalker Ranch, near Mr. Lucas, not in the new San Francisco complex with most of the rest of the employees. (Lucasfilm recently started a Singapore operation, which is not yet up and running.) And Rob Coleman, a creative executive from I.L.M. who was Mr. Lucas's animation director for the last three ''Star Wars'' movies, will be among those working with Mr. Lucas on the TV shows.
 In fact, Ms. Chau said that the company had hired a handful of writers and directors to work with Mr. Lucas and that she hoped they could do projects on their own once they gained the director's trust.
 ''What is important for management,'' Ms. Chau said, ''is that we put people in front of George who can interact with him, work well with him and who are not afraid of George.''
 But Mr. Lucas has made it clear that he is not interested in training a ready army of filmmakers. ''It's not like we have to come up with a movie every year,'' he said, concerned about what has become a hit-driven business. ''I don't want to be Pixar.''
 His ambition for Lucasfilm, he said, is far more ordinary. ''I'm not depending on these people or a new group of people to take the company into a megahit reality,'' he said. ''I'm trying to build a company where we don't make miracles but we do a good job.''

 BODY:
For several years now, Thomas L. Friedman has balanced two major subjects: the Middle East and globalization. The Middle East, with the specter of civilizational clashes and apocalyptic terrorism, has been the bad news. Globalization, promising international prosperity and harmony, has been the good. Yet as Friedman shows in his new book, ''The World Is Flat,'' this good news may not be all that good, at least for those who keep an eye on America's place in the world. Friedman presents a passel of statistics showing that we are falling badly behind in the crucial areas of science and technology. 
 There is probably no one more aware of these trends than Fareed Zakaria, the editor of Newsweek International and author of the best-selling book ''The Future of Freedom.'' In his review of Friedman's book (Page 10), Zakaria cites a passage in which Friedman stands outside an outsourcing company in Bangalore and watches ''wave after wave'' of young Indian techies passing by, all eager, all prepared to participate in the new global economy. Meanwhile, as Friedman tells us, America ranked third in the world in the number of science degrees awarded to 18-to-24-year-olds three decades ago. Today it ranks 17th. 
 On the back page, Randy Cohen, who writes the Ethicist column for The Times Magazine, makes an unusual appeal to readers: Cohen is putting together, with the help of the graphic artist Nigel Holmes, a literary map of Manhattan for the Book Review -- not of authors' homes and haunts, but those of their fictional characters: from the Plaza, where not only Eloise but Woody Allen's Emma Bovary lives (and Jay Gatsby visits), to St. George's Church in Stuyvesant Square, where Mary McCarthy's novel ''The Group'' begins.

HEADLINE: Julia Hart and Jack Reed

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
UNLIKE the wedding a week earlier of a certain heir to the British throne, the marriage on April 16 of Senator Jack Reed, the Rhode Island Democrat, and Julia Hart, was purposefully short on pomp and publicity.
 There would be no splendiferous cathedral with an aisle the length of a football field, no luminaries in the crowd to outshine the wedding couple -- only a small gathering of friends and family at the Catholic Chapel at the United States Military Academy at West Point.
 There were bills to debate, protocol to be maintained -- this couple really did have a country to help run, after all. 
 Ms. Hart, 39, is a coordinator in the Interparliamentary Services Office of the Senate, which organizes exchanges between that body and the legislatures of foreign nations. Mr. Reed, 55, sits on the Senate Armed Services and the Joint Economic Committees, among others. 
 A few days before the ceremony, Mr. Reed, a former Army Ranger, and Ms. Hart were asked to describe their first meeting in early 2002, when they traveled with a Congressional delegation to war-ravaged Afghanistan. 
 Did they notice each other?
 ''Yes,'' Mr. Reed said.
 ''Yes,'' Ms. Hart said.
 And?
 ''That was that,'' Ms. Hart said.
 Maybe it was the steeliness of Ms. Hart, a graduate of the University of Maryland whose discretion has been finely tuned by 17 years of keeping mum about the dignitaries in her charge.
 Perhaps it was because the senator had grown intolerant of the speculation about the state of his private life. Although Mr. Reed had dated other women, some seriously, anyone who knew him recognized that he was married to his job. 
 ''This is an old-fashioned duty-honor-country kind of man,'' said J.B. Poersch, his former chief of staff who is the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''That's been his chief commitment.'' Mr. Poersch added: ''That's not true now. He's more open to filling out the circle.''
 It wasn't until a year and a half after the Afghanistan trip that Mr. Reed and Ms. Hart had their next encounter. Ms. Hart was sitting in a restaurant in South Kingston, R.I., with her stepbrother and sister-in-law when Senator Reed, on one of his weekly visits home, wandered in and sat down at the next table with some high school buddies.
 ''We nodded and said hello,'' Mr. Reed said.
 ''Really, we just said hello,'' Ms. Hart responded.
 A week and a half after that, they ran into each other in Washington, whereupon a date for cocktails was made.
 ''And that was it,'' Ms. Hart said.
 ''Yes, that was it,'' the senator agreed.
 David Duffy, a longtime friend of the senator's who describes him as ''a very reserved, very intelligent guy,'' recalled witnessing the opening of ''the circle'' last summer, when he and his wife, Heidi Kirk Duffy, took a five-day sailing trip from Narragansett Bay to Sag Harbor with Mr. Reed and Ms. Hart. ''Heidi and I were taken by how affectionate they were,'' he recalled. ''And that's not Jack. As long as I've known him, I've never seen him to be so outwardly affectionate. On this trip, they were so relaxed. He was very funny. He was totally at ease.'' 
 Shelly Livingston, a friend of Ms. Hart's, described her as a voracious reader who is fond of yoga and exercise, who ''champions'' human rights and is not ''into material things.'' After meeting Mr. Reed, ''Julia had an aura about her,'' Ms. Livingston said. ''And it's not because he's a senator. She is jaded to that by now.'' 
 Mr. Hart said, ''She's a very nice person and very comfortable to be around -- that and a thousand other things.'' Did he care to elaborate on those thousand things? '' No, I don't care to,'' he stated with something close to a laugh. ''I've learned not to analyze these things.''
 Ms. Hart said, ''Sometimes the fit is just right.''
 After their wedding, the bride, in a beaded strapless Oleg Cassini gown, posed with the bridegroom at Trophy Point on the West Point campus, where their party included some of the senator's schoolmates, Brig. Gen. Daniel J. Kaufman, now the dean of the academy, and Col. Patrick Finnegan, head of its law department.
 In the backdrop, a tanker chugged along the Hudson River. ''The Navy pulled out its best for you,'' an onlooker hollered.
 And then the senator broke, however briefly, his self-imposed ban on speaking to the press the day of the wedding. ''Very happy day,'' he said, a broad smile overtaking his face. His new wife beamed. 
 And that was that.

 BODY:
Opponents of President Bush's plan to partly privatize Social Security are focusing on corporate leaders who support the idea. They say the men make so much that they have nothing at stake in the debate. 
 Two left-leaning groups, United for a Fair Economy and the Institute for America's Future, said average 2004 pay for 26 C.E.O.'s backing the change was $17.7 million. That includes salary, bonuses, restricted stock, incentives and gains on exercised options.
 At that rate, a typical chief in the group -- which includes Kenneth E. Chenault of American Express, Kenneth D. Lewis of Bank of America, Henry M. Paulson Jr. of Goldman Sachs and Richard M. Kovacevich at Wells Fargo -- stopped paying Social Security tax on the fourth workday of 2004, when he earned his 87,900th dollar of the year. Earnings above that were not subject to the tax.
 Some hit the limit sooner. Philip J. Purcell of Morgan Stanley, at $40 million, would have maxed out on his first day at work. Mark A. Stein

Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan understands that when you get a shot to ask the world's richest man for something, take it. 
So when she introduced Bill Gates last week at an automotive technology conference in Dearborn, she made a plea for her job-poor state: ''I hope that when you come back, you bring a few Microsoft employees with you. Hint, hint.'' 
 To bolster her case, she ticked off some areas in which she said Michigan leads the nation: number of golf courses, miles of shoreline, amount spent on automotive research. She did not mention another field in which Michigan leads all other states, its unemployment rate: 7.4 percent in February, the state said last week. Had Ms. Granholm mentioned it, Mr. Gates might have done more than nod politely. Jeremy W. Peters

HEADLINE: Unmentioned Energy Fix: A 55 M.P.H. Speed Limit

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
President Bush made it clear last week that he sees no quick fixes to the nation's energy woes. The problem has been long in coming, the argument goes, and so will the solutions. But if history is any guide, there is one thing he could do immediately: bring back the 55 miles-per-hour speed limit. 
 It has been done before. Along with record oil and gasoline prices, improvements in fuel efficiency and a lasting economic recession, speed limits helped curb fuel consumption for the first time in American postwar history between 1974 and 1984. 
 Of course, energy eventually became cheap again, the economy expanded and Americans became complacent and unwilling to make more sacrifices. 
 Instead of opting for small fuel-efficient cars, people switched to large sport utility vehicles and larger pickups. As drivers groaned and states fought for their right to speed, the limit was raised.
 While oil consumption in most industrialized nations has either leveled off or declined, in the United States, oil demand has soared 38 percent since the first oil shock of 1973.
 The Bush administration's focus over the last four years has been to increase the supply of oil and natural gas, which are also priorities for the energy industry, instead of finding ways to cut back on energy demand, which until very recently has been left out of the picture.
 ''We are in a boxing match, and the president keeps one hand tied to his back,'' said Steven Nadel, the executive director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research group in Washington. ''We're punching with supplies and not using demand. We're at a disadvantage.''
 Other industrialized countries, especially in Europe, have been much more successful than the United States and have managed to actually lower oil demand, or at least keep it in check. That comes from higher diesel use and higher taxes. In France and Germany, a gallon of gasoline sells for as much as $6, with taxes accounting for about 80 percent of that.
 Few politicians in America might risk ridicule or rejection by explicitly supporting higher taxes on gasoline, one of the surest ways to limit the nation's dependence on oil. 
 ''Even the least outrageous gasoline tax would have choked off some demand, and the money would have gone to our own government instead of being transferred overseas,'' said Robert K. Kaufmann, a professor of geography at the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies at Boston University. ''Of course, that would have to involve personal sacrifice, which is off the table politically.'' 
 There are other ways to curb consumption that may be only slightly less challenging, analysts say. One would be to increase the average mileage per gallon requirement. After Congress passed legislation forcing automakers to act in 1975, average mileage almost doubled to 27.5 miles a gallon in 1987 from 14 in 1972. But it has since slipped back to 24 because of S.U.V.'s, and Congress shows no inclination to toughen the standards. 
 Another way to sharply reduce demand -- and improve mileage -- would be to encourage drivers to buy diesel cars, which offer as much as 60 percent more fuel efficiency, said Theodore R. Eck, an energy consultant and former chief economist at the Amoco oil company. 
 ''The neat thing here is that this is off-the-shelf technology,'' he said. But the trade-off to diesel fuels also includes higher emissions of nitrate oxide, a pollutant that is responsible for smog. 
 In a recent speech, President Bush suggested that diesel cars might be made eligible for similar income tax credits as hybrid cars, which are quickly turning into best sellers with long waiting lists.
 The present predicament behind high oil prices is quite different than the oil shocks of the 1970's and 1980's, which were a result of producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cutting oil supplies. Today, the price shock comes from rapidly increasing demand, driven largely by China, but also by the United States and its strong car culture. 
 After rising 33 percent in the last year, crude oil prices in New York slipped below $50 a barrel on Friday for the first time in 10 weeks. They closed down nearly 4 percent at $49.72 a barrel.
 Still, Americans can expect to pay record prices for gasoline this summer. According to the latest national average compiled by the Energy Department, gasoline prices at the pump averaged $2.24 a gallon, up 42 cents from last year; they are expected to touch a record $2.35 a gallon this summer. 
 Polls show that higher gasoline prices are increasingly hurting Americans, and the president is pressing Congress to revive an energy bill that has been stalled for four years. 
 Since the last energy shock of the 1980's, the economy as a whole has shifted toward services and away from heavy industry and is now less dependent on oil than it once was. But that has been more than offset by the rise of oil demand for the transportation sector, which accounts for two of every three barrels of crude oil consumed here; gasoline alone amounts to half the nation's oil consumption.
 ''We've had this situation building up for years, and yet the focus continues to be on the very long term,'' said Shirley Neff, an adjunct professor at Columbia University and a former economist on the Senate Energy Committee. ''We have to focus on demand and be more efficient in our energy use. We need something like an Apollo program for the transportation sector.''
 But restricting demand might also weaken economic growth, an unpalatable prospect for any government, especially at a time when some are already blaming energy costs for a slowdown in growth.
 ''It's true that there is a limit to what you could achieve through a traditional energy policy in one or two years,'' said Fridtjof Unander, an analyst with the International Energy Agency, which advises industrialized nations on ways to reduce their consumption. 
 The 55 miles-per-hour speed limit came as a result of the 1973 Arab oil embargo. The Nixon administration ordered states to lower their maximum limit to save fuel at a time when the first oil shock threatened to bring the economy to a standstill.
 After steadily rising each year, gasoline demand suddenly stopped growing in 1974 and remained nearly flat for the next decade, keeping oil consumption in check. 
 Roland Hwang, the vehicles policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco, estimated the savings of the speed limit in 1983 at 2.5 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel, or 2.2 percent of the total use for these types of fuels.
 But as gas lines faded from people's memories and energy prices went down, the federal speed limit was relaxed in 1987, allowing states to set higher caps of 65 miles an hour. Once more, gasoline consumption surged. 
 Smaller efforts today could make a difference. For example, driving at 10 miles an hour above the 65 miles-per-hour limit increases fuel consumption by 15 percent; inflating tires properly cuts gasoline use by 2 percent; keeping engines idle while in line wastes millions of gallons. 
 The trouble is that few drivers bother with these suggestions, Mr. Hwang said. ''People are basically too lazy to pump their tires up.''

THE WORLD IS FLAT
A Brief History
of the Twenty-First Century.
By Thomas L. Friedman.
488 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $27.50.
 OVER the past few years, the United States has been obsessed with the Middle East. The administration, the news media and the American people have all been focused almost exclusively on the region, and it has seemed that dealing with its problems would define the early decades of the 21st century. ''The war on terror is a struggle that will last for generations,'' Donald Rumsfeld is reported to have said to his associates after 9/11. 
 But could it be that we're focused on the wrong problem? The challenge of Islamic terrorism is real enough, but could it prove to be less durable than it once appeared? There are some signs to suggest this. The combined power of most governments of the world is proving to be a match for any terror group. In addition, several of the governments in the Middle East are inching toward modernizing and opening up their societies. This will be a long process but it is already draining some of the rage that undergirded Islamic extremism. 
 This doesn't mean that the Middle East will disappear off the map. Far from it. Terrorism remains a threat, and we will all continue to be fascinated by upheavals in Lebanon, events in Iran and reforms in Egypt. But ultimately these trends are unlikely to shape the world's future. The countries of the Middle East have been losers in the age of globalization, out of step in an age of free markets, free trade and democratic politics. The world's future -- the big picture -- is more likely to be shaped by the winners of this era. And if the United States thought it was difficult to deal with the losers, the winners present an even thornier set of challenges. This is the implication of the New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman's excellent new book, ''The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century.''
 The metaphor of a flat world, used by Friedman to describe the next phase of globalization, is ingenious. It came to him after hearing an Indian software executive explain how the world's economic playing field was being leveled. For a variety of reasons, what economists call ''barriers to entry'' are being destroyed; today an individual or company anywhere can collaborate or compete globally. Bill Gates explains the meaning of this transformation best. Thirty years ago, he tells Friedman, if you had to choose between being born a genius in Mumbai or Shanghai and an average person in Poughkeepsie, you would have chosen Poughkeepsie because your chances of living a prosperous and fulfilled life were much greater there. ''Now,'' Gates says, ''I would rather be a genius born in China than an average guy born in Poughkeepsie.''
 The book is done in Friedman's trademark style. You travel with him, meet his wife and kids, learn about his friends and sit in on his interviews. Some find this irritating. I think it works in making complicated ideas accessible. Another Indian entrepreneur, Jerry Rao, explained to Friedman why his accounting firm in Bangalore was able to prepare tax returns for Americans. (In 2005, an estimated 400,000 American I.R.S. returns were prepared in India.) ''Any activity where we can digitize and decompose the value chain, and move the work around, will get moved around. Some people will say, 'Yes, but you can't serve me a steak.' True, but I can take the reservation for your table sitting anywhere in the world,'' Rao says. He ended the interview by describing his next plan, which is to link up with an Israeli company that can transmit CAT scans via the Internet so that Americans can get a second opinion from an Indian or Israeli doctor, quickly and cheaply. 
 What created the flat world? Friedman stresses technological forces. Paradoxically, the dot-com bubble played a crucial role. Telecommunications companies like Global Crossing had hundreds of millions of dollars of cash -- given to them by gullible investors -- and they used it to pursue incredibly ambitious plans to ''wire the world,'' laying fiber-optic cable across the ocean floors, connecting Bangalore, Bangkok and Beijing to the advanced industrial countries. This excess supply of connectivity meant that the costs of phone calls, Internet connections and data transmission declined dramatically -- so dramatically that many of the companies that laid these cables went bankrupt. But the deed was done, the world was wired. Today it costs about as much to connect to Guangdong as it does New Jersey.
 The next blow in this one-two punch was the dot-com bust. The stock market crash made companies everywhere cut spending. That meant they needed to look for ways to do what they were doing for less money. The solution: outsourcing. General Electric had led the way a decade earlier and by the late 1990's many large American companies were recognizing that Indian engineers could handle most technical jobs they needed done, at a tenth the cost. The preparations for Y2K, the millennium bug, gave a huge impetus to this shift since most Western companies needed armies of cheap software workers to recode their computers. Welcome to Bangalore.
 A good bit of the book is taken up with a discussion of these technological forces and the way in which business has reacted and adapted to them. Friedman explains the importance of the development of ''work flow platforms,'' software that made it possible for all kinds of computer applications to connect and work together, which is what allowed seamless cooperation by people working anywhere. ''It is the creation of this platform, with these unique attributes, that is the truly important sustainable breakthrough that has made what you call the flattening of the world possible,'' Microsoft's chief technology officer, Craig J. Mundie, told Friedman.
 Friedman has a flair for business reporting and finds amusing stories about Wal-Mart, UPS, Dell and JetBlue, among others, that relate to his basic theme. Did you know that when you order a burger at the drive-through McDonald's on Interstate 55 near Cape Girardeau, Mo., the person taking your order is at a call center 900 miles away in Colorado Springs? (He or she then zaps it back to that McDonald's and the order is ready a few minutes later as you drive around to the pickup window.) Or that when you call JetBlue for a reservation, you're talking to a housewife in Utah, who does the job part time? Or that when you ship your Toshiba laptop for repairs via UPS, it's actually UPS's guys in the ''funny brown shorts'' who do the fixing?
 China and India loom large in Friedman's story because they are the two big countries benefiting most from the flat world. To take just one example, Wal-Mart alone last year imported $18 billion worth of goods from its 5,000 Chinese suppliers. (Friedman doesn't do the math, but this would mean that of Wal-Mart's 6,000 suppliers, 80 percent are in one country -- China.) The Indian case is less staggering and still mostly in services, though the trend is dramatically upward. But Friedman understands that China and India represent not just threats to the developed world, but also great opportunities. After all, the changes he is describing have the net effect of adding hundreds of millions of people -- consumers -- to the world economy. That is an unparalleled opportunity for every company and individual in the world.
 Friedman quotes a Morgan Stanley study estimating that since the mid-1990's cheap imports from China have saved American consumers over $600 billion and probably saved American companies even more than that since they use Chinese-sourced parts in their production. And this is not all about cheap labor. Between 1995 and 2002, China's private sector has increased productivity at 17 percent annually -- a truly breathtaking pace.
 Friedman describes his honest reaction to this new world while he's at one of India's great outsourcing companies, Infosys. He was standing, he says, ''at the gate observing this river of educated young people flowing in and out. . . . They all looked as if they had scored 1600 on their SAT's. . . . My mind just kept telling me, 'Ricardo is right, Ricardo is right.' . . . These Indian techies were doing what was their comparative advantage and then turning around and using their income to buy all the products from America that are our comparative advantage. . . . Both our countries would benefit. . . . But my eye kept . . . telling me something else: 'Oh, my God, there are just so many of them, and they all look so serious, so eager for work. And they just keep coming, wave after wave. How in the world can it possibly be good for my daughters and millions of other young Americans that these Indians can do the same jobs as they can for a fraction of the wages?' ''
 He ends up, wisely, understanding that there's no way to stop the wave. You cannot switch off these forces except at great cost to your own economic well-being. Over the last century, those countries that tried to preserve their systems, jobs, culture or traditions by keeping the rest of the world out all stagnated. Those that opened themselves up to the world prospered. But that doesn't mean you can't do anything to prepare for this new competition and new world. Friedman spends a good chunk of the book outlining ways that America and Americans can place themselves in a position to do better. 
 People in advanced countries have to find ways to move up the value chain, to have special skills that create superior products for which they can charge extra. The UPS story is a classic example of this. Delivering goods doesn't have high margins, but repairing computers (and in effect managing a supply chain) does. In one of Friedman's classic anecdote-as-explanation shticks, he recounts that one of his best friends is an illustrator. The friend saw his business beginning to dry up as computers made routine illustrations easy to do, and he moved on to something new. He became an illustration consultant, helping clients conceive of what they want rather than simply executing a drawing. Friedman explains this in Friedman metaphors: the friend's work began as a chocolate sauce, was turned into a vanilla commodity, through upgraded skills became a special chocolate sauce again, and then had a cherry put on top. All clear?
 Of course it won't be as easy as that, as Friedman knows. He points to the dramatic erosion of America's science and technology base, which has been masked in recent decades by another aspect of globalization. America now imports foreigners to do the scientific work that its citizens no longer want to do or even know how to do. Nearly one in five scientists and engineers in the United States is an immigrant, and 51 percent of doctorates in engineering go to foreigners. America's soaring health care costs are increasingly a burden in a global race, particularly since American industry is especially disadvantaged on this issue. An American carmaker pays about $6,000 per worker for health care. If it moves its factory up to Canada, where the government runs and pays for medical coverage, the company pays only $800. Most of Friedman's solutions to these kinds of problems are intelligent, neoliberal ways of using government in a market-friendly way to further the country's ability to compete in a flat world. 
 There are difficulties with the book. Once Friedman gets through explicating his main point, he throws in too many extras -- perhaps trying to make that chocolate sundae -- making the book seem slightly padded. The process of flattening that he is describing is in its infancy. India is still a poor third-world country, but if you read this book you would assume it is on the verge of becoming a global superstar. (Though as an Indian-American, I read Friedman and whisper the old Jewish saying, ''From your lips to God's ears.'') And while this book is not as powerful as Friedman's earlier ones -- it is, as the publisher notes, an ''update'' of ''The Lexus and the Olive Tree'' -- its fundamental insight is true and deeply important.
 In explaining this insight and this new world, Friedman can sometimes sound like a technological determinist. And while he does acknowledge political factors, they get little space in the book, which gives it a lopsided feel. I would argue that one of the primary forces driving the flat world is actually the shifting attitudes and policies of governments around the world. From Brazil to South Africa to India, governments are becoming more market-friendly, accepting that the best way to cure poverty is to aim for high-growth policies. This change, more than any other, has unleashed the energy of the private sector. After all, India had hundreds of thousands of trained engineers in the 1970's, but they didn't produce growth. In the United States and Europe, deregulation policies spurred the competition that led to radical innovation. There is a chicken-and-egg problem, to be sure. Did government policies create the technological boom or vice versa? At least one can say that each furthered the other.
 The largest political factor is, of course, the structure of global politics. The flat economic world has been created by an extremely unflat political world. The United States dominates the globe like no country since ancient Rome. It has been at the forefront, pushing for open markets, open trade and open politics. But the consequence of these policies will be to create a more nearly equal world, economically and politically. If China grows economically, at some point it will also gain political ambitions. If Brazil continues to surge, it will want to have a larger voice on the international stage. If India gains economic muscle, history suggests that it will also want the security of a stronger military. Friedman tells us that the economic relations between states will be a powerful deterrent to war, which is true if nations act sensibly. But as we have seen over the last three years, pride, honor and rage play a large part in global politics.
 The ultimate challenge for America -- and for Americans -- is whether we are prepared for this flat world, economic and political. While hierarchies are being eroded and playing fields leveled as other countries and people rise in importance and ambition, are we conducting ourselves in a way that will succeed in this new atmosphere? Or will it turn out that, having globalized the world, the United States had forgotten to globalize itself?

HEADLINE: In New Jersey, a Megachurch Fights to Build on a New Site

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR, N.J. 

 BODY:
Worshipers crowded into Christ Church to listen to the Rev. David Ireland preach. Some of them stood in the foyer. Two dozen more were in a room used to handle the overflow watching the minister on a large-screen television. 
 Even among those barely old enough to stand, it was standing room only on a recent Sunday because the church's nursery had reached its capacity of 12 infants and toddlers. If any children cried or needed changing, a board in the sanctuary would light up with their assigned numbers, summoning their parents. This scene is typical of most Sundays at the nondenominational church, which is predominantly black but also has a significant number of members of other races.
 Christ Church holds five services on Sundays at its 800-seat building here, but that is still not enough to accommodate the more than 5,200 members in its expanding congregation. 
 Christ Church's robust growth has led it on a seven-year quest for a new home, and now, reluctantly, into federal court. The church has a contract to buy the corporate campus of a biotechnology company off Route 80 in Rockaway Township, 21 miles northwest of Montclair, with ample parking and room for a 2,512-seat sanctuary. 
 But some neighbors are objecting, saying the church would damage the environment and snarl traffic. The township has not yet approved Christ Church's building plans, which were submitted in July 2003, and the church sued the township last month claiming a violation of its right to practice religion.
 A handful of court cases in New Jersey and across the country have focused on local land use laws that can make it difficult for religious congregations to build new homes. And when the would-be new neighbor is a megachurch, a congregation defined by religion scholars as having more than 2,000 members, the stakes become higher.
 Besides a large sanctuary, Christ Church's leaders want to build offices, Bible study rooms and an elementary school. The plans also include ball fields, basketball and tennis facilities and an indoor gym that local residents could use free. Some existing buildings at the site would be torn down.
 When Dr. Ireland, 43, and seven other people gathered to create a new church in 1986, they never thought they would ever need such a large space. Dr. Ireland, who grew up in Rosedale, Queens, described himself as an atheist when he was a teenager who became a born-again Christian in 1982. He worshiped at an evangelical church in East Orange, N.J., which asked him to start an offshoot that became Christ Church.
 ''I wanted to talk to people who were stuck like I was on this journey to faith,'' he said. His sermons focus on practical matters like parenthood, money management and marriage. The congregation also sponsors meetings during the week on similar topics, a pragmatic response to the needs of its members that has helped spur Christ Church's expansion. 
 ''We have always structured the church for growth, asking what would happen if more people showed up, would they have a good experience,'' said Dr. Ireland, whose marketing approach extends to radio and television broadcasts of his sermons. About 80 percent of the church's members live within a half-hour of Montclair, while some come from as far as the Poconos and Rockland County, N.Y.
 Ed Remsen, the mayor of Montclair, says Christ Church has been an asset to the community. ''They run a lot of quality programs in the church,'' he said. 
 He compares Dr. Ireland to the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, a black leader who is the senior pastor of the 10,000-member Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in Jamaica, Queens, and a former United States representative. ''He's a very charismatic man,'' Mr. Remsen said of Dr. Ireland, who is black.
 Sharon Givens, of Bloomfield, who has attended Christ Church for a year and a half, said she first heard Dr. Ireland preach on radio and television broadcasts and went to the church after moving to the area. ''I love everything about it, the feeling I get every time I wake up and know I'm coming,'' she said. ''I run through emotions here that just touch different parts of me.''
 Odette Allen, who has gone to Christ Church for four years, said she was drawn by its diversity. ''I'm looking forward to more space, and looking forward to what we can actually offer people in the church and community out in Rockaway,'' she said.
 But as has been the case with other megachurches, Christ Church's desire for more space has caused it to run into a legal thicket. 
 In April 2003, the church entered into a contract with Agilent Technologies to buy its 101-acre property on Green Pond Road if Rockaway Township approved the church's plan for the site. In March 2005, the township passed a zoning law that Dr. Ireland believes was aimed at keeping Christ Church out.
 He said the church filed suit in Federal District Court in Newark on April 15 to avoid missing a deadline for appealing the law. The suit said the township, its council, planning board, environmental commission and mayor manufactured improper barriers to the plans, deliberately dragged their feet on the church's application and ''have expressed hostility to the evangelical Christianity practiced by Christ Church.'' 
 The church's complaint cites a federal law requiring governments to give justification for any law that places a burden on a religious organization through land-use policies. The new law in Rockaway Township, which clarifies what can be built in different parts of town, replaces an ordinance that William Dimin, the lawyer for the township's planning board, said was too vague. Mr. Dimin also said the approval process for Christ Church had not taken an unusually long time for a project of its size. 
 Critics of the church's plan have questioned the exemption the church received from the State Department of Environmental Protection to build in the protected Highlands region, saying the plans have changed since the exemption was granted. 
 Lisa Salberg, one of the founders of Voices of Rockaway Township, a group that opposes the church's plans, said the church wants to build closer to a town well than allowed by law. 
 The nearly 700 cars that Christ Church told officials it would draw to town every weekday are also a concern, she said, citing testimony at a meeting from a traffic expert working for the church. 
 Church officials say they have modified the plan several times to meet township concerns and will pay for a traffic light on Green Pond Road to control traffic near the site. They say they have asked the township under what conditions they could build closer to the well, but say that the township has not responded. 
 Rockaway Township is 75 percent white, and Dr. Ireland said the church has received some race-related e-mail messages opposing the plans. The church does not cite race in its lawsuit, however.
 Rockaway Township's mayor, Louis Sceusi, said the township would lose $630,000 in property taxes if the church, a nonprofit organization, moved in. In response, Dr. Ireland said his congregation generates more than $6 million annually for Montclair's economy from parishioners who shop there. 
 Christ Church has been supported in its efforts by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a nonprofit law firm in Washington that has defended religious groups in court cases around the country. ''What the city has basically done here is to sort of hunker down and throw sand in the gears at every step,'' said Derek L. Gaubatz, the fund's director of litigation.
 But Marci A. Hamilton, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, questioned the constitutionality of the federal law cited in Christ Church's lawsuit. 
 ''It's the federal government coming in and creating local land-use law,'' said Professor Hamilton, who argued a case before the Supreme Court involving a previous version of the law that the court declared unconstitutional.
 For the moment, Dr. Ireland is trying to remain optimistic that his church will eventually be able to build a new home in Rockaway Township. ''I look at the Old Testament,'' he said. ''You find Moses had a lot of trouble getting to the promised land.''

PERSON: Dr. Kenneth B. Clark

HEADLINE: Kenneth Clark, Who Helped End Segregation, Dies

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO

 BODY:
Kenneth B. Clark, the psychologist and educator whose 1950 report showing the destructive effect of school segregation influenced the United States Supreme Court to hold school segregation to be unconstitutional, died yesterday at his home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. He was 90.
 His death was reported by his daughter, Kate C. Harris. 
 Dr. Clark was a leader in the civil rights movement that developed after World War II. He was the first black to earn a doctorate in psychology from Columbia University, the first to become a tenured instructor in the City College system of New York and, in 1966, the first black elected to the New York State Board of Regents. 
 He wrote several influential books and articles and used his considerable prestige in academic and professional circles and as a participant on many government bodies and Congressional committees to advance the cause of integration. He battled white supremacists and black separatists alike because he believed that a ''racist system inevitably destroys and damages human beings; it brutalizes and dehumanizes them, black and white alike.''
 It was his research with black schoolchildren that became a pillar of Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court decision that toppled the ''separate but equal'' doctrine of racial segregation that prevailed in 21 states.
 While for decades Dr. Clark was one of the great national authorities on integration, his effect was particularly profound in New York City and New York State. Mayors and governors consulted him, and he expressed firm views about virtually every delicate racial matter from school busing to housing discrimination.
 He was often fearless and blunt about his views, and willing to change them when the empirical evidence led him to believe that his original sentiments were wrong. An early champion of a sweeping reorganization of New York City schools that gave greater control to community school boards, Dr. Clark later commented that ''the schools are no better and no worse than they were a decade ago.''
 ''In terms of the basic objective,'' he said, ''decentralization did not make a damn bit of difference.'' 
 Dr. Clark, who grew up in New York, gained firsthand knowledge of the effects of legally entrenched segregation in an extended visit, in the early 1950's, to Clarendon County in central South Carolina. Its school system had three times as many blacks as whites, but white students received more than 60 percent of the funds earmarked for education.
 Dr. Clark administered a test, which he had devised years earlier, to 16 of those black children, who were ages 6 to 9. He showed them a black doll and a white doll and asked them what they thought of each. Eleven of them said that the black doll looked ''bad,'' and nine of them thought that the white doll looked ''nice.'' Seven of the 16 told Dr. Clark that they actually saw themselves as being closest to the white doll in appearance when asked, ''Now show me the doll that's most like you.''
 ''These children saw themselves as inferior, and they accepted the inferiority as part of reality,'' Dr. Clark said. 
 Dr. Clark's testing in Clarendon County was used by Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in its challenge to the constitutionality of the separate-but-equal doctrine because it showed actual damage to children who were segregated and a violation of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
 On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren announced its decision in Brown v. Board of Education, and Marshall, who had argued the case before the court, called Dr. Clark with the news. Dr. Clark recalled that Marshall told him that ''Justice Warren had specifically mentioned the psychological testimony as key.''
 Dr. Clark added: ''I confidently expected the segregation problem would be solved by 1960. That shows how naive I was.''

An Unwavering Insistence
 To the end, Dr. Clark remained committed to integration, although he grew more pessimistic. For this, in part, he blamed neoconservative whites who, he thought, had betrayed the civil rights struggle; those blacks who thought they could succeed in isolation from whites; politicians of both races who made empty promises; and defeatists who came to think that integration and real racial harmony were ''too difficult to achieve.''
 Renowned for the power of his oratory and writing over a career that spanned more than 50 years, Dr. Clark was uncompromising in his insistence that blacks be given equal rights and that even in the face of violence at the hands of racists, they must ''adopt a courageous, calm and confident position.''
 Besides Ms. Harris, of Lausanne, Switzerland, and Osprey, Fla., he is survived by his son, Hilton B. Clark of Manhattan, three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Dr. Clark's wife died in 1983.
 Kenneth Bancroft Clark was born in the Panama Canal Zone on July 14, 1914, the son of Arthur Bancroft Clark and Miriam Hanson Clark. His parents did not get along. Mrs. Clark yearned to return to the United States; Mr. Clark, a passenger agent with the United Fruit Company in Latin America, felt he wanted to stay where he was in order to earn a living. When Kenneth was only 5, his mother decided to leave her husband. She took Kenneth and his younger sister, Beulah, to New York City, where Mrs. Clark took a job as a seamstress in a sweatshop, struggling to pay the rent on a tenement apartment in Harlem. Later, she helped organize a union where she worked and became a shop steward for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Mrs. Clark and Kenneth had a strong bond and years later, he would recall that she ''somehow communicated to me the excitement of people doing things together to help themselves.''
 In 1920, Kenneth entered Public School 5 in Harlem and soon thereafter switched to P.S. 139, which later also educated James Baldwin. At first, the student body reflected the fact that Harlem contained substantial populations of Irish and Italians. By the time Kenneth Clark reached the ninth grade, however, Harlem was changing and most of the students around him were black. At school, he was told to learn a trade and prepare for vocational training. Miriam Clark would have none of that. She walked into school one day, told the counselor what she thought of vocational schools and made it clear that as far as she was concerned, her son was better than that. Kenneth thus went to George Washington High School in Upper Manhattan.
 He was admitted to Howard University, where he studied political science with Dr. Ralph Bunche and where he came to admire Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1935 and returned to Howard the next year for his master's degree in psychology. He also taught at Howard for a time, but soon departed for New York, where he pursued doctoral studies at Columbia University, receiving his Ph.D. in experimental psychology in 1940.
 From 1939 to 1941 he took part in the classic study of the American Negro that was organized by Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist. The study, which documented the inequalities that obtained among American whites and blacks, would be required reading in colleges and universities for years.
 In 1942, Dr. Clark served for a time in the Office of War Information, for which he traveled about the United States in order to assess morale among blacks. He returned to New York late in the year and joined the faculty of City College. 
 Mamie Phipps Clark, whom he had married in 1938, also earned a doctorate in psychology from Columbia and in 1946 joined him in founding the Northside Center for Child Development, which treated children with personality disorders. At first, its services were offered only to blacks but in 1949, it became available to whites, too. That year, Dr. Clark was promoted to assistant professor of psychology at City College.
 His interest in black children's perceptions of themselves went back to 1939 and 1940, when he and his wife conducted tests with dolls in New York and Washington. In those days, Washington had a segregated school system, and the tests showed that black children in Washington had lower self-esteem than their peers in New York City.
 On another occasion, Dr. Clark was in rural Arkansas and when he asked one black child which doll was most like him, the little boy smiled and pointed to the brown doll and replied: ''That's a nigger. I'm a nigger.'' Dr. Clark said he found that ''as disturbing, or more disturbing, than the children in Massachusetts who would refuse to answer the question or who would cry and run out of the room.''
 Taken as a whole, Dr. Clark said, the results repeatedly confirmed that American society in the segregated South was telling blacks that they were ''inferior to other groups of human beings in the society.''
 Throughout the 1950's and 1960's, Dr. Clark was most active in New York City. In 1954 he had assailed the city school system with permitting de facto segregation, pointing out that because of this, especially in places like Harlem, ''children not only feel inferior but are inferior in academic achievement.'' After an investigation supported his charges, he was named to lead a Board of Education commission to see to the integration of city schools and to push for smaller classes, an enriched curriculum and better facilities in the city's slum schools. 
 During this period he also served as a visiting professor both at Columbia and at the University of California, Berkeley. He became a full tenured professor in the city university system in 1960 and in 1961 won the Spingarn Medal of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for his contributions to promoting better race relations.

A Fight for Harlem
 In 1962, Dr. Clark organized Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited, or Haryou, in an effort to recruit educational experts to reorganize Harlem schools, provide for preschool programs and after-school remedial education and reduce unemployment among blacks who had dropped out of school. Two years later, a committee headed by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy endorsed Haryou's work, and as a result, President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration earmarked $110 million to finance the program.
 But the program was placed under the administration of a joint organization formed by the merger of Haryou and Associated Community Teams, a pet project of Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the Harlem Congressman and minister. Mr. Powell and Dr. Clark, who served as acting chairman of Haryou-Act, clashed over the selection of an executive director. Mr. Powell charged that Dr. Clark stood to profit personally from control of the program. Dr. Clark denied this and said that Mr. Powell saw the Haryou-Act program mostly in terms of the political power it gave him. 
 The struggle between the two was long and heated, and journalists reported that the two grew to despise each other, something that Dr. Clark denied.
 ''I liked him,'' Dr. Clark said of Mr. Powell. ''Adam was one of the most honest, corrupt human beings I have ever met. One of the reasons I liked Adam is that he had so few illusions.''
 Dr. Clark quoted Mr. Powell as telling him, in the middle of the controversy, ''Ah, Kenneth, stop being a child. If you come along with me, we can split a million bucks.'' Dr. Clark explained that what Mr. Powell didn't understand was: ''I didn't want any million dollars. What the hell was I going to do with a million dollars?''
 In 1950, Dr. Clark became convinced he should move his family from New York City to Westchester County. He wanted to leave Harlem because he and his wife could not bear to send their children to the public schools that he was trying so hard to improve but were failing anyhow. ''My children have only one life,'' he said.
 At the same time, he decided that perhaps the way to hasten the improvement of city schools was to decentralize them. But after the schools were decentralized, they continued their decline. Dr. Clark came to think of the decentralization experiment as a ''disaster,'' failing to achieve any of the educational objectives he had sought.
 By the 1970's, after the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and John and Robert Kennedy, and the difficulty in achieving integration in the North, many blacks were growing more wary of whites, more doubtful about overcoming prejudice and achieving racial equality. Dr. Clark was discouraged too, but he remained a firm advocate of the integration of American society. His colleagues described him as ''an incorrigible integrationist,'' convinced of the rightness of the civil rights struggle and certain that the nation could not and should not go back.
 In 1973, with a backlash to integration mounting, Dr. Clark said in an interview in The New York Times Magazine that ''one of the things that disturbs me most is the sophisticated form of intellectual white backlash,'' citing the writings of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, among others. ''In their ivory towers, they have lost all empathy with low-income people and black people. They are seeking to repudiate their own past liberal positions, fighting against their own heritage at the expense of the poor.'' 
 Dr. Clark said he neither admired nor respected such intellectuals and said he was ''breaking all ties with them.'' A registered Democrat, Dr. Clark went out of his way in 1976 to support the incumbent United States senator, James L. Buckley, a conservative Republican, in his unsuccessful race against Mr. Moynihan, the Democratic candidate. 
 Dr. Clark's candor was evenhanded. Late in life, he said he had not been heartened by the ascendancy of blacks in public life because it had not translated into a fundamental change in the condition of ordinary black people. He said he thought white Americans admired accomplished blacks like Colin Powell as long as there were not ''too many of them'' and they did not threaten white hegemony in American society.
 He remained active and vocal. In the 1980's, he expressed anger over assertions that blacks were the cause of their own problems. In 1986, he called on the New York State Board of Regents to supersede the authority of local school boards if they chronically reported low test scores. He also spoke out on deteriorating relations between blacks and Jews, asserting that the dialogue had been too much about anti-Semitism among blacks and not enough about anti-black sentiment among the Jews.
 He irritated separatists when he quit the board of Antioch College after it agreed to black demands for the establishment of a dormitory and study program that excluded whites. And some blacks in Washington became upset with Dr. Clark, whom they had hired to evaluate their black-run school system, when he concluded that it wasn't very good and that what students needed was better teachers and tougher basic courses. He also suggested that whatever argot black children spoke in the streets, they ought to be required to use standard American English in school.
 Dr. Clark was something of a legend in the City University system. And he was quick to say what all really great teachers say: that in the process of teaching, a good professor learned more than his students.
 He retired from City University in 1975 and, looking back on more than a third of a century of work there, said he thought that the students of the 1940's and '50's had been better at asking probing questions. Dr. Clark was not so impressed with the students of the 1960's and said he thought their revolution ''was pure fluff.'' He also retired from the Metropolitan Applied Research Center, which he had founded eight years earlier, and embarked on a consulting business on race relations and affirmative action.
 Dr. Clark's books included ''Dark Ghetto'' (1965); ''A Relevant War Against Poverty'' (1969); ''A Possible Reality,'' (1972); and ''Pathos of Power'' (1974). 
 Despite the many honors he won and the respect he commanded, Dr. Clark said he thought his life had been a serious of ''magnificent failures.'' In 1992, at the age of 78, he confessed: ''I am pessimistic and I don't like that. I don't like the fact that I am more pessimistic now than I was two decades ago.''
 Yet as a conscience of New York politics and of the civil rights movement, he remained an unreconstructed, if anguished, integrationist. A decade ago, during one of his last lengthy interviews, he chain-smoked Marlboros in his home, flanked by vivid African carvings and walls of books wrapped in sun-faded dust jackets, as he professed optimism but repeatedly expressed disappointment over dashed expectations about experiments in school decentralization, open admissions at City University and affirmative action.
 ''There's no question that there have been changes,'' he said then. ''They are not as deep as they appear to be.''
 Among the cosmetic changes was an rhetorical evolution from Negro to black to African-American. What, he was asked, was the best thing for blacks to call themselves?
 ''White,'' he replied.
 He said a lack of meaningful progress could be blamed on blacks who saw themselves only as victims and on whites too narrow-minded to recognize their own self-interest in black success. As whites become a minority in a polyglot country, he was asked, won't they see that it is in their interest that blacks succeed?
 ''They're not that bright,'' he replied. ''I don't think you can expect whites to understand the effects of prejudice and discrimination against blacks affecting them. If whites really understood, they would do something about it.''

HEADLINE: At the Derby, Racing Takes On Its Drug Problem

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 1 

 BODY:
Beneath its twin spires, Churchill Downs has completed a sparkling $121 million makeover in time for the 131st running of the Kentucky Derby, America's most famous horse race. But this year's Derby, which will be Saturday, may be best remembered for the plainclothes investigators roaming the dusty barn areas and for testing the horses for illegal performance-enhancing drugs before and after the Run for the Roses. 
 After decades of rumors about ''juiced'' thoroughbreds and ineffective attempts at regulation, the horse racing industry has acknowledged that it has a drug problem. 
 ''It's a very serious problem, and the public perception is that it is a huge problem,'' said C. Steven Duncker, chairman of the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association's Graded Stakes Committee, which mandated the increased postrace testing for the Derby and the rest of the most important races in the United States.
 ''I don't know if you can put a dimension on how widespread it is because, like in every other sport, our testing seems to be a step behind the cheaters.'' 
 For as long as horses have been racing, some trainers have sought an advantage. Sometimes, it has been as primitive as using a battery-type device to shock a horse during a race; recently it is believed to have become as exotic as using injections of the venom of the cone snail, which is found in the ocean and is prized for its joint-numbing qualities.
 The ability of racing authorities to police the industry has been hampered by its patchwork of regulatory agencies. The industry has no national standards, the way professional sports leagues like Major League Baseball or the National Football League do. States set their own policies and Kentucky, home of the thoroughbred breeding industry and the most famous two minutes in sports, is among the most permissive when it comes to drug policy.
 ''We've been in denial the last 20 years,'' said John T. Ward Jr., the trainer of the 2001 Derby winner, Monarchos. ''Over the years, you've heard a lot of rumors, but there has been no clear-cut evidence. But now we have to think of the future. When you look at the problems in the Olympics and the new-age chemicals out there, it is about time we secure all of our racing -- especially our premier events.''
 Whether or not the horses in past Kentucky Derbys have been competing cleanly is hard to know, many trainers and industry officials say. Only one horse in the history of the Derby has been disqualified for a drug offense: Dancer's Image, who won in 1968.
 The increased surveillance and testing at Churchill Downs this year come after positive test results in horses in California -- including one trained by Jeff Mullins, who will saddle Buzzards Bay for the Derby -- and the federal indictment of a New York trainer on charges of doping one of his horses and telling gamblers associated with the Gambino crime family about it.
 In baseball or Olympic sports, the use of performance-enhancing drugs has little direct economic impact on its fans. But in horse racing, the bettors, who wagered $15 billion in the United States last year and $99.4 million on the Derby, have a financial stake in the outcome of a race. 
 Beginning Thursday, Louisville police officers and Jefferson County sheriff's deputies will take up posts on Churchill Downs' backside along with extra private-security guards hired by the track. And an independent team of investigators from the Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau and the Kentucky Horse Racing Authority will also be watching the barns of Derby horses. 
 ''Frustrations are higher than ever among the honest guys,'' said Jim Gallagher, the executive director of the authority. ''Now it's more important than ever we make people know that we are doing everything in our power to protect the integrity of the game.''
 In 2002, the Racing Medication and Testing Consortium was created in Lexington to come up with a uniform drug policy for the 38 jurisdictions in the United States, and to update testing for a wide range of therapeutic medications, as well as for drugs that are simply performance-enhancing.
 So far, 13 of the jurisdictions have agreed to uniform guidelines, and another 13 are expected to sign on by the end of the year. Kentucky is among those that has agreed to the guidelines, although the stricter rules will not be enacted in time for this year's Kentucky Derby.
 Among Dr. Scot Waterman's duties as the executive director of the consortium is to sort out ''what's real and what's rumor,'' he said, about the use of performance-enhancing drugs. He has been busy.
 With the help of investigators from the Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau, the consortium looks into accusations against trainers and veterinarians. Waterman acknowledged that some of those accused have fielded horses in prestigious races, including the Derby. 
 The consortium also spent more than $300,000 last year and has earmarked $650,000 for this year to come up with tests for chemicals like cone-snail and cobra venom. 
 ''It's a fairly small percentage of people pushing the envelope,'' Waterman said. ''Most vets and most trainers are playing by the rules. But we're shooting to get rid of it all.''
 For the first time at the Derby, for example, the top finishers will undergo what is being called a super test, which will screen for hundreds of drugs and metabolites. 
 In another first, each of the Derby starters will have a prerace blood test to detect alkalizing agents, which is evidence of what is known as a milkshake, a concoction of baking soda, sugar and electrolytes that helps a horse ward off fatigue. Twenty horses are expected to start the Derby on Saturday.
 It is the method that the New York trainer Gregory Martin is charged with using to fix a race at Aqueduct, according to a federal indictment of 17 people accused of being involved in an illegal gambling ring. It also is what California racing officials suspected Mullins of doing, when a horse he trained tested for an illegal level of sodium bicarbonate in February. 
 Mullins denied the milkshaking charge and said that the elevated reading could have come from feed, supplements or stomach medications. 
 Still, for 30 days, Mullins's horses were housed in a detention barn and were under 24-hour surveillance. And for another 15 days, Mullins's barn was monitored. In the 60 days before the penalty, Mullins's horses won 28 percent of their races. That dropped to 13 percent while he was under surveillance. He lost additional good will within racing when he was quoted as saying that horseplayers were idiots and addicts, remarks for which he eventually apologized. 
 Duncker, who is also co-chairman of the New York Racing Association, says uniform regulations, increased testing and greater surveillance are progressive steps. The New York association will take an extraordinary measure when Belmont Park opens Wednesday. All horses will be isolated in a detention barn six hours before their races, with only the state veterinarian having access to them.
 ''We need a paradigm shift in what our punishment is; it needs to be tougher,'' Duncker said. ''Right now in many places, a trainer can get suspended for seven days, pay a small fine and have his assistant run his horses while he's out. That's meaningless. What the tracks can do, however, is take away their stalls and not allow their horses to run at their tracks.''
 Ward, the trainer who has seen one of his horses draped with the blanket of roses, says that trainers, owners and track owners should embrace the new vigilance.
 ''Finally, we have awakened,'' he said. ''This is just the start of it, and hopefully we're only going to get more sophisticated. These are difficult times in all sports to maintain a level playing field, but I think we can do right for these athletes and do right for all of us.''

HEADLINE: Colombian Conflict Spills Into Indians' Perfect World

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: TACUEYO, Colombia, April 28 

 BODY:
The Nasa Indians appear to live well on their lush reservation here in southern Colombia, a swath of mountains and valleys where sweet fruit grows, trout teem in fast-flowing creeks and colorful birds dart about.
 They live in tidy, well-kept homes, growing coffee, bananas and beans. Emphasizing economic independence, they run a successful fish farm and are trying to strike up a marble mine.
 The one major threat to their existence is Colombia's unrelenting civil conflict, which has ground on for 41 years. But the Nasa, an Indian nation that numbers about 100,000 in this region, has used a pacific civil resistance campaign to stay out of the drug-fueled war, which pits the army and right-wing paramilitaries against Marxist rebels intent on toppling the state. 
 For four years, the Nasa's stern-faced but unarmed Indigenous Guards -- now a force of 7,000 men and women -- have simply driven away the fighters who venture into these fog-shrouded mountains in Cauca Province. They confront rebel and soldier alike with ceremonial three-foot batons decorated with tassels in the colors of the Nasa flag, green and red, and persuade the outsiders to leave.
 Their success has earned the acclaim of the United Nations and the foreign governments that pay for Nasa development programs. 
 The Indians have forced traffickers to close down cocaine-producing labs. They have faced down paramilitary death squads. When the mayor of the Nasa town of Toribio was kidnapped by guerrillas last year, 400 guards marched two weeks over the Andes to the rebel camp where he was being held. They won his release.
 ''We do not want armed groups on our land,'' said Julio Mesa, 57, the leader of the Indigenous Guards in Tacueyo. ''So what we do is we get people together and get them out.''
 But in the last two weeks, brutal fighting has swept into three of the Nasa's eight towns, testing the Indians' pacifism and autonomy.
 Starting on April 14, the rebels began rocket attacks on Toribio. In nine days of fighting, a 9-year-old boy and several policemen and soldiers were killed. The government took back the town, but rebels pounded another community, Jambalo, with their notoriously inaccurate mortars, propane tanks armed with explosives.
 Tacueyo was next.
 On Wednesday, with a Colombian military plane raining down bullets on rebel positions, dozens of young soldiers supported by light tanks and armored vehicles stormed Tacueyo. The rebels responded by firing nearly a dozen of the makeshift mortars. Soldiers answered back with their mounted machine guns from the central square.
 ''What worries me are the sharpshooters,'' said one baby-faced soldier, Andres Nova, 24, as he squeezed up against a wall for protection. ''They are not that good, but anyone with a rifle is a danger.''
 Shortly after, snipers killed a soldier and wounded two others.
 Tacueyo's Indians were caught in the middle. When a rebel rocket landed on a house, severely injuring two children, Mr. Mesa and others ran to help. They looked stunned and helpless.
 Mr. Mesa, 57, and his wife, Maria, 54, also a member of the guard, had spoken to the rebels early on. ''They said, 'We're at war,''' Mr. Mesa recounted. ''There was nothing more to say, so I left. But first I told them, 'What you're doing is very bad.'''
 Across Colombia, dozens of Indian tribes are being hammered by the war. Assassins single out leaders of the Wayuu in northeastern Colombia. In northwestern Choco State, Embera children, whipsawed by war and poverty, have committed suicide. Nationwide, tens of thousands of Indians have become refugees. Some of the smaller tribes, the United Nations recently warned, are on the verge of disappearing.
 Mr. Mesa and other Nasa leaders are determined to see their nation avoid that fate.
 The Nasa, also known here as the Paez, were not always peaceful. In the 1980's, they formed a fighting group, Quintin Lame, but the violence only escalated. The Indians changed tactics, and vowed to stay out of the fighting. They focused on building a self-sustaining community held together by an overarching philosophy of self-determination and the right to be left alone.
 ''The government wants to involve us, in their army, in the police, in their informants network,'' explained Nelson Lemus, an Indian leader. ''The guerrillas, they want us to get involved in the revolutionary story, the fight for power.''
 But ''getting involved in war,'' he said, ''hurts our culture, our language, our ways.''
 As Mr. Mesa spoke about the Nasa's efforts to keep the peace, a sniper's bullet came close and the Indian leader and other guards hit the ground.
 ''We want to talk, to see if they will listen,'' Mr. Mesa said, lifting his short, bulky frame off the ground and dusting himself off after the shooting ended. ''Sometimes they do listen to us, but lots of time, they do not.''
 For the army, whose commanders met with the Indians throughout the ordeal, there could be no withdrawal, though Col. Juan Trujillo said he understood the Nasa's position. But he said it was the army's job to fight off the rebels. ''We are the state here,'' he said.
 Still, Mr. Mesa was not about to give up. Last Thursday, he calmly trudged across Tacueyo, wearing a farmer's hat and carrying his trusty baton, and generally oblivious to the shooting around him. What he faced, though, was at times heartbreaking. A 2-week-old girl had died; villagers debated whether the missiles and bullets that had raked the fields near her home were to blame.
 But not all the news was bad. When townspeople became concerned that light tanks were being positioned too close to where most villagers had escaped, Mr. Mesa was able to get a tank commander to hold off.
 And when a young man was detained by soldiers, suspected of helping the rebels, Mr. Mesa was able to get the army to turn him over.
 ''You see,'' Mr. Mesa said, leading him away. ''Talking is the best way to resolve things.''

HEADLINE: A Promise Unfulfilled: Iraq's Oil Output Is Lagging

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
With vast reservoirs of oil and the potential to rival Saudi Arabia as a megaproducer, Iraq has long tantalized the world's energy industry, as well as economists and political leaders worried about the impact of high oil prices. 
 But the new Iraqi government's glaring failure last week to agree on an oil minister and the sectarian bargaining over this crucial appointment, as well as the unabated insurgency, have been new reminders of the political faults that keep the country's petroleum promise unrealized.
 ''Unfortunately, oil in Iraq is being politicized more and more,'' Issam al-Chalabi, who was Iraq's oil minister in the late 1980's, told a conference of scholars and oil-company executives in Washington in late April. ''This is dangerous.'' 
 Mr. Chalabi, now a consultant based in Jordan and Baghdad, is not related to Ahmad Chalabi, the former exile who, in the latest of his political ups and downs, has been appointed interim oil minister. 
 As recently as this April, a senior Iraqi leader evoked the eternal dream that Iraq could produce 10 million barrels a day -- close to the Saudi levels -- within 10 to 15 years. 
 Far less progress than that could alter the global oil market and aid consumers everywhere. 
 But two years after Saddam Hussein was toppled production is limping along at about two million barrels a day, less than before the war, and even at that rate it may be causing long-term damage to poorly maintained fields. 
 American officials had hoped that output at this stage would be at three million barrels a day, generating badly needed funds for reconstruction. That level of production could also reduce oil prices, which are now around $50 a barrel and a global source of inflationary pressure. But close to $2 billion worth of American technical aid to the oil sector has brought only limited gains. 
 Sabotage of a pipeline to Turkey has choked off exports from Iraq's northern fields, around Kirkuk, and violence has slowed efforts to renovate the larger southern fields.
 But even if the insurgency is tamed, oil experts say, Iraq will never receive the foreign investment and advanced technologies it needs until the country has a strategy and laws, ideally enshrined in a constitution, for developing hydrocarbons. Can foreign firms be partners in exploring and drilling new fields and in reaping the product, or will they simply be hired to do the work?
 Whatever pattern Iraq chooses, it must be clearly delineated, industry executives say, and with protections offered to foreign investors. 
 The volatile question of regional autonomy, especially for the Kurds who want more control over Kirkuk and its oil, must also be resolved before outsiders will be likely to put large amounts of capital at risk. 
 These issues and more are at play as the newly elected Iraqi leaders seek to write a constitution this year and, more immediately, try to agree on who should become oil minister. The stakes are high, for Iraq and for the world's consumers. Even if achieving Saudi-level output seems little more than a pipe dream, every incremental gain can make a global difference in the price of oil, energy experts say. 
 ''If the northern pipeline could be secured and those fields were brought to their existing capacity, enough oil could flow to change the world oil market,'' said Lawrence Kumins, an oil expert at the Congressional Research Service. The Kirkuk fields could be producing 800,000 barrels a day within six months to a year, Mr. Kumins said, and ''the world oil market swings on a million barrels a day.'' 
 Herman Franssen, an oil specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, cautioned against too much optimism. Even if Iraq's political situation stabilizes, he noted, it takes years to sign contracts and get oil wells working. Any major decisions on oil development must also await the results of a technical study, being conducted by British Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell, that will chart the state of the country's oil fields and assess the most promising next steps. 
 ''Doubling output to four million barrels a day by the end of the decade would be a major achievement,'' Mr. Franssen said. ''And that would make a big difference in the global market, absolutely.''
 There is a near consensus in the oil industry, he said, that prices will remain high in the coming years, though not necessarily at recent levels of $50 a barrel and more. Barring a widespread recession, he said, prices may bottom out at $30 rather than the previous low of $18. 
 No one doubts Iraq's physical potential for enormous production. Only 17 of its 80 known fields have been developed, and the costs of bringing new production on line are among the world's lowest, according to the United States Department of Energy. Only about 2,300 wells have ever been drilled in Iraq; Texas alone has a million. 
 Huge geologically promising areas of Iraq have never been explored with advanced seismic techniques. 
 But the focus now is simply on resuming maintenance at existing fields to safeguard their output. 
 Since the international sanctions that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the country has done virtually none of the customary nurturing of oil wells normally carried out every one to three years. 
 Also halted was the constant drilling of new wells, which is necessary to replace old ones, to reach shifting reservoir pockets or to apply strategic injections of pressure. In a desperate effort to maintain underground pressure, large amounts of fuel oil were injected into some wells, gumming them up. 
 ''Of the 1,500 producing wells in the south, at least 20 percent need to be replaced,'' Mr. Chalabi, the former minister and consultant, said.

HEADLINE: Liberians: Looking Down on Ghana While It Rises Above Us

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: ACCRA, Ghana 

 BODY:
The road to the beach here twists through dozens of neighborhoods, and every one of them is God-fearing. ''Believe in Jesus Electrical Parts Store,'' says one colorfully painted sign hanging in front of, well, an electrical parts store. ''God is Great Catering and Fast Food,'' says a sign in front of a shack selling cans of Fanta and Coca-Cola and tins of biscuits. 
 My friends and I -- all Liberian -- are on the way to the beach, and indulging in a favorite Liberian pastime: making fun of Ghana. Sure, Ghana is one of our West African neighbors, but the country just seems so different. Beyond the Ghanaian quirk -- which occurs far less often in Liberia -- of naming businesses after Bible verses, people here like kooky logos on their buses that have nothing to do with transportation. ''Observers Are Worried'' is posted on one bus. ''Sea Never Dry'' is on another. 
 We don't like the food. ''I can't believe these people put tomatoes in ground-pea soup,'' I complain to one Liberian friend over lunch at a local restaurant in Accra.
 We don't understand the social system. Ghanaian men seem to like going out stag. ''I just don't get it,'' says my friend, Richard, shaking his head. ''When I first moved here, these dudes invited me out. But the whole night, it was just us guys. Who wants to go out with just guys?''
 Now, I'm not normally particularly nationalistic -- I dropped my Liberian passport after becoming a citizen of my new home, America -- but when I'm in Ghana, this side comes out. Why? The answer, actually, is simple. Even as I'm joining my Liberian expat friends in making fun of Ghanaians, I know exactly why we're doing this. We are jealous. We'll never say it out loud, but Ghana is what we Liberians aspire to.
 The list of what Ghanaians have that we don't is a mile long:
 Electricity -- Liberia hasn't had it since 1991, thanks to the former President Charles Taylor and the civil war he started. But here in Ghana, you can just walk into a room and turn on a light, and it works. And when it gets dark, you can still see. 
 Running water -- We don't have that in Liberia either, again thanks to Mr. Taylor and Liberian government officials more concerned with lining their own pockets than with providing services most people would consider basic. Taking a bath usually requires contortions involving buckets. Alas, in Ghana, you can take showers. What a treat.
 A functional country -- These Ghanaians may spend a lot of time coming up with Biblical passages to name their businesses after, but they seem to have figured out how to run a country, something we Liberians have proved to be woefully dismal at. People actually -- though sporadically -- remove the garbage from the street in downtown Accra. Downtown Monrovia has trash piled up higher than the S.U.V.'s that the United Nations workers use. 
 To rub salt in the wound, there's even a Liberian refugee camp just outside Accra for some 70,000 Liberians who fled the war. There are few amenities at the camp; replicating things at home, the place is devoid of flush toilets. But all is not lost -- I've heard the food there is way better than anything you can find in downtown Accra.
 Was it the inability of Liberians to form a really unified society that did us in, or is it that Ghanaians are just far more industrious than we are? We have great bars and discos, and we love to party, but we've made a mess out of running our country. 
 A few months ago, I went home to Monrovia to take a look at the rebuilding going on now that Charles Taylor is finally gone and our civil wars are over. I arrived at Robertsfield Airport in Liberia and was promptly hit up for a bribe by the immigration woman who demanded my passport. 
 I didn't even think twice about giving her a dollar when she asked me what I had brought home for my people. I knew that was code for ''give me money or I'll keep you here in this hot little room until you come to your senses.'' 
 Within three hours of my arrival back in Monrovia, I was cavorting with friends at Musu's Spot, a rowdy outdoor bar across the street from the United Nations relief mission. West African highlife music was blaring, and people were laughing and drinking our delicious Club Beer. 
 If it weren't for the dozens of one-legged former child soldiers begging for money on the side of the potholed road, you'd have no idea that you were in a city still recovering from 10 years of vicious civil war. 
 I called my Liberian friends in Accra. ''You should be here,'' I yelled at Richard. But while Richard is happy enough to make fun of Ghanaians whenever the mood strikes him, he's no fool. 
 ''Nope,'' he said. ''I'm happy right here.''

HEADLINE: For Freedom Tower and Ground Zero, Disarray Reigns, and an Opportunity Awaits

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
The master plan for ground zero is unraveling, which is not necessarily bad news. But what are the odds that planners will see this as an opportunity to save it?
 The discovery that the Freedom Tower will have to be redesigned to address concerns raised by security experts has once again sent architects scurrying to patch up one of the most muddled developments in the city's recent memory.
 State officials have said that the changes sought by police officials could delay construction of the tower, already behind schedule, for at least three more months. But one of the suggestions under discussion -- moving the tower to the east, where it would be less vulnerable to a truck bomb -- would clearly delay construction longer. Meanwhile, there is growing apprehension that adhering to new security standards will transform the tower into an armored bunker -- a message that is unlikely to instill confidence in downtown's rebirth. 
 In fact, the delay in addressing security is only the most recent in a series of missteps that have dogged the master plan since it was adopted more than two years ago. These include imperious changes to the ground zero memorial that have dismayed its architect, Michael Arad, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's insistence on forging ahead with the design of a ''Freedom Center'' building even though no one knows exactly what it would house. At the same time, the agency decided to put off fund-raising for a theater complex designed by Frank Gehry, seeding doubt that it will be built at all.
 These are not simply errors in judgment. They are byproducts of the mix of secrecy, self-interest and paranoia that have enveloped the site from the outset -- a climate that favors political expediency and empty symbolic gestures over thoughtful urban planning discussions. And that climate has essentially prevented the architects involved from openly addressing problems with the master plan even as its weaknesses have become more glaring. 
 With typical inflexibility, Kevin Rampe, the president of the development corporation, insisted last week that the tower would not be moved under any circumstances. His point was that moving the tower eastward would only raise new security concerns, like its relationship to train tracks that run beneath Greenwich Street.
 Meanwhile, Daniel Libeskind, the site's master planner, has privately suggested to Gov. George E. Pataki that the tower be combined with the proposed theater complex that would stand just to the east, at the corner of Greenwich and Fulton, which would allow for a broader defensive perimeter around both.
 Mr. Libeskind has also floated the idea of simply straightening the tower's twisting form. That would allow the architect to reduce the size of the building's base, which would leave more room for a security buffer. (According to Mr. Libeskind, it could increase the tower's distance from West Street by an additional 40 feet.)
 All of these proposals have some merit. I, for one, won't shed a tear if the tower has to be redesigned. Its cylindrical crown of steel cables and twisting silhouette are clunky, watered-down versions of a recycled idea. But simply redesigning the tower or shifting it slightly to one side would set off more stopgap changes that would only exacerbate the project's flaws. This approach to urban planning is doomed to failure -- and is particularly galling at a site once spoken of as sacred ground.
 Among the most glaring problems with the master plan is its relationship to the neighborhoods to the west. In its current incarnation, the ground zero memorial park is completely exposed to West Street, given that planners recently decided not to build a tunnel that would have funneled much of the traffic underground past the site. The park feels like leftover space, and it only reinforces the sense of detachment between the site and the World Financial Center across the street.
 Just as troubling is the park's diminished size. At the behest of planners, the Norwegian architectural firm Snohetta has been struggling to stuff 70,000 square feet of space into a museum building in the northeast corner of the park -- a figure that is essentially random, given that it is still unclear what that museum would contain. The building would gobble up a quarter of the area that is supposed to encompass the memorial park; the ground zero memorial, which traces the footprints of the former towers, would essentially consume two more quadrants. That would leave only the southwest corner -- about one and a half acres -- for a park.
 Privately, several architects involved at ground zero have been exploring ways to improve the master plan. Long before the security concerns were raised, some had toyed with the notion of moving the Freedom Tower to the east side of the site and creating a smaller commercial structure at its current location on the site's northwest corner. This would create a stronger visual dialogue between the various commercial towers at ground zero and the World Financial Center.
 Others have proposed moving one of the cultural buildings to the site's southwest corner, which would help shield the memorial from West Street and make it feel more intimate. An even more radical idea -- a riff on one of Mr. Libeskind's proposals -- would be to relocate all of the cultural institutions in the base of the towers, freeing up room for a much bigger public park. This might help cover the costs of the site's cultural components and ensure that they remain a strong part of the program.
 Of course, these are simply mental exercises, a way of exploring how the project could be set on the right track. But the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has steadfastly refused to open up discussion on the site's overall organization. Not only has it sought to prevent the architects from speaking publicly about their ideas, according to several architects interviewed, but it has also warned them against sharing their ideas with one another, saying that this would be a breach of their confidentiality agreements. 
 As a result, the major architectural players at ground zero -- Mr. Libeskind, Mr. Gehry, Santiago Calatrava, David Childs, Mr. Arad and the Snohetta architects, to name the most obvious -- have never sat down in a room together to discuss their growing concerns about the overall plan, let alone exchange ideas about how best to improve it. 
 This constitutes an enormous squandering of talent, as well as a total disregard for how the creative process unfolds. And it has essentially shut the public out of the process.
 So far, such inflexibility has been justified by political calculations. Open discussion of what isn't working, and why, might slow the pace of rebuilding, the thinking goes, and send the wrong message to the world -- as if indecision were somehow a sign of weakness. Given how the project has stumbled, that argument is looking more and more specious. And it ignores the fact that the city, and those of us who care about it, will have to live with the consequences of these decisions for decades.
 Governor Pataki should take advantage of the most recent delays to take a big step back and rethink what has become a debased process. Planning should be open to intense public scrutiny. And by encouraging the architects to talk with one another and to the public they serve, he could finally take advantage of the talent that he has right under his nose.

HEADLINE: The Lost Continent Of The Atlantic

BYLINE: By Matthew Pearl. 
Matthew Pearl is the author of ''The Dante Club.''

DATELINE: Boston 

 BODY:
WITH The Atlantic Monthly's recent announcement that it is moving its editorial offices to Washington, there has been sad talk here about the magazine's indispensable role in shaping the intellectual life of the city. But it is harder to preserve a meaningful cultural memory of how much the city was once a part of The Atlantic. In its early years, the magazine was a product of a distinct literary regionalism that was not only unparalleled in American history, but most certainly will never recur.
 When The Atlantic Monthly was chosen as the title of a new magazine in 1857, some in the literary community objected to using ''Atlantic'' as an adjective in such an odd way, but its founders were in the mood for an aggressive and novel aesthetic. They did not see the magazine or their other burgeoning publishing ventures as regional endeavors, but rather saw their region as one that encapsulated universal ideas and artistry. 
 The magazine's title was meant to signify the bridging of Old and New England, and that New England could intellectually encompass both. It was suggested by Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, the writer and Harvard medical professor (and father of the Supreme Court jurist), who would soon label Boston (in The Atlantic's pages) the ''hub of the solar system'' -- a term that eventually evolved into ''Hub of the Universe.'' 
 That popular designation captures not just a cultural pride, but also how closed off that universe around The Atlantic could feel. For intellectual New England in the mid-19th century, almost all roads ran through similar backgrounds, and crossed through Harvard Yard. This was the case for Holmes and his fellow poet James Russell Lowell, the first editor of The Atlantic. Both men were Harvard graduates who had become Harvard professors. Lowell and the first overseers of the magazine did not explicitly limit their search for Atlantic material to New Englanders, but from today's vantage point they were stingy in their use of outsiders like Walt Whitman and Herman Melville and demonstrated a grudging recognition of Mark Twain. 
 When Dr. Holmes joked in a letter in 1864 that he was thinking of ''leaping into the Atlantic,'' he made sure to specify he meant the ocean rather than the magazine. The periodical had become that much an extension of their geography. It even provided a way for Bostonians to organize themselves socially, through The Atlantic Club. At periodic gatherings, it was said, members would receive copies of the latest issue fresh from the printer and each turn immediately to read his own articles. It was a fashionable game to try to guess who wrote all the articles and poems, which were printed anonymously, but it proved pretty easy for literati who were friends with most contributors.
 This insularity extended, with questionable ethics, to the magazine's relations with the larger publishing business; the magazine glowingly ''puffed'' books being published by Ticknor & Fields, which had acquired the magazine early on. Its strong harmony with surrounding social, academic and commercial interests also made The Atlantic a provocateur for other literary regions looking to develop their own sense of separateness. New York City's cutting-edge writers and their new magazine, The Nation, found a voice in part by attacking The Atlantic's.
 From the beginning, there was a sharp awareness around The Atlantic of shaping literary history, as well as a self-conscious attempt to balance the components of the subtitle's broad mission, ''A Magazine of Literature, Art and Politics.'' Shortly before the magazine's current owner, David Bradley, disclosed his plan to move the magazine from Boston, the editors announced they were stopping the regular publication of fiction, at least in the print version. This is a major transformation for a magazine that in its first issue began serializing ''The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table,'' a meandering fictional travelogue of Boston life by Holmes. 
 We cannot separate that latest philosophical move from the magazine's physical move to Washington, a place with little visible awareness of its own literary history and, in the shadow of politics' swift movements, little sentimentality for the slower intersections that develop between literature and life, between writing and place. 
 Boston, still a congenial home for writers, also still carries its sense of literary history, but it seems more a part of the city's trade in American nostalgia than of any continuing cultural coherence. (The space that once held the ''Old Corner Bookstore,'' The Atlantic's historic home under Ticknor & Fields, keeps a photographic tribute to its history for passers-by to view in the window, but is otherwise empty.) Nor does New York stand much for regional literature, instead serving as an amalgamated headquarters for all publishing activities -- a matter of efficiency and economics that can also be seen as the cause of The Atlantic's passage into its parent company's Washington offices. 
 While there are American authors today who identify themselves regionally, that is often an individualistic and even idiosyncratic sign, not one of larger geographic-literary claims. These days, groups of writers and thinkers brought into regular personal contact with one another do so not usually from deep cultural ties but because of geographical happenstance (and, often, generous stipends from university writing programs).
 This isn't all bad: shaking up the link between upbringing, education and publishing opportunities lessens the risk of creative homogeneity and the sort of literary protectionism that obstructed Whitman and Edgar Allan Poe in the 19th century. But that also implies the unlikelihood of literary community. Thus Washington seems an appropriate new home for a magazine that once seemed to grow right out of the landscape of another city; the nation's capital is a mutable conglomerate for ''representatives'' of every part of the country, a place of mock-ups of regional communities.
 Symbolism aside, there are few established literary publications remaining in America for which the place of publication would matter. The evocative fact is not that The Atlantic will change so much once outside of Boston, but that it probably will not.

HEADLINE: China Trade Surplus With West Still Rising

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, May 1 

 BODY:
China's global exports soared in the first quarter of this year, allowing the country to rack up huge trade surpluses with the United States and western Europe, according to detailed trade data released late last week by Chinese customs officials.
 Chinese exports in the quarter rose to $155 billion, up 35 percent from about $116 billion a year ago.
 According to the figures, which were analyzed by Global Trade Information Services in Columbia, S.C., China continues to run a big trade deficit with Asian trading partners like Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, as well as several oil exporting countries. But its surpluses with the United States and Europe are rapidly widening. 
 China's trade surplus with the United States jumped to $21 billion in the first three months of the year, up from about $12.4 billion a year ago -- a 73 percent increase.
 The Chinese statistics are different from those released by the United States, which generally show much larger trade gaps. Last year, the United States government said that China had a $162 billion trade surplus with the United States, the largest ever recorded. 
 In the first three months of the year, China's trade surplus with the seven largest traders in western Europe -- Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Britain -- rose to about $12.3 billion, up from about $5 billion in the same period a year ago.
 Even Germany, which has long run trade surpluses with China because it sells heavy manufacturing equipment to Chinese factories, is now in the red: its $2 billion trade surplus in the first three months of last year evaporated, turning into a $159 million trade deficit in the first months of this year.
 China's biggest exports continue to be computers, electronics and other machinery. But its exports of textiles and apparel have flooded the world market since global quotas were lifted on Jan. 1.
 While textile and apparel exports to the United States jumped by about 78 percent in the first quarter, its exports to Spain rose 92 percent, to France 90 percent and to Germany 88 percent. 
 Government officials in the United States and Europe are now considering tariffs or quotas to restrain the trade growth. But late last week, Chinese government officials warned that such moves might violate trade agreements.
 Some economists and trade officials caution that China's trade figures are often distorted or hard to analyze because of the way goods pass through intermediary trade spots like Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, and also because of the way they are tracked and recorded by Chinese customs officials. 
 Vincent Chan, the head of China research at Credit Suisse, said that China's surplus could be temporarily exaggerated because of the way some Chinese companies tally their inventories. He also warned of currency speculation.
 President Bush, European Union officials and even the World Bank have in recent weeks called on China to allow its currency, which is pegged to the dollar, to float more freely, which would most likely allow it to appreciate. The hope among some economists and trade officials is that such a move would help shrink its trade surpluses.
 But some economists and trade experts doubt that a more freely floating yuan would do much to reduce the trade gaps with the West because American multinationals and consumers are tightly bound to China's export boom. 
 ''Trade protectionism is an empty threat,'' said Andy Xie, an economist at Morgan Stanley. ''A lot of these goods are made on consignment for multinationals. If there were punitive tariffs, American businesses would have to pay.''
 Several investment banks now predict a currency change. ''We believe they will move sooner rather than later,'' said Frank Gong, an economist at J.P. Morgan Chase. 
 A spokesman for China's central bank told Dow Jones last week that such a change was not imminent. China has been reluctant to change its currency policy for fear of harming its economy.

Banned Chinese Film Takes Top TriBeCa Prize
 A Chinese movie, whose director said it was banned in China, won the top feature film award at the fourth annual TriBeCa Film Festival on Saturday. ''Stolen Life'' (''Sheng Si Jie''), directed by Li Shaohong, about a young woman who encounters love and deception after enrolling at college, won the Founders Award for best narrative feature. Ms. Li said she hoped the award would help the movie be ''greenlighted so that my people in China can watch this film soon,'' Reuters reported. Other big winners included Peter Forgacs's ''El Perro Negro: Stories From the Spanish Civil War,'' which won best documentary; Felicity Huffman, right, who took best actress for her role as a pre-operative transsexual in ''Transamerica''; Cees Geel, from the Netherlands, for best actor in ''Simon''; the Chilean-born director Alicia Scherson, who won the prize for best new narrative filmmaker, for ''Play''; and Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary, who shared the best new documentary filmmaker award for their ''Favela Rising.'' The awards for feature film, documentary, and best new narrative and documentary filmmakers each have a $25,000 prize.

New CD's in Release
 The last month has been a busy time for big new releases, and this week is no different. New pop CD's to be released tomorrow include Nine Inch Nails' first album of new material in six years, ''With Teeth'' (Interscope); ''Joe Perry'' (Columbia), the first solo album in 21 years by Joe Perry, the lead guitarist of Aerosmith; ''Cold Roses'' (Lost Highway), a double album by Ryan Adams and the Cardinals (Mr. Adams is apparently on a roll -- he has two more albums scheduled for release later this year); Limp Bizkit's return, ''The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)'' (Geffen); Aimee Mann's ''Forgotten Arm'' (SuperEgo); ''Pretty in Black'' (Columbia), by the arty Danish garage group the Raveonettes; the rising emo band Fall Out Boy's ''From Under the Cork Tree'' (Island); ''Rock of Ages ... Hymns & Faith'' (A&M), an album of classic hymns by the Christian pop star Amy Grant, featuring her husband, Vince Gill.

Heinz Awards
 The sculptor Mark Di Suvero is to be given the 11th annual Heinz Award for the Arts and Humanities today, the Heinz Family Foundation announced. ''For almost 50 years, the works of Mark Di Suvero have stopped us in our tracks, confronting us with audacious colors and shapes and mesmerizing us with subtle energy and intricate proportion,'' said Teresa Heinz Kerry, above, the chairwoman of the foundation. The Heinz Awards include four other prizes: Jerry F. Franklin, a forest ecologist, has won the environment award; Joseph A. Rogers, a mental health administrator, will take the human condition prize; Sidney Drell, a theoretical physicist and arms control adviser, wins for public policy; and Mildred S. Dresselhaus, a physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has won in the category of technology, the economy and employment for her work as a trailblazer for women in the sciences. The winners are to receive $250,000 each.

Footnotes
 Mos Def has been cast opposite Bruce Willis in a new movie to be directed by Richard Donner (''Lethal Weapon,'' ''The Goonies''). In the film, ''16 Blocks,'' Mos Def will play a witness who is escorted to a New York City courthouse by an aging cop played by Mr. Willis. A plan to name a Texas highway after Willie Nelson has stalled because of partisan politics. A Democratic state senator, Gonzalo Barrientos, had proposed naming a 49-mile stretch of a new road, Texas Highway 130, in honor of Mr. Nelson. But two Republican legislators, Steve Ogden of Bryan and Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio, said they did not want Mr. Nelson's name on the road that crosses their districts, citing his fondness for drinking and smoking, and active campaigning for Democratic candidates, The Associated Press reported.

HEADLINE: For Blair, Iraq Issue Just Won't Go Away

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: HOVE, England, May 1 

 BODY:
If there is one campaign issue that Prime Minister Tony Blair would prefer to wish away before Britons go to the polls on Thursday, it is probably the question of his integrity and credibility in the way he handled the period leading up to the Iraq war.
 But on Sunday, Iraq came back to haunt him yet again in a newspaper article suggesting that he had committed himself to an American plan for ''regime change'' months before he told either Parliament or the people that British participation in the American-led invasion was all but inevitable.
 The article could further damage Mr. Blair because his opponents may use it to renew their assault on his trustworthiness, reviving the argument that he secretly promised President Bush to support the invasion of Iraq. 
 Yet, at a rally of the party faithful on Sunday in this southern coastal town, Mr. Blair counterattacked, seeking to transform the debate into a broader question of leadership, and assailing his opponents for what he depicted as their lack of it.
 In a combative speech to about 1,000 followers, he focused closely on areas where he says Labor has secured progress -- particularly the economy and public services. His opponents, he said, assailed his character and leadership because ''they have nothing else to focus this election on,'' adding, ''They know they have lost the argument'' on the economy and other issues.
 He barely mentioned the war in Iraq, except to say: ''I don't doubt that there are people in this audience today who disagreed with what I did in Iraq. I understand that, and I have never disrespected people who disagreed with me.''
 But, he said, ''leadership is about taking difficult decisions.''
 He continued, ''So now we come to the stage where it's the British people who sit in the seat of decision-making, and all I ask them to do is recognize the fundamental nature of the choice'' to be made May 5. ''On that choice they make rests the future of this country.''
 Politically, the legacy of the war has created an aura of mistrust around Mr. Blair that he has been unable to shake despite endorsements of his candidacy for a record-setting third straight term from sources as disparate as The Sun to Bill Clinton. With opinion surveys on Sunday forecasting a Labor lead at the polls of three to eight percentage points, a number of widely read tabloids gave Mr. Blair their endorsements.
 But The Sunday Times published details of a leaked document dating to July 2002 -- eight months before the Iraq war -- recording a meeting between Mr. Blair and his close advisers, in which he seemed to swing behind American arguments for ''regime change.'' 
 As the war approached, Mr. Blair said frequently that the reason for it was to force Saddam Hussein to comply with United Nations resolutions calling on him to disarm, and Mr. Blair denied that he was seeking to force a change of leadership in Iraq. Indeed, in a previously secret document made public last week, Britain's attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, said forcing a change of leadership could not be used as a justification for invasion.
 The leaked document from July 2002, however, summarized Mr. Blair's position with these words: ''If the political context were right, people would support regime change. The two key issues were whether the military plan worked and whether we had the political strategy to give the military plan the space to work.'' 
 Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, reportedly described the case for war as ''thin'' because Mr. Hussein ''was not threatening his neighbors'' and his unconventional arms capacity ''was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran.'' 
 Sir Richard Dearlove, Britain's most senior intelligence officer, who had just returned from Washington, was said to have concluded that the invasion was inevitable because ''Bush wanted to remove Saddam through military action.''
 ''Intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy,'' he was quoted as saying.
 In a Sunday morning television interview, Mr. Blair did not deny that the meeting took place in July 2002, but he recalled that ''subsequent to that meeting, we went the United Nations route,'' seeking a resolution in November 2002, calling on the Iraqi government to disarm. An effort to secure a more bellicose second resolution faltered in early 2003.
 Mr. Blair disputed a suggestion that Britain might have pulled out of the war, leaving America to topple Mr. Hussein alone. 
 ''So we the British at the moment of decision would have faltered and backed off,'' Mr. Blair said. ''That's not my conception of Britain.''
 He denied, however, that Britain had committed itself irrevocably to war by July 2002. 
 ''The idea that we had decided definitely by that stage is disproved by the fact that we went back to the U.N.'' he said. 
 The Iraq issue has dogged Mr. Blair despite strenuous efforts to move the campaign onto more comfortable territory, like the economy, where Labor believes it has a good record. Mr. Blair is also worried that if voters shift away from Labor to the smaller opposition Liberal Democrats to protest the war, the Conservatives will in effect benefit. 
 ''There will be people who will feel very, very strongly over Iraq,'' he said. ''But if they vote Liberal Democrat in a seat where the Conservatives are second, it is not policy on Iraq that will change; it's the policy on the economy, on the health service, on schools, on the minimum wage.'' 
 At his rally here, Mr. Blair also enjoined his supporters to vote in large numbers: ''Think about the program and the policies. Think about the choice. Think about the type of country we are and want to become. Don't opt out of it.''

HEADLINE: Prominent Brooklyn Pastor Backs Bloomberg

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE; Matthew Sweeney contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg paid a lengthy visit yesterday to the Christian Cultural Center, a charismatic evangelical church in Brooklyn that claims more than 20,000 members, and he came away with an endorsement by its pastor. 
 The support of the center's pastor, the Rev. A.R. Bernard Sr., who endorsed Mr. Bloomberg four years ago and served on his mayoral transition team after his election, was not unexpected. But for a Republican mayor trying to woo black and Hispanic voters away from Democratic opponents, it was a chance to bask in the praise of an influential black clergyman -- on the same day two of those opponents attacked him from different fronts. 
 Mr. Bernard said he was backing Mr. Bloomberg again because he was pleased with his efforts to curb homelessness, revamp education and spur economic development. Asked about criticism from Democrats that the mayor's wealth had made it impossible for him to relate to average New Yorkers, Mr. Bernard said he would not hold the fact that the mayor is a billionaire against him. 
 ''He's not looking at the city as a politician would look at the city,'' the pastor said. ''You have a lot of people who are running for office and it's about political careers. That's not the issue here. Here's someone that feels he can make a difference, and he's got the people at heart.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's visit to the center -- a sprawling gated complex in East New York, where 90 percent of the congregants are African-Americans or black immigrants -- was rather long. He spent more than three hours there, an indication of the importance his re-election campaign attached to Mr. Bernard's endorsement.
 With Mr. Bloomberg preoccupied at the center, two Democratic candidates for mayor called separate news conferences in Manhattan to criticize him. Representative Anthony D. Weiner took to the City Hall steps to criticize the Bloomberg administration's handling of security plans for the Freedom Tower at ground zero. Referring to reports of delays by the police in disclosing their concerns about the tower's design, Mr. Weiner suggested that the mayor was not paying close enough attention to the issue.
 ''Perhaps if we had focused a little less on a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan and a little more on developing Lower Manhattan in a safe way, we wouldn't be in this mess today,'' Mr. Weiner said.
 Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, meanwhile, at his news conference released a letter to the mayor calling on him to rescind a plan to formalize restrictions that limit the number of people who can gather on the Great Lawn in Central Park. The rules, announced last week, are intended to safeguard the $18 million restoration of the lawn. 
 Mr. Bloomberg declined to answer reporters' questions after his campaign event, saying he did not want to talk about official city business, but he promised to take questions at a news conference today.
 ''This is a political thing,'' he said, standing beside Mr. Bernard outside the church, ''and I want to keep the business of government separate from politics.''

HEADLINE: A New Arts Foundation With a Focus on Creativity

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
What happens to the brain when you write or read a poem, beyond the moment of creation or enjoyment? What do the arts mean for jobs and economies? How can creativity be taught and fostered?
 Those are some of the questions that led Louise T. Blouin MacBain, founder of one of the world's largest art magazine publishers, to set up the Louise T. Blouin Foundation. The international nonprofit arts organization has a wide-ranging agenda to support cultural development around the world, through research and new programs. It was to be officially inaugurated tonight with an awards ceremony in New York at the Nomadic Museum at Pier 54. 
 The honorees for their contributions to creativity include former President Bill Clinton; the Nobel peace laureate Elie Wiesel; and Clive Gillinson, managing director of the London Symphony Orchestra and the incoming executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall. It will be a glamorous beginning for a foundation with big ambitions. Mrs. MacBain, a 46-year-old French-Canadian, has pledged $30 million to establish the Louise T. Blouin Center for Creativity in London and the first year's program budget.
 ''The foundation launch for me is where my knowledge and passions all come together,'' Mrs. MacBain said in a recent interview. She grew up in Montreal, she said, exposed to music and museums through her parents, who were also businesspeople. Her interests in the arts and business first converged, she said, when she became a co-founder of Trader Classified Media in 1987 and built a business with more than 400 publications and 60 Internet sites in 20 countries. Her company, the London-based LTB Holding Ltd., is a large art-magazine publisher and art-information provider.
 Mrs. MacBain said that after she learned she had dyslexia at the age of 8, she became aware of how creative many bright people with learning disabilities are, making links among seemingly disparate subjects. So, through an interdisciplinary, international foundation, she said, she hoped to show how creativity benefits countries economically and culturally. 
 One of the foundation's early projects will be to study the economic importance of the arts. It plans to hold forums at which artists, politicians, business leaders and educators propose cultural policies. The foundation also wants to endow a chair at a leading university to research the relevance of art to everyday life and the connections between the study of art and the study of perception and cognition. 
 The foundation's advisory board includes Mr. Gillinson; Thomas Krens, director of the Guggenheim Museum; the soprano Renee Fleming; and the contemporary artists Damien Hirst, Jeff Koons and Francesco Clemente. 
 ''It's an aggressive agenda,'' said Robert Lynch, the president and chief executive of Americans for the Arts, a national advocacy group for arts and arts education. He said that he was particularly intrigued by the foundation's international ambitions and its research agenda on creativity and connections between the arts and the economy. 
 ''Creativity is at the core of the American economy right now,'' Mr. Lynch said, adding that his group's recent study on creative industries found that 578,486 businesses in the United States alone are connected to the arts in some way. 
 The Blouin Foundation's other award recipients tonight will be Gregory Colbert, the photographer who conceived of a ''nomadic museum'' that could be disassembled and moved; Robert Wilson, the theater and opera director; Anish Kapoor, an Indian-born British sculptor; Paulo Coelho, the Brazilian writer; and Dr. Richard Axel, a Columbia University medical researcher and Nobel Prize laureate. 


CORRECTION-DATE: May 5, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Arts on Monday about the creation of the Louise T. Blouin Foundation, to support cultural development around the world, included an erroneous reference, from the organization's news release, to an author among those honored by the foundation in New York on Monday night. Paulo Coelho did not receive an award.

HEADLINE: Sharansky Is Quitting Israel's Cabinet

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 1 

 BODY:
Natan Sharansky, the Soviet dissident turned Israeli politician, intends to resign from Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's cabinet on Monday because he opposes Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, he said in an interview on Sunday.
 Mr. Sharansky, whose ideas on the promotion of democracy have been endorsed by President Bush, said he objected to the lack of linkage of the Gaza withdrawal to specific reforms to create more freedom in Palestinian society.
 He said he would hand a letter of resignation to Mr. Sharon on Monday morning. He is a member of the Likud Party and minister for Jerusalem and diaspora affairs. 
 The shape of the current government, with the participation of the left-center Labor Party and the support of other left-wing opposition parties, is intended only to carry out the Gaza plan, which he has opposed from the start, Mr. Sharansky said.
 He said that ''the only real reason for the government's existence now is disengagement,'' to the exclusion of almost all other business, adding, ''It's why I feel I cannot stay there and must resign.'' 
 ''Morally, I feel it's not right for me as a minister, as a politician, to believe in one thing, and with this mandate of my belief, and to go into politics and then to stay in a government that devotes all its efforts in another direction,'' he said.
 Given his reputation as an idealist and dissident, his resignation is unlikely to have a major political impact. 
 Mr. Sharansky said he also objected strongly to Mr. Sharon's intention to separate the Israeli economy as much as possible from the Palestinian one, arguing that Israel will not find real security in physical borders or walls, but only in a Palestinian state that is truly democratic and free, politically and economically.
 ''Their problems are our problems,'' he said, arguing for Israeli engagement with Palestinian society and help to find jobs for its people.
 He remains deeply opposed to Mr. Sharon's unilateral withdrawal of all Israeli settlements and troops from Gaza. ''All my experience and my understanding says that the plan is wrong,'' he said. ''It will not bring peace. It will bring an increase of terror. It will weaken the democratic forces in Palestinian society.''
 He said he hoped to be proved wrong. ''But unfortunately I am right,'' he said, adding that ''because I strongly believe in it, I cannot remain in a government'' devoted almost solely now to carrying out the Gaza withdrawal.
 Mr. Sharansky, 57, is viewed as a quixotic figure in Israeli society and politics. He is admired for his staunch resistance to Soviet oppression and for his Zionism. But many Israelis find his ideas eccentric. 
 Mr. Sharon once told him in a cabinet meeting, ''I understand that in the Soviet Union your ideas were important, but unfortunately they have no place in the Middle East.''
 They seem to have found a place, however, in the affections of Mr. Bush, who has embraced the principles underlying Mr. Sharansky's latest book, ''The Case for Democracy: The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny & Terror'' (PublicAffairs, 2004). It depicts a clear moral universe divided into ''free societies,'' which promote peace, and ''fear societies,'' which foster war. Mr. Bush, however, has given full support to Mr. Sharon's plan to leave Gaza. 
 The point is not to make the world safe for democracy, Mr. Sharansky argues. The point is that the promotion of democracy and human rights will make the world safe.
 Democracy, he says, is not just having elections. ''Democracy is about having free elections in a free society,'' he said, and a free society among the Palestinians can best be promoted with aid and concessions tied to specific reforms, not by supporting this or that leader.
 In particular, Mr. Sharansky wants international aid linked to the promotion of a free Palestinian press and economy, new school textbooks that do not promote anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli themes, the dismantling of terrorist organizations and the replacement of squalid refugee camps with decent housing. ''It won't happen by itself, or because someone likes Abu Mazen,'' he said, using a common name for Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader.
 ''The free world must do everything it can to improve the lives of Palestinians,'' he said, in a process that will lead to a true peace, when Israel can make ''very painful concessions'' and withdraw from occupied lands without security fears.
 While Mr. Bush endorses the Gaza plan ''and hopes the vacuum will be filled with democratic forces,'' he said, ''I don't believe these forces will fill the vacuum by themselves,'' but must be helped by direct linkage to aid and negotiated concessions.
 ''Help Abu Mazen by all means,'' he said. ''We have a much better chance with him. But help and press him, too. It's not a story about good and bad guys, but good and bad societies.''
 Mr. Sharansky has been refining his ideas about democracy for a decade. 
 ''My voice is often believed to be naive, or ridiculous or harmful,'' he freely conceded. But now, he said, ''I'll have more opportunities to explain what I believe in public without restrictions, and I and my friends have a strong position in Likud, and we can work also in the party.'' 
 Some think Mr. Sharansky's call for a democratic Palestinian Authority is simply a pretext for delaying serious peace negotiations -- similar to the dictum of Mr. Sharon's aide, Dov Weissglas, who said serious peace talks would happen only when Palestinians ''turn into Finns.'' But Mr. Sharansky rejects the comparison, saying he has long favored an independent Palestine and wants to engage as soon as possible in a process of democratization matched by Israeli concessions, including significant withdrawals from the occupied West Bank.
 He said he thought Israel was missing a vital opportunity ''to build the peace process correctly'' with the rise of Mr. Abbas and especially Mr. Bush, ''the leader of the free world who believes in these connections, even if my views are dissident here.''

HEADLINE: Interest in Reactors Builds, But Industry Is Still Cautious

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30 

 BODY:
President Bush may be cheerleading for nuclear power, but the electric industry is not ready to order new reactors. 
 Electric companies have shown more interest in building nuclear reactors in the last few months than they have in the last two decades. But conditions are not yet right to induce companies and investors to gamble the billion or two it would take to build a reactor and see whether the country is ready for a second round of plants, according to industry experts.
 The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Nils J. Diaz, said he expects five or six applications by 2008 and has asked Congress for money to add staff members to handle them. ''I have no proof, but that's what they tell me,'' he said in a telephone interview on Friday. ''They come around and whisper, 'You need to have the people there.''' 
 But others remain cautious. John W. Rowe, the chairman of Exelon, the largest nuclear operator in the United States, says that the high price of natural gas is an incentive to build new plants, but that an offsetting factor is the continuing low cost of coal. The lack of a solution for nuclear waste is also a deterrent.
 Mr. Rowe's company, though, is spending millions of dollars to win early approval from the nuclear commission for a new reactor site next to its existing reactor near Clinton in central Illinois. The company is at least five years from a decision on whether to build there, Mr. Rowe said.
 Dominion, an energy company based in Richmond, Va., is also applying to have a site approved for a new reactor. But Thomas E. Capps, the chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview, ''We aren't going to build a nuclear plant anytime soon.
 ''Standard & Poor's and Moody's would have a heart attack,'' said Mr. Capps, referring to the debt-rating agencies. ''And my chief financial officer would, too.'' 
 Mr. Capps said substantial government aid would be needed, perhaps to pay the interest costs during construction, which could take six and a half years. He said that ideally, Congress would also help prevent the project from being dragged into the federal courts. Both ideas would face substantial resistance in Congress.
 Some experts also think a revival is much further away. Peter Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the former head of the public service commissions in New York and Maine, said that in the last 20 years, predictions of a revival had ''rivaled -- in frequency and in accuracy -- forecasts of the second coming of the messiah.'' But the technology is still uneconomic, he said.
 And there is still the risk of accidents, which could devastate the industry even if no one outside a plant was harmed.
 ''The abiding lesson that Three Mile Island taught Wall Street was that a group of N.R.C.-licensed reactor operators, as good as any others, could turn a $2 billion asset into a $1 billion cleanup job in about 90 minutes,'' Mr. Bradford said in an interview conducted by e-mail. 
 The accident at Three Mile Island was 26 years ago, and the far more serious accident at Chernobyl, in Ukraine, was 19 years ago. The industry asserts it has sharply reduced the risk of accidents since then. 
 Environmentalists remain divided. ''Many people in the environmental community think it should be off the table,'' said John Holdren, a professor of environmental policy at Harvard. ''On the other hand, if people are as sensitive about climate as they say they are, how can you throw out the window one of the largest carbon-free sources of energy?''
 The president's suggestion this week that the federal government provide insurance to plant builders against the risk of delays might be helpful, some experts said, but a lot of other factors would have to come into line first. 
 The most prominent is the price of natural gas. Most of the electric plants built in the 1990's were powered with natural gas, but lately gas has sold for between $6 and $8 per million B.T.U., the standard unit in which it is sold. The average price in the 1990's was under $2 per million B.T.U. At that price, a kilowatt-hour of power costs more than 4 cents just for the fuel, and in many hours of the day, that is uncompetitive with coal and other power sources. 
 ''The high gas prices are making all the utilities stop and think twice about solid fuel,'' said David E. Dismukes, an associate professor at Louisiana State University and the associate director of the Center for Energy Studies there. But solid fuel, meaning conventional or lignite coal, carries its own risks because no one is sure what the rules on emissions will be in the decades over which a new plant would operate, experts say. For example, a carbon tax imposed in 2015 could make companies wish they had placed an order for nuclear power instead.
 But Dr. Dismukes said there were competitors to new reactors, including liquefied natural gas, also proposed by Mr. Bush in the same speech. The Bush administration would like to give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority to approve liquefied natural gas plants over the objections of state and local governments, which often are wary because of safety and security considerations.
 Liquefied natural gas could push the price of natural gas down to about $3 per million B.T.U., said Dr. Dismukes, who added, ''I don't know that nuclear works so well'' with natural gas in that price range. 
 Oil prices are up, too, of course, but new nuclear plants would not reduce oil use significantly. 
 Nuclear power also has an unattractive financial history that industry backers say they must overcome to obtain financing for new plants. 
 ''There is a perception in the capital markets, and with the general public, that the next generation of nuclear plants needs help in getting past the perception of risk,'' said Ray W. Ganthner, the senior vice president for new plants at Areva, a French-German company that has sold components for a new plant in Finland and is hoping to do the same here soon. His company recently began the process of obtaining a license for its design here.
 The nation has 103 operating plants, but about the same number were ordered and then canceled, in some cases after hundreds of millions of dollars had been spent on construction, in the 1970's and 80's. 
 The last nuclear reactor ordered in this country that was not later canceled was the Palo Verde plant, in Arizona, in late 1973. The last reactor commissioned was the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar reactor, in 1996 (23 years after the construction permit was obtained). Industry supporters have been predicting a renewal of orders throughout the 80's and 90's. In the mid-90's, there were persistent rumors that a plant had been ordered, but no one could confirm it; in October 1993, a trade publication, Nucleonics Week, joked that the phantom plant should be called Elvis 1.
 But industry executives say they are closer now. Gary Taylor, the president and chief executive of Entergy Nuclear, which runs 10 reactors around the country, said in a telephone interview on Friday that there was a high likelihood of a nuclear plant being ordered in the next few years. His company, like Exelon, has applied for early approval at its Grand Gulf site, on the Mississippi River south of Vicksburg, Miss. Dominion is seeking approval for a site at North Anna, Va., about 40 miles northwest of Richmond. And a fourth company, Duke Power, has expressed strong interest in a reactor without naming a site.
 ''With the president saying this is important to the country, that brings us to a whole new level of playing field,'' Mr. Taylor said. 
 The competition over what type of generating plant to build, he said, is often within a company. In the South, Entergy's biggest area of operation, nuclear competes against gas, the price of which is expected to stay high, he said.
 Still, he said, the industry would require financial help. The underlying economics would have to be sound, he said, but that would not be enough. 
 ''It's got to be shown that it's a business, but it has got to be jump-started,'' he said. ''The only people who can make that happen is the president of the United States and the government.'' Mr. Taylor said loan guarantees and risk insurance of the kind mentioned by Mr. Bush would be very helpful. 
 The risk of licensing problems has been on the minds of nuclear advocates for decades. To try to limit risk, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission began a licensing process in 1989 that was meant to avoid the debacles of the mid-80's. The process, known colloquially as ''one-stop licensing,'' is mostly untried. Under it, a utility can apply for ''early site approval'' with no commitment to build, and vendors can submit completed designs for preapproval.

HEADLINE: Are Our High Schools Obsolete?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re '''What, Me Worry?,''' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, April 29): Mr. Friedman and Bill Gates are profoundly right. Our high school curriculum is substandard for the 21st century. 
 Not long ago in a high school in North Miami, some parents of gifted kids complained to my son, a science teacher, that the homework is too difficult. My son replied, ''I want them to be able to compete with future scientists in Korea and China.'' There were no further complaints.
 How to fix the problem? First, let's agree that there is no Alabama or New York or Oregon math. There is one math, and its most advanced form should be taught. 
 The United States is today one employment entity, and it should have a unified curriculum. States may, if they wish, teach their particular area history, or humanities, but otherwise, ask Bill Gates and other leaders of the economy what is needed. This is the absolute minimum required to reach the high school level education of India and other future competitors.

HEADLINE: Manhattan's Mayor Ahab

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg's obsession with building a football stadium on the Far West Side of Manhattan is in danger of leaving other development projects in its shadow -- including the rebuilding of ground zero. Since Lower Manhattan is where Melville began the saga of ''Moby-Dick,'' it seems appropriate to wonder whether Mr. Bloomberg is turning into a modern-day Ahab, pursuing his great white elephant of a stadium as the former World Trade Center site sinks into trouble. 
 Lower Manhattan isn't the only issue that seems to be left in the lurch while the mayor devotes a disproportionate amount of energy to getting the Jets and new office buildings on the Far West Side and landing the Olympics. Governors Island has been standing lonely and empty out in the harbor while years of talk about development have come to nothing. But shepherding the rebirth of the site of the terrorist attack should rebound to the top of Mr. Bloomberg's priority list. That's true for Gov. George Pataki as well. Mr. Pataki too often gets distracted -- by the elections or the state budget, or, lately, his vague quest for higher office. The governor won't have a political future to worry about if he doesn't keep a clearer eye on the very complicated rebuilding of the World Trade Center site.
 One of the reasons for the sudden sense of crisis downtown is that the Police Department -- headed by one of the officials closest to Mr. Bloomberg -- has suddenly come up with new, detailed security plans that could require substantial changes in the development plans. Security is obviously critical, but since the police and the deputy mayor have been sitting in on planning sessions since the beginning, it's both strange and disturbing that this sudden shift of course is occurring at this late stage. The mayor needs to be at the center of efforts to make the revitalization of downtown work.
 This is also the time for Mr. Bloomberg to be making an all-out effort to persuade Goldman Sachs, whose new building was supposed to be a critical anchor for the area, to rethink its plans to move elsewhere in the city. The mayor's staff insists that he has been engaged in every corner of the city. One way to prove that would be to keep such financial stalwarts as Goldman Sachs downtown.
 As for the Freedom Tower, right now engineers, architects and the developer are all scrambling to figure out how to deal with the new police security standards as quickly as possible. The master plan designer, Daniel Libeskind, has already sketched a few possibilities for turning the office tower into a thinner building, set back farther from the street and merged with the cultural center. It is an interesting possibility that deserves to be part of the give-and-take between Mr. Libeskind and David Childs, who is the architect for the lead developer, Larry Silverstein.
 Mr. Silverstein, who wants the maximum amount of office space, is not likely to be enamored with the idea. But the bottom line cannot be the bottom line here. The tower must be designed to be a spectacular focal point that will draw people to live, work and visit. Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg know that and sometimes even say that. Now it's time to put some sustained energy behind those convictions.

HEADLINE: City Backs Makeover for Decaying Brooklyn Waterfront

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
City officials agreed yesterday to let developers turn the decaying north Brooklyn waterfront, with its relics of Brooklyn's industrial past, into a neighborhood of residential towers with a parklike esplanade along the East River.
 The plan, which rivals the ambition and scope of the creation of Battery Park City, would rezone a 175-block area of Greenpoint and Williamsburg, two neighborhoods that have surged in popularity because of their proximity to Manhattan but whose development has been curtailed because much of the area is now restricted to industrial use.
 The area has become perhaps the most emblematic of Brooklyn's resurgence over the last few decades, as young people seeking an alternative to Manhattan have flocked to its once desolate streets, remaking Williamsburg into a hub of nightlife, art galleries and restaurants just one subway stop away from Manhattan. 
 That has propelled the local housing market, and led to intense pressure to develop acres of abandoned or underutilized properties near the East River that boast stunning views of Manhattan. 
 The rezoning, which was approved unanimously by a key City Council committee, would transform the long-crumbling waterfront into a residential neighborhood complete with 40-story luxury apartment buildings, shops and manicured recreation areas. As envisioned by city planners, the rezoning would help realize decades-long efforts to capitalize on one of New York's most ignored assets, its miles of neglected waterfront, while also protecting a neighborhood that has long been considered a repository for unpopular projects like power plants, waste transfer stations and porn shops.
 ''This rezoning will ensure that the reuse of this priceless but long derelict waterfront will be for the purposes of housing and recreation and not for such inappropriate uses as waste transfer stations and power plants,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told reporters at a late afternoon news conference.
 The plan, which is expected to be approved by the full City Council next week, imposes some novel requirements for developers seeking to build the housing. In order to build to the maximum height of roughly 30 or 40 stories, they must keep at least 20 percent of the homes affordable to low- and middle-income New Yorkers, making it among the most ambitious such programs in the nation, city officials say. And the developers must build the waterfront esplanade, which will eventually be turned over for management to the city's Parks Department.
 The rezoning in north Brooklyn is coming together as the city moves aggressively to spruce up its aging waterfronts, many of which have been in decline for more than a generation as New York's ports lost their prominence. Earlier this year, the city approved the rezoning of a huge swath of the Far West Side of Manhattan for office space and housing and has finally begun putting in place a plan to support a mix of uses, including a cruise ship terminal, on the Red Hook waterfront in Brooklyn.
 But the north Brooklyn plan, whose final version came after intense negotiations between the City Council and Bloomberg administration officials, could yield one of the most extreme transformations of a neighborhood in decades. Inland from the water, the plan seeks to preserve the low-rise scale of the areas, where four- and six-story apartment buildings predominate, as well as the mix of light industry and residences.
 To that end, the plan will designate a 22-block area near the Bushwick Inlet, just beyond the East River waterfront, as an Industrial Business Zone, which brings with it special protections and benefits for businesses operating or moving there, and create a $4 million fund to preserve manufacturing jobs in the neighborhood.
 The plan also creates 54 acres of parkland, including a 28-acre park with an Olympic-quality aquatic center on the river. The waterfront, though, will see the most striking change, and is the scene of the city's broadest test of inclusionary zoning, which allows developers to build larger buildings in exchange for setting aside some of the apartments as lower-cost units.
 To take advantage of this bonus, developers on the waterfront must put aside 20 to 25 percent of their apartments for low- to moderate-income New Yorkers. In the city's calculations, for a family of four, low income is defined as earning up to $50,250 per year, and moderate income is defined as $50,250 to $78,000. 
 In exchange, they will be allowed to put up larger buildings, capped at roughly 30 or 40 stories depending on the location, and they will be eligible for a 25-year tax exemption. Those developers are also eligible for certain grants for the public esplanades they build.
 Those who do not include affordable apartments in their developments would be ineligible for the tax exemption. The size of their buildings would also be smaller, limited to roughly 23 or 33 stories, officials said. In the inland areas, there is also an inclusionary program, but it is smaller in scale.
 Council members involved in the negotiations said that their modifications to the administration's plan will result in the construction of more affordable homes overall, about 33 percent of the more than 10,500 apartments anticipated from the rezoning.
 In addition, Mr. Bloomberg said, the five major developers who own 70 percent of the property within the rezoning area reached an agreement with the city's main building service union to pay union-scale wages.
 ''In 10 years, I can't imagine what Williamsburg-Greenpoint is going to look like,'' said Councilwoman Melinda Katz, Democrat of Queens, who as chairwoman of the Land Use Committee led negotiations with Bloomberg administration officials.
 City Councilman David Yassky, Democrat of Brooklyn, who represents much of the area, echoed that sentiment. ''This is truly a transformative plan for New York City's waterfront,'' he said. Many residents and community advocates, though, have been opposed to the changes envisioned by the city, and some had lobbied for a guarantee that 40 percent of the new housing would be directed to lower-income residents. But several housing advocates watching the voting at City Hall praised city officials for including more lower-cost housing and open space in the plan.
 ''The communities off Williamsburg and Greenpoint win,'' said Brad Lander, director of the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development, ''because today there is a guarantee of new and permanently affordable housing, instead of a virtual guarantee that new development would price residents out of their homes.''

HEADLINE: The Fed Is Expected to Raise Rates Again

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2 

 BODY:
Despite growing evidence of an economic slowdown, the Federal Reserve is not about to ride to the rescue by keeping rates steady.
 A big reason is that in a trend that has confounded the Fed, cheap money is almost as plentiful now as when it started raising rates last June.
 The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, is all but certain to raise short-term rates on Tuesday to 3 percent, from 2.75 percent, the eighth increase since last June.
 Recent public statements by Fed officials, expressing confidence about growth, suggest that the Fed is likely to repeat its support for gradual, or measured, rate increases in the months ahead. This approach comes against the backdrop of both slowing growth and higher price pressures. 
 Economic growth slowed sharply in the first three months of this year, according to preliminary government estimates. Business investment on new equipment slowed sharply, exports lagged far behind imports and consumers were pinched by higher gasoline prices.
 On Monday, a closely watched barometer of manufacturing dropped sharply. The Institute of Supply Management's index of factory activity slid to 53.3 in April, from 55.2, as companies focused more on reducing inventories than on expanding production.Under other circumstances, that kind of data might prompt the Fed to slow down or stop its rate increases, which would reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. 
 But at the same time, inflation has quickened. Consumer prices are up 3.1 percent over the last year, and increased sharply in March. The Fed's preferred measure of core inflation is up 1.7 percent. Core inflation excludes energy and food prices.
 Although the central bank has never set a goal for inflation, officials become uncomfortable if core inflation rises above about 1.5 percent a year. That might be a reason to raise rates more quickly and cool down consumer demand. 
 But the inflation picture is mixed. Labor costs, which are the biggest cost component in production, are climbing slowly. Last Friday, the government reported that employment costs -- wages as well as benefits like health insurance -- climbed at a modest rate of 3.5 percent.
 Fed officials have suggested that the data on growth and inflation may be the largely transitory results of higher oil prices. What is much clearer is that money is still surprisingly cheap, despite the seven rate increases in the past year.
 Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds and on 30-year fixed mortgages are slightly lower now than they were a year ago. Housing prices have been climbing at double-digit rates and the pace of new home sales hit a record in February.
 ''Housing is still very healthy,'' said David A. Lereah, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. Though fixed-rate mortgages have become slightly more expensive in recent weeks, Mr. Lereah said, people are resorting to riskier adjustable-rate and interest-only mortgages to finance rising purchase prices.
 Rates on long-term corporate bonds have also declined over the last year, despite the Fed's actions on overnight lending rates. Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said rates on long-term corporate bonds have slipped from about 6 percent last June to about 5.46 percent now.
 ''What is really unusual is that conditions have eased at a time when the Fed has been pushing the federal funds rate up,'' said Mr. Hatzius. The typical pattern during a period of Fed tightening, he said, is for stock prices to decline and long-term interest rates to go up or for the dollar's exchange rate to climb.
 This time around, long-term rates have declined and stock prices are still slightly ahead of where they were last June. The dollar has weakened against the euro and most other major currencies.
 Brian S. Wesbury, chief investment strategist at Claymore Advisers in Lisle, Ill., said that even the overnight federal funds rate remains far below historic averages.
 Over the long term, Mr. Wesbury said, the federal funds rate has moved roughly in line with the nominal growth of the gross domestic product -- real growth plus inflation. But gross domestic product climbed by about 6 percent in the first quarter of this year, while the Fed funds rate was only 2.75 percent.
 ''That is one of the widest gaps in history between nominal G.D.P. growth and the federal funds rate,'' Mr. Wesbury said. ''I would argue that you have to continue tightening in the near term, because your No.1 priority is making sure that prices don't get out of control.''
 Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, described the surprising persistence of low long-term rates as a ''conundrum'' in mid-February. But just as stock investors in the 1990's shrugged off Mr. Greenspan's warning about ''irrational exuberance,'' bond investors have paid little heed to the ''conundrum.'' 
 Long-term rates edged up in March, but then declined again as new data pointed to slowing economic growth. Prices on Treasury bonds for delivery five years in the future suggest that investors are expecting an after-inflation return of barely 2.5 percent, lower than at any point in the last 20 years.
 ''The conundrum is still very much there,'' said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson/ICAP, a bond-market research firm.

PAYING TO AVOID STANDBY -- For $25, domestic passengers of Northwest Airlines who hold a nonrefundable ticket and wish to change their itinerary can get a same-day confirmed seat on an earlier or later flight. This avoids the uncertainty of the standby list, the carrier said yesterday. The fine print is that the $25 option is subject to seat availability and must be exercised within three hours of the time a customer checks in for the original flight. Kurt Ebenhoch, a Northwest spokesman, explained the advantage to paying for a confirmed seat on an alternate flight rather than standing by, which is free: ''You're at the airport; the flight is within three hours. You could stand by, but for $25 you'd rather have the confidence of knowing you're on, of knowing that you have your seat picked out already and you'll be able to board when boarding begins.''

IT'S ALL ABOUT OIL -- All domestic airlines have been reporting surging traffic and nearly full flights this year, even as most continue piling up heavy losses. In March, for example, major airlines filled 81 percent of their seats with paying customers, the Air Transport Association said. As airline after airline still reported big first-quarter losses, oil prices were cited as the culprit preventing many carriers from making money after years of drastic cost-cutting in every other area of their operations. Last year, the domestic airline industry paid $8 billion more for fuel than it did in 2002, according to John P. Heimlich, chief economist at the Air Transport Association. The prospects? ''I expect to see contraction and consolidation in the industry, both among traditional network carriers and low-cost carriers,'' Mr. Heimlich told the Congressional Economic Leadership Institute in a recent speech. ''And, yes, I expect some airlines to go out of business. It's all a question of how quickly.''

LUXURY HOTEL EXPANSION CONTINUES -- The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company has planted another flag in Indonesia, as major North American luxury hotels keep expanding throughout Asia. The 333-room Ritz-Carlton Jakarta opened Sunday. Introductory rates of $158 on weekdays and $138 on weekends are in effect through Aug. 31, and include breakfast. Meanwhile, Hyatt International opened a 185-room Park Hyatt directly opposite the convention center in Seoul, South Korea, two weeks ago. Opening rates start at $300 a night.

BAGGAGE GUARANTEE -- If your checked bag doesn't get to your destination when you do, Independence Air will give you a voucher, good for a year, for future travel equal to your one-way fare. Independence, a low-cost carrier, said yesterday that the guarantee was intended to increase customer awareness of its brand and its service. Since it ceased operations as Atlantic Coast Airlines and began operating as an independent last November, Independence Air has been struggling for market share against fierce competition and amid soaring oil prices.

WORTH A TRIP -- Fort Smith Regional Airport in Arkansas has America's finest public restrooms, according to a national survey of restrooms by the Cintas Corporation, which sells bathroom hygiene products and services. ''Our maintenance staff does an excellent job making sure that every part of our airport is user-friendly,'' the proud airport said. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: The Performance Vanishes

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Maurice R. Greenberg, former chief executive of American International Group, was a guru to many. To investors and employees, he was the genius who presided over a company that produced consistent growth in a volatile business. Within the insurance industry, Mr. Greenberg was an icon for generating fewer losses than peer companies on the insurance A.I.G. wrote. 
 Now that performance appears to have been a mirage. In A.I.G.'s most recent inventory of accounting improprieties, disclosed late Sunday, the company said it would probably reduce its net worth by $2.7 billion, $1 billion more than it had previously estimated.
 Mr. Greenberg, ousted as chief executive and chairman in March, now resembles the man behind the curtain, working furiously with a handful of colleagues at the top to maintain an awesome image to the investing world that was not quite reality. 
 A.I.G. has made two disclosures about its accounting errors in recent weeks, one on March 30 and another on Sunday. Both are the result of an internal investigation into the company's practices and have focused on how the missteps will reduce its net worth or balance sheet. 
 What may be more interesting to investors, however, is the way the improprieties artificially inflated the company's operating income. Since the company will no longer employ such tactics in the future, the accounting disclosures may provide a clue to how different A.I.G.'s operating results might be in coming years. 
 Using the details the company provided, it appears that almost 90 percent of the $2.7 billion restatement of A.I.G.'s net worth -- $2.4 billion -- consisted of items that would have been reflected on its income statement, which shows profits or losses for each operating segment for the year. That figure is about 3.8 percent of its total operating income from 2000 to 2005.
 Chris Winans, an A.I.G. spokesman, said the company would not comment on the effects that the accounting errors might have on its income statement. Only when the company publishes its long-awaited annual report for 2004, he said, will it become clear how the income statement will look after the improprieties are incorporated in it.
 Mr. Winans did confirm, however, that the $2.7 billion in accounting errors acknowledged by the company going back to 2000 is an after-tax figure. On a pretax basis -- A.I.G.'s tax rate is roughly 30 percent -- that number will grow considerably.
 For the moment, investors seem relieved that the accounting tricks amount to only 3 percent of the company's net worth. Yesterday, they bid A.I.G.'s stock up $2.59, or 5 percent, in heavy trading. Its shares closed yesterday at $53.44.
 Yesterday, analysts at Fitch Ratings, a credit rating concern in Chicago, and at Moody's Investors Service in New York downgraded A.I.G.'s credit quality a notch. Fitch said that ''the uncertainty surrounding A.I.G.'s financial condition and future financial performance has grown to levels beyond the expectations embedded in Fitch's previous rating levels.'' Fitch also said that the outlook for A.I.G.'s credit rating was negative. 
 Sentiment at the rating agencies seemed to extend beyond the impact of the latest disclosure to the company's ability to generate the kind of stellar results that have defined it as an industry leader in recent years.
 ''With all that's happened, they won't quite have the stature they have had,'' said Julie Burke, a managing director in the insurance group at Fitch Ratings. ''They had a unique advantage with reinsurance purchasing, pricing and risk selection. Going forward, insurers and reinsurers will put increased pressure on A.I.G. and it will be harder for them to have those advantages.'' 
 A.I.G. said Sunday that the errors in its accounting ''appear to have had the purpose of achieving an accounting result that would enhance measures important to the financial community and that may have involved documentation that did not accurately reflect the nature of the arrangements.''
 One new area of concern in A.I.G.'s most recent disclosure is so-called top-level adjustments, which involve $100 million of accounting entries made by top management to increase reported earnings. ''A.I.G. has determined that certain entries appear to have been made at the direction of certain former members of senior management without appropriate support,'' the company noted Sunday in its news release.
 People briefed on the investigation said that two of the managers involved in much of the questionable accounting were Mr. Greenberg and Howard I. Smith, the former chief financial officer who was fired in March for refusing to cooperate in the investigation. Andrew M. Lawler, Mr. Smith's lawyer, did not return calls for comment. David Boies, one of many lawyers representing Mr. Greenberg, criticized the report's conclusion, and also that his client did not have a chance to participate in it.
 Trying to understand how A.I.G.'s results were manipulated and how the company will perform in the future without such maneuvers is, at best, a guess. But the effects of the tricks on the company's operating income back to 2000 can be approximated by examining the areas highlighted by the company's recent disclosures and seeing which of them may have enhanced operating income at A.I.G.
 The company has not disclosed figures relating to all of the accounting improprieties and it has not concluded that it has identified all the problems. But armed with the figures A.I.G. has supplied, it appears that roughly $2.4 billion of the accounting errors consisted of items that would have to appear on A.I.G.'s income statement. Computing that as a pretax figure puts the number at around $3.4 billion.
 That number may be high because some of the problems relate to A.I.G.'s investment income, which may have involved tax-free municipal bonds and other instruments with favorable tax treatment. And the company has said that the reversal of improper hedging may add $2.4 billion to its income, although changing its hedging practices will bring considerable volatility to its earnings, A.I.G. said.
 In any case, the overall adjustments announced by A.I.G. seem to show a company concerned about its operating income over the past five years. This is not surprising: financial analysts and investors care deeply about operating income because it is seen as the cleanest representation of how a business is performing.
 ''Both the proposed decrease in shareholders' equity of $2.7 billion and the proposed increase in shareholders' equity of $2.4 billion represent decisions to change what A.I.G.'s officers, directors and auditors at the time concluded were appropriate accounting decisions,'' said Mr. Boies. ''Those decisions were made not merely by former senior management, but by present senior management, including operational heads, and the company's present directors and auditors as well.'' 
 As A.I.G. has acknowledged, the biggest single problematic area in the company's books is the reinsurance deals it struck with the Union Excess Reinsurance Company, a Barbados company that had been seen as independent of A.I.G. but is now viewed as a unit whose business will be consolidated onto A.I.G.'s books. As a result, the premiums recorded by A.I.G. on these deals must now be accounted for as deposits, reducing revenues by $1.2 billion.
 The $300 million that A.I.G. said it did not include in its allowance for doubtful accounts in its domestic brokerage group is also an income statement issue, according to an insurance analyst. So is the $300 million that A.I.G. said it recorded in net investment income when it improperly sold call options on bonds in which the company had unrealized gains. That $300 million was generated by premiums A.I.G. received from the buyers of the call options.
 A.I.G.'s admission that it temporarily redeemed certain investments in hedge funds to generate investment income -- only to buy them back again after a financial reporting period ended -- also manipulated its income. But the company provided no numbers to help quantify the effect, so it is unclear how the income statement will be affected by it.
 Another hit to operating income may result from A.I.G.'s improper transformation of underwriting losses into capital losses. These $200 million in losses relate to the auto warranty business conducted with the Capco Reinsurance Company Ltd., a Barbados reinsurer. An additional $200 million in deferred acquisition costs -- such as commissions promised to sellers of life insurance -- that the company did not account for correctly will almost certainly reduce its operating income. 
 A.I.G.'s accounting for so-called life settlements, which allow life insurance policyholders to cash in their policies while they are still alive, was also improper. Although it is not clear that this reduction will affect its operating income, one analyst said it probably would. That mistake totals $100 million, A.I.G. said. 
 Adjustments that A.I.G. said it would make in accounting entries at the parent company -- the ''top level'' entries -- are also likely to be deducted from its income. These total $100 million.
 Taken together, the improper accounting points to a $2.4 billion impact on A.I.G.'s income statement.
 Regulators involved in the investigation were surprised by A.I.G.'s conclusion that a reinterpretation of rules for hedge accounting would result in a $2.4 billion increase in the company's net worth -- almost offsetting the $2.7 billion decrease in net worth. 
 Representatives from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York attorney general's office and the New York State Insurance Department were first briefed last week on the hedge accounting issue and were told that it was a large and complex problem that would require significant time to understand. 
 But over the weekend, A.I.G., in conjunction with its auditors and lawyers, concluded that a $2.4 billion increase would be appropriate. One person briefed on A.I.G.'s hedge accounting said the company was able to arrive at a conclusion so quickly because its auditors at PricewaterhouseCoopers chose a method that did not require as much time as A.I.G. originally had thought. 
 The question investors face, of course, is whether A.I.G. will be able to sustain its growth and hegemony in the insurance world without using accounting gimmickry. ''There is clearly risk associated with an investment in shares of A.I.G.,'' wrote William M. Wilt, insurance analyst at Morgan Stanley, who recommends the stock. ''Moreover we do not think the stock will recapture the valuation levels it once enjoyed.'' 
 Certainly, Mr. Greenberg's famous complaints about overzealous regulators and A.I.G.'s being above the fray will no longer be heard. 
 In his letter to shareholders in the company's 2003 annual report, he wrote: ''The whole country is paying a price for the gross misdeeds of relatively few executives who shirked their responsibility to create value for all of their corporate constituencies -- shareholders, customers and employees -- and abused the system to create wealth for themselves and their close associates. It is unfortunate that the misbehavior of a few companies and their executives could have a negative impact on so many.''

HEADLINE: Laura Bush Talks Naughty

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When King Agamemnon and his fleet of warships were becalmed in the Aegean Sea, he ordered his wife to fetch their daughter so she could be sacrificed to the gods. It worked, sort of. The winds picked up and blew the Greek ships to triumph at Troy, although Agamemnon's wife did murder him later.
 Republican presidents rely on a slightly less cruel sacrificial ritual for their problems. Their wives appease the media gods with comedy routines. 
 Each spring, when politicians and reporters convene for formal dinners that are supposed to be funny and are often compared to root canals, they talk about Nancy Reagan's ''Secondhand Clothes'' the way fans talk about the 1927 Yankees. The Reagans' image for conspicuous consumption was never the same after Mrs. Reagan put on rags in 1982 to sing a lampoon of her spending habits.
 But on Saturday night, Laura Bush set a new standard. After interrupting her husband and telling him to sit down, she did a stand-up routine that included what was probably the first joke told in earshot of a president that involved him and a horse's phallus.
 Mrs. Bush called her husband Mr. Excitement for going to bed by 9 o'clock and turning her into a ''desperate housewife.'' She said that Lynne Cheney's Secret Service code name became Dollar Bill after they both went to Chippendales (where they ran into Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg). Noting that Andover and Yale did not have ''real strong ranching programs,'' she said Mr. Bush had started his ranching career by trying to milk a horse -- a male horse. 
 Her timing had the audience howling, and the edgier lines had them gasping. Jokes about pent-up sexual frustration from a prim librarian? With her born-again husband sitting there and enjoying it? And cameras recording it for Republican preachers who are determined to get sex out of schools and off television?
 For the mainly Democratic audience -- this was a crowd of Washington journalists and luminaries from Hollywood and Manhattan -- it was an evening of cognitive dissonance. How to reconcile this charming image on stage with the Bush they love to bash?
 Mrs. Bush's performance, and her husband's reaction, wasn't a shock to the reporters who cover the White House. For years they have tried to convince their friends outside Washington that Mr. Bush is actually not a close-minded dolt, and Mrs. Bush is no Stepford Wife or Church Lady. Yes, they're Texans who go to church and preach family values, but they're not yahoos or religious zealots. 
 The coverage of Mrs. Bush's comic debut may change some minds, but for devout Bush-bashers, it's much easier to stay the course. If you live in a blue-state stronghold, a coastal city where you can go 24 hours without meeting any Republicans, it's consoling to think of the red staters as an alien bunch of strait-laced Bible thumpers. 
 Otherwise, how do you explain why they're Republican? Or answer the question Democrats asked in astonishment when they saw Mr. Bush's vote totals: Who are these people?
 The favorite Democratic explanation is that the red staters are hicks who have been blinded by righteousness, as Thomas Frank argues in ''What's the Matter With Kansas?'' He laments that middle-class Kansans are so bamboozled by moral issues like abortion and school prayer that they vote for Republicans even though the Republican tax-cutting policies are against their self-interest.
 But middle-class Americans don't simply cast ballots for Republicans. They also vote with their feet, which is why blue states and old Democratic cities are losing population to red states and Republican exurbs. People are moving there precisely because of economic reasons -- more jobs, affordable houses and the lower taxes offered by Republican politicians. 
 They're not moving for the churches, and they don't vote for Mr. Bush simply because he reads the Bible every day. One of the main reasons they like him is that he gets bashed so often. When Jon Stewart sneers at him, they empathize because they're used to being sneered at themselves. 
 They know what their image is in Manhattan and Hollywood, and they know they're not all that different from the Democrats in those places. They, too, watch ''Desperate Housewives,'' and they're not surprised to hear Laura Bush doing Chippendales jokes. They've spent their own dollar bills there. They don't see anything the matter with that -- or with themselves.

HEADLINE: Tracking the Imperiled Bluefin From Ocean to Sushi Platter

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
For sushi aficionados, the essence of the Atlantic bluefin tuna is its fat-laced, butter-soft belly meat, called toro. For the long-liners, purse seiners, harpooners, trappers and fish farmers who seek the bluefin from Cape Hatteras to the frigid waters south of Iceland to the balmy Mediterranean, the fish are a potential bonanza, with choice specimens fetching $50,000 or more in Tokyo.
 But the intensifying trade in bluefin may soon empty the waters of this master of the sea.
 In just the last 35 years, exploding markets for sushi-grade tuna, combined with intensifying industrial-scale hunts aided by satellites and spotters in airplanes, have devastated not only the fish but also many fisheries.
 Dozens of Mediterranean towns that maintained coastal net traps for half a millennium or more are turning away from now-barren waters. Anglers off New England, who once watched great parading schools of bluefin migrate north at the end of each summer now scour the seas for scattered fish. Most vulnerable, by far, marine biologists say, is the apparently distinct population of bluefin tuna that breeds in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 The threat to the bluefin was underscored last week by researchers who have tracked hundreds of the fish on their ocean-spanning journeys using electronic tags. They found that the tuna that spawn in the west, which are most severely depleted, are further threatened by an ever-broadening gantlet of hooks, seines, harpoons, traps and now farm-style pens, in which netted fish are raised and fattened -- all to supply the Japanese sushi trade.
 Dr. Barbara A. Block, a marine biologist at Stanford and the lead author of a study, published in the April 28 issue of Nature, said she found it hard to believe that ''a fish of this size and beauty, an animal that had captured the hearts of fishermen and scientists alike for millennia, is slipping off Earth.''
 The bluefin, known to biologists as Thunnus thynnus, is a wonder of metabolic and evolutionary perfection, a Ferrari-like mix of refinement and brute power. 
 Adult bluefins, some topping half a ton and living 40 years, slice through icy or tropical waters while maintaining their body temperature around 80 degrees. 
 Their physiology allows their ruby-red muscles to generate a split-second tail flick, rocketing the fish to on-ramp speeds in pursuit of prey. But having an oceanic range may also be their undoing, exposing them to harvests at every turn.
 Dr. Block has been studying the physiology and behavior of tunas for 25 years. Lately, she has spent much of her time at sea, surgically implanting tags in thrashing giants hauled briefly onto the decks of sport and commercial fishing boats assisting in her research.
 From her base next to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which helps support her work, she leads a research team that focuses on every facet of the bluefin, from its evolution, genetics and unique muscle physiology to its diet and migrations.
 ''We're trying to see the planet through their lens,'' Dr. Block said. But increasingly, she added, the bluefin are seeing the end of a fishing line, the inside of a net and the hold of a fishing boat.
 The new study is based on the research team's grueling, decade-long effort to implant hundreds of increasingly sophisticated electronic tags in the giant fish, an enterprise that is beginning to reveal in new detail their ocean paths, from feeding grounds along the East Coast and in frigid waters south of Iceland to spawning areas in the balmy Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean.
 Most tagging studies provide only two data points -- the place and time of release and the place and time of capture. In this study, 772 fish were tagged with sophisticated devices that continually record body and water temperature, depth and daylight. Some tags stayed in the fish until they were caught, often for years. Others were intended to break a tether, pop to the surface and relay stored data to satellites after a programmed number of weeks.
 In all, 330 tags provided unparalleled records of fish as they repeatedly dove thousands of feet, traversed the ocean in a few weeks, and routinely crossed imaginary lines drawn nearly 25 years ago by tuna-fishing nations to divvy up what were thought to be separate eastern and western populations.
 In the study, Dr. Block's team showed that there indeed appear to be distinct populations of bluefin that spawn either in the gulf to the west or the Mediterranean to the east.
 But when the fish disperse across the Atlantic to feed, they mingle, rendering the management boundary, which runs along the 45th meridian, relatively meaningless.
 That means that big quotas, granted for two decades to countries fishing east of the line, probably added pressure to the ailing western bluefin population, said Dr. John J. Magnuson, an emeritus professor of zoology at the University of Wisconsin. He was chairman of a National Academy of Sciences panel that included Dr. Block and that assessed the tuna's problems in 1994.
 ''Fishing the mixed fishery as though it is a strong stock depletes and can eliminate the weak stock,'' he said.
 The tuna spawning in the gulf are even more endangered, Dr. Block and her team said, because spawning ''hot spots'' overlap with areas where boats, using long lines of baited hooks, pursue another tuna species, the yellowfin.
 When big adult bluefin get caught on the lines, the researchers said, the warm water and their high-revving metabolism can push them beyond their physiological limits. Many die before they can be released. The toll is significant because it includes fish at the peak of their reproductive potential, the researchers said. 
 In the paper, Dr. Block and her colleagues recommended seasonal bans on long-line fishing in spawning hot spots in the gulf. They also urged tighter controls on fishing in the Central Atlantic, where a feeding area straddles the existing boundary line and fish from both coasts congregate. Right now, that area is intensively fished by a host of countries with almost no monitoring.
 Without action, Dr. Block said, the western population has little hope. ''If such megafauna can disappear, imagine what else is occurring?'' she said. ''And it's all because we do not have a system that manages the oceans properly.''
 American boat owners say that existing restrictions on long-line fishing in the Gulf are sufficient, and add that the spawning zones identified by Dr. Block are likely to shift each year, making specific ''time-area closures'' impossible. Long-liners in the area also use lightweight hooks that hold smaller yellowfin but are designed to uncoil under the powerful tug of a bluefin, they say.
 Dr. Block said that when she worked on long-line vessels in the region, the same smaller hooks caught and killed a substantial number of bluefin. She added that only a few percent of longliners in the area carry observers who independently tally bluefin deaths.
 Perhaps the biggest unresolved question is whether the new information can change an international regulatory regime that almost everyone, from anglers and commercial fishers to biologists and tuna diplomats, agrees is broken.
 There are signs that the accumulated scientific evidence is starting to sway some members of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, the body created under a treaty in 1969 to oversee the fishery.
 For two decades, many marine biologists have criticized the organization for setting quotas too high and for favoring data and analyses provided by the industry. 
 In an interview last week, Masanori Miyahara, the chairman of the commission and a senior fisheries official from Japan, acknowledged that the existing system had failed.
 ''We've spent too much time under the wrong assumption -- two-stock management,'' he said. ''After 25 years of those measures we don't see any improvement in western spawners. We believe something is definitely wrong.''
 He said that eastern catch limits needed to be better enforced, and he noted that a particular problem was the greatly increased penning of Mediterranean tuna, which disrupts spawning.
 A meeting of scientific advisers to the commission will take place next month to consider new ways to manage the fish stocks. Mr. Miyahara added that Japan was particularly committed to restoring the bluefin.
 ''We feel some responsibility for this mess,'' he said. ''Japanese buyers are running all around the world and buying as many fish as possible, particularly bluefin. 
 ''We're seriously working with our buyers now to contain their eagerness,'' Mr. Miyahara said.
 Even with such statements, and the new research, many scientists and scholars who study tuna and tuna fishing said they doubted much would change.
 Glenn Delaney, an American who formerly served on the international commission and represents American fishing companies at meetings of the group, said Dr. Block's findings, while possibly correct, were at best preliminary and spotty -- and thus unlikely to move the commission to act.
 Mr. Delaney is one of many people in the tuna debate, including a host of biologists and environmental campaigners, who view Europe as a bigger impediment to better protections than Japan or the United States. Under the longstanding division of the Atlantic bluefin population, Europe has long had the advantage, with recent quotas of more than 30,000 metric tons of bluefin a year; less than a tenth that is allocated for western waters.
 In an e-mail message, John Spencer, the chief European negotiator in international commission meetings, said that Europe had an ''open mind'' about management options after 2006. But, he added, ''If we are going to change the current system, which has brought stability to the management, then we need to be demonstrated the added value of any new system.''
 William T. Hogarth, the assistant administrator for fisheries of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that trade sanctions or other economic measures may be required to push some countries to end routine violations of size and catch limits by their fleets. 
 As long as the issue is hashed out only in the invisible realm of fisheries bureaucracies, there will be little progress, environmental experts and industry representative agreed.
 They also agreed that while the international commission has been a problem, the organization and the underlying treaty are the only source of a solution, as well.
 For the moment, however, there are few signs of change. Last month, a group of fisheries experts from the international commission met in Fukuoka, Japan, to ponder alternative systems for managing the shared resource. The main camps -- the United States, Europe and Japan -- staked out starkly different positions.
 Several tuna experts who were not involved with the new study said that Dr. Block's pointillist maps, showing the movements of some tuna for more than four years, were sufficiently concrete that they could force an end to the prolonged stalemate.
 ''Without her, we'd be in exactly the same place we were 15 years ago: a bunch of theoreticians waving their hands and a bunch of European fisheries politicians arguing the case based on no data,'' said Dr. E. Don Stevens, an emeritus professor of zoology at the University of Guelph in Ontario and an author of the 1994 National Academy of Sciences tuna study.
 ''If the managers do not accept this evidence,'' Dr. Stevens said, ''then it seems to me that they will never accept any evidence and that their argument is not based on logic but rather is based on shortsighted political grounds.''

HEADLINE: Baby Boomers Say, Don't Blame Us

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 I disagree with Nicholas D. Kristof's view of the generations in America. Instead of addressing the issue of a growing population of elders as a positive, though challenging, demographic change, he pits elders against kids. How easy to paint this as a generational issue with an ''either/or'' solution. 
 Should we assure health care and economic security for a growing population of elders? Of course we should. Should we do a better job keeping kids out of poverty and getting them health care? Absolutely. Kids need a good foundation for what we hope is a fulfilling, productive life. If we're successful, those kids will eventually become, well, old. So, we come full circle. 
 If we persist in pitting one generation against the other, we'll continue spending time and energy on the wrong issues. We need a society that values each of us, at any age.

HEADLINE: U.S. Demand Deepens Gulf With Iran Over Nuclear Facilities

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 2 

 BODY:
The gulf between Iran and the United States deepened Monday when the Bush administration, at the opening of a conference on the future of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, demanded that Iran dismantle all the ''equipment and facilities'' it has built over the past two decades to manufacture nuclear material.
 The demand, made by Stephen G. Rademaker, an assistant secretary of state who spoke at the opening of the conference in the chamber of the General Assembly on Monday afternoon, is a longtime demand but it comes at a sensitive moment. Just two days earlier Iran threatened to resume some production activities. As part of its negotiations with the European Union over the future of its nuclear program -- which it insists is solely intended for electricity production -- Iran has demanded that it be allowed to install 3,000 centrifuges, which enrich uranium. If enriched at a low level, that uranium could fuel a nuclear power plant. But the centrifuges could also produce enough highly enriched uranium to manufacture nuclear weapons. 
 Mr. Rademaker's statement on Monday was intended to focus the conference on loopholes in the 35-year-old treaty, which he charged that Iran and North Korea have exploited. ''Today, the treaty is facing the most serious challenge in its history due to instances of noncompliance,'' he said. Though the International Atomic Energy Agency has said it has yet to find concrete evidence of a weapons program in Iran, Mr. Rademaker expressed no doubts about what Iran had done. 
 ''For almost two decades Iran has conducted a clandestine nuclear weapons program, aided by the illicit network of A.Q. Khan,'' Mr. Rademaker said, referring to the head of Pakistan's nuclear research laboratory, who was at the center of a huge black-market network in nuclear technology. Mr. Rademaker offered the administration's first public confirmation that Mr. Khan had also traded in nuclear weapons designs -- a reference to a Chinese design for a nuclear weapon that the Khan network provided Libya, though he stopped short of saying that Iran had also been given that design. ''We assume that what the Libyans got the Iranians also got,'' a senior American intelligence official said recently. ''But can we prove it? Not yet.''
 The Bush administration has long demanded that North Korea dismantle all of its nuclear facilities, and in Washington Mr. Bush's aides have argued that President Clinton erred in 1994 by signing an accord with the North that did not require the country to dismantle its facilities and ship all of its nuclear material out of the country. The North has refused to do so, and pulled out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 2003. It now asserts that it has reprocessed its stockpile of spent nuclear fuel into nuclear weapons.
 At the conference here, there is considerable concern that Iran will follow the same model. Its chief nuclear negotiator said on Friday that in the next week Iran's leaders will decide whether to resume the production of a form of uranium that can be poured into centrifuges for enrichment. Both American officials and officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency said they were concerned that as Iran's June elections draw nearer, a politically popular drive to restart the nuclear program may accelerate. 
 Mr. Rademaker described the American demands by saying that any solution ''must include permanent cessation of Iran's enrichment and reprocessing efforts, as well as dismantlement of equipment facilities related to such activity.'' 
 The dispute over what Iran should and should not be allowed to do encapsulates the challenges facing the review of the treaty, which takes place every five years.
 The 184 signers of the treaty who do not have nuclear weapons, or who have given them up, insist that the central bargain of the 1970 accord allows any signer to build nuclear facilities as long as they are for peaceful purposes. The treaty gives the International Atomic Energy Agency the responsibility to inspect those facilities to make sure that they are not being turned to weapons production.
 They also contend that the United States is not living up to its commitment that all nuclear weapons nations will move toward the elimination of their arsenals. Mr. Rademaker insisted Monday that progress was being made, noting that the Moscow Treaty signed three years ago with Russia requires huge reductions in deployed nuclear warheads by 2012. But he did not mention the treaty provision that critics note permits the United States to keep thousands of additional warheads in nonoperational storage. The treaty also leaves unclear what will happen after 2012, though Mr. Rademaker noted in an interview on Friday that ''it is no one's intention to rebuild the arsenal.''
 With the weapons and nonweapons countries so divided, Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, and Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, tried to find middle ground today. Mr. Annan said that the former cold war rivals must commit ''to further cuts in their arsenals, so that warheads number in the hundreds, not the thousands.'' Dr. ElBaradei sought to calm the fears of nonnuclear states that they would be cut off from nuclear technology as a result of the growing effort to keep it out of the hands of nations like Iran and North Korea.
 Dr. ElBaradei argued that his agency needed broader rights to inspect any facilities it desired, and to enforce stricter control over the most sensitive technology. But he also renewed his call for guarantees that any country that needed reactor technology or nuclear material for power generation would be guaranteed a supply, saying that ''is clearly a prerequisite'' for acceptance of international controls on the technology.

HEADLINE: Hitting the Middle Class, Again

 BODY:
As he moved into the home stretch of his 60-day Social Security road show last week, it became clear that President Bush had saved the worst for last. 
 Mr. Bush endorsed a proposal that would take a huge bite out of the Social Security retirement benefits for the middle class, claiming that would close some 70 percent of the system's financing gap. That figure is almost certainly overstated. Under the proposed reductions, young workers who now earn about $36,000 would face a 16 percent cut; those earning about $58,000 would face a cut of 25 percent, and those earning $90,000, 29 percent. People not yet in the work force would face even larger reductions. 
 Mr. Bush says these cuts would enable the system to continue paying benefits at the current level to the 30 percent of recipients who now make less than $20,000. But fully two-thirds of retirees rely on Social Security for more than half of their income. Moreover, the Bush plan gives the false impression that the wealthiest beneficiaries would bear the most pain. That's not the case. The wealthier one is, the lower the percentage of retirement income coming from Social Security, so even a big cut has little impact. By 2075, an average worker's benefit cut would equal 10 percent of pre-retirement income; a millionaire's reduction would be only 1 percent. 
 Worse, if Mr. Bush succeeded in creating private accounts, these newly proposed cuts would be only the first whack at retirement benefits. Workers who opened private accounts would also see their government benefits reduced by one dollar for every dollar invested -- plus interest, computed at 3 percentage points above inflation. That would occur even if a private account performed miserably. In the end, the Social Security checks would be minimal -- or nonexistent -- for millions of Americans. 
 But Social Security can be strengthened without cuts as blunt and inflexible as the ones Mr. Bush proposes. Let's start by incorporating Americans' longer lives into the formula for Social Security benefits, ending the need for continual increases in the retirement age. To account for the life expectancy of today's average 35-year-old, for example, adjustments could be made now that would reduce the benefit in 2036 by about $300 a year. A chunk of the Social Security shortfall could also be closed by linking life expectancy to income level. The affluent live longer than the poor, and the gap is growing.
 Politicians also have to face the hard truth about taxes. Raising the payroll tax by a mere three-tenths of a percentage point -- starting 10 years from now and adding tiny increments over the succeeding 20 years -- would be fair and lucrative, without being too steep or too sudden. It would also be fair to raise the cap on wages subject to the Social Security tax to about $150,000 from the current $90,000. 
 President Bush's overall approval rating and his marks for his handling of Social Security have declined since he put privatization at the top of his agenda. The American people are trying to tell him that there are better ways to go. He obviously can't hear them, but we hope Congress can.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe Play Down Aircraft Dispute

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PARIS, May 2 

 BODY:
The United States and the European Union played down their dispute over the aircraft makers Airbus and Boeing on Monday and instead joined forces to bring global trade talks back from the brink of crisis.
 In contrast with April, when Washington and Brussels missed their deadline for a deal to cut subsidies to the two aircraft makers, each side spoke of working together to secure a draft deal on the Doha round of talks by December.
 ''I was encouraged by the meeting, both by its seriousness and its atmospherics,'' the trade negotiator for the European Union, Peter Mandelson, said after meeting the new United States trade representative, Rob Portman, in Paris. ''He showed a real grasp of the issues and what's needed to advance Doha.'' 
 Mr. Portman and Mr. Mandelson touched only briefly on the dispute over aircraft manufacturers' subsidies, which could start the largest commercial dispute in history if it went to the World Trade Organization.
 ''Mr. Mandelson and Mr. Portman agreed that a negotiated solution remained the most desirable option,'' the European Union said in a statement. ''They agreed to continue their dialogue.''
 The sides set aside competing lawsuits in January, giving themselves three months to reach a deal on eliminating billions of dollars in support received by the two companies.
 But talks broke down in March, with Mr. Mandelson and Robert B. Zoellick -- then the United States trade representative -- accusing each other of slamming down the phone in a heated conversation.
 Mr. Portman on Monday played down tensions with the European Union, saying trade ties between the economic superpowers were healthy. ''While disagreements such as the Airbus-Boeing dispute are significant and grab the headlines, our healthy $1.6 trillion trans-Atlantic economic relationship testifies to the larger ties that bind us,'' he wrote in The International Herald Tribune.
 The talks on Monday preceded a Paris gathering of trade ministers from rich and poor nations over the next two days. They also followed warnings from the head of the W.T.O. over the slow pace of negotiations.
 With just three months left for W.T.O. states to conclude some important deals, Supachai Panitchpakdi, the director general of the W.T.O., said last week that he was beginning to have doubts that the deadline would be met.
 Failure to meet the July deadline would jeopardize the chances of W.T.O. ministers signing off on a draft deal for the round at a conference in Hong Kong in December, itself a crucial step if the negotiations are to be completed in 2006 as planned.

HEADLINE: Military Base Closings Will Sting, Panel Chairman Says

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3 

 BODY:
The chairman of the independent commission that will review the Pentagon's list of recommended military base closings warned Tuesday that the impending decisions would be ''tsunamis in the communities they hit.'' 
 The chairman, Anthony J. Principi, a former secretary of veterans affairs, also promised to provide a ''clear-eyed reality check'' of the Defense Department's decisions to close or consolidate military bases around the country. 
 Mr. Principi spoke at the first meeting of the commission, in a hearing room on Capitol Hill where the Government Accountability Office also issued a report stating that communities that lost bases in previous years were ''continuing to recover'' and had regained about 85 percent of the civilian jobs that were lost. 
 The report said that most communities affected by four earlier rounds of base closings, beginning in 1988, were faring well when compared with the average American unemployment and income-growth rates, but it added, ''The recovery process has not necessarily been easy.''
 Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is to deliver his recommendations to the commission next week, probably Friday, in the first round of base closings in a decade and one that Mr. Rumsfeld seeks to make a cornerstone of his plan to remake the military into a leaner, more agile force. 
 While the Pentagon has said it has nearly 25 percent more capacity than what the armed services need and that all 425 domestic bases are under scrutiny, Mr. Rumsfeld said recently that the 70,000 troops returning home from Europe over the next several years would soften the blow for scores of communities nationwide. 
 At Tuesday's initial meeting of the commission, all nine members were sworn in, and Mr. Principi announced that the panel would hold several hearings on Capitol Hill and across the country to analyze the Pentagon's rationale and hear reaction from state and community groups, as well as military specialists.
 Panel members and their staff said they had little inkling of what Mr. Rumsfeld would recommend. The Pentagon has sought to clamp down on information leaks by requiring hundreds of employees involved in the process over the last two years to sign secrecy oaths. 
 A top Pentagon official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the oaths, said that there were working lists of proposed base closings and realignments circulating at senior levels but that Mr. Rumsfeld had not yet been briefed on a final set of recommendations. 
 The military value of a base, particularly its impact on fighting wars, training and combat readiness, as well as the potential cost savings, are among the major criteria that Pentagon analysts have used in their calculations. The panel members and their 90 staff members will use that criteria in their review. 
 ''Every dollar consumed in redundant, unnecessary, obsolete, inappropriately designed or located infrastructure is a dollar not available to provide the training that might save a marine's life or purchase the munitions to win a soldier's firefight,'' Mr. Principi said. 
 He told fellow commission members, Congressional aides, lobbyists and reporters packed into the hearing room, ''The ripples of the proposals the secretary of defense will soon present to our nation, and to us, will be tsunamis in the communities they hit.''
 State and local officials from California to Florida are bracing for the worst, and going to extraordinary lengths to insulate hometown bases from cuts or consolidation.
 Some bases in Texas, however, like Fort Hood and Fort Bliss, may actually grow by absorbing troops returning from Europe. 
 In Illinois, officials fear that Scott Air Force Base, near St. Louis, and the Rock Island Arsenal could be on the chopping block. These officials have also expressed concern that two Air National Guard bases, one in Springfield and another in Peoria, are considered vulnerable as the Air Force looks to merge many of its active-duty and reservist units. 
 In late March, House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and two other senior Illinois lawmakers wrote Mr. Rumsfeld to warn him that closing any National Guard base would, by law, require the state governor's approval.
 The Pentagon's top acquisition official, Michael W. Wynne, wrote back to the lawmakers last month to inform them politely that they were wrong. 
 In Massachusetts last month, Gov. Mitt Romney asked the Department of Homeland Security to build a new antiterrorism training center at Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod, in an effort to protect the installation from closing. 
 On Tuesday, the commission members, who are largely retired military officers selected by President Bush and Congressional leaders, were given a tutorial by Congressional analysts on the history and procedures of the base-closing process. They also received an update on national security threats. 
 A final roster of cuts and other changes, prepared by the commission, is due Sept. 8. Mr. Bush and Congress must then accept or reject the list by Nov. 7. 
 In four previous base-closing rounds, 85 percent of the Pentagon's findings were endorsed.

HEADLINE: Fed Raises Rates but Bobbles Delivery

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and JONATHAN FUERBRINGER; Edmund L. Andrews reported from Washington for this article and Jonathan Fuerbringer from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark short-term interest rate on Tuesday by a quarter-point, to 3 percent, and signaled that it was more worried about rising prices than about slower growth.
 It was the eighth increase in the federal funds rate on overnight bank loans since June, and the central bank left little doubt in explaining its decision that more rate increases will follow.
 But in a remarkable error that muddled the Fed's message for nearly two hours, the central bank said it inadvertently omitted a crucial sentence from its original statement, noting that central bankers thought inflation expectations were still ''well contained.'' Omitting the phrasing, which has been standard in Fed statements in recent months, initially suggested to Fed watchers that officials might be more worried about a return of the self-perpetuating inflationary psychology of the 1970's and early 1980's. 
 About five minutes before the markets closed at 4 p.m., the central bank announced that it had made a mistake and issued a new statement that included the traditional reassurance about ''well-contained'' expectations.
 In their official statement, the Fed's policy makers acknowledged that the sharp rise in oil prices had taken a toll on the economy. But they noted that employment continues to rise, a trend that reduces the pressure to spur consumer spending with low borrowing costs. Despite slower growth, the Fed reaffirmed its goal of raising rates at a ''measured'' pace and sounded more worried than before that higher energy prices were pushing up other consumer prices.
 Even with the amended statement, policy makers appear more worried about inflation than they were in March.
 ''Pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident,'' their statement noted. And in contrast to the wording in March, the panel omitted a soothing declaration that higher energy prices had not significantly fed into increases in ''core'' consumer prices outside of food and energy.
 Analysts said that change reflected worrisome new inflation data in March, when the core rate of consumer price inflation was 0.4 percent, the biggest increase in nearly four years.
 Despite a clear slowdown in economic growth over the last month or two, the Federal Reserve did not budge from earlier statements that the current level of interest rates was still ''accommodative'' and that its goal was to keep nudging them up until low borrowing costs no longer provide a stimulus to the economy.
 ''Recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices,'' the central bank said. Fed officials did not suggest, as they did in a similar situation last summer, that the slowdown would be ''transitory'' or a ''soft patch,'' in the words of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman.
 The unexpected amending of the Fed's statement just before 4 p.m. caught the bond market by surprise and cost traders some money. As for stocks, the announcement was so close to the end of the session that its impact was muted. But stocks rose in the last few minutes of trading.
 ''I can't remember anything like this,'' said Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP. He said one reason the market was caught off balance was that the original statement was the kind of negative news many bond traders had prepared for.
 The head trader on the Treasury desk at a major bank, who spoke on the condition he not be identified, said, ''I can tell you it cost us some money.''
 When the original statement was released at 2:15 p.m., the price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell immediately but modestly. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.21 percent from 4.19 percent. 
 After the announcement of the restoration, the yield fell quickly to 4.15 percent and the price jumped. In late trading, the yield was at 4.16 percent.
 ''I think people took positions on a set of facts that they thought to be correct and then they changed,'' the trader said. For a few minutes, he said, it was hard to buy Treasury securities to cover losing positions, and traders who were short in their holdings had to buy back Treasuries quickly to avoid losses.
 Lundy Wright, who runs the Treasury desk at Nomura Securities International, said, ''A lot of people who had taken short positions thought the day was over and so it really did catch the market by surprise.'' 
 But the overall move of the market, he said, was not that large. ''You can't say it created a terrific amount of damage,'' he said.
 In its statement, the central bank noted that the job market had continued to improve, a trend that reduces pressure on the Fed to stimulate activity by keeping interest rates lower than normal.
 The nation's economic growth slowed to 3.1 percent in the first three months of 2005, from 3.8 percent in the final quarter of 2004, according to preliminary government estimates. Figures on job growth in April will be released Friday.
 The latest economic signals have been mixed. Just hours before the Fed announcement, the government reported that factory orders were almost flat in March, but the slight gain surprised many analysts, who had expected another decline.
 On Monday, a closely watched barometer of manufacturing dropped sharply. The Institute of Supply Management's index of factory activity slid to 53.3 in April, from 55.2, as companies focused more on reducing inventories than expanding production. It was the fifth drop in a row for that index. It came as global economic growth, especially in Europe and Japan, appears to be slowing to about 1 percent a year.
 Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said the Fed had reinforced his sense that it was more worried about faster inflation than slower growth and that officials were likely to keep nudging up short-term interest rates at their remaining policy meetings this year.
 ''Clearly, they are now worried about core consumer price inflation,'' he said. ''There's no hint that they have any intention of stopping anytime soon.''
 For all the confusion, the financial markets reacted calmly to both the Fed's initial statement at 2:15 p.m., which seemed especially bearish about inflation, and to its correction.
 For investors, the decision to raise short-term interest rates was a foregone conclusion. The uncertainty was whether the Federal Reserve would signal any change in its strategy of raising rates in small increments back up to a ''neutral'' level that neither stalls growth nor promotes inflation.
 ''Inflation is now back at the top of the central bank's agenda,'' concluded Ian Shepherdson, who tracks the United States economy for High Frequency Economics, ''and nothing short of a serious slowdown will remove it.''

HEADLINE: Party On! It's a Civic Duty

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Like so many science fiction fantasies, Hal Hartley's new film, ''The Girl From Monday,'' begins with a clever satirical premise, then stumbles all over itself trying to tell a coherent, original story. This deadpan comedy, which Mr. Hartley has called ''a fake science fiction film about the way we live now,'' is set in a supremely yuppified New York City. After the Great Revolution, the country has been taken over by Triple M, an Orwellian corporate and political octopus that has established the Dictatorship of the Consumer. (Think of Microsoft run amok.) 
 Jack Bell (Bill Sage), the poker-faced Triple M advertising whiz in charge of the Brutal Youth Children's Wear division, has the chilly corporate style down pat: people can have whatever they want as long as they commit themselves ''body and soul'' to the goal of economic supremacy, he explains in the tone of a human resources robot. People who are sexually active and available have been shown to be the biggest spenders; therefore, income generated by the pursuit of happiness (that is, recreational sex with multiple partners and no commitments) is necessary for the revolution's continued growth. 
 In this chilly ''Brave New World'' where everyone belongs to everyone, spontaneous acts of love and charity are regarded as perverse and self-indulgent. Everyone has a bar code tattooed on his wrist, and each person is considered an investment stock with growth potential. 
 A growing underground of counterrevolutionaries (people without credit ratings or bar codes) has begun carrying out terrorist acts against the regime. When arrested, they are exiled to the Moon to work at the concession stands in Triple M theme parks. 
 Jack, sleek, blond and cold, may appear to be a walking advertisement for Triple M, but he isn't what he seems. To say more would be to give away a plot so slender and cliched it's not really worth protecting. We meet his co-worker, Cecile (Sabrina Lloyd), who falls from grace after an aborted tryst with Jack; William (Leo Fitzpatrick), a happy-go-lucky counterrevolutionary; and Abercrombie (D J Mendel), a glaring corporate snake with a distant resemblance to the young Martin Landau.
 Triple M knows that many of the counterrevolutionaries are immigrants from a planet orbiting Star 147X, whose inhabitants share a communal consciousness and have no bodies. On reaching the Earth in their assumed human forms, they enter relationships that make a return to their previous lives unthinkable. Jack discovers a new immigrant, a nameless, blank-faced beauty who calls herself Nobody (Tatiana Abracos) and emerges out of the sea like Botticelli's Venus. The newcomer is so unaccustomed to emotion that when she feels tears streaming down her cheeks she doesn't know what they are. 
 With its gossamer, stop-time cinematography and a story that's little more than a sketch, ''The Girl From Monday'' evokes a mood of tenderness. Beyond that, it is a weightless, sentimental and intellectually lazy effort from an independent filmmaker whose movies seem increasingly insubstantial. 

The Girl From Monday
Opens today in Manhattan.

Written and directed by Hal Hartley; director of photography, Sarah Cawley-Cabiya; edited by Steve Hamilton; music by Mr. Hartley; art director, Inbal Weinberg; produced by Mr. Hartley and Mr. Hamilton; released by Possible Films Collection. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 84 minutes. This film is not rated.

WITH: Bill Sage (Jack Bell), Sabrina Lloyd (Cecile), Tatiana Abracos (The Girl From Monday) and Leo Fitzpatrick (William).

HEADLINE: Star Rising, Mexican Populist Faces New Tests

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 3 

 BODY:
He is mayor of the largest city in the hemisphere, and this country's latest political phenomenon.
 He can summon tens of thousands into the streets at will. In a whirlwind three weeks he staged the biggest protest in Mexico's recent history and turned back a legal challenge from the Mexican president and Congress that threatened to end his political career. 
 Now Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is considered the favorite to be elected president next year.
 ''What we saw last Sunday was proof that this is a new society,'' the mayor said during an interview last week, referring to the protest march, ''that the traditional structures of power are not in control, not even with all their money and media.'' 
 Indeed, while Mr. Lopez Obrador, a 51-year-old widower and father of three sons, has proven that he can motivate this country's vast underclass, what remains unclear is whether he will be able to keep pro-American businesspeople and the fragile middle class on his side. 
 He is better known for picking political fights than building bridges. And his left-leaning, hard-charging political style has many in the ruling elite and analysts abroad worried that Mexico could go the way of Venezuela, which is embroiled in a class war as President Hugo Chavez rides a wave of anti-American sentiment.
 It is a wave that has swept leftist politicians into power across Latin America. And like Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brazil and Tabare Vasquez of Uruguay, Mr. Lopez Obrador personifies the angry disappointment with Washington-backed promarket economic policies that have stabilized the economy for the rich but failed to lift up the poor. His rise to power would move that frustration to the United States' door.
 In the interview, Mayor Lopez Obrador rejected comparisons to leftist movements across the region. He said he considered himself a purely Mexican phenomenon, shaped by a devout Catholic mother, a devastating family tragedy and a poet who wrote about Mexico's beautiful landscapes and introduced him to this country's grimmest struggles.
 At his core, the mayor said, he remains an underdog activist from the tropics, where politics can be a rough-and-tumble affair. But, he said, he has been a player in national politics for nearly a decade, having served as head of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party before becoming mayor in 2000.
 He pointed to his record as mayor of this monster of a city, pulling out financial statements that showed the lowest debt increases in the last 20 years as proof that he is qualified to run the national economy. He pointed to the nearly one million people who marched on this city last month as a sign that a growing number of Mexicans think so too. ''The mentality of the people has changed,'' he said. ''They are willing to stand up for democracy. That's what we were betting on. And we bet right.''
 Indeed, the embattled mayor, known in Mexico -- J.F.K.-like -- as AMLO, defies easy labels. He holds daily news conferences at 6:30 a.m., but brushes off most substantive questions and has blocked enforcement of freedom of information laws. 
 He has been criticized by conservatives for spending lavishly on welfare for the elderly, a shelter for prostitutes too old to work and double-decker freeways to ease traffic. He rattled the left when he blocked laws that would have legalized gay unions, forged agreements with business tycoons to restore this city's historic center and brought former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York to help design zero-tolerance crime policies.
 And in what even his closest aides considered a major blunder that alienated the middle class, he said the organizers of a citizens' march against crime were pawns in a right-wing conspiracy against him.
 Like almost every other political leader in this country, Mr. Lopez Obrador started out in the authoritarian Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which dominated the government for more than seven decades. His supporters point out that he agitated against corruption within that party, then abandoned it to help lead a leftist opposition movement that put Mexico on the road to greater democracy.
 Political analysts said the mayor is an expression of the broad disappointment with President Vicente Fox, who has failed to deliver on his sweeping promises for reform; a nostalgia for the firm hand of the PRI; and a reluctance among people to surrender their dreams of change.
 ''It has been said that Lopez Obrador writes his speeches with his left hand and governs with his right,'' said Hector Zagal, co-author of a biography of the mayor. ''He's a product of the old PRI, with all its flaws and virtues.''
 Manuel Camacho Solis, a federal legislator and the mayor's chief political strategist, said: ''He is comfortable as a social leader, and he does it well, but he has had to work on learning to govern. To be president he needs to win people's respect through dialogue, not in conflict with them.''
 Mayor Lopez Obrador did not disagree. ''There is the impression that I am authoritarian,'' he said. ''But social movements require strong leadership. This fight is very hard. And at times it hardens the heart, but not forever.''
 Clues about the mayor, named for his father, Andres, and his mother, Manuela, are scattered across the southern state of Tabasco. He was born in a tiny town, called Tepetitan, which feels nothing like the city he governs today.
 Children play ball in the middle of cornfields and scruffy fishermen like Felipe Lopez Gonzalez quote scripture from the New Testament as they explain how the average family lives close to this country's richest oil fields on less than $4 a day.
 Poverty seemed a passing matter to the young Mr. Lopez Obrador, something he heard about from the men and women who could not pay their tabs at his family's general store. Then, in 1969, that idyllic life was shattered when one of his younger brothers, Jose Ramon, was killed playing with a pistol when it fired.
 Andres Manuel, 15 at the time, watched it happen. Relatives said he had tried to get his brother to put the gun away. 
 In the interview, the mayor declined to talk about it or the speculation by some here that the trauma of that shooting gave his politics a messianic zeal. ''It affected me and still affects me,'' he said. 
 Perhaps the experience that changed him most came years later in the Indian town of Tucta, which he helped raise from a swamp. He first laid eyes on the village in 1976 in the company of Carlos Pellicer Camara, one of Mexico's most beloved poets.
 It was a place that seemed lost in time. The Chontal Indians, descendants of the Maya, had no electricity or clean water. There were no schools or clinics. People lived in huts made from branches and leaves.
 ''Not only did they have the Chontales stuck out in the margins of society,'' Mr. Lopez Obrador recalled, referring to government authorities, ''they denied that the Chontales existed, even though they are the most intimate reality of Tabasco.''
 The Indians quickly became an intimate reality for Mr. Lopez Obrador. He moved his wife and baby son into a shack in Tucta with dirt floors and a thatched roof, and -- much as he has done in Mexico City -- began a combination of welfare and public works programs to help meet people's basic needs and create jobs.
 ''He could have had a comfortable life with his family, but he brought them here to be with us,'' said Pedro Bernardo, 58, one of the beneficiaries of Mr. Lopez Obrador's work in Tucta. ''There are few people who could endure the blows of this life.''
 There were even tougher blows to come.
 ''My dream was to become the governor of Tabasco,'' Mr. Lopez Obrador said, ''because I wanted to change it.'' It was a dream that would elude him.
 Mr. Lopez Obrador abandoned the PRI and then set out to topple it in 1988 when the party refused to run him for mayor of the municipality of Macuspana.
 Backed by a peasant political base that he commanded like a general, the firebrand politician ran twice for governor on leftist tickets and lost both times. The elections in 1994 were marred by allegations of corruption. And for several months, Mr. Lopez Obrador and his civilian troops protested every way they could to make the state ungovernable.
 Two years later he was at it again, leading thousands of supporters against more than 50 oil wells across the state to protest spills by the government-owned oil company that had contaminated rivers and farmland.
 The protests caused the company to lose some $8.5 million in revenues in the first 12 days. Dozens of people were hurt and arrested as the police tried to clear a way to the wells.
 In the interview last week, Mr. Lopez Obrador took delight in his old war stories. The principles of those battles still guide him, he said, but his radical days are over.
 ''I'm a centrist now,'' he said, with a wry smile.
 ''When we started, the PRI dominated completely,'' he said. ''Not even the leaves of the trees moved unless the PRI said so.
 ''A lot of time had to pass before people began to live their freedom. It was up to us to teach them not to be afraid.
 ''They are not afraid anymore.''

HEADLINE: City Rent Board Again Opts for Ambiguity

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Saying that it needed more time to study housing data, the New York City Rent Guidelines Board decided last night, for the second year in a row, not to recommend a specific set of rent increases for the city's one million rent-stabilized apartments.
 Instead, the board recommended increases of 2 percent to 4.5 percent for one-year lease renewals and 4 percent to 7 percent for two-year renewals. 
 The nine-member board will vote on specific increases on June 21, after two public hearings. Last night's vote repeated a tactic that the board used last year when its initial vote was also for increases within a certain range. 
 And while the board chairman, Marvin Markus, told an angry audience at Cooper Union in the East Village that recommendation of an increase range was preferable to a set figure because ''it's early in the process,'' landlord and tenant advocates in the crowd dismissed the vote as a sign of indecision and election-year politics.
 ''If they can't do their jobs, they should resign,'' said Michael McKee, associate director of Tenants and Neighbors, a statewide advocacy group. 
 Every spring, in a rowdy rite of dollars-and-cents drama and political theater, the board, consisting of two landlord representatives, two tenant representatives and five others who are appointed by the mayor, determines how much to raise rents. And without fail, tenants say they are paying too much money, and landlords say that they are not making enough.
 This year, the stakes are arguably higher, because Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is running for a second term, is pointing to his housing proposals as an example of how he has tried to make New York more affordable to the poor and working class. Yet tenants, while supportive of some of Mr. Bloomberg's proposals, have criticized the board for raising rents up to 6.5 percent last year and 7.5 percent in 2003, which was the biggest increase since 1989.
 Last Sunday, they went so far as to demonstrate near the mayor's town house on the Upper East Side.
 The audience for last night's vote comprised mostly tenants, and it conveyed that same sense of frustration and urgency. They repeatedly interrupted the meeting, yelling at board members: ''No rent hikes,'' ''You're parasites,'' and ''Roll back the rents.''
 At the end of the nearly two-hour meeting, the board voted 5 to 4 to recommend that this year's increases fall within the respective ranges. It recommended the same ranges for lofts; for residential hotels, it suggested an increase of 2 percent or less for one-year lease renewals, the only kind offered.
 The final increases approved by the board on June 21 will apply to leases that are renewed between Oct. 1, 2005, and Sept. 30, 2006. 
 Before that vote, the board will hold two public hearings, on June 14 at the New York City College of Technology in Brooklyn, and on June 16 at Cooper Union.
 Of the city's three million dwelling units, about two million are occupied by renters, significantly higher than the national occupancy figure, which is one-third renters. Of the city's two million rental apartments, about one million are stabilized and subject to the adjustments made by the board.
 In the 1990's, the board generally limited rent increases to a couple of percentage points each year, in keeping with low inflation.
 Landlords' incomes have declined in the last two years, with a drop of 4.5 percent for 2003, the most recent year for which figures are available. There was a 0.1 percent decline in 2002, which followed a 5.9 percent increase in 2001. 
 But the current decline has been somewhat offset by a slower rise in landlords' expenses for everything from utilities to insurance, according to studies by the board. In the year ending April 1, 2005, those expenses climbed by 5.8 percent -- down from 6.9 percent the previous year, and 16.9 percent a year earlier, according to the studies.

HEADLINE: Shares Finish Flat After Fed Makes Expected Rate Move

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks stumbled to a mixed but basically flat finish yesterday as the Federal Reserve kept to its policy of gradual interest rate increases.
 The Fed's Open Market Committee announced a widely expected quarter-percentage-point increase in the nation's benchmark lending rate, to 3 percent, and said future increases would remain ''measured,'' a phrase intended to ease investors' worries about aggressive increases.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.25, or 0.1 percent, to 10,256.95. The Dow was down 46 points five minutes before the close, but surged into positive territory after the Fed amended its policy statement to add wording about inflation being ''well contained,'' which had inadvertently been omitted. 
 Broader stock indicators finished narrowly mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 0.99, or 0.1 percent, to 1,161.17. The Nasdaq composite index gained 4.42 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,933.07.
 Falling crude oil prices gave some support to stocks, with a barrel of light crude settling at $49.50, down $1.42, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The dollar was mixed against other currencies in European trading, and gold prices fell.
 Wall Street again received mixed messages on the economy, with American factories showing a 0.1 percent increase in orders last month, better than the large drop economists had forecast. However, the vast majority of orders were for consumable goods. Orders for big-ticket items fell sharply -- a sign that consumers are not making the big purchases that drive growth.
 While stocks have recovered modestly from a difficult April, Wall Street hoped that a strong, positive statement from the Fed would help stocks move higher. 
 ''Right now, the market has stabilized,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany. ''It's clear the economy is slowing, but investors want to know how much and how far.''
 The Fed has steadily issued quarter-percentage-point rate increases since June, when the benchmark rate stood at just 1 percent.
 In company news, Tyco International dropped $2.07, to $28.65, after it said second-quarter profit declined 75 percent on a number of one-time charges. While Tyco beat Wall Street's profit expectations by a penny a share, investors were disappointed with a lower-than-expected forecast for future quarters.
 Shares of Boeing and Lockheed Martin rose after they announced a joint venture to produce rockets for the United States military, ending a bitter rivalry and setting the stage for the two companies to drop litigation involving the rocket business. Boeing gained 49 cents, to $59.87. Lockheed added 55 cents, to $62.41.
 Oshkosh Truck, one of the military's top vehicle suppliers in Iraq, tumbled $4.73, to $72.02, despite reporting earnings that exceeded its best estimates for the second quarter and a profit outlook that surpassed analysts' expectations.
 Qwest Communications slipped a penny, to $3.46, after dropping out of a bidding war for MCI with Verizon Communications. Qwest reported earnings of 3 cents a share yesterday; analysts had expected a loss of 11 cents.

HEADLINE: The Statement From the Fed

 BODY:
Following is the text of a revised statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3 percent.
 The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices. 
 Labor market conditions, however, apparently continue to improve gradually. Pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident. Longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.
 The committee perceives that with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.
 Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Richard W. Fisher; Edward M. Gramlich; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern.
 In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.

HEADLINE: 1930's Faces, Haunting A New Debate

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: HYDE PARK, N.Y. 

 BODY:
THE very first entry in the spiral notebook reserved for visitors' comments on the photographic exhibit at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum seems to throw down a challenge.
 ''You should bring President Bush here,'' it reads.
 Of course, you could view the exhibition of Depression-era photographs, many of them already seared into the nation's collective unconscious, in various ways.
 So its pictures of Dust Bowl farmers and unemployed factory workers, of women with tired faces all cracks and crevices, of children as thin and wan as wafers, could be taken as pictures from a vanished America. These days their subjects' grandchildren are probably Sun Belt Republicans whose doctors tell them that they need to cut back on the fried chicken and coconut pie at those all-you-can-eat buffets. 
 Or, as one guesses the woman who scrawled the message in the book had in mind, it could be taken as a cautionary message from the not-so-distant past: This is what we were and it was government programs that saved the haunted-looking people in the pictures -- and us as well.
 There's more at the Roosevelt library and museum, the nation's first presidential library and the only one where a president actually worked, than the famous photographs by Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans and other Depression-era photographers who produced 80,000 pictures for the Farm Security Administration. The site includes the Springwood estate, where Roosevelt was born and which he called his home. 
 But these days, with the New Deal legacy and particularly with the future of Social Security very much in the news and the air, there's a palpable mix of something from the past and something remarkably contemporary in Hyde Park, about two hours north of Manhattan.
 So, for the sixth graders from Circleville Middle School in Orange County, who navigated the place on Tuesday, it all seemed a period piece -- the creaky old big band music and scratchy voice doing fireside chats over radios as big as refrigerators, the ancient campaign buttons, the letter from a woman thanking Eleanor Roosevelt for her monthly Social Security check of $15.93.
 Kassie Wall, Shannon Davis and Stephanie Keddrell walked through the exhibit, ''This Great Nation Will Endure: Photographs of the Great Depression,'' a little spooked by the power of the images. ''It's sad to look at,'' Stephanie said. ''It's like another country.'' Indeed, it was a place so strange and distant you could actually run and win as a Democrat from New York and a mine and mill workers' union could put out a notice reading: ''Miners! Your President wants you to join your local union now.''
 But for the adults -- most of them retired, most of them receiving Social Security, many of them people who remembered Roosevelt as president -- the library and museum, which draws about 100,000 visitors a year, was as much about the present as the past, like a chapel for an orthodox faith now under siege.
 SO asked about Mr. Bush's proposal to allow private investment accounts as a part of Social Security, Joe Ferraro, a retiree from Waldwick, N.J., said: ''I think it stinks. I once took money I have in a retirement account and lost $60,000 in five months. No one can afford that, but it didn't kill me. I'm O.K. But you take a pick and shovel guy, he loses that, what's he going to do? Where's he going to go? He loses that money, it's gone.''
 Gary Aho, a retired University of Massachusetts professor, and his wife Pat, were equally vehement.
 ''Shrub is trying to undo what Roosevelt built, and I don't like it,'' Mr. Aho said. 
 Even Isabel Chappuis, visiting from Winterthur, Switzerland, was with the program.
 ''Roosevelt, I think was very simpatic,'' she said.
 Bush? ''That I don't know.''
 David Woolner, executive director of the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, which is separate from the library, and a history professor at nearby Marist College, said Roosevelt was at heart a pragmatic politician who was open to rethinking his programs. But, he said, he believes there is still deep and fundamental support for the programs Roosevelt put in place. 
 ''I don't think there's anything wrong with remodeling the house,'' he said. ''But if you want to tear the house down and put up something else in its place, I think that's where Roosevelt would draw the line. I think Roosevelt would have real problems with trying to privatize it.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''Tourists at Market to Look Crowd Those Who Cook'' (April 27), about the trials of the San Francisco farmers market:
 In the small Midwestern city where I live, a number of farmers' markets operate every week during the growing season. Tens of thousands flock to the primary market every Saturday, and no one complains if a few tourists or local gawkers just out for a stroll scrutinize the stalls of eggplant and hand-harvested hickory nuts and organic buffalo steaks without purchasing anything. It's a marketplace of goods, and if vendors can't find sufficient buyers for their offerings, they move on.
 My guess is that if vendors at San Francisco's Ferry Plaza market feel that they can't connect with customers in such an attractive, photogenic setting, they'll move on, too. In any case, worrying about whether the crowded scene on Ferry Plaza is sufficiently rarefied for serious food insiders and in-the-know locals won't sell more goods, or do much to advance the notion that organic food is good for all of us.

HEADLINE: After Looking Elsewhere, Microsoft Will Expand at Home

BYLINE: By HARRIET KING

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash. 

 BODY:
After years of indecision on whether to build a satellite campus 15 miles away in Seattle or in nearby Issaquah, the Microsoft Corporation has pledged to keep its growing empire in this community, where it has flourished since 1985. Its already sprawling 80-building headquarters complex is expected to expand by 2.2 million square feet.
 This summer, the company will start design work on two office buildings that will have a total of more than 500,000 square feet when software workers move in by the fall of 2007. These are the first of 13 similar buildings and 8 garages that Microsoft plans to build within 10 to 20 years. The company also plans to demolish and rebuild 600,000 square feet of older buildings that lack the power and cooling capacity needed for modern computer equipment.
 Employees will remain in close proximity to collaborate on projects, like developing the next generation of the Windows operating system under the code name Longhorn. 
 The campus already has the population and many of the amenities of a small city. The aroma of food at lunchtime wafts across Microsoft's woodsy grounds from eight cafeterias that serve meals for 28,000 employees. On sunny days, it is common to see casually dressed employees with wireless notebook computers holding meetings over lunch at tables tucked away in gardens and plazas between the buildings. Microsoft's 42-bus shuttle fleet logs 500,000 passenger trips yearly between buildings or the ball field, where games are frequently played during lunchtime.
 ''We like Redmond because we can keep people together, and they can walk to each other's offices or take a short shuttle,'' said Bradford Smith, the company's senior vice president and general counsel. ''Our development plan ensures that the world's center for developing software remains in Redmond.'' 
 The new five-story buildings will match the 80 low-rise office structures scattered across the 400-acre campus abutting 148th Avenue, which forms the boundary between Redmond and Bellevue. The office of Bill Gates looks out on a sweeping courtyard from a fifth-floor suite in the midst of the complex. 
 With $36.8 billion in sales and a work force second only to Boeing's 52,800 workers in the Puget Sound area, Microsoft is an economic mainstay for Washington. The company plans to hire 12,000 specialists in the next 10 years or so, bringing its local work force to 40,000. 
 ''Microsoft's decision to remain in Redmond is a very good signal for the city and region,'' said Rob Odle, the city's policy planning manager. ''Boeing moved its headquarters to Chicago, but Microsoft is saying, 'This is where we are going to stay.'''
 Redmond's City Council is reviewing Microsoft's plan, which spells out its development strategy for the first time, and may be ready to give its approval by May 19, Mr. Odle said. ''By filing an agreement now,'' he said, ''Microsoft can have greater predictability on what will occur and resolve issues rather than on a building-by-building basis in the future.'' 
 Mr. Gates and Paul Allen, who both come from Seattle, founded Microsoft in 1975 in Albuquerque, N.M. The company moved to Bellevue, Wash., in 1979 with 30 employees. In 1985, having outgrown leased offices and wanting a corporate campus, the company moved two miles away to Redmond. 
 Settled in the 1870's, Redmond was a logging and farming community on the Seattle metropolitan area's eastern outskirts. It was separated from Seattle by Lake Washington and grew slowly; in 1960, its population was 1,426. Both Redmond and the adjacent Bellevue expanded rapidly after a bridge to Seattle was built across Lake Washington in 1963. Redmond has 46,500 residents today. 
 As Microsoft prospered, it acquired adjacent property. But in the late 1990's, Redmond imposed a development moratorium while planners struggled with growth issues. Microsoft took steps to consider construction of a satellite campus elsewhere. 
 It looked at Seattle, where Vulcan Inc., owned by Mr. Allen, who is no longer active in Microsoft, is redeveloping the aging South Lake Union neighborhood adjacent to downtown. But the company eventually declined against a satellite operation in Seattle.
 ''We'd need a substantial amount of space,'' said Mr. Smith, the Microsoft executive, ''and it would be a dilemma to have offices that far away.'' Driving from the Redmond headquarters to downtown Seattle can typically take a half-hour in smooth traffic, double that in rush hour.
 Instead, in October 2001, Microsoft announced a plan to build a $600 million 2.95-million-square-feet satellite campus for 12,000 employees in Issaquah, a half-hour drive to the south. It bought 37.5 acres of the 150 acres on which it held purchase options and said it expected to start site work in summer 2002. 
 As the economy slowed, however, Microsoft backed off its fast track in Issaquah. Last October, it declined to pick up its option to buy the remaining Issaquah acreage. A developer, Port Blakely Communities, is in discussions to sell 15 acres of the unclaimed Issaquah property to a hospital and will develop a 400,000-square-foot mall with retailing, cinemas and a hotel on the remaining land, said Judd Kirk, Port Blakely's president. 
 On its own Issaquah acreage, Microsoft could still build 1.2 million square feet and employ 5,000 people there. ''We have no plans to sell Issaquah land,'' Mr. Smith said. ''If we grow quickly, it remains a viable alternative.''
 Microsoft's decision to expand in Redmond was influenced by the fact that the city had ended its development moratorium, allowing the company to take a new look at enlarging its headquarters campus. 
 ''During the last year and a half, we saw our growth rate pick up, and started a land assembly, buying ahead of our need,'' said Chris Owens, Microsoft's general manager of worldwide real estate and facilities. The company bought six adjacent parcels, each with buildings of about 20,000 square feet on one or two acres. Most of the parcels came with rights for further development. 
 Last July, Microsoft paid $38 million for a 20-acre parcel owned by the clothing retailer Eddie Bauer. The property, which includes a 230,000-square-foot headquarters building, is surrounded by Microsoft's holdings. The Eddie Bauer property has 100,000 square feet of development rights. 
 To combat traffic gridlock, Redmond puts limits on the amount of development that can occur. Nintendo of America, which is also based in Redmond, moved quickly to submit a development agreement with the city this spring to build 550,000 square feet on 27 acres adjacent to Microsoft on the north.
 ''We wanted to secure plans for the future,'' said Bruce Meyer, vice president for real estate and facilities at Nintendo. ''Otherwise, Microsoft might gobble up whatever development is possible.'' Nintendo, which makes video games, including Mario, Donkey Kong and Pokemon, occupies 400,000 square feet built since 1982, but has no immediate plans for new construction.
 Property of another adjacent neighbor, the Safeco Corporation, an insurance company, may also go on the market soon. Since 1981, Safeco has owned a Redmond satellite center with 850,000 square feet in six office, data-processing and warehouse buildings covering 46.1 acres. Its property is expandable by 175,000 square feet.
 On April 6, Safeco said it planned to consolidate offices in Seattle. The company said it would add 260,000 square feet to its current 567,000-square-foot headquarters, which has anchored the University District of Seattle for 69 years. The company will not put its Redmond property on the market until Seattle approves permits for the construction, including an exemption on building height.
 ''Safeco's land is in the path of Microsoft's progress,'' said Tom Bohman, director of the Bellevue office of Cushman Wakefield. ''Picking up 850,000 square feet down the street is logical.'' He estimated the Safeco property to be worth $230 million or more if offices, a data processing center and warehouses were sold. Mr. Owens, the Microsoft real estate executive, said that if the property were to be put up for sale, ''we'd take a look at it.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Support, Bush Offers Assurances on Retirement Cuts

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: CANTON, Miss., May 3 

 BODY:
President Bush took his Social Security campaign back on the road on Tuesday, seeking to reassure workers here about his new call to cut promised retirement benefits for most Americans as part of an effort to ensure the system's long-term solvency. 
 But the White House signaled that Mr. Bush would be flexible if Congress had other ideas about how to close the projected long-term gap in Social Security's finances, reflecting the reluctance of many members of his own party on Capitol Hill to embrace any plan that could be portrayed as harming the middle class. 
 In an indication of how deep that reluctance runs, Mississippi's two Republican senators both suggested after attending Mr. Bush's rally here that they were not yet prepared to embrace the details of the president's approach. Senator Trent Lott said he was ''not overjoyed'' by the way the administration's approach would work, and Senator Thad Cochran said he wanted to see Congress and the administration come together to work out a plan. 
 Speaking to several thousand employees at a Nissan automobile factory, Mr. Bush cast the plan in positive terms, saying his proposal would result in a faster rate of rise in benefits for lower-income workers than those for middle- and upper-income people.
 But he did not directly discuss the primary implication of his approach: a reduction in benefits from the level promised to future retirees by the current system for all but people in the lowest 30 percent of the income spectrum. 
 ''You know, you hear all this talk about benefit cuts,'' Mr. Bush said, addressing the issue somewhat more directly than he had so far. ''We're talking about making sure benefits grow at the rate of inflation -- that's what we're talking about. You've been promised something. It ought to grow at the rate of inflation.''
 The approach ''makes sense to me,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I hope it makes sense to the United States Congress.''
 Under current law, initial benefits for retirees are set by a formula based on the growth in wages throughout the economy. Mr. Bush's plan would leave that formula intact for low-income workers. But for upper-income workers, the formula would shift to one based on prices, which tend to grow more slowly than wages. For middle-income workers, the formula would blend inflation and wage growth in setting benefits.
 Over the long run, the effects, in terms of savings to the retirement system and reduced income to many retirees, would be substantial. For average-wage earners -- making around $36,500 this year -- the benefit cut would be 16 percent if they reach retirement age in 2045 and 28 percent if they retire in 2075, under the approach favored by Mr. Bush. For upper-income people -- making $90,000 or above this year -- the benefit cut for those retiring in 2045 would be 29 percent, and for those retiring in 2075 it would be 49 percent. Low-income workers would get the entire benefit now promised to them when they retire.
 His aides say the benefit cuts proposed by Mr. Bush have to be judged against what will happen if nothing is done to shore up the system as the baby boom generation ages and life expectancy increases. Social Security's trustees estimate that if no action is taken, the system can pay full benefits until 2041, and after that will take in only enough through payroll taxes to cover about 73 percent of promised benefits.
 But the White House opened the door on Tuesday to revisiting the details of the approach in negotiations with Congress.
 ''He has put out his proposal on a way to protect the lowest-income workers, but that in the context of the legislative process, he'll welcome other ideas for solutions, and would welcome other ideas to perfect or to make the best system,'' Trent Duffy, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, told reporters aboard Air Force One on the way here.
 Early readings of public opinion suggest that Mr. Bush is still struggling to convince the nation that he has the right prescription for Social Security.
 A new CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll conducted in the three days after Mr. Bush introduced the benefit cut ideas on prime-time television Thursday night found 38 percent approval for the proposal, with 54 percent opposed. Mr. Bush's approval rating for his handling of Social Security generally remained stuck at 35 percent, where it has been for the last two months, down from 43 percent just after his State of the Union address in February.

HEADLINE: Iran to Resume Nuclear Plans, Official States

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE and DAVID E. SANGER; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran for this article.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 3 

 BODY:
Iran declared Tuesday that it would soon resume some of the nuclear activities it had suspended during negotiations with Europe, and it used a conference here to accuse the United States and other nations of using the fear of nuclear weapons proliferation to deny peaceful nuclear technology to developing nations.
 The Iranian announcement, on the second day of the United Nations conference reviewing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, was made by the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Hamid-Reza Asefi. 
 He stopped short of saying exactly what kind of work Iran would resume in breaking what it has termed a voluntary moratorium while it negotiated with the European Union. But he said he did not expect Iran would begin ''the actual enrichment'' of uranium, which can lead to production of bomb fuel. 
 European officials and the Bush administration have both said any breach of the moratorium would prompt a sharp response. 
 In Washington, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Tuesday at a brief news conference, ''There needs to be a very clear commitment from the Iranians to live up to their international obligations not to seek a nuclear weapon under the cover of civilian nuclear power.'' 
 ''We are all very clear that the international community has, as a step that it could take, referral to the Security Council,'' she added, a debate that could include the imposition of economic sanctions. 
 In New York for the opening of the conference, Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, urged the Bush administration and the Europeans to give Iran a far better sense of what kind of economic inducement they would be willing to offer in return for a much longer suspension of nuclear activity.
 ''I think in diplomacy if you offer more, you get more,'' he said during a visit to the editorial board of The New York Times. ''Iran is no exception. If you offer trade, technology and security, you ought to be able to get good assurances on the nuclear issue.''
 Dr. ElBaradei urged the United States, which has declined to negotiate with Iran, to act much more forcefully. ''I firmly believe that any grand bargain will have to involve the United States,'' he said, ''because on the security side, only the U.S. can do the heavy lifting.''
 Iran did not repeat its threat during its formal presentation in the hall of the General Assembly, where the monthlong meeting is taking place. But the foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, told the conference that the United States and Europe were trying to keep an exclusive hold on technological advancement, and he said Iran was determined to defy that effort. 
 ''It is unacceptable that some tend to limit the access to peaceful nuclear technology to an exclusive club of technologically advanced states under the pretext of nonproliferation,'' he said. 
 Iran, he added, will pursue ''all legal areas of nuclear technology, including enrichment, exclusively for peaceful purposes.'' 
 He said the terms of the treaty permitted it to do so; the United States argues that because Iran hid much of its nuclear activity for 18 years, it could not be trusted with the technology.
 In October in Paris, Iran agreed with France, Britain and Germany to freeze all enrichment of uranium and ''related activities'' while negotiations went forward. But Iran has complained that those talks have not included any substantive incentives, and its announcement on Tuesday seemed part of a strategy to press Europe and, by extension, the Bush administration. 
 Recently, Iran demanded that it be allowed to build and operate 3,000 centrifuges, which can produce low-enriched uranium to make fuel for nuclear power stations, or, unchecked, highly enriched uranium for bomb fuel. 
 At the conference on Monday, it became clear how far apart Iran and the United States are on the issue. Addressing the conference, Stephen G. Rademaker, an assistant secretary of state, said any solution to the impasse ''must include permanent cessation of Iran's enrichment and reprocessing efforts, as well as dismantlement of equipment facilities related to such activity.''
 Mr. Rademaker's statement was intended to focus the conference on loopholes in the 35-year-old treaty, which he accused both Iran and North Korea of exploiting. Others among the more than 180 nations here want to direct attention at compelling declared nuclear states, especially the United States, to meet their own treaty obligations to move toward disarmament. The Iranians revived that argument on Tuesday.
 ''The continued existence of thousands of nuclear warheads in the nuclear weapon states' stockpile, which can destroy the entire globe many times over, are the major sources of threat to peace and security,'' said Mr. Kharrazi, the foreign minister. 
 The United States and its allies are confronting nuclear developments on opposite sides of the world. 
 Iran's program has the longer lead time; the United States says that country is not likely to have a weapon for five to seven more years, according to testimony that intelligence officials gave to Congress earlier this year. But North Korea is widely thought to possess nuclear material already for six to eight weapons, much of it manufactured after the country pulled out of the treaty in 2003 and evicted international inspectors. 
 Now American, Japanese and South Korean officials say North Korea may be preparing for an underground nuclear test, which would end debate about whether the research it conducted while a treaty member has yielded nuclear warheads. 
 Mr. Kharrazi insisted that Iran remained ''eager'' to provide European negotiators with guarantees of its peaceful intent, but he harshly criticized the demands being made on his country. 
 ''This attitude is in clear violation of the letter and spirit of the treaty and destroys the fundamental balance which exists between the rights and obligations in the treaty,'' he declared. He said the treaty itself affirmed that nothing in the measure should affect the ''inalienable right'' of all to produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
 Mr. Kharrazi said countries that had not signed the treaty had exploited their freedom from its restrictions to build up nuclear stockpiles that posed more serious threats to world peace. 
 His reference was to India, Pakistan and Israel, though Israel was the only one he mentioned by name, saying it had continually rejected bids to join the treaty and open itself up to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

HEADLINE: Prada Begins Talks to Sell Unprofitable Helmut Lang Brand

BYLINE: By ERIC SYLVERS

DATELINE: MILAN, May 3 

 BODY:
Prada, which turned a black nylon backpack into a must-have fashion accessory, said Tuesday that it had entered talks to sell its unprofitable Helmut Lang brand.
 The proceeds of the sale would help shore up Prada's balance sheet at a time when the luxury goods industry is confronting a slowing world economy and a flood of inexpensive Chinese products. 
 Prada bought 51 percent of Helmut Lang in 1999 and the rest last year, part of a buying spree begun by the chief executive, Patrizio Bertelli, who also picked up the Jil Sander fashion house. Mr. Bertelli is married to Miuccia Prada, the company's designer and granddaughter of its founder. 
 Mr. Bertelli succeeded in turning Prada, once a small Milan leather-goods shop, into a multibrand luxury goods company. But the Helmut Lang and Jil Sander brands have stumbled under Prada's ownership. 
 Prada acquired Helmut Lang, which has flagship stores in New York, Paris, Vienna and Milan and also sells its products in high-end department stores, from its Austrian-born designer and namesake, who remained with the company until January. Prada gave no reason for Mr. Lang's departure at the time, though industry analysts said he might have clashed with Mr. Bertelli. Jil Sander, the designer, left the company late last year.
 A Prada spokesman, Jason Jacobs, would not say what companies were in talks for Helmut Lang or what the brand might be worth.
 After the spate of acquisitions that included Helmut Lang, Mr. Bertelli planned an initial share sale for Sept. 18, 2001, to finance further expansion.
 The terrorist attacks in the United States forced a postponement; Mr. Bertelli pushed back the public offering again on several other occasions because of unfavorable market conditions. He said recently that the offering would not be held this year.
 After the first postponement, Prada opted for a 700 million euro ($900 million) bond sale, which came to market in December 2001. The bonds come due next month, probably before the Helmut Lang brand is sold.
 The company had sales of 1.36 billion euros in 2003. Profit that year rose 33 percent, to 36 million euros. Financial results for 2004 have yet to be released. Prada and its competitors are battling both low-cost Chinese goods and low-quality knockoffs of their products. While some European companies have responded by moving production to China and other low-wage countries, Prada still produces all its shoes, belts, handbags, clothing and other items in Italy.

HEADLINE: Citigroup Units Kept Making Loans That Violated Policy

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Citigroup lenders made hundreds of high-cost home loans to customers with poor credit histories in 2004, even though the company had adopted a policy a year earlier to no longer issue such loans, the bank acknowledged yesterday.
 The number of those loans was a small fraction of those originated by its consumer finance subsidiary, CitiFinancial, and the lending was not illegal. Still, the disclosure highlights the persistence of problems at the unit even after the bank pledged to change its lending practices.
 The company's disclosure also comes at a time when the office of Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, has been seeking information about high-cost loans made by eight big lenders, including Citigroup. The inquiry is examining whether the lenders made high-cost loans to minority and other vulnerable consumers who would otherwise qualify for less-expensive credit. 
 An analysis of federal mortgage data by Inner City Press-Fair Finance Watch, an advocacy group for low-income borrowers based in the Bronx, found that last year CitiFinancial affiliates issued 837 real estate loans with extraordinarily high borrowing fees. The fees were higher than 8 percent of the value of the loan, or the interest rates ranged as high as 12 percent or more. High-cost loans like those are regulated under a federal law called the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, or Hoepa, that requires lenders to provide borrowers with special disclosures and protections. Many consumer advocates argue that such high-priced credit is abusive.
 Citigroup said that it banned all of its real estate lenders from originating loans that fall under regulations of the act by July 2004; CitiFinancial enacted a similar policy in January 2003. The advocacy group's analysis found that Associates Financial Services of Puerto Rico accounted for 611 of the high-cost loans; Associates was formerly part of a subprime lender with a long history of regulatory run-ins that was purchased by Citigroup. 
 At least two other affiliates of CitiFinancial -- CitiFinancial of Puerto Rico and Washington Mutual Financial -- made 197 additional loans early last year. And Citicorp Trust Bank, a unit of Citigroup, made a 29 loans last year that are regulated by the act.
 A Citigroup spokesman confirmed yesterday that the loans were made, but in a statement said the affiliates in question had "migrated to this policy'' over time. ''We have integrated a number of different businesses,'' the spokesman said. ''We've worked to conform their practices; today, none of these channels originate Hoepa loans.''
 Citigroup apparently imposed no set timetable for putting the policy into effect. In some cases, it took months after a division was acquired; in other cases, years. Associates Financial, for example, was acquired by Citigroup in November 2000. But it did not adopt the policy against originating the loans until it was reorganized under the CitiFinancial umbrella in July 2004 and became governed by its rules. 
 Washington Mutual and Easy Money of Puerto Rico, which Citigroup said previously made the loans, were acquired by last year and adopted the new policy in a matter of months. CitiFinancial of Puerto Rico adopted the policy in July 2004; Citicorp Trust Bank in April 2004.
 Mathew Lee, the executive director of Inner City Press who is an outspoken critic of Citigroup's lending practices, was skeptical of the bank's response. "It's not rocket science,'' he said. ''If you tell your people and computer systems not to make Hoepa loans, you just don't do it."
 It is not the first time that Citigroup has found itself at the center of controversy over its lending practices. In 2002, Citigroup agreed to pay $215 million to about two million customers to resolve Federal Trade Commission charges that Associates First Capital deceived borrowers into accepting overpriced mortgages and credit insurance from 1995 to 2000. Citigroup acquired the parent company in 2000, and that division, one of the country's biggest consumer finance companies, drew a firestorm of criticism from consumer advocates and regulators for its practices.
 Citigroup's move to ban the loans came after its regulator, the Federal Reserve Board, began investigating new allegations of abusive lending at CitiFinancial from 2000 to 2002. Upon learning those concerns, CitiFinancial made restitution available to the affected borrowers and agreed to pay a $70 million fine last May. 
 In a letter to CitiFinancial employees at the time, Harry D. Goff, it's chief executive, said the division had ''ceased making Hoepa loans altogether in January 2003.'' And on a company Web site highlighting its commitments to customers, CitiFinancial lists the practice as one of five things it does not do.

HEADLINE: Politics by Another Means

BYLINE: By David Lodge. 
David Lodge is the author, most recently, of the novel ''Author, Author.''

DATELINE: Birmingham, England 

 BODY:
I was in America at the time of the presidential election last November, on a short book tour. It wasn't the ideal time to promote a novel about Henry James, but I couldn't resist the opportunity to observe at first hand the climax of the campaign, which had been reported with intense interest in the British news media. 
 I was in Cambridge, Mass., on election night, and went to give a reading at Harvard Book Store the next evening. My escort warned me that there might not be anybody there. She, like almost everyone I knew or met on John Kerry's home turf, was devastated by the result, and was seriously thinking of emigrating. The bookstore, happily, was full, but I have never seen such a collection of glum faces. I read to them about Henry James's feelings of despair after he was booed on stage at the first night of his play ''Guy Domville.'' It seemed to strike a chord. 
 It's hard to imagine two elections more different in character than that one and tomorrow's British general election. Americans faced a choice between two starkly opposed sets of fundamental values and priorities, and the narrow margin of George W. Bush's victory revealed a nation deeply divided. The British picture is much more confused and confusing, partly because there are three major parties instead of two, and partly because these parties have shifted their ideological positions in recent times. 
 The Labor Party under Tony Blair has occupied much of the center-right territory formerly held by the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats, who used to offer a wishy-washy compromise between those two, have moved to the left of Labor. So, as the columnist Simon Jenkins put it in The Times of London the other day, if you want a Conservative government vote Labor, if you want a Labor government vote Liberal Democrat, and if you want a Liberal government vote Conservative. Got that? 
 Most polls have predicted that Labor will be returned with a comfortable majority, but polls that count only respondents who say they are certain to vote make the gap much narrower. There is widespread dissatisfaction, mainly related to the war in Iraq, among people who supported Labor in the last two elections, but nobody really knows what proportion of them will reluctantly vote Labor, or register a protest vote for one of the other parties, or abstain. 
 A curious game of bluff and double bluff is being played. Many disaffected Labor supporters would like to see Prime Minister Tony Blair punished by having his parliamentary majority drastically reduced, but would be appalled if a Conservative government were actually elected. The Labor Party is deliberately exaggerating that risk in its campaigning to scare the hesitant into voting Labor. The Conservatives are urging dissatisfied voters to ''send Tony Blair a message'' rather than to vote for their own leader, Michael Howard. And the Liberal Democrats are saying, in effect, Labor is bound to win, but we would provide a more progressive opposition than the Tories. 
 Even in the era of sophisticated polling, the British electorate retains the capacity to surprise. Labor lost to the Conservatives in 1970 in spite of being ahead in the polls to the very end; John Major won comfortably for the Conservatives in 1992 in what was supposed to be a neck-and-neck race; nobody, including Tony Blair, predicted the scale of Labor's landslide victory in 1997.
 The British are by and large very reticent about their political allegiances and this makes electoral prediction difficult. I was astonished when I first went to America, in the mid-1960's, by the way people (these were mostly academic people) discussed politics eagerly and knowledgeably in casual conversation, and made their views very clear. I hardly ever discussed politics with my colleagues at the University of Birmingham, and I had no idea how most of them voted. 
 Many say that is because there are fixed dates for elections in America, so campaigning in effect never stops; whereas under the British system, with the prime minister able to call a general election at any time he likes, the campaign lasts only a few weeks. But I think it goes deeper, into national temperament and cultural conditioning. 
 In polite society, religion and politics were traditionally taboo topics of conversation in England, considered too personal and potentially divisive for open discussion. This code of etiquette lingers throughout the social scale. For instance, a woman named Barbara has cleaned for my family one morning a week for the last 25 years. In the interests of research for this article, I asked her the other day how she was going to vote and she said, with only half-simulated indignation, ''I'm not going to tell you!'' -- as if I had enquired about the most intimate details of her married life. She then confided that she and her husband never told each other how they voted. Now that's what I call a secret ballot.
 The only friends with whom I have regular and animated political conversations are an American-Canadian couple who are near neighbors. They have settled here and are registered voters. On the American political spectrum they would be firm Democrats. They are only too glad to tell me how they are going to vote tomorrow: Liberal Democrat, to express their disillusionment with, and indeed outrage at, Tony Blair's government. 
 There is no chance that their candidate will be elected, but they hope that if enough people in the country make the same choice we will end up with a Labor government that has a much reduced majority and might even have to make a deal with the Liberal Democrats. If Britain had proportional representation that is what probably would happen, but like the United States, we have a first-past-the-post system, which makes the results in marginal constituencies crucial. 
 I live in the constituency of Edgbaston, in Birmingham, which happens to be an interesting one, as well as a nice place to live. It's that rare thing, a green and leafy inner-city suburb only 5 or 10 minutes' drive from downtown. The entrepreneurs of the industrial revolution built their villas here, to windward of their factory chimneys, and today's affluent middle class have inherited these amenities, together with the University of Birmingham. 
 The constituency also encompasses significant numbers of voters in the lower income groups, but it was always a safe Tory seat until 1997, when it went to Labor on a huge swing of 11 percent. It was one of the first results to be announced on election night -- it always is -- and was the first indication of the scale of the Labor landslide. 
 The successful candidate was Gisela Stuart, one of many youngish women in the new Parliament sometimes referred to in the news media as Blair's Babes. In 2001, by which time the nation's honeymoon with New Labor was well over, there was a small swing in favor of the Tories, but Ms. Stuart held on to the seat.
 IT would need a swing of about 6 percent for the Tories to unseat her tomorrow, so it is not quite a ''marginal,'' but the local Labor Party is running scared. Gisela Stuart went out of her way to support the government's policy on Iraq, and so has not endeared herself to progressive middle-class voters like my American-Canadian friends. But nobody knows how many of them there are, or how determined they are to hurt Labor -- and that is true of the country at large. 
 The election has for many people narrowed down to a simple choice -- between rewarding a government that has managed the economy successfully and achieved a modest redistribution of income and improvement in health and education, or punishing them for leading the country into a war of dubious legality and still dauntingly uncertain consequences. I opposed the war, but I did not find it an easy or obvious judgment to make, and I would have found it even more difficult in Tony Blair's shoes, so I did not condemn him out of hand. I assumed he was a more reluctant participant in the war than recent evidence has shown him to be, and although I do not think he lied about the case for war, he was certainly economical with the truth in advocating it.
 Even if Labor wins, he will never recover the broad-based respect and admiration he enjoyed in his first term, and many members of his own party hope that he will step down sooner rather than later as leader in favor of the chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown. When you consider Mr. Blair's success in reshaping the Labor Party so that it occupied the vital middle ground of British politics and routed a Tory party that had been in power for nearly two decades, this fall from grace seems to me punishment enough for his failings. 
 I am basically a supporter of New Labor's domestic policies and that's why I will cast my vote for the party. My hunch is that there are enough people who feel the same way to return a Labor government with a workable majority. Look out for that early result from Edgbaston -- it will indicate whether I was right.

HEADLINE: Ex-Diplomat Chosen to Fill Treasury Post

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3 

 BODY:
President Bush said on Tuesday that he would nominate Robert M. Kimmitt, a veteran diplomat under President Ronald Reagan and the first President George Bush, to become deputy secretary of the Treasury.
 Mr. Kimmitt, a protege of James A. Baker III when Mr. Baker was secretary of the Treasury and later secretary of state, would become second in command to Treasury Secretary John W. Snow. 
 Mr. Kimmitt's nomination could signal an important transition at the Treasury Department, which has been struggling to replace a long list of top officials who have left since the elections in November.
 An international lawyer and a former ambassador to Germany, Mr. Kimmitt, 57, is a respected diplomat who helped steer diplomatic efforts during the Persian Gulf war. 
 He was recently executive vice president of global and strategic policy at Time Warner. He left that post this year to join the law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr in Washington.
 With experience in a wide array of top posts -- including the National Security Council under President Reagan and senior positions in the Treasury and State Departments -- Mr. Kimmitt has longstanding relationships with scores of people in and around the Bush White House.
 He worked closely with Mr. Baker, first as general counsel to the Treasury Department in the mid-1980's and then as under secretary of state for political affairs from 1989-91. He became the American ambassador to Germany in 1991, shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Communism in Central Europe.
 Administration officials offered little information about what Mr. Kimmitt's responsibilities would be, and the job can vary greatly. Under President Bush, the Treasury Department has occupied a much less central role in formulating economic policy. Mr. Snow has worked more as a salesman for Mr. Bush's tax and Social Security initiatives. The second in command at Treasury has stayed largely out of sight.
 But that could change, in part because the Treasury Department has ceded many of its activities to the new Department of Homeland Security. The deputy Treasury secretary has often been responsible for overseeing those operations, but the job could be redefined in a variety of ways.
 Mr. Kimmitt will succeed Samuel W. Bodman, who served as deputy secretary at Treasury until this year, when Mr. Bush named him to head the Energy Department.
 The Bush administration is trying to fill a number of other top positions at the Treasury Department. The most important of those is the assistant secretary in charge of tax policy, a post that has been vacant for months.

HEADLINE: Parrying Its Critics, Wal-Mart Says Its Wages Must Stay Competitive

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: BENTONVILLE, Ark. 

 BODY:
With most of Wal-Mart's workers earning less than $19,000 a year, a number of community groups and lawmakers have recently teamed up with labor unions in mounting an intensive campaign aimed at prodding Wal-Mart into paying its 1.3 million employees higher wages.
 A new group of Wal-Mart critics ran a full-page advertisement on April 20 contending that the company's low pay had forced tens of thousands of its workers to resort to food stamps and Medicaid, costing taxpayers billions of dollars. On April 26, as part of a campaign called ''Love Mom, Not Wal-Mart,'' five members of Congress joined women's advocates and labor leaders to assail the company for not paying its female employees more. 
 And in a book to be published this fall, a group of scholars will argue that Wal-Mart Stores, having replaced General Motors as the nation's largest company, has an obligation to treat its employees better. 
 Among workers at Wal-Mart's 3,700 stores across the United States, the debate is also heating up. 
 Frances Browning, for example, once earned $15 a hour, but now at Wal-Mart, where she is a cashier in Roswell, Ga., she is paid $9.43. She says she is happy to have the job.
 ''I was unemployed for two and a half years before I found my job at Wal-Mart,'' Ms. Browning, 57, said. ''Like everybody else I'd love to make a lot more, but I have to be realistic.''
 But Jason Mrkwa, 27, a high school graduate who stocks frozen food at a Wal-Mart in Independence, Kan., maintains that he is underpaid. ''I make $8.53, even though every one of my evaluations has been above standard,'' Mr. Mrkwa (pronounced MARK-wah) said. ''You can't really live on this.''
 Labor groups and their allies are focusing on Wal-Mart because they say that the campaign will not just benefit its workers but also reduce the existing pressure on unionized competitors to reduce their own wages and benefits.
 ''Wal-Mart should pay people at a minimum enough to go above the U.S. poverty line,'' said Andrew Grossman, executive director of Wal-Mart Watch, the coalition of community, environmental and labor groups running the series of ads criticizing Wal-Mart. ''A company this big and this wealthy has the ability to pay higher wages.''
 H. Lee Scott Jr., Wal-Mart's chief executive, vigorously defends his company, arguing that wages are primarily determined by market forces and that Wal-Mart pays more than most retailers and provides better opportunities for advancement.
 ''If people tell you that Wal-Mart is leading the so-called 'race to the bottom' in terms of job quality or pay, they're not only wrong, they're dead wrong,'' he said to journalists at a company-sponsored conference here in April, the first time Wal-Mart has gone out of its way to invite a number of reporters to its headquarters to hear its views. ''We are instead creating a better workplace with more opportunity and more benefits than have been available in retail.''
 Mr. Scott contends that the critics, including competitors, are defenders of an outdated status quo, intent on upholding a retailing system full of inefficiency and inflated prices.
 He said that if Wal-Mart were as greedy as its detractors say, it would never have attracted 8,000 job applicants for 525 places at a new store in Glendale, Ariz., or 3,000 applicants for 300 jobs in outlying Los Angeles.
 Michael T. Duke, chief of the company's stores division, said, ''Wal-Mart is a very good place to work for our associates, and every day we make it even better.''
 Mr. Mrkwa, the food stocker, does not see it that way. With pay that brings him about $20,000 a year, he said he could not afford a decent apartment or a vehicle better than his 1991 Dodge Dakota. ''I don't see why Wal-Mart can't pay more,'' Mr. Mrkwa said. ''Unfortunately, in the market we live in there just aren't many jobs available.''
 Wal-Mart says its full-time workers average $9.68 an hour, and with many of them working 35 hours a week, their annual pay comes to around $17,600. That is below the $19,157 poverty line for a family of four, but above the $15,219 line for a family of three.
 Wal-Mart critics often note that corporations like Ford and G.M. led a race to the top, providing high wages and generous benefits that other companies emulated. They ask why Wal-Mart, with some $10 billion in profit on about $288 billion in revenue last year, cannot act similarly.
 ''Henry Ford made sure he paid his workers enough so that they could afford to buy his cars,'' said William McDonough, executive vice president of the United Food and Commercial Workers union. ''Wal-Mart is doing the polar opposite of Henry Ford. Wal-Mart brags about how its low prices help poor Americans, but its low wages are helping increase the number of Americans in poverty.''
 Mr. Scott argues that retailers, with narrow profit margins, face a different competitive situation and cannot afford to be as generous to their workers as automakers and other capital-intensive companies. 
 ''Some well-meaning critics,'' he said, ''believe that Wal-Mart, because of our size, should play the role that General Motors played after World War II, and that is to establish the post-world-war middle class that the country is so proud of. The facts are that retailing doesn't perform that role in the economy as G.M. does or did. Retailing doesn't perform that role in any country in the world.''
 Many of those assailing Wal-Mart argue that the company can, and should, pay its workers at least $2 more an hour and add $1 or $2 an hour beyond that to improve its health benefits. A Harvard Business School study found that Wal-Mart paid $3,500 a year for each employee for health care, while the typical American corporation paid $5,600. 
 If Wal-Mart spent $3.50 an hour more for wages and benefits of its full-time employees, that would cost the company about $6.5 billion a year. At less than 3 percent of its sales in the United States, critics say, Wal-Mart could absorb these costs by slightly raising its prices or accepting somewhat lower profits.
 But company executives dismiss such proposals, saying they would largely wipe out Wal-Mart's profit or its price advantage over competitors. Wal-Mart had a profit margin on sales last year around 3.5 percent. If ''we raised prices substantially to fund above-market wages, as some critics urge,'' the company argued in a recent two-page ad in The New York Review of Books, ''we'd betray our commitment to tens of millions of customers, many of whom struggle to make ends meet.''
 Here in Bentonville, Mr. Scott pursued that theme. ''If you're telling me because you're Wal-Mart and you're going to pay $12 an hour and this other retailer is going to pay $5.15 an hour, the federal minimum wage, and they're not going to provide any benefits at all and somehow the consumer is rewarded in all this, all you're doing is perpetuating the status quo,'' he said. ''You're driving inefficiencies into the system. It doesn't make any sense.''
 Wal-Mart argues that, as retailing companies go, it treats its workers better than average. It says 74 percent of its employees work full time, compared with fewer than 40 percent at many other retailers. But critics note that a leading competitor, Costco, pays $16 an hour -- 65 percent more than the average wage at Wal-Mart stores and 33 percent more than the $12 average at its Sam's Club stores. At Costco, 82 percent of the workers are covered by company health insurance, compared with 48 percent at Wal-Mart. 
 George Whalin, president of Retail Management Consultants in San Marcos, Calif., said that Wal-Mart should ignore the attacks. ''Retail has always paid poorly and it probably always will,'' he said. ''Wal-Mart has a responsibility to serve their customers -- to give them a good product -- and to their shareholders. They don't have a responsibility to society to pay a higher wage than the law says you have to pay.''
 But Burt Flickinger, another retailing consultant, said it would be in Wal-Mart's long-run interest to pay better. ''Wal-Mart's turnover will be close to half a million workers this year,'' he said. ''By paying higher wages, Wal-Mart will make its employees happier and will reduce turnover. A lot of its new workers, for instance, don't know where to stock things. Higher wages will mean more productivity per person, and that should help raise profits.'' 
 The debate is far from over. LaTasha Barker, a single mother who worked for two years as a cashier at a Sam's Club in Cicero, Ill., said she earned so little that she could not afford the $1,860 a year for family health insurance.
 ''They don't pay a living wage,'' said Ms. Barker, who quit her $8.40-an-hour job in 2004 to take a $15-an-hour social work job. While at Sam's, she said, she qualified for Medicaid and $139 a month in food stamps.
 By contrast, Jamie Schifferer, manager of the health and beauty aids department at a Wal-Mart in Algonquin, Ill., said Wal-Mart was a terrific employer. She quit her $25,000-a-year post running a Cingular wireless shop to go to Wal-Mart.
 After 20 months, she earns $12.50 an hour -- close to her previous pay -- but now works 40 hours a week rather than the 60 hours at Cingular. 
 ''I was very miserable,'' she said. ''As soon as I heard about this store opening, I jumped. It's perfect for me right now.''

HEADLINE: Science, Education And Our Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 We were pleased to see Thomas L. Friedman's April 29 column, '''What, Me Worry?','' as well as his previous efforts to call attention to the erosion of United States leadership in science and technology caused by declining investment in education.
 This is particularly true, since the United States Commission on National Security-21st Century, of which we were co-chairmen, reported in January 2001: 
 ''Americans are living off the economic and security benefits of the last three generations' investment in science and education, but we are now consuming our capital.
 ''Our systems of basic scientific research and education are in crisis, while other countries are redoubling their efforts.
 ''In the next quarter century, we will likely see ourselves surpassed, and in relative decline, unless we make a conscious national commitment to maintain our edge.''
 Regrettably, our calls for recapitalization of our education base, by doubling the national investment in science and technology, have been as badly neglected as our warnings of the terrorist threat and calls for the creation of a national homeland security agency were. 
 Beyond the economic warnings included in Mr. Friedman's column, we believe this to be a major issue directly affecting United States national security.

HEADLINE: Treasury Says 30-Year Bond May Be Revived

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The government has taken the first step toward a revival of the 30-year bond, an unexpected shift that could provide an important tool to grapple with the nation's troublesome budget deficit and its creaky pension system.
 And for Wall Street, which has been clamoring for a revival of the bond almost since it was abandoned in 2001, a new Treasury security with a longer maturity than the current market benchmark -- the 10-year note -- could help the boom in bond trading that has bolstered many firms' profits in recent years.
 ''It was a surprise,'' said Lundy Wright, who runs the Treasury desk at Nomura Securities International, after the 9 a.m. announcement by the Treasury Department prompted a sharp sell-off in the bond market that cost some traders and investors millions. 
 ''But it was something the market had been calling for for a long time.''
 The return of the 30-year bond, once the benchmark of the world's biggest bond market, would give pension funds a longer-term investment to match their costs against at a time when the baby-boom population is approaching retirement. 
 ''Very long time horizons are implicit in things like pensions,'' said Neil M. Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''Very long time horizons are implicit in things like I.R.A.'s and 401(k)'s. And very long time horizons are implicit in the longer lives Americans are living.''
 The reissuing of the 30-year bond could also affect the pricing of mortgages and longer-term corporate and municipal bonds. But what impact the new bond would have on overall interest rates would depend mostly on the state of the economy.
 When the 30-year bond was abandoned on Oct. 31, 2001, the country had a budget surplus, although it was shrinking, and both slower economic growth and the cost of the fight against terrorism indicated to many that deficits would return very soon. At the time, the Bush administration argued that the 30-year bond raised the cost of borrowing too much to be cost-effective. 
 Now, managing the borrowing for the budget deficits in the years ahead, the demand for more longer-term securities from pension funds and other buyers and calls from Wall Street have overridden concerns about the possible additional cost. 
 Treasury officials said yesterday that the decision had nothing to do with the budget deficits. Speaking on background as senior Treasury officials, they said a new 30-year bond would give them more flexibility in their borrowing strategies in a way that would make the government's debt sales more cost-effective. 
 They also said that increasing demand for longer-term securities, including demand from pension funds, and a sharp decline in the average maturity of the nation's outstanding debt figured in the decision. 
 But cost-effective does not necessarily mean less expensive. In this case, it may mean the Treasury will pay more to expand its investor base, which some analysts said yesterday would be a good idea. 
 Foreign central banks have become big buyers of Treasury securities, but they are expected to curb their appetites at some point. So attracting new buyers with a 30-year bond would help offset a decline in central bank buying.
 Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, advocated the killing of the 30-year bond in 2001. But he said that with the potential demand from pension funds, reissuing the 30-year bond might not be a bad idea, even if the revived bond added some to Treasury borrowing costs.
 ''It is not impossible that the costs will be small enough to make it worthwhile,'' he said. ''But we won't know that for a while.''
 Gary G. Gensler, the deputy under secretary for domestic finance in the Clinton administration, said, ''I think this is the right thing to do, but it's also a sad reminder of the declining fiscal situation of the U.S. government.''
 He said, ''This is such an iconic thing, a recognition by the Bush administration that we will need this money because we will have deficits as far as the eye can see.''
 While the Treasury said it would not make a final decision until August -- and said it could decide against a new 30-year bond -- Wall Street and others seemed to think the new bond was a sure thing because it would play well in many constituencies.
 For Wall Street, the 30-year bond is a longer-term security that is more volatile than shorter-term securities. And Wall Street traders love volatility because it is an opportunity to make money.
 The committee from Wall Street that advises the Treasury on the sales of government debt recommended this week that the 30-year bond be revived.
 For pensions, a new 30-year bond could provide a clearer benchmark on whether a fund has enough money. And buying 30-year bonds could help pension officials who want to guarantee they can meet their projected costs. Pension funds are expected to become a big customer if the 30-year bond is reissued.
 ''Governments around the world are recognizing that one of their functions in their pension systems is to provide this kind of long-term asset to match the maturities of the long-term pension payouts,'' said Zvi Bodie, a finance professor at Boston University. He noted that France had just sold a 50-year bond and that Britain is planning a 50-year inflation-protected security. 
 Jeremy Gold, a consulting actuary based in New York, said using the 30-year bond as a benchmark for calculating contributions to pension funds would be better than the current system. ''Compared to the current law, it would lessen the underfunding of pensions over time,'' he said. 
 At the end of last year, 83 percent of about 350 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index that have defined-benefit plans were underfunded, he said. At the end of 1999, pensions plans were overfunded at 90 percent of these companies. 
 The reason the Treasury announcement caught the bond market unprepared was that Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said as recently as April 20 that he ''didn't see the need for longer-term paper,'' according to Bloomberg News. But he also said, ''Never say never.''
 The price of the old 30-year bond plunged yesterday as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose as high as 4.67 percent, from around 4.5 percent, in just minutes. The fear was that prices would have to fall and yield rise to accommodate the new supply of 30-year bonds. 
 By late afternoon, the 30-year bond had recovered significantly as the market adjusted to the news, including the fact that new bonds, if approved, would not be sold until February.
 The yield on the 30-year bond was 4.59 percent in late trading, up from 4.48 Tuesday, while the price was down 125/32, to 11125/32. The rest of the Treasury market recovered even more, with the price of the 10-year note off just 6/32, to 9816/32, while the yield rose to 4.19 percent, from 4.16 percent Tuesday.
 But that recovery did not necessarily lessen the losses some traders and investors took in the first few minutes after the 9 a.m. announcement. Because many traders have been betting that longer-term rates will rise more slowly as short-term term rates rise, the sudden surge in the yield on the 30-year bond meant a lot of losses, traders said.
 ''An enormous amount of money was lost today,'' said one bond trader, who spoke on the condition he not be named. He estimated that the loss on a $100 million bet, which is not large for Wall Street, could have been as much as $2.5 million.
 If the Treasury reissues 30-year bonds, the sales would begin in February 2006, with a second sale later in the year. The total of bonds issued would be $20 billion to $30 billion a year. Treasury officials said there was no plan to issue a 30-year Treasury inflation-protected security. 
 Peter R. Fisher, the Treasury under secretary for domestic finance, who made the decision to drop the 30-year bond in 2001, declined to comment yesterday on the reversal. 


CORRECTION-DATE: May 7, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about a proposal by the Treasury Department to reissue the 30-year bond misstated the title of a former Treasury official, Gary Gensler. He was Treasury under secretary for domestic finance in the Clinton administration, not deputy under secretary. The article also misspelled the given name of the chief economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. He is Neal M. Soss, not Neil.

HEADLINE: 'Sweet Charity,' After a Rocky Road, Finally Reaches Broadway

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
Charity Hope Valentine, the cockeyed optimist from the 1966 musical ''Sweet Charity,'' believes that fairy tales do come true, despite cruel evidence to the contrary. So, it would seem, does Christina Applegate, the appealing but underequipped star of the lukewarm revival of ''Sweet Charity'' that opened last night at the Al Hirschfeld Theater after weeks of widely reported toil and strife.
 The road to Broadway for this production has generated theater news of a kind you supposed didn't happen anymore, or perhaps never really happened except in old backstage movies. Star breaks leg (well, a bone in her foot) twirling off lamppost onstage in Chicago; talented understudy (Charlotte d'Amboise) opens for star in Boston; producers decide to close show; star insists that she will, will get better in time for a delayed New York opening and helps raise the extra money to ensure show's arrival, just before the deadline for Tony nominations. And you thought ''42nd Street'' was just moonshine. 
 So when Ms. Applegate steps into view at the Hirschfeld, in a tiny red dress and a halo of adrenaline, it is to the accompaniment of excited thoughts from an audience braced for a Busby Berkeley-style climax, be it triumph or catastrophe. (Look, she's standing next to that dangerous lamppost! Look, she's wearing unflattering ankle boots for therapeutic support! Look, one leg seems to bend less easily than the other!) And then Ms. Applegate starts to sing and dance and a collective sigh stirs the air that sounds like relief, yes, but also deflation.
 Ms. Applegate, who is best known for 11 seasons as the dopey daughter on the sitcom ''Married With Children,'' exudes a soft hopefulness and a sterner determination that suit her character, an unlucky dance-hall hostess in eternal pursuit of love. She has a comic polish that considerately stops short of polyurethane sheen, and an easy, conversational way with a song, even if her voice isn't always on pitch.
 But as a character meant to be a shopworn angel, Ms. Applegate looks more like a merry cherub, an ingenue fresh from the suburbs. More important, in the musical numbers, she seems to grow smaller rather than bigger, which is one thing that definitely should not happen if you are playing Charity Hope Valentine.
 The magic generated four decades ago by ''Sweet Charity,'' which has a first-rate score by Cy Coleman (with charming lyrics by Dorothy Fields) and a second-rate book by Neil Simon, presumably came mostly from the alchemical collaboration of its original director and choreographer, Bob Fosse, and its star, Gwen Verdon. They were virtuosos of a sweet-and-sour style that must have gone a long way in leavening the winking cuteness of a show that featured a dance-hall hostess as its heroine, a bizarrely quaint profession even 40 years ago. (The character was a streetwalker in the 1957 movie that inspired ''Sweet Charity,'' Federico Fellini's ''Nights of Cabiria.'')
 When it was revived in 1986, with Fosse again in charge and Debbie Allen in the title role, ''Sweet Charity'' showed its age, but not in the dance numbers. The choreography still pulsed with the defiant, angular eroticism that was Fosse, a man whose oft-cited equation of showbiz with prostitution seemed particularly appropriate in this case. But the production asked a question that boded ill for future incarnations: Could ''Charity'' possibly soar without the Fosse touch and a star who thrilled to it?
 This latest revival, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, answers that question with a weary ''no.'' While the overture, with its delicious opening vamp from the song ''Big Spender,'' makes you salivate, the main course never seems to arrive.
 The show is steeped in a fuzzy, Pop-colored campiness that whispers raspingly, ''Weren't the 60's a hoot?,'' and includes visual references to Andy Warhol (the person) and Color Field painting. This sensibility translates more attractively into the show's costumes (by the omnipresent William Ivey Long) than into its set (Scott Pask) and lighting (Brian MacDevitt), which suggest quickly set up, psychedelic-themed store displays at Bed, Bath & Beyond.
 Mr. Cilento's choreography is similarly ersatz and soft-edged, acknowledging and blurring the original Fosse blueprint. (The best numbers here are the most unapologetically Fosse-like, ''Rich Man's Frug'' and ''Big Spender.'') The dances never achieve more than a low-grade fever, when what's wanted is that old steam heat. The pop-religion parody, ''The Rhythm of Life,'' usually a guaranteed showstopper, fizzles for want of choreographic and satiric sharpness.
 The supporting cast includes solid pros like Ernie Sabella (as the dance-hall proprietor) and, as two of the many men in Charity's life, Denis O'Hare and the handsome-voiced Paul Schoeffler. Doing a variation on his Tony-winning performance as a neurotic gay accountant in Richard Greenberg's ''Take Me Out,'' Mr. O'Hare at least provides some comic oxygen as a neurotic heterosexual accountant.
 As Charity's hard-bitten best friends (and co-workers), Janine LaManna and Kyra Da Costa bring an otherwise absent spark to ''There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This,'' an exultant skirt-swishing tribute to the ''America'' sequence from ''West Side Story.'' Ms. Applegate, it should be noted, the third member of the trio, more or less disappears in this number.
 Actually, whenever Ms. Applegate dances, she shrinks, even in big solo turns like ''If My Friends Could See Me Now.'' She is a graceful physical comedian, and she reads her lines with winning conviction (though she sometimes sounds as if she has spent a lot of time watching Shirley MacLaine in the 1969 film adaptation).
 But while she executes her steps with care and precision, dance is not a transcendent form of self-expression for Ms. Applegate. And let's face it, neither is song. Nor ultimately does she have the sheer freakish force of personality to make her numbers work despite this, as the musically challenged Melanie Griffith did when she joined the cast of ''Chicago.''
 Thus it is that ''Sweet Charity'' concludes a Broadway season weak on musicals not with a hoped-for fanfare but with an all-too-appropriate wistful whimper.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. to Lay Off Over 10,000, Mostly in Europe

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. announced yesterday that it would lay off 10,000 to 13,000 workers, mostly in Europe, as it struggles to keep up its profits at a time when global competition in the technology business spreads beyond selling computers to providing services. 
 The cutbacks come after I.B.M. reported disappointing quarterly earnings last month and the price of its shares dropped. But I.B.M. portrayed the move as mainly an evolution in its strategy of globalizing its operations by moving back-office work like accounting and procurement to low-cost locations and pruning operations in high-cost and slower-growth markets like France, Germany and Italy.
 The job cuts, the company said, are primarily in administrative offices in European countries that were set up in the postwar years to serve those markets, which were growing rapidly. I.B.M. executives said those national and regional administrative centers were being dismantled. 
 That older style of multinational corporation, they said, is being replaced by a leaner global operation, with work being sent digitally across the Internet to where it can be done most efficiently.
 ''We're still going to have deep roots locally, but we are increasingly globalizing our operations and processes,'' Robert W. Moffat, an I.B.M. senior vice president, said in an interview. ''And the first-quarter financial results did accelerate some of the things we did, but these actions are not a reaction to the first quarter.''
 I.B.M. employs about 322,000 people worldwide today, after 10,000 I.B.M. workers were transferred to Lenovo of China, which this week completed its purchase of I.B.M.'s personal computer business. So the payroll cuts will amount to 4 percent or less of the work force. 
 While most of the trimming will come from West European countries, among them Germany, France and Italy, some will also be made in the United States, where I.B.M. employs 120,000 people. I.B.M. did not say how many American workers would be affected.
 I.B.M. will take a charge of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion in the current quarter to pay for severance packages and other payments to the laid-off workers.
 Wall Street analysts estimate that the cutbacks will reduce I.B.M.'s annual operating expenses by $1 billion or more. 
 The job cuts are expected to be completed by the end of this year.
 I.B.M. made the announcement after regular trading ended yesterday; the company's stock price rose 77 cents, to $77.85, in after-hours trading. So far this year, however, I.B.M.'s share price is down 22 percent. 
 I.B.M. remains a solidly profitable company with nearly $9 billion in cash in the bank, even after the company spent $3.4 billion in the first quarter to repurchase shares and set aside $1 billion more than it did in the same quarter a year earlier to cover its pension obligations to retirees.
 Still, I.B.M. reported a profit for the first quarter of 85 cents a share, 5 cents a share below Wall Street's expectations. The shortfall was regarded by investors as a surprising stumble.
 The company attributed its weak performance primarily to its big services business, which now accounts for more than half the company's revenue and is supposed to be the main engine of I.B.M.'s growth in the future.
 In a sense, I.B.M.'s strategy in moving toward services mirrors the course of the American economy. The company depends less on manufacturing than it did in the heyday of mainframe computers as it moves up the economic ladder to helping corporate customers use information technology. Increasingly, I.B.M. researchers and software programmers are put to work for customers redesigning and automating business tasks like procurement, accounting and customer service.
 Yet I.B.M. faces increasing competition and price pressure in services from low-cost rivals like Dell, which is rapidly expanding in services, as well as Indian outsourcing companies like Wipro, Tata Consulting and Infosys. Those competitors operate mostly in the mundane but big part of the services industry, which helps companies run their computer data centers. 
 The disappointing earnings report raised the question of how competitive I.B.M. really is in the services market, and how quickly it can develop the more profitable business of helping companies use technology to increase sales and streamline operations.
 ''The issue is what if the old-style services decline more rapidly than the new business-transformation services picks up the slack,'' said Mark D. Stahlman, an analyst at Caris & Company, an investment firm.
 For months before I.B.M. reported its lower-than-expected profit, Samuel J. Palmisano, the chief executive, talked publicly about the need to ''lower the center of gravity'' of the company by eliminating administrative layers and putting more authority and resources in the hands of employees who deal directly with customers.
 Last December, after I.B.M. announced the sale of its PC business to Lenovo, Mark Loughridge, the chief financial officer, said in a conference call that some of the proceeds from the $1.75 billion deal, including cash, stock and debt, would be invested in ''the transformation and globalization of I.B.M.'s business model.''
 Yet industry analysts said the big cutbacks announced yesterday suggest that the transition to more profitable businesses and faster-growing markets is not going as smoothly as I.B.M. had anticipated.
 ''The technology services business has changed, and I.B.M.'s operations have to change with that shift,'' said Laura Conigliaro, an analyst at Goldman Sachs & Company. ''As we've seen, I.B.M. has not done a picture-perfect job of it.''
 And while trimming the payroll will reduce costs, it remains to be seen whether the pruning will increase the company's competitiveness and sales in the long run, analysts noted.
 ''This move is an acknowledgement that I.B.M.'s competitiveness is not as good as it could be,'' said A.M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. 
 ''Taking costs out is the easy part,'' he said. ''The issue is whether the result will be a more competitive, vibrant I.B.M. or not.''

Job Cuts at Hewlett-Packard
 By Bloomberg News
 The Hewlett-Packard Company, the world's largest printer maker, said yesterday that more than 1,900 workers at its printing and imaging unit had accepted severance packages.
 Employees in the United States and Puerto Rico were offered and accepted voluntary severance packages last month, said Monica Sarkar, a spokeswoman for the company, based in Palo Alto, Calif. 
 Most cuts will be at the company's offices in Boise, Idaho, and Corvallis, Ore., she said.
 Profit in the printing group, which accounts for more than two-thirds of Hewlett-Packard earnings, fell 3.6 percent last quarter as the company cut prices deeply.
 The cuts are ''part of the transformation of I.P.G. to maintain market leadership and improve the cost structure,'' Ms. Sarkar said. 
 She declined to say how many workers remained in the unit.

HEADLINE: More Is More, With a Dollop Of Too Much

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
DEREK ZOOLANDER sighting at 11 o'clock. Shoot a glance to the left, and there Upen Patel sits at the edge of a wood-boxed palm tree, glowing in the reflection of all the acres of marble paneling the lobby of the Grand Hotel. 
 Like a beefcake Lana Turner, Mr. Patel strikes a profile, his head theatrically atilt, his cheeks sucked in as if to emulate an expression Ben Stiller immortalized in ''Zoolander,'' the durable spoof of the male modeling world. 
 This Zoolander happens to be an ''A Category'' model, according to a system employed here, and catnip to Bollywood starlets. This may help account for the maniacal interest shown in him by the photographic hordes documenting every significant clench of his jaw. 
 Mr. Patel was in town for the sixth annual India Fashion Week, an event that would have been hard to imagine taking place just 10 years ago. In those seemingly long gone days, before what one local publication called ''mall mania'' had infected the country, pret-a-porter fashion barely existed here in any Western sense. Yes, there were serious designers -- Tarun Tahiliani, Rohit Bal and Ritu Kumar, among others -- and runway shows, but these were pitched to a local market for the custom-made clothing grandiosely termed couture.
 Then in the late 1990's a weeklong presentation of catwalk shows for international press and buyers was first organized here and, seemingly in an instant, an entire fashion circus was conjured up, as if from one on Delhi's frequent dust storms. This style apparition arrived replete with sideshows, paparazzi, blanket front-page coverage and daily seating wars. 
 Since then India Fashion Week has become an institution, one whose increased presence on the global style stage could not be better timed. It happens that at the moment Western designers are been being less coy than usual about their visits to Mother India's closet. American and European collections for spring and summer are chockablock with Indian inspirations; Roberto Cavalli, Gucci, Oscar de la Renta, Kean Etro, Monique Lhuillier and Tracy Reese are just a smattering of those who helped themselves to the subcontinental legacy of handicraft, ornament, strong color and durable motif. Indian design has even filtered through to the mass market in the form of kurti, modified versions of the humble pajamalike kurta, daily wear for many Indian men and the shirt of choice this summer for hot evenings in the Hamptons or days at the beach. 
 ''The West has borrowed a lot from us over the years,'' said Cory Walia, a Bollywood stylist renowned for having discovered the model Ujjwala Raut, a darling on Western runways. ''But realistically we also get most of our information and just about every inspiration from the West,'' Mr. Walia added. ''Fashion shows are not part of the culture of India. Even fashion isn't, in a way.'' 
 The distinction between fashion and apparel is probably worth noting. Most of the $16 billion worth of clothing that the Fashion Design Council of India projects the country will export this year hardly merits being called fashion, in the conventional sense of high-end label goods; the bulk of it constitutes generic goods manufactured by cheap Indian labor and destined for the shelves of department and discount stores.
 Yet India ''has traditionally had a very strong design handwriting,'' according to Rajeev Sethi, a designer and local cultural impresario who heads the preservationist Asian Heritage Foundation. ''And we had better start marketing ourselves quickly before we lose our identity to all the multinationals coming along.'' 
 India Fashion Week, which ran through April 26, was nothing if not an answer to Mr. Sethi's hopes, a crazily diverse showcase of contemporary Indian design aesthetics, yoked to a frenzy of corporate image building, all of it underwritten by an array of unlikely sponsors that included makers of discount shoes, mobile telephones, cosmetics and beer.
 IT was also a goofy social free-for-all that drew its audience partly from the large pool of New Delhi's nouveau riche, and also from a ripe assortment of sponsors' clients, buyers, flunkies, models of both sexes and of course their ever present groupies. 
 All of them converged on the Grand (formerly the Grand Hyatt), a hotel that rises like a bleak mirage in an enclave of South Delhi, on the road to Gurgaon, where the city's new shopping centers are clustered, and alongside a lot where construction workers hack away at the foundations for another new mall.
 ''It was in the exact same condition last year,'' said Fern Mallis, a vice president of IMG, the global sports marketing company that owns Fashion Week in New York and that produced its offshoot here. ''If this were China, they would have had a parking lot full of cars by now,'' Ms. Mallis said. 
 Suneet Varma, a local fashion celebrity whose clothes are distributed in Europe, Asia and the United States, opened the week one blazing April noontime with his Le Spice collection. His was the first of 39 runway presentations at the hotel, augmented by 70 trade booths showcasing what could be called the poles of current fashion design. 
 On one hand there are the neo-minimalists, deploying traditional handicrafts with restraint and confidence. On the other are designers whose response, when presented with a blank slate and access to those same crafts traditions, takes the form of horror vacui. More is more, in other words, with a dollop of too much.
 For every even marginally subtle designer like Mr. Varma, there are five others whose work looks as if it is destined for a camel fair in Rajasthan. Kurtas, salwar kameez, churridar trousers, saris, caftans, and formal sherwani coats came paved with sequins, barnacled with cowrie shells, encrusted with zardozi embroidery, ornamented with ghungroo bells and universally accessorized with sad clunky shoes.
 Models' hairstyles were trained to resemble cotton candy or else the conehead coiffures of ancient Chola deities. Their faces, too, were treated to some odd effects: zippered or bisected or randomly splashed with the pastel powders of Holi, the Hindu festival of spring.
 At any fashion week one can count on an abundance of weird themes. But at India Fashion Week the narratives seemed likelier to borrow from the Mahabharata than the latest indie sensation at the multiplex. Ms. Kumar, the grande dame of Indian fashion, claimed as her inspiration the ''Threads of the Indus,'' a reference to the cradle of civilization. Why she then showed flounced Gypsy skirts and T-shirts bearing sequined images of the Nizam of Hyderabad -- whose family was legendary for its gems and staggering wealth -- is anyone's guess. 
 Wendell Rodricks, a designer from the former Portuguese enclave of Goa, organized his collection around ''the wandering tribes on Oceania,'' an allusion, he explained, to an unproved theory that Pacific islands were colonized by prehistoric sailors who had set out from southern India. As it happened, the gauzy rags looked just like the stuff one sees on Lonely Planet types at surf shacks all along Goa's Benaulim beach. 
 THE models seemed enchanted with Mr. Rodricks's loose shirts in light linens and drawstring trousers with flukes at the side seams. Buyers, alas, were less enthusiastic. ''I'm here to see clothes that speak to a larger, more global vision,'' said Michael Fink, a buyer for Saks Fifth Avenue. ''I keep saying to people: 'Designers come from abroad, take your fabrics and crafts and present extraordinary clothes. What's wrong? Why aren't you doing that here?'''
 Mr. Fink was not alone among those hopefuls who made the trek from the United States or Europe only to find disappointment in collections not yet likely to translate for foreign markets.
 ''I've been coming for three years, and I definitely buy, but I'm cautious and only use two or three designers,'' said Nadine Allen of Okra, a Palm Beach store that specializes in Indian labels. 
 Chances are slim, after all, that Ms. Allen's Worth Avenue clientele would be drawn to the patchwork, beaded, embroidered, hand-blocked and vegetable-dyed clothes Payal Jain imagined for a show she called ''The Wandering Mendicant.'' 
 That is not to suggest that Ms. Jain, who was trained in the United States, is not deserving of a wider audience. But, one wonders, where? As with many of those who showed during the week, Ms. Jain seemed stalled in aesthetic limbo, caught between cultures, a condition that seems to afflict much current Indian fashion design.
 What renders this reality particularly odd is that the fine arts branch of India Inc. has had anything but trouble establishing itself globally, as witness the current abundance of Indian stars in art, film, literature and music. 
 Yet Indian fashion inexplicably continues to drift along lazily, as if the vital subcontinent that made a gift to the world of calico, madras, chintz, tie-dye, crewelwork and virtually the entire technique of hand block printing was somehow not motivated to propel itself out of the backwaters of design. 
 ''There is no such thing as 'fashion' in India, beyond weddings,'' said Mahendra Singh, a prominent jeweler in New Delhi who frequently lends wares to designers for Fashion Week. ''Designers don't feel they need to go beyond that, because the market here is so large,'' he said.
 MR. SINGH'S observations are valid, or might logically have been during the long years when India's economic isolation kept it out of reach of multinational suitors hawking their luxury wares. But those days are now past. The challenge from the West is on, and the business face of India is changing, as many will tell you, faster than at any time since independence. 
 In particular the fever to Westernize has become a contagion in the consumer marketplace, with goods and fads being shipped in by the planeload. Among the most blatant current manias in the capital city are those for Gucci mini clutches and Vuitton sandals, for ageless bodies -- spinning and Pilates classes are packed at Delhi gyms -- Botox and even tanning creams.
 Fashion models use the latter liberally, particularly the men, the better to display action-figure physiques that suggest Jose Canseco's cautions about steroids have not yet made it to bookshelves here. 
 ''Our problem as Indians is that we lack restraint,'' Madhu Verma, the wife of a construction magnate said one night over dinner at her Delhi farm, a gated compound with world-class collections of ancient and contemporary art and a Krishna temple attended by three salaried priests. 
 Happily, Ms. Verma's generalization was not borne out by all the designers during Fashion Week, and there were those whose collections handily resolved the East-West dilemma by improvising an aesthetic that was subtly hybridized. Paras Bairoliya and Shalini Jaikaria of Geisha Designs, for instance, offset their delicate floaty skirts with mannish tunics.
 The darlings of Bollywood, Sandeep Khosla and Abu Jani of Abu Sandeep, presented a subdued monochrome collection embroidered in the elaborate chikankori style. And Sabyasachi Mukherjee, a Calcutta-based designer with a growing international following paid frank homage to Prada with a clothes that employed an array of Indian handicrafts, although skewed, worked over and conspicuously dulled down.
 There were even slouchy, tailored men's coats worn atop saris by models whose ''librarian'' eyeglasses lent them the look of impoverished art students from mid-20th-century West Bengal. ''To appear poor is to appear chic,'' Mr. Mukherjee explained of the collection. Given the larger setting, his may have been the most radical design statement one heard all week.

HEADLINE: Nation's Insurers Face New Inquiry, by F.B.I.

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4 

 BODY:
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has begun a nationwide review of insurance practices to determine whether the accounting irregularities uncovered at American International Group represent a pervasive problem in the industry, agency officials said on Wednesday.
 The F.B.I. has instructed agents at its 56 field offices to talk to government regulators and industry executives, review civil filings and look for patterns that mirror the problems seen in recent months at A.I.G., the officials said.
 ''We do not want to be caught napping on this,'' said Chris Swecker, an assistant director at the F.B.I. who oversees the financial crimes unit. ''We are taking a very, very hard look at this to see if it represents a pervasive problem.'' 
 A.I.G., the embattled insurance giant, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York attorney general's office, the Justice Department and the New York insurance department over accounting improprieties and the use of transactions that inflated its financial strength. The company disclosed earlier this week that accounting problems uncovered in an internal review would force it to reduce its net worth by $2.7 billion, or $1 billion more than it had previously estimated.
 Chris Winans, a spokesman for A.I.G., said he could not comment on the merits of the F.B.I.'s latest review. 
 He said, however, that ''in general, we welcome any constructive effort aimed at improving the environment of the insurance industry.''
 ''A.I.G. is cooperating with government authorities to the fullest extent possible, and that would include state, federal and regulatory authorities,'' he said. 
 The F.B.I.'s review, which is being handled by its financial crimes section, could increase pressure on insurance companies to show that they are in compliance with accounting rules and regulatory requirements. 
 The review caught some industry officials by surprise. Some officials pledged their cooperation, while others cautioned that it was premature for the F.B.I. to suggest that A.I.G. represented anything other than an isolated incident.
 F.B.I. officials compared the current review to those conducted into the savings and loan crisis in the 1980's and, in more recent years, into the corporate fraud cases at large corporations like Enron. 
 Mr. Swecker said that the F.B.I.'s review began two or three months ago and that it was too soon to suggest whether the problems at A.I.G were an indication of a broader industry problem. 
 ''I'm not going to say it is the next crisis, but I will say we are looking at it'' in an effort to determine whether the industry is vulnerable to becoming ''the next big one'' in terms of corporate scandals, Mr. Swecker said.
 Alan Haskins, the antifraud coordinator for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said the group was not aware of the F.B.I.'s review, but he pledged its cooperation. 
 ''We have always had and will continue to have an ongoing dialogue with the F.B.I. on antifraud matters and regulatory matters,'' he said. ''We'll continue to try to assist them with whatever they need.''
 Some officials in the insurance industry were skeptical about the F.B.I. review. Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute in New York, a trade consortium, said any comparisons the F.B.I. might be seeking to the savings and loan crisis or Enron-like scandals were misguided.
 ''They will find, I'm confident, that there are no appropriate analogies here to those types of broad, industry problems,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''What we have here are isolated cases of accounting improprieties that have been uncovered.''
 In a separate report released Wednesday, the F.B.I. said that investigating fraud in the insurance industry was a priority for its financial crimes section. The industry has more than 7,000 companies, and more than $1 trillion in annual premiums.
 The number of F.B.I. investigations and fines levied for insurance fraud have declined significantly since 2001, the bureau said in its report. But officials said that insurance fraud -- often with the insurance companies as victims rather than perpetrators -- is a growing concern. The F.B.I. said in its report that insurance fraud costs the average family $400 to $700 a year in increased insurance costs, with total losses exceeding $40 billion.
 Identity theft has also become a pervasive concern in a range of corporate crime and fraud cases; 1,678 investigations were pending as of the second quarter of this year, the F.B.I. report said. It said that ''identity theft has emerged as one of the dominant white-collar crime problems of the 21st century,'' and the report described the problem as pervasive and growing.

HEADLINE: The Pursuit Of Jackson Is a Courtship Of Patience

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
Phil Jackson remains both highly coveted and unmistakably unemployed, and his return to the N.B.A. does not appear to be imminent, despite a flurry of activity from coast to coast.
 The Knicks have met with Jackson once and hope to speak with him again soon. The Los Angeles Lakers have not yet decided if they want to bring back Jackson, but they plan to broach the possibility soon. 
 Jerry Buss, the Lakers owner, said yesterday that he had not interviewed Jackson, but he added, ''I think that's going to get pretty close now, a few days.''
 Todd Musburger, Jackson's longtime agent, could not be reached for comment.
 Buss spent more than an hour speaking to reporters at the Lakers' headquarters in El Segundo, Calif., but he shed little light on his intentions. Buss let Jackson go last summer, after a five-year tenure that included three championships.
 It has been widely assumed that the Lakers are seeking to bring Jackson back, but those who have spoken to Buss say he is noncommittal -- an impression he reinforced with conflicting statements yesterday.
 ''I haven't said that I do want him back,'' Buss said. ''However, my reaction to the situation is, you choose the coach that has the best chance of leading us back to the glory days. Whatever that takes is the direction we're going to go. If that be Phil, so be it. If it be one of the other unmentionables, so be it.''
 By ''unmentionables,'' Buss said he was referring to three to four candidates he would not name. The Lakers have reportedly been in contact with Flip Saunders, the former Minnesota Timberwolves coach, and also have interest in Larry Brown, the Detroit Pistons' coach.
 Jackson dates Buss's daughter, Jeanie, who is also a team executive vice president. The three have dined socially on occasion, but Jerry Buss said they had not discussed the Lakers' coaching job.
 ''I meet Phil because we have a social relationship, and very seldom do we refer to anything basketball right now,'' Buss said. ''We talk about the playoffs a little bit, who's doing well, who's not. But I am not in negotiations with him.''
 Buss said that Kobe Bryant, who clashed often with Jackson, would not have veto power on a hire but would probably be consulted.
 Buss said he did not expect to make a hire ''for a few weeks.''
 The timeline could be aimed at waiting for Brown. With the Pistons in the playoffs, it is difficult for any team to gauge Detroit's interest in allowing Brown to leave. He has three years left on his contract.
 The Knicks also have an interest in Brown but are skeptical they can land him. If they are unable to hire either Brown or Jackson -- considered two of the best coaches in the league -- the Knicks intend to bring back Herb Williams, who coached the team for the final three months of the season.

REBOUNDS
 MIKE SAUNDERS, the Knicks' trainer for 27 seasons, has been reassigned to a newly created post, assistant to the director of player care. Saunders will report to the Knicks' chief physician, Dr. Lisa Callahan. The team has begun a search for a new trainer. The Knicks will hold a second day of draft-prospect workouts today. The four prospects are JOEY GRAHAM of Oklahoma State, JULIUS HODGE of North Carolina State, AARON MILES of Kansas and HAKIM WARRICK of Syracuse.

HEADLINE: Kerkorian Seeking 9% Stake in G.M.

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 4 

 BODY:
Kirk Kerkorian, the multi-billionaire casino operator and financier, said today that he was making an offer that would give him a stake worth nearly 9 percent in General Motors, the struggling Detroit auto giant whose stock recently hit a 12-year low. Coming from Mr. Kerkorian, an 87-year-old with a history of taking big stakes and exerting varying degrees of control over airlines, casinos, automakers and movie studios, the news surprised Detroit and Wall Street. 
 G.M. shares surged 18 percent, closing at $32.80, up $5.03. 
 Mr. Kerkorian's investment firm, Tracinda, said in a statement today that its acquisition was ''solely for investment purposes.'' But Mr. Kerkorian has been known as an investor who rarely sits on the sidelines, asserting his will on the often struggling companies he buys in hopes of turning them around. He previously was Chrysler's largest shareholder and tried unsuccessfully in the 1990's to take over the company with the aid of its former chairman, Lee A. Iacocca. He is now in the midst of a legal battle with DaimlerChrysler over the terms of the 1998 merger between DaimlerBenz and Chrysler.
 In an interview Wednesday morning, Mr. Kerkorian's personal lawyer, Terry Christensen, said the investment would be a passive one and added that Mr. Kerkorian would not seek a board seat or control over management. He also said that Mr. Kerkorian aimed for an investment of roughly 9 percent and was not looking for a larger stake at present. 
 And he said that Mr. Kerkorian had confidence in G.M.'s management, including the chairman and chief executive, Rick Wagoner. 
 ''He's not really trying to judge management,'' Mr. Christensen said. ''He's trying to judge the assets of the company, the ability of the company to right itself and get going strong again. He sees no reason why this management team can't do that. He believes they will do it.''
 But people on Wall Street and in Detroit say they are skeptical that Mr. Kerkorian would make a passive investment. Analysts floated several possibilities: Mr. Kerkorian would press G.M. to sell some of its lucrative non-automotive business, like its mortgage lending business; he would eventually try for various degrees of management control; or he would make himself enough of a nuisance that G.M. would buy his shares for a quick profit, a tactic he has used with companies like Columbia Pictures. 
 ''Our expectation is that the Tracinda/G.M. story will take many twists and turns over many quarters,'' said John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, who upgraded his rating on G.M. shares to neutral from sell after the announcement. ''We expect G.M. to react vigorously and defiantly to Tracinda's actions. Given G.M.'s still considerable economic and political clout, we expect this to be a long, drawn-out battle.''
 ''Given Kerkorian's successful track record of unlocking shareholder value, we feel we cannot continue to be a seller of G.M.,'' he said, adding that he thought Mr. Kerkorian might be interested in having G.M. sell or consider other options for the nonautomotive businesses, like its mortgage lending unit, that are part of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, G.M.'s financing division.
 Tracinda, which is owned by Mr. Kerkorian, said Wednesday that it had bought 22 million shares, or 3.9 percent of G.M., in the last few weeks. Tracinda said it was also offering $868 million, or $31 a share, for 28 million more G.M. shares. The offer represented a premium of 11.6 percent over G.M.'s closing price of $27.77 on Tuesday. 
 Mr. Christensen said Mr. Kerkorian thought G.M. had been oversold by the market and saw the investment as ''a value investing play.''
 ''Mr. Kerkorian's focus has always been, what are the assets of the company and what is the ability of the company to generate cash flow and to strengthen its position in the marketplace?'' he said. ''General Motors, he believes, has the assets and the cash flow, and the ability to generate more cash flow. Over time they have proven themselves to be an extremely strong competitor and he believes they will continue to prove that to be the case.''
 In a statement. G.M. said it learned about the offer today and would ''not express a view on specific investor activity.''
 Born in Fresno, Calif., Mr. Kerkorian is the son of Armenian immigrants. He spent his youth boxing, among other things, and during World War II was a pilot who trained other pilots for the military. He built the charter airline Trans International in the 1960's, then sold it, bought it back and sold it again, and went on to develop hotels and casinos in Las Vegas.
 Over the last half century, he has bought and sold Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the movie studio, three times, most recently last year, for a handsome profit. Shares of his MGM Mirage casino group have risen more than 50 percent in the last year, driven in part by its acquisition of the Mandalay Resort Group. 
 A less successful investment has been his stake in Chrysler, which depreciated considerably after the merger with DaimlerBenz. Mr. Kerkorian is suing DaimlerChrysler on the ground that he was misled about the terms of the merger, but a federal judge rejected that argument this year. Mr. Kerkorian is appealing.
 Mr. Christensen, the lawyer, declined to offer specifics about what particular assets attracted Mr. Kerkorian to G.M.
 ''This is an endorsement of the American automobile industry and General Motors specifically,'' he added. ''It is an endorsement of the industry and its future.''
 Gerald Meyers, a professor at the University of Michigan who was the chief executive of American Motors before it was sold to Renault in the 1980's, said the likely outcome would be for Mr. Kerkorian to force G.M. to buy out his shares. 
 ''He's not going after the company,'' he said. ''G.M. is not going to be well anytime soon and he knows that.''
 ''The only thing I can make out of it is that he hopes he'll be bought out or that he truly will be patient and will wait for the stock to go up, which I can't imagine he can find on the horizon.''
 Certainly, G.M. is in rough shape. Last month, the company reported a $1.1 billion first-quarter loss, its largest quarterly loss in more than a decade, and the company has been pummeled this year by falling sales in the United States, particularly for large sport utility vehicles. Rising health care costs have also hurt; G.M. is the nation's largest private health care provider, giving coverage to 1.1 million American workers, retirees and their families. The array of problems have raised questions about G.M.'s long-term viability, though most analysts say it has adequate cash reserves to stave off a bankruptcy filing.

HEADLINE: Hevesi Sees Debt Causing M.T.A. Deficits by '08

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority should be able to balance its budget through 2007 without severe service cuts, but it faces large deficits starting in 2008 as a result of mounting debts, according to a new report by the state comptroller.
 Even if it balances its budget for the next two years, the authority faces a budget gap of more than $400 million in 2008, rising to $1.1 billion in 2010, the report found. 
 Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi has had a wary relationship with the authority since April 2003, when he accused it of misleading the public about its finances in advance of a vote to increase fares that year for the first time since 1995. 
 Mr. Hevesi's latest report, issued yesterday, contained the first detailed analysis of the financing authorized by the Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki for the authority's capital improvements from 2005 to 2009. 
 The Legislature agreed to a 0.125 percent sales tax increase and a 5-cent mortgage-recording tax increase in the 12-county area served by the authority. It also approved increases in several types of motor vehicle fees and authorized a transportation bond act that would generate $1.45 billion for the authority. Together, those measures would provide $3 billion in new resources for the authority over the next five years, Mr. Hevesi found.
 However, Mr. Hevesi also identified significant risks facing the authority, among them the possibility that a bond act on the November ballot will fail and that the economic recovery would stall. The major contract with subway and bus workers expires in December, he noted, and energy costs have been volatile.
 ''The M.T.A. continues to rely heavily on debt to finance its capital program,'' the report stated, noting that its outstanding debt had risen to $20.9 billion as of April, from $9.8 billion in 1995. The proportion of the capital program to be financed with new borrowing is 44 percent, more than in any of the authority's previous programs, he said.
 The authority's executive director, Katherine N. Lapp, has noted that of the $9.3 billion in new borrowing, $5.1 billion would be backed by new revenue sources and $4.2 billion from existing sources. Therefore, she says, the new debt burden will be less ''crushing'' than in previous plans.
 Mr. Hevesi called for the authority to improve its efficiency, echoing a report he issued in October that concluded that many positions were redundant or unnecessary.
 In January, the authority ordered a hiring freeze for nonessential positions, and last month, Ms. Lapp ordered the heads of the agency's subsidiaries, including New York City Transit, to identify a total of $150 million in savings for 2006 and 2007 by July. She also has hired consultants, at a cost of $832,283, to find other ways to save money. 
 ''We appreciate the comptroller's acknowledgment of the fiscal path that we have taken,'' an authority spokesman, Tom Kelly, said yesterday. ''We will continue to streamline our operations while making sure that they have no effect on customer service or safety.''

HEADLINE: Perhaps it's time for a thorough tax overhaul, but the question is, What should any reconfigured system look like?

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
TAX systems are like septic tanks: they need to be cleaned out every 10 years or so.
 The last significant structural tax reform in the United States was in 1986, so we are long overdue for a thorough cleansing. Some economists have claimed that the changes in 1986 increased the economy's growth rate by as much as 1 percent in the years immediately afterward. But since then, virtually every piece of tax legislation introduced in Congress has added to the complexity and inefficiency of the tax system. 
 Last January, President Bush formed an advisory committee on income tax reform, which he asked to issue a report by the end of July 2005. Given the importance of tax reform to the economy, two noted tax economists, Alan J. Auerbach and Kevin A. Hassett, recently invited nine leading economic and legal scholars to prepare papers describing their own views. This collection of papers, ''Toward Fundamental Tax Reform,'' can be ordered at http://www.aei.org/books/bookID.820/book--detail.asp.
 The authors span the political spectrum and have diverse views about the size of the public sector, how progressive the tax system should be and other value judgments. But as economists, they are all concerned with the same question: given that a government wants to raise a given amount of revenue, how can it raise it in a way that least distorts economic decisions?
 Posing the question in this way naturally leads to an examination of marginal tax rates -- the tax that individuals would face if their income increased slightly -- since that is the relevant tax rate for deciding whether to engage in activities that could increase income.
 Some might want to see marginal tax rates increase with income; some might like to see them stay relatively flat. But, as the authors point out, there is no coherent theory that advocates the ''crazy quilt of blips'' implied by the current rate structure. 
 Most economists would agree that it is better to have low tax rates on a broad base of activities rather than high taxes on a few activities. So, if you are going to tax income, say, it is better to tax income from all sources at the same rate and allow as few deductions as possible.
 A system of this sort will have the least impact on choices among different sorts of income-producing activities. In addition, the fewer deductions there are, the less attractive it will be to engage in activities whose primary goal is reducing taxable income.
 Consider, for example, everyone's favorite handout to the middle class: the deductibility of home mortgage interest. Many economists would argue that the favorable tax treatment of residences leads people to overinvest in housing.
 If mortgage interest were not deductible, but overall rates were reduced so that people paid about the same total amount of taxes, then we would probably see a shift toward smaller and less expensive houses.
 Needless to say, such a change would not be popular with many voters, so it is unlikely to be put in place anytime soon.
 Of course, taxing income is not the only way to raise revenue. It might make more sense to tax consumption instead. Since income is equal to consumption plus savings, by definition, a consumption tax is equivalent to making savings tax deductible.
 More savings translates into more investment and a higher living standard in the future, certainly desirable goals. 
 One could directly impose a consumption tax by using a Value Added Tax (VAT) as is done in Europe. But a less disruptive change that still captures some of the benefits of a consumption tax would be to unify the current messy system of tax-deferred savings, including I.R.A.'s, 401(k)'s, 403's and Keough plans. We do not really need all those different plans and having one, simple tax-deferred savings plan would make a lot of sense.
 Many people essentially face a consumption tax now, given the plethora of tax-deferred plans, so simplifying the system should cause few disruptive changes in behavior. Simplification might even increase savings, since it would make the choices much less confusing.
 Opponents of a consumption tax argue that it is regressive. But it does not have to be that way. There could be a generous personal exemption, which would substantially reduce taxes paid by low-income households. Or we could tax higher levels of consumption at higher rates by setting limits on the amount of savings that could be deducted, as we do now.
 Unfortunately, such a change would discourage savings among the rich, who are most able to save more. One of the papers by R. Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia University economist, explores the distributional effect of a consumption tax in some detail and concludes that such a tax need not be strongly regressive.
 Another source of tax complexity is the differing tax rates that businesses face. Single proprietors, partnerships, small and large corporations all face different sets of rules and rates. If there were a uniform set of tax rates for businesses, and these rates were closely related to individual tax rates, we would see significant savings in spending on accountants and lawyers.
 The papers by David F. Bradford, a Princeton economist who recently died, and Robert E. Hall, a Stanford economist, describe how a unified tax system might work.
 But the big problem with tax reform is how do you get there from here? It is true that the current tax code is a mess, but it is a mess for a reason. Every one of those loopholes has a constituency. Sometimes it is a broad constituency, like the one supporting the mortgage interest deduction. Sometimes it is a narrow but politically powerful constituency, like the agriculture or energy industries.
 Any sort of change or simplification will require quite a bit of bipartisan cooperation and a substantial amount of logrolling. In theory, everyone can come out ahead with a simpler system. But in practice, finding a set of changes that are politically palatable will be difficult.

HEADLINE: A Pitched Battle for Stem Cell Research Headquarters

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 4 

 BODY:
The headquarters for California's new embryonic stem cell research program will have about 50 employees, none of whom will conduct the $3 billion in experiments that voters authorized last fall as part of the ground-breaking endeavor.
 Yet a bare-knuckles competition for the headquarters, the kind more commonly associated with Olympics bidding, concludes on Friday. Officials will decide then where to place the headquarters, having narrowed the field of 10 applicants to three by means of a hair-splitting ranking system calculated to the hundredth decimal point. 
 The cities and counties that submitted bids in March to a site-selection committee each offered millions of dollars in incentives beyond the basics, including free office space and laboratories, health clubs, world-class golf, luxury hotel rooms and even access to a corporate jet. 
 San Francisco finished with 222.75 points, followed by Sacramento with 200.50 and San Diego with 199.80. At its meeting in Fresno, the institute's 29-member oversight committee will be free to choose any of them.
 The program, formally known as the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, was authorized last year when voters committed $300million a year in bond money over the next 10 years to stem cell research. It is the largest state-sponsored research endeavor ever.
 While most attention has focused on the science and politics of the undertaking, the competition over its real estate has been fierce, as officials across the state look beyond the modest scope of the administrative headquarters and see in it the genesis of ''the next big thing'' for their local economies.
 Robert Klein, chairman of the oversight committee, likens the municipal enthusiasm to the civic roles of the Accademia del Cimento in Florence and the Royal Society of London in the 17th century. ''What we are doing is a repeat of a major historical force where cities and their philanthropists join together behind a major research movement,'' he said.
 San Francisco's 139-page bid, the most generous of all, is worth about $18 million in giveaways from private entities and includes office furniture, a limousine service and the use of conference facilities at the Giants baseball stadium. The center would be on the second floor of a building in a waterfront redevelopment area across the street from the ballpark and near a new campus of the University of California, San Francisco.
 Mayor Gavin Newsom, who has visions of a biotechnology-led recovery from the city's dot-com crash, has committed to raising $4.7 million from private donors himself. ''The institute becomes an extraordinary anchor in inviting people from around the world,'' Mr. Newsom said. ''This will be the heart and soul of the United States' stem cell efforts.''
 While there is widespread agreement that the prize is worth winning, the contest has ignited simmering regional rivalries, leading to accusations of favoritism against some committee members.
 Rankings have been challenged, methodology questioned and aspersions cast.
 Some San Diegans have suggested that the process is tilted toward San Francisco because Mr. Klein, who wrote last fall's initiative creating the institute, lives in the Bay Area. Mr. Klein acknowledged in an interview that San Francisco topped his list, but he said he could be swayed otherwise on Friday.
 In Sacramento, anger has been directed at several members of the site-selection committee who did not show up last weekend for the official tour of the city's proposed headquarters building.
 ''They didn't even come to Sacramento,'' Mayor Heather Fargo said. ''Yes, I have a problem with that.'' 
 Ms. Fargo said Sacramento was typically cast as the underdog in statewide competitions -- who doesn't love to hate the capital? -- but that it was perfectly suited for the headquarters. Not only would the institute's staff members be close to lawmakers and state agencies, but they would also be able to buy houses and arrive home from work in time to coach Little League, she said.
 ''If I was a millionaire and could afford a view of the coast in San Diego or San Francisco, that is a good option,'' Ms. Fargo said. ''But that is not who they are going to be hiring to do the administration.''
 Some San Franciscans have questioned whether it was coincidental that the two members of the site-selection committee from San Diego awarded significantly lower marks to San Francisco than to San Diego when asked to give their ''general overall impression'' of the cities.
 On a scale of 1 to 30, John C. Reed, the president of the Burnham Institute, gave San Francisco only 9 points, and Richard A. Murphy, president of the Salk Institute, gave it 10, according to unofficial tallies kept by the cities. Dr. Reed and Dr. Murphy, whose institutes are in San Diego, gave that city 27 points and 26 points, respectively, according to the unofficial tallies. The official tallies will not be available until Friday.
 Dr. Murphy, in an e-mail interview, said he did not believe regional rivalries played a role in the rankings by the site-selection committee, which he described as ''extremely professional and objective.'' 
 While describing San Francisco as ''a lovely international city that has terrific hotels and conference facilities,'' Dr. Murphy said the San Diego site ''has the potential to become a world center for stem cell science as well as administration.''
 The San Diego bid would place the headquarters in the Torrey Pines Mesa area of La Jolla in a building that overlooks Torrey Pines Golf Course (site of the 2008 U.S. Open Championship) and the Pacific Ocean. The building is a 15-minute walk from a large biotechnology business park; the University of California, San Diego; and several renowned research centers.
 ''Because of the scientific strength of this area and the always-good weather, La Jolla is a valued meeting site by scientists from all over the world,'' Dr. Murphy said.
 In the tense competition, advantages have been turned into disadvantages by rivals.
 San Francisco has promoted its stunning setting, but detractors note that the ocean is too chilly for swimming. San Diego boasts abundant sunshine, but critics say it lacks San Francisco's urban sophistication. Sacramento has cheaper housing and shorter commutes than both coastal cities, but even Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is still living out of a suitcase, 18 months into his job there, boosters for the other cities note.
 ''Regionalism has reared its head in extraordinary ways,'' said Mr. Newsom, who complained about pot shots against his hometown yet rattled off the number of consulates and airport travelers in each of the three cities, with San Francisco, of course, leading the pack.
 ''No greater international city, outside New York, exists,'' he said. ''It is objectively factual.''
 In preparing for the vote on Friday, Andrea Moser, a vice president of the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation, plodded through a list of the committee members and marked ''N'' or ''S'' after each to indicate location in Northern or Southern California. She said her eye was out for possible swing votes.
 ''I was in my mind thinking, 'Is there anybody from Santa Barbara?''' Ms. Moser said. ''They never know where they are. They want the Northern California panache and the Southern California lifestyle. But there were none from Santa Barbara.''

HEADLINE: Nike, with little explanation, has decided not to do business with Sears. Whose image suffers?

BYLINE: By Nat Ives

 BODY:
NIKE'S decision to stop selling its sneakers and clothes at Sears is shining a spotlight on the impact retail environments have on marketers' brands.
 Though the companies themselves have said little about the move, retail analysts quickly pronounced it a result of the Kmart Holding Corporation's $12 billion acquisition of Sears, Roebuck & Company in March. 
 Nike may have feared that its products would wind up for sale at Kmart, a discount chain, analysts said. If not, Nike may still have worried that Sears Holdings, the company that resulted from the Kmart-Sears combination, would undermine Nike's image. 
 When Sears Holdings was formed, its chief executive, Alan J. Lacy, said that the new company would offer a complete shopping solution. ''Shoppers will have greater access to the leading proprietary brands of both Kmart and Sears,'' Mr. Lacy said. Kmart stores, for example, would be able to sell products once exclusive to Sears, like Craftsman tools and Kenmore appliances.
 The cross-pollination, however, has yet to significantly improve the image of either chain. 
 At the same time, Nike has continued to pursue high-gloss ad campaigns. It is spending an estimated $20 million to $30 million, for example, on its warriors campaign that shows professional athletes donning masks.
 In sum, Nike spent an estimated $220 million last year to advertise in major United States media, according to TNS Media Intelligence. It is also the runaway sales leader in its chief category. With about $3.2 billion in wholesale footwear sales last year, Nike represented 36.3 percent of the nation's $8.9 billion branded athletic shoe market, according to Sporting Goods Intelligence. Its next closest competitor, Reebok, had 12.2 percent of that market.
 Sears, which sold Nike shoes primarily aimed at women and children, will suffer the loss of the swoosh more than Nike will miss the department store, said John J. Shanley, senior athletic and footwear industry analyst at the Susquehanna Investment Group. 
 Joani Komlos, a spokeswoman at Nike in Beaverton, Ore., called the company's decision a brand management matter. ''The decision was made based on what we felt was best for the brand,'' she said, declining to elaborate.
 Lee Antonio, a spokeswoman at Sears Holdings in Hoffman Estates, Ill., declined to address outsiders' explanations for the Nike pullout. ''We were surprised and, although we are disappointed, we respect their brand decision,'' she said. ''We plan to continue talking to Nike, as our customers feel strongly about the Nike brand.''
 Ms. Antonio noted that Sears continues to carry shoes from companies including Reebok, New Balance, Adidas and Skechers. 
 ''Advertisers are learning that where they sell their products has tremendous effects,'' said Robert K. Passikoff, president at Brand Keys in New York, a brand and customer-loyalty consultant. ''Where your product values are reinforced by the venue, you will see higher levels of consideration.''
 In a Brand Keys index that tracks retailer characteristics like merchandise selections, shopping experiences and store reputations, Sears stores score above average but have lost ground over the last five years, Mr. Passikoff said.
 Not every branding expert found wisdom in the Nike withdrawal.
 ''It is surprising and incredibly short-sighted of Nike to pull their sneakers from Sears,'' said Debbie Millman, president of the New York office of the Sterling Group. ''This would have been the perfect opportunity to leverage the idea of a 'specially designed' sneaker for the retailer in an effort to capitalize on the current design-led economy we are living in, which is a good part of what is currently differentiating Target.''
 Nike has happily sold its sneakers to Wal-Mart since March, but only a swoosh-free brand called Starter. It plans to monitor the results of its Wal-Mart deal for a while before deciding whether to expand the strategy to other chains. The company expects to stop shipping to Sears in October, meaning that the products will stay on Sears shelves through the end of the year. 
 Sears has survived without Nike before; the shoemaker cut Sears out for much of the 1990's before relenting and signing a new sales agreement in 1999. That agreement expired this year.
 And even without Nike, Sears will still sell an abundance of nationally advertised products supplied by outside companies, like Compaq computers, Bosch appliances and Russell Athletic clothes.
 But Nike is unlikely to relent in the near term, said John G. Horan, publisher at Sporting Goods Intelligence. ''Nike has always had a very keen understanding of its brand image,'' he said. ''It has been very uncompromising about that for years. This is the same thing all over again.''

HEADLINE: Private Equity Investors Are Reshaping the Landscape of European Business

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, May 4 

 BODY:
The new conquerors of Europe have already taken control of one of the Netherlands' largest retailers, half the nursing homes in Britain and Spain's yellow pages. 
 Next, the raiders are going after Germany's largest private housing company, a Spanish telecommunications group, and even the Lego Group of Denmark and its theme parks. 
 In the United States, private equity investors have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years. But in Europe, the deal making has been nothing short of transformational. Bedrock industries are changing hands, and changing the face of corporate Europe in the process. 
 And a growing pile of private equity cash is on hand to buy even more European assets in 2005. Investors say the Continent is loaded with opportunities compared with the picked-over American market, yet is a safer and more predictable place to invest than Asia.
 Some record-breaking deals are likely this year, including a $15 billion-plus buyout of Auna, a leading Spanish telecommunications group. A $40 billion deal for the beverage giant Allied Domecq may be powered in part by private equity money.
 Poring over Europe, the private equity investors have operated like ''kids in a candy store,'' said Kamal Tabet, global head of Citigroup's financial sponsors group, which advises private equity funds on deal making. ''More companies were for sale, they had less competition for buying the assets, and interest rates have been at historic lows,'' he said, allowing the investors to borrow money cheaply. 
 But some people are beginning to worry that these deals, often driven by American private equity firms and backed by money from American investors and banks, are happening too fast, at too high a price and without regard for jobs or the long-term success of the business. The hangover from overspending, they warn, could be brutal to the newly private companies.
 And one of these debt-burdened companies will no doubt default, a private equity banker who has helped put deals together, said, adding, ''Everyone hopes they're not the one holding the baby'' when it happens.
 Private equity investors specialize in taking over troubled companies, paying a small amount in cash and financing the rest with loans. Applying a hard-boiled combination of cost-cutting, management shuffling and sharpened strategy, they are often able to turn a money loser into a profitable business in just a few years -- at which point they sell the company, sometimes for several times the purchase price.
 In Europe, the value of these buyouts rose 39 percent in 2004, to $159 billion, surpassing United States private equity activity for the first time in the 10 years that Dealogic, a consultant group, has kept track. Private equity investment in the United States lagged that in Europe in the first quarter by $5 billion, and investors predict that the difference will widen. 
 Raising money has been easy, as huge investment funds allocate more capital to Europe and banks compete to offer low-interest loans. Meantime, competition for acquisitions had been slim. After a glut of deal making in the late 1990's, many European corporations focused on selling assets and returning cash to shareholders. Today, a European executive who is even rumored to be thinking of buying a company may be rewarded with a steep drop in his stock price. And buyout firms like the Blackstone Group, the Texas Pacific Group or Kohlberg Kravis Roberts are watching, with lots of money to spend. 
 The effects are just being realized. Bankers and economists often refer to private equity as a ''lubricant'' -- which, they say, is helping to create a more unified and unabashedly capitalist Europe. These investors are buying financially troubled companies that have often been burdened by the government's focus on retaining jobs, even if they do not make business sense, and turning out revamped, more American-style businesses with a close focus on profit margins, specialists say.
 ''Private equity is moving into a vacuum, created by the inability of big countries to seriously reform their large-scale enterprises,'' said D. Quinn Mills, a professor at Harvard Business School. ''Socially, that's good. It's the major engine of change of an institutional nature in the European economy.''
 Because they are willing to invest where no one else is, the private equity companies have been able to cut jobs and costs in ways that would be politically unacceptable for a public company's management.
 ''Private equity is the only game in town that can play the villains, that can play the vultures,'' said Eli Talmor, a professor at the Private Equity Institute of the London Business School. ''If the private equity guys cannot fix it, then it is nearly helpless.'' 
 The influx of capital has been welcome to politicians, who have created tax breaks to suit private investment. Officials speak at private conferences and, in some cases, retired heads of state sit on the boards of funds. ''Private equity investment is what we're trying to attract the most,'' said Heinz Zourek, deputy director general for enterprise at the European Commission. 
 There is at this point no shortage of money. In the last month, Advent International of London raised a 2.5 billion euro, or $3.3 billion, fund for global buyouts, and a French firm, PAI Partners, put together a 2.7 billion euro fund. This was in addition to record-breaking flows of cash into American private equity pools like the one at the Carlyle Group, which surpassed the $10 billion mark. And there is talk of a $12 billion fund from the Blackstone Group. 
 But as all this money flows in, private investment in Europe is in danger of creating a bubble, bankers and investors say. Already, the debt these investors are building up on company books has increased. 
 In recent years, such investors have paid roughly eight times annual Ebitda -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- for a company, and then loaded on as much as five times that in debt. But prices and debt levels are going up, experts say, which will make it harder to be profitable down the road. 
 ''Prices are high on a historic basis,'' said John Coyle of J.P. Morgan Chase. ''There is clearly an increased risk that someone is going to overpay with too much leverage.''
 The long-term effects of overpayment could be painful for European economies. Private investors, despite their independent reputation, tend to act and react in flocks. A well publicized failure, where investors are forced to swallow a big loss, could cause most of them to move rapidly out of Europe, much as investors did after the telecommunications bubble burst in the United States.
 Another risk lies in a small but vocal group of European mutual fund managers, who have balked at repurchasing companies after they have been through the private equity machine, saying prices are too high. Private equity houses are ''successfully arbitraging the ignorance of the fund manager,'' said Andy Brough, a fund manager with Schroders.'' The big laugh for me is how will they get out of these stocks.'' 
 And some politicians are also emerging as critics, notably in Germany. 
 Despite such signs of trouble, most private equity investors are still focusing on the opportunities in Europe. ''Anything that gives corporations liquidity is good,'' Wilbur Ross, a longtime American buyout investor, said from New York. 
 There are a lot of medium-size European companies and subsidiaries that need reshaping, Mr. Ross said, adding, ''There's a big opportunity to change the map.''

HEADLINE: Pataki and Bloomberg Endorse Changes in Ground Zero Tower

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY and CHARLES V. BAGLI; Robin Pogrebin, Jim Rutenberg and Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Seeking to restore public confidence in the pace and vision of the rebuilding effort at the former World Trade Center site, Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the lead developer at ground zero said yesterday that the soaring office building known as the Freedom Tower would be significantly redesigned to satisfy security concerns.
 After meeting for more than an hour, the political leaders and the developer, Larry A. Silverstein, emerged to declare that they were united in their commitment to build the tower despite a rash of recent delays and escalating alarm over the building's safety. They said they still regard the Freedom Tower as an essential new addition to the identity and economy of New York City. 
 People involved in the rebuilding processs say that the tower, unveiled 18 months ago as the product of a contentious collaboration between two world-famous architects, is likely to lose its signature twisting form, along with its distinctive spire -- a conscious reflection and reply to the Statue of Liberty's upraised arm in New York harbor. Mr. Pataki, his aides and others stressed, however, that the Freedom Tower would not be reduced to an unsightly, fortress-like bunker, and that it would be built on the same general location planners had long ago settled on. 
 ''What emerged from the meeting was a renewed commitment to the realization of the Freedom Tower as a bold symbol of the rebuilding,'' Mr. Pataki said in a statement. ''We have an obligation to move forward with the rebuilding in a deliberative and responsible way.'' 
 The meeting, and a series of public statements from the principals, came after several weeks of disturbing news about the site. Last month, Goldman Sachs & Company announced that it had pulled back from its plan to build a new 40-story headquarters across from the Freedom Tower because of security worries. 
 As well, concerns raised by the New York Police Department about the tower's vulnerabilities required a delay in construction of several months to a year. As a result, some designers, urban planners and experts on downtown Manhattan have begun to encourage a major rethinking of the ambitious plans for the 16-acre site, plans that call for the tower and several other office buildings, a memorial for the victims of Sept. 11, a museum and other features.
 There has been talk of moving the location of the Freedom Tower, of scaling back the amount of office space built, of relocating some of the cultural features.
 But yesterday, Mr. Pataki did his best to foreclose for the moment much of that talk. He made clear that the tower, if different, would retain some essential qualities laid out in the master plan for the site: that the building be iconic, that it remain in its current location, that it be the tallest building on the site and that its spire reach a height of 1,776 feet to satisfy that patriotic number. 
 The tower is expected to be set farther back from West Street than the minimum of 25 feet now proposed. It has been suggested that untwisting the tower would reduce the size of the building's base, leaving more room for a security buffer.
 ''I have no doubt that David Childs will come up with yet another magnificent design that will once again inspire the nation and serve as a fitting tribute to freedom,'' Mr. Pataki said, referring to the architect who designed the current model for the Freedom Tower and will lead the new effort.
 The public show of support for the office tower, which included a statement by Mr. Silverstein, the developer, came even as questions have deepened about the future need for, and attractiveness of, office space downtown. 
 For instance, there have always been questions about whether commercial tenants will occupy the building or other office space in the area; the one building currently being developed at the site, 7 World Trade Center, has no tenants so far other than Silverstein Properties.
 Indeed, Goldman's decision to step back from plans for its $2 billion headquarters has sent a chill through the real estate market, industry executives say. The decision came as both Morgan Stanley and Newsweek decided not to lease space in Lower Manhattan, even though rents are substantially cheaper than in Midtown. 
 ''There's been a pullback on the part of companies considering downtown," said Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive of the CB Richard Ellis Company in New York. "I think companies are responding to the uncertainty about redevelopment plans. Goldman really was the kickoff.''
 On Tuesday, Mr. Pataki's chief of staff, John Cahill, held a meeting in the governor's Third Avenue offices with top Goldman executives, Deputy Mayor Daniel Doctoroff, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and other state and city officials in hopes of addressing Goldman's concerns and convincing it that its best investment would be in Site 26, which is across from the proposed Freedom Tower.
 ''Conversations are continuing," said Kevin Rampe, the outgoing president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
 Yesterday's meeting included the governor, the mayor, Mr. Silverstein, Mr. Kelly, Mr. Doctoroff and representatives of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, among others.
 The two architects most involved in the Freedom Tower and the site, Mr. Childs and Daniel Libeskind, did not attend. The two men are competitors and fought over the design from early on; Mr. Libeskind shaped the master plan for the site. Their relationship remains a combustible and unpredictable variable.
 Mr. Libeskind was on his way to Europe yesterday and issued a statement calling security of the Freedom Tower ''the paramount concern'' but saying that the intent and spirit of the master plan for the trade center site would remain even if the shape of the building changed. The tower's antenna is expected to remain. 
 It will be several weeks before officials come out with a preliminary new design, state and city officials said, and longer before detailed engineering drawings are ready. People involved in the redevelopment have estimated that the redesign could delay the tower for several months to a year; work on its foundation and orders for steel and concrete were to occur this winter and spring.
 Mr. Doctoroff and Mr. Rampe, among others, emphasized yesterday that they had made significant progress on many fronts in the $12 billion redevelopment plan and that it should not be overshadowed by the delay and redesign at the Freedom Tower.
 Yesterday's meeting also dealt with the role of Mr. Silverstein, who has spent well more than $10 million on preliminary work on the Freedom Tower. But Mr. Silverstein has also at times been at odds with officials at City Hall, the Port Authority and the governor's office.
 Recently, after concerns were raised by the Police Department, Mr. Silverstein, who holds the lease for the trade center site, has proposed seeking more public money to cover security costs and other elements of the building. That, according to one person involved in the rebuilding effort, irked state and city officials.
 ''If Larry asks for too much money, the mayor and the governor will take him out of this project," said a top rebuilding official who attended the meeting. He said the mayor and the governor yesterday made it "very clear" to Mr. Silverstein that ''we're not negotiating, we're building a building; Larry can be part of it or not.''
 Mr. Silverstein expects to receive about $4.6 billion in insurance money to rebuild the trade center. The insurers have already turned over about $1.9 billion. Of that, $1.4 billion has already been spent. It is clear there is enough money for the first tower and the infrastructure but not necessarily the subsequent four proposed towers.

HEADLINE: Fashion's Bare Bones

BYLINE: By Eric Wilson

 BODY:
IT'S too early to be thinking of Halloween, and the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' franchise didn't have the fashion authority to be sparking a trend. Which makes it all the more striking that a morbid skull and crossbones should suddenly turn up as a look for spring. 
 Polo Ralph Lauren, known for its traditional polo player embroidery, has slyly slipped a few items into its line -- $49 canvas deck sneakers, a $75 ribbon belt, a $97.50 polo shirt -- that bear a Jolly Roger insignia, although Mr. Lauren's reference is to rugby teams and secret societies, not pirates. The insignia is also a motif in the company's new Rugby store concept, which is geared to college students. (''It gives the preppy element of Rugby a rebel edge,'' a company spokeswoman explained.) 
 Sonia Rykiel included a black sweater with sequined skull in her spring line, and skulls have become signature items in the high-priced Garrard and Me&Ro jewelry collections and in Lucien Pellat-Finet's cashmere sweaters, which are priced upward of $2,000. At the other extreme H&M carries men's socks bearing a green skull and crossbones for $3.90. 
 And the skeletal trend has legs: Clements Ribeiro has dresses and jackets for fall that are hand-painted with skeletons and bones, and the Los Angeles jewelry designer Loree Rodkin is introducing a line of sunglasses in July that have rhinestone skulls at the temples.
 Barneys New York is also joining the crypt clique with limited-edition Skullhead vinyl action figures, a collaboration with the New York toy company Kidrobot. Barneys asked several designers to custom-fit a look from their spring collections on a 12-inch figure topped by a menacing white skull. Marc Jacobs did a trench coat and jeans; Jil Sander designed a tailored white suit and pink tie; and Dries van Noten recreated his tweed linen jacket and hand-knit leg warmers. The $295 dolls are expected to go on sale in the Madison Avenue store on Friday. 
 Jay Bell, Barneys' senior buyer of men's designer collections, who organized the designers' participation, said the idea originated with another fashion trend: the craze for grown-up toys spurred by Miuccia Prada's robot accessories.
 ''Everybody's getting on this toy bandwagon,'' Mr. Bell said, noting that it is the skull's subversiveness that sets it, well, head and shoulders above other designer toys. ''To get Jil Sander, the madam of German chic, to collaborate with this kind of figure was really unexpected,'' he said. ''Below the radar, right now, is spot on.'' 
 Hamptons Hot Spots 
 Stacey Bendet, the designer of the three-year-old Alice & Olivia label, thought she had found the perfect location for her first store when a prime spot on Main Street in East Hampton, N.Y., recently became available. But she quickly learned a lesson about the economics of real estate in a retail strip where antiques dealers and art galleries have made way for an ever-increasing array of designer boutiques, and an old-fashioned ice cream shop has been replaced by a Starbucks. Keeping tabs on which brands are coming next in the Hamptons has become an annual rite of spring.
 ''I thought I had the space, but then J. Crew offered to pay twice the rent,'' Ms. Bendet said. 
 J. Crew has been exploring locations in the Hamptons area for several seasons. Last year it offered a ''beach delivery service'' to shuttle merchandise to summer renters who could not do without their preppy chinos for a weekend. A spokeswoman for J. Crew would not comment on the space, at 46 Main Street, but she said that based on positive response to its delivery service, the company is looking to expand with ''a home base in the Hamptons.''
 Ms. Bendet will not have to resort to taking phone orders for her signature 1970's-fit pants or the line of denim she is introducing this summer. With her business partner, Andrew Rosen, who brought the Theory label to East Hampton last summer (at the site of the Barefoot Contessa store), she was able to secure a smaller location across Main Street in a shopping complex known by its street name, the Circle. Ms. Bendet hopes to have the store open by Memorial Day.

HEADLINE: ANALYST CHARGED WITH DISCLOSING MILITARY SECRETS

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON and ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4 

 BODY:
Federal agents arrested a Pentagon analyst on Wednesday, accusing him of illegally disclosing highly classified information about possible attacks on American forces in Iraq to two employees of a pro-Israel lobbying group.
 The analyst, Lawrence A. Franklin, turned himself in to the authorities on Wednesday morning in a case that has stirred unusually anxious debate in influential political circles in the capital even though it has focused on a midlevel Pentagon employee.
 The inquiry has cast a cloud over the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which employed the two men who are said to have received the classified information from Mr. Franklin. The group, also known as Aipac, has close ties to senior policymakers in the Bush administration, among them Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is expected to appear later this month at the group's annual meeting.
 The investigation has proven awkward as well for a group of conservative Republicans, who held high-level civilian jobs at the Pentagon during President Bush's first term and the buildup toward the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and who were also close to Aipac. 
 They were led by Paul D. Wolfowitz, the former deputy defense secretary who has been named president of the World Bank. Mr. Franklin once worked in the office of one of Mr. Wolfowitz's allies, Douglas J. Feith, the under secretary for policy at the Pentagon, who has also said he is leaving the administration later this year.
 According to a 10-page F.B.I. affidavit accompanying the criminal complaint, Mr. Franklin divulged the secret information about the potential attacks at a lunch on June 26, 2003. Officials said he was dining with two of Aipac's senior staff members. The lunch was apparently held under F.B.I. surveillance. Four days later, federal agents searched Mr. Franklin's office and found the document containing the information. 
 Later, agents found dozens of classified documents at his home. The affidavit did not describe the subject matter of the documents, but said 38 were classified Top Secret, about 37 were classified Secret and approximately eight were classified Confidential. The dates on the documents spanned more than three decades. The affidavit did not indicate whether the information that was disclosed would have placed American troops at risk, and it offered no details about the gravity of the information that might have been compromised. 
 Other people who have been officially briefed on the case said that while Iraq was discussed at the lunch, most of the conversation centered on Iran. 
 Friends of Mr. Franklin, an advocate of a tough approach to Iran, say he was worried that his views were not being given an adequate hearing at the White House. They also say he wanted Aipac to help bring more attention to his ideas.
 The two Aipac employees at the lunch were not identified in the complaint, but officials said they were Steven Rosen, formerly the group's director of foreign policy issues, and Keith Weissman, formerly its senior Middle East analyst. They remain under scrutiny, officials said, and supporters of the two men said they feared that they might be charged as well. 
 Lawyers for Mr. Rosen and Mr. Weissman have said the men did nothing wrong. On Wednesday, Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for Mr. Rosen, said, ''Steve Rosen never solicited, received, or passed on any classified documents from Larry Franklin, and Mr. Franklin will never be able to say otherwise.'' John N. Nassikas, a lawyer for Mr. Weissman, declined to discuss the case.
 For its part, Aipac has been advised by the government that the group itself is not a target of the investigation, according to a person who has been briefed on Aipac's legal strategy. 
 Still, the organization recently took action to distance itself from the two men. Two weeks ago, Aipac said it had dismissed Mr. Rosen and Mr. Weissman after months of defending them. On Wednesday, Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for the group, declined to discuss the case.
 Mr. Franklin, 58, was suspended last year, as was his security clearance, but he had been rehired in recent months in a nonsensitive job. He has been employed by the Defense Department since 1979 and is a colonel in the Air Force Reserve.
 He made a brief appearance on Wednesday in federal court in Alexandria, Va., and was released on $100,000 bond. A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for May 27. If convicted, Mr. Franklin could be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in prison. One of Mr. Franklin's lawyers said that he expected his client would plead not guilty.
 Associates of the influential circle at the Pentagon that had been headed by Mr. Wolfowitz attributed the scrutiny of Mr. Franklin to the continuing struggle inside the administration over intelligence. They said they had been unfairly attacked by critics at the country's intelligence agencies with whom they had clashed since before the war in Iraq. 
 They have said other efforts to embarrass them include one last year when American officials said Ahmed Chalabi, the leader of the Iraqi National Congress and a longtime ally of Pentagon conservatives, told Iranian intelligence officials that the United States had broken its communications codes. A federal investigation into who might have provided the information to Mr. Chalabi remained unresolved.
 Friends of Mr. Rosen and Mr. Weissman said the two men have been singled out unfairly. The friends say the men operated no differently than many corporate representatives, lobbyists and journalists in Washington who cultivate sources inside the government to barter information about competitors, personal gossip and, sometimes, classified intelligence.
 But Mr. Rosen and Mr. Weissman had regular discussions with Israeli officials about the Middle East, and investigators have long said that they believed that the Aipac employees had veered into the area of national security, meeting with Israeli officials, including intelligence agents, although the affidavit made no mention of Israel as a recipient of any information.
 The absence of any mention of Israel appears to reflect the acutely sensitive relationship between two allies with close political, military and intelligence relationships. Israel says it has banned espionage operations against the United States, but American counterintelligence officials have said that Israel still spies on the United States, looking for technological data and inside information about American thinking about the Middle East.
 After Mr. Franklin's arrest, the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalon, said in an interview on Israel's Channel One that Israel had no role in the case. But American officials confirmed a report by The Associated Press report from Jerusalem on Monday that said F.B.I. agents had interviewed a former senior Israeli intelligence official, Uzi Arad, about the Franklin inquiry.
 At the heart of the government's case against Mr. Franklin is the lunch he had in June at a restaurant in Arlington, Va. At the lunch, Mr. Franklin spoke of the information related to potential attacks on American forces in Iraq, the affidavit says.
 The affidavit said Mr. Franklin told the two men that the information was highly classified and asked them not to ''use'' it. There is no indication that Mr. Franklin provided any documents to the two men. 
 The affidavit, signed by Catherine M. Hanna, a F.B.I. agent, said Mr. Franklin had engaged in other illegal acts. The complaint said he disclosed government information to an unidentified foreign official and journalists. In addition, investigators found 83 classified documents in his home in West Virginia. The documents were stored throughout the house in open and closed containers, and one was in plain view.
 After the search of his office in June 2003, Mr. Franklin, according to the affidavit, admitted that he had told Mr. Rosen and Mr. Weissman about the classified document. He also began cooperating with the government, but he later reversed that decision. Investigators pursued espionage charges against Mr. Franklin for more than a year, but Wednesday's complaint charges him not with spying but with the lesser offense of illegal disclosure of classified information.
 A senior Justice Department official, while not ruling out the possibility of future espionage charges, noted that such charges required an intent to act on behalf of a foreign power. ''That is not the case here,'' the official said. ''He was charged with the appropriate crime here, and that's the crime the investigators believe he committed.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Proposes Reducing Sales Tax

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Starting next month, New York City shoppers would pay reduced sales taxes on shoe and clothing purchases costing less than $110, under a budget proposal to be announced today by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
 The proposal would lower the sales tax by eliminating a 4 percent city tax that shoppers now pay, an action that requires the approval of the State Legislature. The state sales tax of slightly more than 4 percent, which includes a surcharge for downstate residents in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority region, would still apply, administration officials said yesterday. The sales tax reduction is part of a proposed budget, totaling close to $50 billion, for the 2006 fiscal year, which starts in July. The mayoral aides say the budget will also include spending initiatives on education and a tax break for some homeowners who renovate or expand their buildings. 
 Council members who were briefed last night on the proposed budget said it would add about $125 million for cultural programs, libraries and summer jobs that was not included in the mayor's preliminary budget proposal in January. The mayor also proposes cutting taxes on small businesses, and boosting the reserve of funds to cover future labor agreements to about $900 million by the 2009 fiscal year, the council members said. 
 Immediately eliminating the city's portion of the sales tax on clothing costing less than $110, which is due to expire in the 2007 fiscal year, would cost the city about $200 million in lost revenue over the next year, according to administration officials. However, the proposal -- which has its political advantages in this mayoral election year and, in fact, was proposed by the City Council in March -- is made easier because of increases in other revenue, mostly from real estate-related taxes.
 When Mr. Bloomberg announced his preliminary budget plan, he said that tax revenues were about $1.5 billion higher than figures projected a year ago. Administration officials said yesterday that since the release of the preliminary budget in January, those projections have been revised upward again, mostly because of an improving economy.
 While the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid upstaging the mayor, provided a few clues about today's budget announcement, the mayor himself remained mum. He hinted during a news conference at City Hall that his budget plan would most likely be free of controversial spending cuts, and he extended an olive branch to Gifford Miller, the council speaker and a Democratic candidate for mayor.
 ''I think this budget, on balance, is going to be greeted by people very well,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Now we'll negotiate with the City Council -- and I will say this for Speaker Miller, three years in a row we've come up with an agreement. There's no reason why we won't come up with an agreement, and he and I will stand there in the rotunda and announce an on-time budget.''
 The city must adopt a budget before July 1. One area of friction during the negotiations traditionally involves the restoration of funds the mayor proposes to cut from programs favored by council members. In his preliminary budget proposal, the mayor cut $276 million for those programs.
 This year, however, the mayor is already proposing to add back $125 million of that money, which council members took as a positive first step.

HEADLINE: The Thrift Imperative

 BODY:
The stock market has been a scary place lately: new yearly lows followed by big daily gains, then more lows and so on. While no one fully understands these gyrations, we do know that markets become skittish when fundamentals are out of whack. There's arguably no more fundamental imbalance these days than the United States' low national savings -- the amount Americans save minus the amount the government borrows. But don't expect to hear our nation's leaders talk about it. 
 From 2002 through 2004, the rate of national savings was lower than at any time since 1934. This year, savings are once again off to an anemic start. That's a problem for stocks because the market looks forward, and a lack of national savings means that both the private and government sectors must borrow to pay for all of the things we wish for ourselves, our progeny and our society, like modern industrial plants, secure retirements, good education and better health care. If current trends continue, the United States will borrow an unprecedented $1 trillion this year alone, mostly from abroad, a sum that is reflected in the nation's huge budget and trade deficits.
 Any sane market analyst has to wonder how long that can last, and such underlying angst intensifies market swings. 
 How we got to this point is now sadly familiar. The biggest culprit is the Bush administration's profligacy, with tax cuts the most glaring driver of the swing from budget surplus to budget deficit over the past four years. Currently, the deficit offsets most of the economy's net private savings. 
 Individuals also do not save enough, as reflected in the widespread inadequacy of retirement savings. Some argue that the amount of personal savings is understated because it does not take into account the increase in housing values, which has many homeowners feeling flush. But elevated home values do not add to national savings.
 Such wealth is not converted into cold hard cash until houses are sold, and at that point the money flowing into the sellers' pockets is simply money that is flowing out of the buyers' pockets. No new wealth is created unless a seller saves the windfall -- which is generally not the case in today's consumer economy. Instead, sellers increase their purchasing power, while the saving rate declines and the country as a whole becomes poorer. The uncomfortable reality is that saving is possible only by deferring today's consumption, not by spending freely while one's house appreciates. 
 The most powerful way to increase national savings is to cut the budget deficit. To do that, President Bush and his allies in Congress must defer the gratification they would derive from showering more tax cuts on the affluent. Lawmakers should also refocus their efforts on increasing personal savings. For decades the emphasis has been on granting tax incentives to savers, and for decades the amount of personal savings has trended downward. Congress should instead encourage all employers to improve the structure of retirement savings plans in ways that have demonstrably increased participation, including automatic enrollment upon hiring and the automatic allocation of employee contributions. 
 The alternative is economic decline. The markets are right to be skittish.

HEADLINE: Blaming the Foreigners

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: PADERBORN, Germany, May 3 

 BODY:
Karl-Heinz Stiller might have felt entitled to a victory lap, right about now.
 His company, Wincor Nixdorf, has completed a grueling five-year run during which it was sold to demanding American private equity investors, rebuilt from the ground up, and taken public in Germany's first major stock offering since 2001, after the Internet bubble burst.
 Not only did Wincor Nixforf survive, but it thrived. The company, which makes automated teller machines and cash registers, has hired 3,200 employees since 1999. Its stock has risen 57 percent since the offering a year ago. 
 But last week, Mr. Stiller was startled to find that his company had won notoriety of a different sort, when its name -- and those of its former investors, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, the leveraged buyout firm, and Goldman Sachs -- turned up on a so-called locust list.
 This internal report, prepared by Parliament researchers for Germany's governing Social Democratic Party and leaked to the press, named Kohlberg Kravis, Goldman Sachs, and other American and British firms as foreigners who have plundered German assets, laid off workers or been just plain greedy.
 Earlier, the party's chairman, Franz Muntefering, told the German tabloid Bild that such investors ''stay anonymous, have no face, fall upon companies like locusts, devour them and move on.''
 Deploring foreign investors as parasites or carpetbaggers is neither new nor limited to Germany. Russia has become chilly toward foreign firms with interests there, and Malaysia's former leader, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, a few years ago blamed the financier George Soros for the Asian currency crisis.
 In Germany, the antiforeign sentiment these days is stoked by the convergence of three trends: a flood of private equity money into the country; the extended weakness of the nation's economy, which feeds fear that German jobs are leaching out of the country; and the fading fortunes of the Social Democratic Party and its leader, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder.
 ''Equating financial investors with locusts is something that has a history in this country,'' said Jan Pieter Krahnen, director of the Center for Financial Studies at the University of Frankfurt. ''It alludes to some deep sentiments, which may or may not be there, but which can be exploited.'' 
 German industrialists, academics and other politicians have roundly criticized Mr. Muntefering's attack, which seems calculated to shore up the leftist base of the Social Democrats before a crucial election on May 22 in North Rhine-Westphalia, a large and an economically troubled state.
 A prominent German-Jewish historian, Michael Wolffsohn, even detected a whiff of anti-Jewish sentiment in the list, which also included Blackstone, the New York private equity investment group, and Saban Capital, which is controlled by the Israeli-American billionaire, Haim Saban. 
 Mr. Schroder has not joined in such attacks, and Social Democratic officials in North Rhine-Westphalia said it made no sense to put Wincor Nixdorf on a list of supposed victims.
 For Mr. Stiller, who guided Wincor through its overhaul and remains the chief executive, the whole matter is baffling. ''We are absolutely the wrong example for this,'' he said in an interview at company headquarters here in Paderborn, a city of 141,000 in a rural part of Westphalia.
 ''My own view,'' he said, ''is that it is absolute nonsense, and stupid, to attack private equity investors. As a country, we should be open to any investor who puts his money on the table.''
 It is not that Mr. Stiller, 63, thinks all foreign investors are white knights. Some takeovers, he acknowledges, have gone badly. Some have resulted in wholesale layoffs or the dismantling of companies.
 But Wincor Nixdorf's story, he said, illustrates that numbers-driven investors can do good. By demanding rich returns and using unforgiving methods -- chiefly a preoccupation with cash flow -- they can get solid, but underachieving, German companies into shape.
 ''We are much more focused on financial stability because of them,'' Mr. Stiller said. ''This has helped us, as a public company, in talking to analysts, shareholders and institutional investors.''
 That is a far cry from six years ago, when Nixdorf languished as a small part of the sprawling computer division of Siemens. In those days, people at the company said, Nixdorf executives were not sure exactly where their profits were coming from, since its sales, service and cash management were all handled by the parent company in Munich.
 It was a humbling turn of events for Nixdorf, which had once been Germany's most successful computer maker. Founded in 1952 by Heinz Nixdorf, the company was a pioneer in wiring offices with desktop terminals that were connected to remote databases. But in the mid-1980's, it lost its market to I.B.M. and other rivals after it failed to recognize the potential of personal computers.
 In 1986, Mr. Nixdorf died suddenly, leaving the company rudderless just as its business was evaporating. By the time Siemens took it over in 1990, Nixdorf was facing a real threat of failure. In the course of integrating its operations, its work force was cut to 12,000 from 26,000. 
 Mr. Stiller, who had been recruited by the founder in 1966, stuck with the company under Siemens ownership, overseeing Nixdorf's still-profitable business in A.T.M.'s and cash registers. But he and his colleagues chafed at the limitations that came with life in a conglomerate.
 ''If the head of Siemens France is successfully selling power plants or trains, he's not going to be that interested in selling A.T.M.'s,'' said Eckard Heidloff, Nixdorf's chief financial officer.
 Fortunately for Nixdorf, in the 1990's, Siemens began to spin off units it deemed extraneous. It held an auction for the company, which was won by Kohlberg Kravis and Goldman Sachs with a joint bid of about 250 million euros (now $322 million), plus the assumption of hundreds of millions more in debt and other obligations.
 Newly independent and renamed, Wincor Nixdorf set about building its own service organization, and expanding outside Germany. Mr. Stiller and his colleagues pledged to deliver annual profit increases of at least 28 percent over five years. And they invested their own money.
 The pressure from Kohlberg Kravis and Goldman was unrelenting, particularly since Wincor initially lost money with its expansion drive. 
 ''In the beginning, I was on the phone to these guys a couple of times a week,'' said Johannes P. Huth, the partner in charge of European investments for Kolhberg Kravis. ''As the business matured, I didn't bother them twice a week. Maybe I called them every two weeks.''
 Mr. Huth scrutinized every acquisition and questioned even basic assumptions, like whether Wincor ought to stay in the retail business, which includes cash registers, bottle recycling machines and other devices. ''We didn't say, 'You've got to get out,''' he recalled. ''We said, 'Let's understand this better.'''
 Wincor Nixdorf's management persuaded him to stick to its strategy -- largely, Mr. Stiller said, because the company never failed to meet its profit targets. Kohlberg Kravis and Goldman hoped to recoup their investment through an initial public offering, and by 2003, with a cash flow of 104 million euros on sales of 1.44 billion euros (now $1.86 billion), the company was clearly ready.
 The trouble, Mr. Stiller said, was that the German market was in the dumps. To compensate the investors for having to hold their stakes longer, Wincor Nixdorf paid them a special dividend of 160 million euros ($207 million). But four months later, the market picked up, and Wincor was able to list its shares successfully, netting Kohlberg Kravis and Goldman 260 million euros ($336 million).
 After the stock rose strongly, the two investors decided to sell their remaining shares in Wincor Nixdorf last January. That sale netted them a further 333 million euros ($431 million), bringing the total proceeds from the deal to $974 million -- or more than triple their original investment.
 These windfall profits have provoked criticism in Germany, particularly since the company itself received only about $130 million from the public offering. Mr. Heidloff, the chief financial officer, said Wincor Nixdorf had net debt of just $233 million, giving it enough financial muscle to bankroll its expansion.
 As for the rich returns, Kohlberg Kravis and Goldman say they are not so unusual for private equity deals. And they note that Wincor Nixdorf employees and shareholders have also benefited. ''We've generated an incredible number of new jobs through this deal,'' Mr. Huth said.
 Not all such deals create jobs, of course. Kohlberg Kravis's experience with the German telecommunications firm Tenovis may be more typical. It bought the company in 2000, pushed through deep job cuts and sold it to an American telephone equipment maker, Avaya, last fall.
 Executives at Kohlberg Kravis and Goldman declined to comment directly on Mr. Muntefering's accusations. But they are clearly stung. Kohlberg Kravis has invested more than eight billion euros in German deals, Mr. Huth said, while Goldman invested one-quarter of its last private equity fund, or $1.37 billion, here.
 ''This is self-defeating in a number of ways,'' said John C. Kornblum, a former American ambassador to Germany who now runs Lazard's office in Berlin. ''It's not likely,'' he said, to help the Social Democrats win the election, ''and it's going to make this swarm of locusts want to invest elsewhere.''
 Alexander Dibelius, a Goldman partner who runs its German operation, said the economic measures adopted by Chancellor Schroder have helped make the country an attractive place to invest. But the current tempest, he said, stirred memories of earlier times, particularly the 1970's, when anticapitalist sentiment made it tough to do business here.
 ''You've woken up ghosts you didn't want to see anymore,'' Mr. Dibelius said. ''The question is, Can you put them back to bed?''

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Job Cuts Will Hit Europe Especially Hard

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 5 

 BODY:
In the fierce global battle for jobs and capital, Western Europe just lost another round.
 I.B.M.'s announced cuts of 10,000 to 13,000 jobs will fall heaviest on Germany, France, Britain and Italy, where the costs are high and growth prospects have recently been dim.
 I.B.M. said Thursday that at least 60 percent of the cuts would be in its European operation. That division, which is based in Paris and also covers Africa and the Middle East, employs 100,000 people. 
 ''It is no secret that there has been an extended period of soft economic conditions in several European countries,'' Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts Thursday.
 Mr. Loughridge said that I.B.M. wanted to ''rebalance'' its investment from low-growth to high-growth areas. Western Europe, analysts said, was likely to lose out to the faster-growing economies of Central Europe, Asia and the United States, though I.B.M. noted that it would cut American jobs as well.
 The public reaction to I.B.M.'s announcement was muted here, partly because offices and stock markets were closed in France, Germany and other countries in observance of Ascension Day.
 But I.B.M.'s move, coming on the heels of other large jobs cuts by American and European corporations, is likely to deepen fears that Europe is losing its competitiveness as a place for business.
 Last fall, General Motors announced it would cut up to 12,000 jobs in its money-losing European operations, which include Opel and Saab. Deutsche Bank is pressing ahead with plans to cut 1,920 jobs in Germany, despite reporting better profits in the first quarter. 
 ''If Germany does not reinvent itself, multinational companies will readjust their investments, as some are already doing,'' said Frederick B. Irwin, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Frankfurt.
 The loss of jobs to Central Europe strikes a particular nerve here. I.B.M. is shutting several of its smaller sites in Germany and consolidating at service centers in Hungary and the Czech Republic, among other countries. These centers perform a variety of administrative and back-office tasks for customers.
 For France, the impact may be as much symbolic as economic. As part of the reorganization, I.B.M. is downgrading its European headquarters in Paris to a much smaller operation, and performing its operating responsibilities in a pair of new hubs in Zurich and Madrid. 
 With unemployment running at double-digit rates in France and Germany, I.B.M.'s announcement is also likely to ripple across the political landscape, according to pollsters and analysts.
 Both countries face important elections in coming weeks, with joblessness looming large as an issue. In France, President Jacques Chirac is fighting an uphill battle to win a referendum on the European Union's new constitution, while in Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder is trying to stave off a defeat of his Social Democratic Party in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
 The Social Democrats have seized on layoffs by big employers, notably Deutsche Bank, to shore up their blue-collar base there. The party's leaders have also appealed to antiforeign sentiment, using the word ''locusts'' to describe private equity investors who have taken over German companies.
 ''They can just add this one to their list,'' said Reinhard Schlinkert, the chairman of Dimap, a polling firm in Bonn.
 Last week, union members rallied in front of I.B.M.'s German headquarters in Stuttgart to protest a previously announced plan to shut two service operations, in Hanover and Schweinfurt, affecting 580 jobs. 
 In a call for members to gather, posted on the Internet, the unions warned that their jobs were in danger of being lost to lower-cost locations like Budapest, Bratislava and Slovakia, or Shenzhen in China.
 I.B.M., they said, was selling off chunks of its business, including the recent sale of its PC business to Lenovo of China. While the announcement of the cuts was timed to come after the sale to Lenovo had been completed, I.B.M. officials said that deal did not affect the size of the layoffs here.
 I.B.M. declined to break down the job reductions by country. But a spokesman said the 580 job cuts already announced in Germany would be included in the overall target. It will also include 538 jobs to be trimmed in Sweden, where I.B.M. announced it would close five service centers.
 Mr. Loughridge said he expected most of the cuts in Europe to be voluntary, and that I.B.M. had begun negotiations with workers' representatives. Laying people off in Europe can be a time-consuming and costly exercise. I.B.M. expects to record a pretax charge of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion in the second quarter to pay for the revamping, he said.
 But I.B.M. also expects to save up to $500 million in the second half of 2005 because of these cuts. ''There is no longer a need for a pan-European management layer,'' Mr. Loughridge said.

HEADLINE: Productivity and Labor Cost Both Increased in First Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5 

 BODY:
Growth in business productivity accelerated unexpectedly in the first quarter, but in a signal of slowly building price and profit pressures, labor costs also picked up, a government report showed on Thursday.
 Separately, the government said initial claims for unemployment benefits climbed to 333,000 last week, an increase of 11,000, slightly above expectations on Wall Street but consistent with expectations for rising employment.
 Financial markets largely ignored the data as traders waited for a report on job creation due on Friday, which was expected to show that payrolls rose 170,000 in April. The April job survey was taken before last week's unemployment claims. 
 Nonfarm business productivity, or output per worker hour, rose at a 2.6 percent annual pace in the January-to-March period after gaining 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter, the Labor Department said.
 But unit labor costs, which economists watch closely to gauge inflation pressures, moved ahead at a 2.2 percent pace, an acceleration from an upwardly revised 1.7 percent fourth-quarter advance.
 Economists had expected productivity growth to slow to a 1.9 percent pace, with unit labor costs accelerating to a 2 percent increase from the 1.3 percent gain initially reported for the fourth quarter.
 Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economics Advisors in Holland, Pa., said the report suggested just a slow bubbling up of inflation pressures.
 ''American businesses are doing surprisingly well in controlling their hiring and wages,'' he said. ''While we are seeing a slow, steady increase they are not surging.''
 A big first-quarter increase in hourly compensation lay behind the acceleration in unit labor costs, as hours worked rose only modestly.
 Productivity rose more than 4 percent in each of the last three years, but has slowed to a range more in keeping with historical experience as the economic expansion has matured.
 Productivity in the first quarter was 2.5 percent above its year-earlier level, the smallest year-on-year gain since the second quarter of 2001.
 Slower productivity growth implies stronger job creation, but also puts pressure on profits or prices -- or both -- as businesses find themselves facing increased labor costs.
 Economists said the separate Labor Department report on initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits suggested little change in the pace of layoffs and a reasonable increase in jobs.
 Initial claims dropped below 300,000 earlier last month, but economists dismissed that low level as a reflection of data volatility around the Easter holiday and school spring breaks.

HEADLINE: A Rising China

 BODY:
China's rapid economic growth and steady military modernization are transforming power relations across Asia. In recent weeks, Beijing has reached out to its old rival, New Delhi, courted Taiwanese opposition parties and fanned old grievances against Japan. This comes on top of the long-term deals that Chinese diplomats have been signing to give Beijing special access to the raw materials of Southeast Asia and Australia. 
 It's time for the United States to take more notice. America may still be Asia's dominant military power, but its economic role is receding as China advances. Unfortunately, Asian policy, long a stepchild for the Bush administration, has been further marginalized, thanks to the exit of the State Department's most respected Asia hands, Richard Armitage and Mitchell Reiss. Paul Wolfowitz's move to the World Bank leaves a similar void at the Pentagon. 
 By working out clear understandings with Beijing on regional issues today, Washington could help avoid unnecessary and highly destructive future conflicts. Here's what Washington should be focusing on right now:
 Japan -- For years, the United States has urged Tokyo to cast off its postwar pacifism and play a larger role in regional defense. Japan's current prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, is happy to oblige. But he has combined a more assertive military stance with an embrace of right-wing nationalism that offends and alarms the Asian nations that suffered wartime Japanese aggression and atrocities. His repeated visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo have been particularly provocative; the shrine is where top Japanese war criminals are among the honored and the country's Asian conquests are celebrated. 
 In this context, it was a mistake for Washington to encourage Japan recently to declare a security interest in matters concerning Taiwan, a former Japanese colony. Beijing seized on this declaration, along with Japan's bid for a permanent United Nations Security Council seat, as a pretext for permitting three weekends of anti-Japanese violence last month. Beijing achieved its purpose of throwing Tokyo onto the defensive, but is wrong to oppose Japan's Security Council bid and reckless to stir up past grievances. China and Japan, Asia's two biggest economic powers, need to work out a healthier relationship, and Washington should be actively looking for ways to help them. 
 Taiwan -- Beijing finally seems to be learning that honey works better than vinegar in winning over Taiwanese opinion. The warm welcome China gave last week to Taiwan's main opposition leader has now forced the island's independence-minded president, Chen Shui-bian, to send an emissary of his own. While Beijing's clear goal is to undermine Mr. Chen's party and help the opposition Nationalists, it has nevertheless set in motion a constructive dynamic that contrasts sharply with the negative response its menacing antisecession law elicited in March. The Bush administration should strongly support any initiative by either side that can help preserve an acceptable, if ambiguous, status quo. 
 India -- China's prime minister visited India last month and signed a series of agreements intended to increase bilateral trade and end a long-festering set of border disputes that once brought the two countries to war. An improved relationship between these rapidly developing countries, which are home to about 40 percent of the world's population, can only be welcomed. But it signals an enormous shift in the Asian power equation. 
 Washington must adjust to a rising China. The future peace and prosperity of Asia depend on it.

HEADLINE: Where Big Green Gets Big Greenery

BYLINE: By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
TO christen his two-acre property in Southampton, Gary Wexler wanted something grand for his front yard, something that bespoke sophistication, culture and permanence. After all, this was the social jungle of the Hamptons, where the carpetlike grass advertises a homeowner's cachet as much as the Hummer he drives and the caterers he hires.
 So Mr. Wexler, 64, a real estate developer from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, chose a fully grown copper beech valued at $50,000. ''We picked this tree to match the house,'' Mr. Wexler said, as he stood on the driveway at his property on the East End of Long Island a few Fridays ago, waiting for his lawn ornament to arrive.
 A little after daybreak, a flatbed trailer rolled in from New Jersey, along with a caravan of cranes and gardeners. The specimen stood 45 feet, weighed 20 tons and was about 70 years old. Mr. Wexler was immediately pleased by how the gnarled branches offset the crisp cedar shingles of his new, 7,000-square-foot house on Wickapogue Road. ''It makes the house look like it's been there for a while,'' he said. 
 In the Hamptons, where many people already have trophy wives and trophy houses, the trophy tree is becoming the latest must-have accouterment in the game of landscaping one-upmanship. Hedges that screen out prying eyes are being pushed to ridiculous heights, hothouse orchids are trotted outdoors, and the price tags for glamour gardens and mock nature preserves are topping $1 million. A garden-variety lawn is a faux pas worse than last year's Vuitton bag.
 ''It's landscaping as jewelry,'' said Steven Gaines, the author of ''Philistines at the Hedgerow: Passion and Property in the Hamptons'' (Little, Brown, 1998). ''You have a generation of incredibly wealthy baby boomers whose signature emotion is impatience, and the landscaping reflects that.''
 Or as Mike Scotto, the truck driver who transported the beech tree, put it: ''It's like putting a big diamond necklace on your pretty wife and showboating.''
 Lavishing on landscapes is hardly new to Long Island. The estates of the Astors, Vanderbilts and Whitneys, so reminiscent of the Gatsby era, bristled with manicured croquet lawns, tea gardens and rarified maples. The Hamptons, however, with a fertile mix of money, real estate envy and fishbowl paranoia, breeds landscaping pageantry. Where else would gardeners be required to sign a confidentiality agreement before putting on work gloves?
 And with only weeks to go before Memorial Day, the roads in and out of the Hamptons currently resemble a nursery parking lot. Armies of landscapers, gardeners and their flatbed trailers file in every morning in a sort of upper-crust Earth Day. ''Everyone is on edge worrying about whether the gardens will be done,'' said David Seeler, the owner of the Bayberry, a nursery in Amagansett. ''When this was a beach-house community, people wanted a little shade tree. But now we have this surge of $15 million homes. And very big houses require very big landscapes.''
 Cheryl Minikes, 60, who lives on Park Avenue in Manhattan, knows about landscape inflation. When she outgrew her two acres on Georgica Road in East Hampton, she added three more acres. But the resulting lawn was so big that she had to subdivide her garden into a dozen smaller ''rooms'': one for formal cocktails, one for informal gatherings and another just for children.
 The cost for all her magnolias, wisterias and hydrangeas? ''Oh god! It's probably millions,'' Ms. Minikes said. ''I don't know the answer, and I definitely don't want my husband to know.''
 Like fashion and art, landscaping is a costly hobby to sustain. ''If someone is looking to use their landscape to impress their friends, they can spend a lot of money,'' said Perry Guillot, a landscape architect based in Southampton. ''I had a client who flew over a nursery in his own plane to pick out a tree.''
 He might have to charter another flight. The purple-leafed Japanese maple may have been in vogue last season, but this summer, it's all about the deep-burgundy chocolate mimosa. ''That's supposed to be the long-awaited hot tree,'' said Kathleen Marder, an owner of Marders, a boutique nursery in Bridgehampton that has supplied exotic plants to Martha Stewart. Other trendy plants? A new hydrangea hybrid, Endless Summer; the native bayberry shrub; and anything tropical, Ms. Marder said. She picked up a book called, ''Hot Plants for Cool Climates,'' and listed several tropical varieties she plans to carry: burgundy banana plants, burgundy phormiums and assorted cannas.
 Whether the warm-weather foliage can survive the Hamptons climate is beside the point. After Labor Day ''they get tossed out,'' Ms. Marder said, in an offhand tone that suggested yet another trend: disposable gardens.
 AFFLUENT Hamptonites, however, have long preferred checkbook gardening over hands-on mulching anyway. ''We get clients who buy $20,000 worth of annuals every spring,'' said Jim Kiley, the maintenance manager at Whitmore's, a large landscaping company in Amagansett. That doesn't include the price of upkeep; after all, people here don't water their own flowers. ''A three-acre property costs about $40,000 a year to maintain.''
 Luckily for those on a tighter budget, the most coveted plant is also the humblest: the common privet hedge. ''Originally, people screened to block the wind,'' said Elizabeth Lear, a landscape architect from Southampton. ''Now they want to screen out their neighbors.''
 Privet is so overused that some hedge-lined streets look more like labyrinths than neighborhoods. In Water Mill, the column of privets along Rose Hill Road stands 20 feet, as if triple-decker buses were an issue. In Southampton, the entire length of Gin Lane is a wall of hedges as opaque as a highway sound barrier.
 Landscape architects joke that the Hamptons is the privet capital of the world. Mr. Guillot has even written a book, ''Privet Lives: An Imaginary Tale of Southampton's Iconic Shrub'' (powerHouse Books, 2004), that satirizes the Hamptons in a series of fanciful hedge drawings: a lawn dotted with pill-shaped privets, a hedge cropped like a bouffant. But there is no shortage of real-life entries.
 Carroll Petrie, a New York philanthropist, has been known locally for the 400-foot-long trapezoidal hedge at the the corner of Gin Lane and Little Plain Road, a property with serious curb appeal. It looks as geometric and architectural as a Richard Serra sculpture. ''We used laser levels to shape it,'' said Charles Bellows, her longtime landscaper. ''People are always taking pictures of it.'' (Mrs. Petrie sold the property this week.) 
 Hedges, however, have their limits. As the Hamptons are subdivided into smaller and denser lots, homeowners are discovering that privet only grows to about 25 feet before its shallow roots buckle. To extend its height, a few have started using duckbill cables from party tents, which keep the hedges from tipping.
 While those extra feet may thwart neighbors from peering into your pool, that won't prevent the neighbors' Garage Mahal from rising above the hedges. For those landscaping emergencies, Edmund Hollander, a landscape architect based in Manhattan, likes to hem his hedgerows with a tightly packed skirt of Leyland cypresses. The hardy evergreens can grow 60 feet and taller. ''They give you another layer of privacy,'' said Mr. Hollander, who designed the Hamptons gardens of Peter Jennings, Alan Alda and many Fortune 100 executives. For extra camouflage, he also advises his clients to snap up adjoining properties as they become available. Why take the chance that P. Diddy will move in and start holding his famous parties?
 But rappers or not, entertaining is what these gardens are designed for. Just make sure they're ready for guests. ''We were laying down the sod while the caterers were setting up,'' Mr. Seeler, the nursery owner, recalled of a Bastille Day party several years ago in East Hampton. Such last-minute installations are becoming the norm. ''The trend today is for instant gardens,'' he said. ''The first question clients ask me is, 'When will it be done?' Then they go away to Europe, and when they return, they come out and entertain.''
 But even in the Hamptons, there are those who resist the trends. Take Christopher Browne, 58, a managing director of the Tweedy, Browne Company, a New York investment firm. He has been landscaping his 18 oceanfront acres in East Hampton for three years, and he's less than half done. A recent drive-by revealed a pond, an apple orchard, a grove of specimen trees, but no house -- he won't be breaking ground until 2007. ''You do a landscape the same way an artist does a painting,'' Mr. Browne explained. ''I like to feel that it reflects me, that I put more into it than just writing checks.''

PERSON: Peter S. Kalikow

HEADLINE: A Mass Transit Chief Who Runs With the Ferraris

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
BIG mistake to assume that the beach towel-size map spread on a table in Peter S. Kalikow's Midtown office is a state-of-the-art chart of New York City's subway, bus and rail systems. Or, to put it in the lingo of Mr. Kalikow, a master of overstatement and the occasional grand, ungainly gesture -- like buying The New York Post for $35 million in 1988 and filing for bankruptcy protection three years and $200 wasted millions later -- it would be a mega-mistake to assume the obvious. He's not that obvious.
 Just because Mr. Kalikow, who grudgingly admits to being 62, is the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority does not mean he spends every waking hour thinking about the deployment of No. 4 trains (his favorite line, as it goes to Yankee Stadium) or the saga of the West Side railyard/stadium after a fraught bidding process he recaps with a smattering of mild expletives. 
 ''Usually when I do a real estate deal I get paid for it,'' grumbles Mr. Kalikow, popping a miniature Tootsie Roll in his mouth as an alternative to the tobacco habit he thinks he's outgrown (unlike an addiction to Ferraris, which he hasn't). He made and later inherited millions via the family real estate business, H.J. Kalikow & Company, built over six decades by his grandfather and father and consolidated in recent years to this flagship building at 101 Park Avenue and 10 less consequential properties. 
 ''I'm no longer active in real estate development,'' he says, ''but I still do deals.'' Clearly. The much-scrutinized deal he and his board made with the New York Jets and by extension, City Hall, will put $250 million in the transportation authority's coffers, and yield a westward spike of the No. 7 subway line with $2 billion in city funds pledged by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, if the proposed stadium wins final approval. 
 Mr. Kalikow is not a Jets fan. ''And I'm not a Giants fan, either,'' he says. ''But I always thought the stadium was a good idea; however, it was not a good idea for free, which is what they were offering for the property the first time they came around. It's a problem solved.'' 
 So is the $16 billion designated for the M.T.A.'s core operations in the budget pitched by Mr. Kalikow's pal, George E. Pataki, the governor who appointed him M.T.A. chairman in 2001 and whom he has championed since they met in Mr. Pataki's Mayor-of-Peekskill phase. No sweat that Mr. Kalikow wanted $17.2 billion: ''When a guy gives you 93 percent of what you asked for, you can't be mad at him,'' he says. ''The core is looking real good.'' 
 Not so the outlook for expansion: ''This is the area that makes my ears turn red,'' says Mr. Kalikow, whose lobbying for state and federal money has come up several billions short despite his ''you're dead without mass transit'' message. Growing up in Queens, he rode a city bus to junior high and took the subway to high school, and into Manhattan. It is not lost on him that his family made its fortune building on transportation hubs. 
 ''I understand not only how mass transit works because I rode it, but I know transit is an economic issue, a growth issue, a business issue,'' he says. Riders should be less steamed about fare increases and more steamed about politicians' reluctance to bankroll capital improvements. ''I mean, would you buy a car with bald tires? I'll take the abuse I've got to take on this stuff. I know I'm right.''
 Mr. Kalikow backs the sentiment with a plaque that reads: ''Be reasonable, do it my way.'' His other plaque, ''If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' seems less appropriate, given that he presides over ''a great system that is a hundred years old; we still have the 1900 technology.''
 Last week the M.T.A. board voted to scale back its capital plan for 2005-2009, including ''mega-projects'' like the Second Avenue subway, the link between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central Terminal, and the rail link from downtown to Kennedy Airport. Mr. Kalikow says they will happen, just not soon. He predicts a Second Avenue subway by 2012, and the Long Island link by 2013. He is cavalier about a projected deficit of $400 million by 2008. ''We'll fix that by then,'' he says. His term expires in 2006. 
 He is confident that he can cajole more money from Albany and Washington: ''People in Washington think I'm some kind of nut: here's a Republican asking for mass transit money. It doesn't quite fit the mold.'' 
 BUT first, he's taking a break.
 The gigantic map spread out in his office is of Italy, where Mr. Kalikow is about to go on vacation. At 28, he moved there to open a factory. The product was cars, his first love. He built a dozen Momo Miracles, named for the Italian designer Alfred Momo, and still owns four. Plus Ferraris and BMW's. When the Miracle startup stalled after a few years, he moved home and joined the family firm, which he inherited in 1987; he and his wife live on Fifth Avenue opposite the Metropolitan Museum and have two children. 
 He bought The Post on impulse: ''I had a fixation I could make it work, but I couldn't. It was murder.'' He sold the paper in 1993, but the American flag from its lobby decorates his office here.
 ''I liberated it,'' he says. 
 He swiped it? ''Come on, I paid for it 300,000 times over.''

HEADLINE: Ferrer Gets Endorsement, And the Mayor Gets Criticism

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD and DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Fernando Ferrer, a Democratic candidate for mayor, was endorsed by a cross section of Brooklyn politicians yesterday, while another candidate, C. Virginia Fields, assailed the mayor and the governor over the delays in rebuilding at ground zero.
 The endorsement of Mr. Ferrer, from a multiracial group that represents neighborhoods as disparate as Crown Heights, Park Slope and Bensonhurst, was intended to show that he can appeal to a broad cross section of New Yorkers. 
 The officials said they were supporting Mr. Ferrer because of his advocacy of lower-cost housing and for improving the lot of middle class New Yorkers and even for a controversial plan to raise money for schools by imposing a tax on stock transfers. Critics have said such a tax would burden Wall Street firms and lead to job losses.
 The Ferrer supporters included State Senator Kevin Parker, who was charged with misdemeanor assault earlier this year, after the police said he punched a traffic agent in the face as she wrote a ticket for his double-parked car. 
 ''As you know, I know about fighting, and nobody's going to fight more for this city than Freddy Ferrer,'' Mr. Parker said, smiling broadly.
 Meanwhile, Ms. Fields, the Manhattan borough president, made her most extensive remarks about the increasingly troubled rebuilding plans at the site of the former World Trade Center.
 ''It is certainly mind-boggling to me that security is affecting the design so late in the development process, and that is why I call this a colossal failure and I believe that is a mild description of what has just happened,'' Ms. Fields said at a news conference at her office.
 She said Mr. Bloomberg had ''ceded control over downtown redevelopment to George Pataki in return for gaining control over development of the West Side railyards and a stadium for the Jets.'' Part of the problem, she asserted, was the lack of elected officials, including herself, on the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation board, which was appointed by the mayor and governor.
 The Bloomberg campaign denied that Mr. Bloomberg had turned away from downtown and released a statement in response that said he had ''gone out of his way to keep politics and politicking away from ground zero, and it is unfortunate that the candidates for mayor are not following this example.''
 They also had the chairman of the Republican Party in Manhattan, James Ortenzio, assert that Ms. Fields had not been prominent in advocating rebuilding at the trade center site, leaving it up to representatives to make her concerns known.
 Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman for the governor, said, ''It's sad that naysaying opportunists have forgotten that we need to work together to rebuild Lower Manhattan.''
 Ms. Fields said she had not consulted with Mr. Bloomberg or Mr. Pataki on the progress of the rebuilding but assumed the people directing the project would have kept security concerns paramount. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 13, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article last Friday about an endorsement of Fernando Ferrer for New York mayor given by a group of Brooklyn politicians, including State Senator Kevin Parker, misstated the sex of a traffic agent Mr. Parker is accused of having punched in the face for writing him a ticket. The agent is a man, Joseph San Filippo.

HEADLINE: CREDIT RANKINGS OF G.M. AND FORD ARE CUT TO JUNK

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Mary Williams Walsh contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 5 

 BODY:
General Motors and Ford Motor lost their investment grade ratings Thursday, pushing two of corporate America's biggest borrowers into the ranks of junk bonds and rattling the financial markets with the message that the collective fortunes of the remaining two domestically owned automakers have sunk to their lowest points yet.
 The downgrading by Standard & Poor's, the credit agency, reflects the inability of G.M. and Ford to make enough cars that people will buy without $5,000 rebates and other sales incentives, as well as worries that the two automakers may not emerge anytime soon from their troubles, starting with eroding earnings and sliding sales. 
 S.&P. said it was especially concerned about declining sales of the large sport utility vehicles that Ford and G.M. have depended on for profit, particularly as Japanese automakers step up their interest in the pickup truck market. 
 The downgrading reduces the number of ways the automakers can raise money and could make it more expensive for them to borrow. But for now they are likely to use other ways of financing operations besides issuing bonds. It also suggests, according to some financial experts, that the companies' pension funds pose a greater risk of failure at some point than generally acknowledged. 
 But both companies have large enough stashes of cash at least for the short term, and other companies, including Chrysler (now part of DaimlerChrysler), have previously been downgraded to junk bond status only to stage comebacks. G.M. and Ford join several other aged blue- chip warhorses that S.&P. has cut to junk this year, including Eastman Kodak, Maytag and Sears, Roebuck.
 Borrowing in junk bond status, as big heavily indebted start-ups in risky fields like telecommunications often successfully have, requires paying interest rates of 7 to 8 percentage points, sometimes more, above the rate of safe government bonds. 
 Still, the move is not expected to harm the companies' abilities to offer bargain leases and low-interest loans to auto buyers.
 On the New York Stock Exchange, G.M. shares fell $1.94, to $30.86. Ford shares fell 46 cents, to $9.70. 
 The shares of G.M., in some ways, were spared a potentially worse fate, as S.&P.'s move came a day after Kirk Kerkorian, the financier, declared an offer to spend $868 million to raise his stake in G.M. to nearly 9 percent of the company. 
 A spokeswoman at Tracinda, Mr. Kerkorian's investment firm, said Thursday that it ''remains committed to making the cash tender offer for G.M. common shares it announced yesterday.''
 Alone, either G.M. or Ford would have been the largest corporate debt issuer ever cut to junk bond status by one of the three major debt ratings firms. Together, the two companies have more then $450 billion in debt. Both have been increasing their reliance on alternatives to issuing bonds and are expected to continue to do so. 
 The events of the last two days underscore that G.M.'s current management has become increasingly vulnerable as the company's market value plummets. 
 S.&P. also said that rising gas prices put the companies even more at risk and cited a number of other concerns, from soaring health care costs -- particularly for G.M., the nation's largest private provider of medical benefits -- to Ford's close relationship with its former parts unit Visteon, which might require an infusion of capital from Ford. 
 The agency was also concerned that sales at G.M. and Ford are falling even as the nation's auto sales are relatively robust, with competitors like Toyota, Nissan and Hyundai continuing to post strong sales.
 ''S.U.V.'s and pickups together are the segments where G.M. and Ford have the clearest competitive advantages, and we just don't feel that is something that can be relied upon going forward,'' said Scott Sprinzen, S.&P.'s auto analyst, during a conference call Thursday with professional investors and the news media. 
 A primary concern is that G.M. and Ford have not been prescient enough in diversifying their automotive operations beyond sales of big sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in the United States. Sales of many brand name S.U.V.'s, including the Chevrolet Suburban and the Ford Explorer, are down more than 20 percent this year, as consumers shift to more fuel-efficient sport utilities. 
 Toyota and other foreign competitors have come to dominate the passenger car market while G.M. and Ford have been forced to sell many of their cars at less than favorable terms to rental car companies, business fleets or to their own employees and their friends and families. 
 Now, Toyota and other companies are bringing their better reputations for quality and reliability to the S.U.V. and pickup truck market. 
 In an e-mail message Thursday, Ford's chairman and chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., told employees about the downgrading and said S.&P.'s rationale ''suggested pretty deep pessimism about the U.S. auto industry's ability to successfully counter increasing competitive challenges.''
 ''I won't speak for others,'' Mr. Ford wrote, ''but when it comes to Ford, we don't share anyone's pessimism. And, it is our job to prove our critics wrong.''
 He added that he believed that S.&P. had not given his company enough credit for its new products and had ''discounted'' Ford's cash reserves and ability to raise more. 
 Mr. Sprinzen at S.&P. was particularly bleak in his assessment of G.M., cutting the company by two notches, to BB, and also putting it on a negative outlook. This suggested that the rating agency might further downgrade the company.
 ''To downgrade two notches and put it on a negative outlook is a huge move,'' said Craig Hutson, an analyst at Gimme Credit, a research firm. 
 Ford was downgraded one notch, to BB+, and also put on a negative outlook. ''Ford, we believe, is less burdened by the retiree health care issue to a significant extent, and looking at recent quarters, in terms of either cash flow or earnings, Ford has done considerably better than General Motors,'' Mr. Sprinzen said. 
 Last month, G.M. reported a $1.1 billion loss in the first quarter, its largest quarterly loss in more than a decade. And the company has also said it is so uncertain of the future that it is no longer able to provide an earnings projection for the full year.
 By contrast, while Ford has sharply cut its earnings outlook for the year, it reported a $1.2 billion profit in the first quarter and is still projecting a profit for the year. 
 The downgrading will also have broad implications for the bond markets; not only will the junk bond market be flooded with new debt, but many large bond investors may be forced by their investment guidelines to reassess their G.M. and Ford holdings. 
 The pension plans of the automakers are also a source of concern because of their immense size. 
 General Motors has by far the biggest company pension plan in the United States, having promised to pay benefits worth $89 billion to its current and future retirees as of the end of 2004. Until now, G.M. has been setting aside money to make good on those promises, keeping its pension plans compliant with the law. 
 But if it lost its ability to generate enough cash to do that, and had to default on its pension obligations, the cost could overwhelm the agency that insures pensions, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
 The Bush administration has been trying to reduce that risk of a possible bailout with proposals that would tighten the way companies handle their pension funds. The package would impose tough standards on companies whose credit ratings fall below investment grade. 
 Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman for G.M., said, ''We're disappointed with the decision.''
 Most analysts do not think G.M. and Ford are at risk of bankruptcy in the near future. But their wariness increased in March when G.M. reversed projections and said it would have an outflow of $2 billion in cash, rather than generate that amount. It has since backed away from that projection and has not offered another. 
 G.M.'s cash cushion of roughly $20 billion ''does afford the company a lot of flexibility,'' Mr. Sprinzen said. ''But this is a business where large players can go through a lot of cash in a short period, too, as General Motors has demonstrated recently.''
 Solomon Samson, S.&P.'s chief rating officer, cited two ways G.M. and Ford could improve their fortunes. First, he said the companies would be in better shape if they could win concessions from the United Automobile Workers on health care benefits, particularly for retirees. Union leaders, however, said recently that they would not be open to talking about significant changes in benefits before the next round of contract negotiations in 2007. 
 The other strategy would be more fundamental: make more cars and trucks people want to buy, he said. 
 ''If one of these companies managed to hit a lot of triples and home runs, that would have the potential to stabilize things,'' he said. ''Obviously, we're not banking on either of those.''

HEADLINE: Department Stores Led the Gains in Retail Sales Last Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The J.C. Penney Company and Nordstrom led the sales gains at the nation's retailers last month, while discounters like Wal-Mart Stores trailed, hurt by soaring gasoline prices. 
 According to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index, April sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.2 percent, compared with 4 percent in April 2004. Analysts had estimated an April increase of 2 percent. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, posted a 0.9 percent increase. 
 J.C. Penney and Federated Department Stores said that first-quarter profit was higher than they expected as spring fashions lifted sales. The 12.5 percent gain at the Neiman Marcus Group, which agreed to be bought this week, was the best result among luxury chains. Easter's arrival in March this year hurt April sales, many retailers said. 
 ''You have a lot of unevenness in April,'' said Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. ''But if you factor in 1.5 percentage points for the Easter shift, the underlying demand is not as bad as it seems. The consumer is still a driver for economic growth despite the worries about high gasoline prices.'' 
 Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Talbots and the Costco Wholesale Corporation posted sales above analysts' estimates. J.C. Penney, the No.2 department store chain, said that its sales gained 3.6 percent, helped by demand for home and women's accessories and shoes. 
 Penney said that first-quarter earnings rose to about 61 cents a share. It lifted its second-quarter earnings forecast to 25 cents to 30 cents a share. 
 Federated, the retailer that has agreed to buy the May Department Stores Company, said that its sales gained 2.8 percent. It said first-quarter earnings would rise to 65 cents to 70 cents a share, as much as 20 cents above its previous forecast. 
 Nordstrom had a 6.9 percent sales gain. 
 Sales at Neiman, which agreed to be bought this week, bounced up from a 1.6 percent increase in March, and came in at more than double analysts' estimates. Saks posted a 0.3 percent gain. A 5.4 percent decline at the regional chains it is selling dragged down a 7.1 percent gain at its Saks Fifth Avenue luxury chain. 
 The Kohl's Corporation posted an 8 percent gain, with sales strongest in accessories and men's wear, the company said in a recorded call. 
 Costco, the nation's biggest warehouse-club chain, recorded an 11 percent gain in sales. Among its best-selling categories were food, home furnishings and jewelry. 
 Wal-Mart said that sales would rise 2 percent to 4 percent in May. The retailer, which is adding more supermarkets to its stores, said that food, rather than general merchandise, led the sales gains in all but one week last month. 
 Target had a 1.3 percent gain and said the earlier Easter shaved 2.8 percent off its April sales. Target expects a 3 percent to 5 percent gain in same-store sales in May.

HEADLINE: Fixated on Stadium? Mayor Says No, but His Letters Differ

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been pilloried by critics who say his relentless push for a Jets stadium on the West Side of Manhattan has distracted him from other important projects, like the troubled rebuilding efforts at the World Trade Center site. 
 Political opponents have called him obsessed. Even some supporters have been perplexed by what they call his single-mindedness. For his part, Mr. Bloomberg says that he and his staff are not overly focused on the stadium and the broader West Side redevelopment plan. 
 So how much time do he and his senior aides actually spend on the project?
 Letters he and others have recently written to the city's Conflicts of Interest Board address the question directly: ''It is far and away the most important land use initiative of my administration,'' Mr. Bloomberg wrote in January. ''As such, planning for the project occupies a substantial amount of my time and discussions with numerous high-level members of my administration.''
 Calling the project ''the most important redevelopment project undertaken by the city in recent times,'' the mayor listed the officials with whom he spends substantial time talking about it. They include two deputy mayors, his budget director, the planning commissioner, the president of the Economic Development Corporation and the city's chief lawyer, Michael A. Cardozo.
 The letters are surfacing at a time when criticism of the administration's West Side focus is taking on a new resonance: critics say that it led the Bloomberg team to lose sight of problems at ground zero that have led to a decision to redesign its iconic central building, the Freedom Tower. City Hall calls the accusations unfounded and unfair. 
 The letters were included in an ultimately successful plea by the administration to the Conflicts of Interest Board, asking that it allow Mr. Cardozo to continue working on stadium issues despite having formerly headed the legal unit that has represented the owners of the Jets.
 Even before the letters were written, some developers and public officials had been complaining that the administration's work on the stadium plan had come at the detriment of many other projects.
 In rebutting accusations that they are overly focused on the stadium, Mr. Bloomberg and Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, point to large-scale development plans under way citywide to which, they say, stadium-obsessed news media give relatively scant coverage. Among the plans they cite are a major redevelopment of the Bronx Terminal Market; the redevelopment plan for Williamsburg and Greenpoint in Brooklyn; the Sept. 11 memorial downtown; and the rebuilding of several streets near ground zero.
 ''We are working on many, many things simultaneously,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a press briefing on Wednesday, after a reporter asked about criticism that he was too focused on the West Side. ''Those things go on at the same time, and no one project gets in the way of the other -- multitasking, I guess, would be the term.''
 Mr. Doctoroff said in an interview on Wednesday that the stadium issue itself took about 10 percent of his time, and if that seemed to be a lot, it was because he often works 100-hour weeks.
 ''I think this notion that we're too busy somehow to focus on Lower Manhattan is unfounded,'' he said. Referring to the stadium, he said, ''I spend a relatively small percentage of my time on it; the mayor spends a tiny percentage of his time on it.''
 He said that several other downtown projects, like a new PATH station, are moving along but that it is the state that controls much of the overall rebuilding of downtown. 
 Mr. Doctoroff conceded that his work trying to lure the 2012 Summer Games to the city kept him traveling but said his staff and other economic development officials are plenty capable in his stead.
 However, some development executives with business before the city complained that while that was true, there were times they needed help from Mr. Doctoroff himself and had a hard time getting his attention. The executives spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering a man who has the power to stall their projects.
 ''We're just having trouble getting the support we think we deserve,'' said one developer whose planned commercial project is stalled in a community battle. ''We've given to the Olympics, we support the stadium. But the stadium, in particular, has diverted attention from important projects like ours.''
 Another developer, who works on nonprofit projects, said of Mr. Doctoroff, ''He's very hard to get a hold of if the project doesn't involve nine figures.''
 Edward Skyler, the City Hall communications director, dismissed such complaints, saying: ''It doesn't take much for anonymous sources to throw cheap shots. It's an easy sound bite to attack the mayor on the West Side, but the fact is that he's engaged all over the city and has a record to prove it.''
 He added, ''Just because the press is at it on a day-to-day basis doesn't mean that it picks up any more time of the mayor's than it should.''
 Still, even some defenders of the mayor say that Mr. Bloomberg may bear some responsibility for the news coverage of the issue. ''If you look at the mayor's record substantively, it is unfair to suggest that the administration is simply concentrating on the stadium,'' said Fran Reiter, a lobbyist who was a deputy mayor under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
 However, Ms. Reiter said, ''They have done a less good job at communicating their own accomplishments, so that when you weigh that against all of the media attention and political attention paid to the stadium, it appears as if that's their only project.''
 Jeremy Soffin, the spokesman for the Regional Plan Association, a group that has frequently criticized the mayor's development plans, conceded that Mr. Bloomberg can point to solid accomplishments outside of the stadium but said that that was not the issue.
 ''It's not that nothing else is happening in the city,'' he said. ''When he and the deputy mayor really focus on something, they have a tremendous ability to get things done. And if they put that kind of effort into Lower Manhattan, the ball would start to move.''

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Says 'Forces' Keep Inflation Low

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
A revival of the 30-year Treasury bond would be unlikely to raise long-term bond yields because forces worldwide are keeping inflation low, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said yesterday. 
 The yield on 10-year Treasury notes has fallen to about 4.15 percent, from 4.68 percent last June, when the Fed began raising interest rates. 
 In Europe, where the central bank has left the benchmark rate unchanged at 2 percent since June 2003, yields on Germany's 10-year benchmark bond fell to a record low of 3.36 percent on Wednesday. 
 ''It is clearly a phenomenon which not only exists in the U.S. but pretty much around the world: that is, low real long-term interest rates,'' Mr. Greenspan said after a speech on derivatives to the Chicago Fed's bank structure conference. ''Real'' interest rates are market rates minus inflation. 
 ''What we are observing is an underlying set of pressures which is a major factor causing disinflationary forces worldwide in the past decade,'' he said. 
 Mr. Greenspan did not elaborate on the ''forces'' and ''pressures'' during his remarks. In a speech in March, he focused on two of them: globalization and innovation.

HEADLINE: Facing Surplus, Mayor Plans to Spread It Around

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE; Jim Rutenberg and Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
New York City will end the fiscal year with a record $3.3 billion surplus fueled in part by taxes from a superheated real estate market. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed an election-year budget yesterday that would spread that wealth around by cutting taxes and spending millions more on reducing class sizes, increasing garbage pickups and other measures sure to please voters.
 The surging revenues from taxes on real estate sales and refinancing of mortgages, expected to top $2 billion this year, helped the mayor propose a budget that for the first time approached $50 billion.
 Saying the city ''can afford a little bit of relaxation'' from the more stringent spending plans he has put forward since taking office in 2002, Mr. Bloomberg moved to steal some thunder from his political rivals. He proposed a property tax rebate for a second straight year, and tax reductions for clothing purchases, small businesses and improvements to apartment buildings. 
 Fiscal analysts and some Democratic mayoral candidates noted the size of the budget plan -- $49.7 billion for the 2006 fiscal year that begins on July 1, a 6 percent increase over last year's proposal. And they suggested that Mr. Bloomberg should use more of the tax windfall to close deficits, which are projected to be $4.5 billion in 2007 and $4.2 billion in 2008. 
 The mayor, however, insisted he is continuing to be fiscally prudent by cutting spending at most agencies, making conservative forecasts of tax revenues and using surplus money to cover rising costs over which the city has little control, including employee pensions, Medicaid and interest on the city's debt.
 He justified his plan for $500 million in tax cuts next year as an obligation to ''try to make the burden of living in this city tolerable,'' and he credited the tighter budgets of recent years, coupled with an improving economy, for making his proposals possible.
 ''Last year I said 'cautious optimism,''' Mr. Bloomberg said at a City Hall news conference. ''We have a reason to have a grin on our face. A big smile, maybe not, but a grin on your face, because we have made the tough decisions, and in retrospect I think it's fair to say that we made the right decisions.''
 But he acknowledged that he did not know what the city would do to address the looming deficits. His own long-range financial plan shows the boom in real estate taxes dropping off precipitously after this year, while mandatory costs continue to rise, creating the future deficits. Critics were quick to suggest that his assertion of fiscal stability was illusory.
 ''If you can grin while looking ahead a year to a situation where your budget gap is something like 8 percent of your revenues, I guess you're pretty optimistic,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, an analyst at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group. ''It's troubling to see how big the out-year gaps have grown.''
 Elizabeth Lynam, deputy director of research for the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed policy group, called Mr. Bloomberg's budget ''a one-year party.''
 She added, ''The party's going to come to an end quickly.'' She also said the proposal includes the highest level of spending of surplus money in a single year on record.
 The budget blueprint released yesterday represents the mayor's final proposal, which now goes to the City Council for review, and it includes revisions to spending and revenue projections put forth in his preliminary financial plan in January. The Council and the mayor must now negotiate a formal budget agreement and adopt it before the end of the fiscal year in June, a fractious process that may be even more so this year, considering that the Council's speaker, Gifford Miller, is also running for mayor.
 In announcing the budget, Mr. Bloomberg revealed that a recent actuarial review found that the municipal retirement system had not properly accounted for 1,000 teachers and revised some other assumptions, forcing the city to set aside $862 million next year to cover the newly discovered pension liabilities.
 The mayor's tax proposals include the immediate elimination of a 4 percent city sales tax on purchases of clothing and footwear costing less than $110, something that would require approval by the State Legislature. An additional state sales tax of a little more than 4 percent would remain in effect.
 Also, he proposes to reduce the unincorporated business tax, as well as the tax assessment imposed on the cost of improvements and repairs to apartment buildings that have 4 to 10 units. In addition, he plans to issue another $400 property tax rebate to homeowners, with the checks showing up close to the election.
 On the spending side, Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican who is up for re-election in November, moved to outflank his Democratic opponents by adding money to a number of programs that some of them have long championed. He would add $50 million for smaller class sizes, programs for gifted and talented students and other education initiatives; $13 million for more frequent trash collections; $15 million for summer jobs and after-school programs; $7 million for libraries; and $17 million for meals and other services for the elderly.
 ''He's not leaving Miller or anybody else much room,'' said Doug Turetsky, a spokesman for the city's Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan fiscal monitor.
 Mr. Miller called a press conference to claim some of the mayor's ideas as his own.
 ''I think the mayor has clearly come half of the way towards the Council's priorities and the vision that we laid out last month for a better budget for our city,'' said Mr. Miller, who went on to criticize Mr. Bloomberg for not proposing more help for mass transit, H.I.V./AIDS programs and infant mortality prevention.
 Another Democratic candidate, Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, noted that the $49.7 billion proposal set a ''new high-water mark in this city,'' and yet included no money to address the billions that a court concluded needs to be spent on city schools. The Bloomberg administration contends that the state should foot the bill.
 Mr. Bloomberg rejected suggestions that his budget plan was tailored to help his re-election campaign, and he asserted that the city was simply reaping the benefits of improved tax revenues and his administration's fiscal prudence.
 ''If it comes in an election year, that's great,'' he said. ''I hope we have it next year, and the year after, and the year after that. And if we stay the course, it will.''

HEADLINE: Bringing Back the 30-Year Bond

 BODY:
On Halloween 2001, the United States Treasury said it would no longer issue a 30-year bond. The federal budget had been in the black for four years, and President Bush was still riding high on the $237 billion surplus he had inherited from the Clinton administration. ''We do not need the 30-year bond to meet the government's current financing needs, nor those we expect to face in coming years,'' said the administration official who announced its demise. 
 Oh, for the good old days. Since 2002, annual deficits have added nearly $1 trillion to the nation's debt, bringing it to $4.3 trillion last year, nearly double what budget experts were projecting back in 2001. Yet the Treasury says that the nation's ballooning indebtedness is not a factor in its recent decision to consider reissuing the 30-year bond. Not a factor?
 In the real world, reviving the 30-year bond would mean acknowledging that the nation's growing debt burden will eventually cause long-term interest rates to rise. Right now, however, those rates are abnormally low. So reverting to the 30-year bond would lock in low rates on future government borrowing. That would be a good thing for taxpayers, whose taxes go to pay the bonds' interest. But coming out and saying so would expose one of the administration's biggest failings: it has created the conditions for higher interest rates by squandering the Clinton-era surpluses and piling on debt. Locking in low rates with a 30-year bond is clever, but it is no substitute for cutting the deficit and reducing the national debt, something the powers-that-be have no credible plan for doing.
 A move to bring back the bond also flags the danger of America's immense borrowing from abroad. Without a 30-year bond, the average maturity of the debt held by foreigners has been falling -- to 54 months this year from 60 months in 2003. Such short maturities -- together with a depreciating dollar -- make financial markets fearful that in the near term, foreign lenders may choose to invest in other currencies' assets when their dollar-based debt matures, forcing the United States to raise rates, perhaps sharply, to attract the loans it needs. The 30-year bond would alleviate some of that anxiety. But again, it's no substitute for curbing the borrowing itself. 
 There is nothing objectionable, per se, about the 30-year bond. But if the nation were on a path to paying off its debt and accumulating assets for the future, as it was in the years before the Bush binge, there would be little need for it now.

HEADLINE: 2 Witnesses Say They Shared Jackson's Bed and Were Never Abused

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: SANTA MARIA, Calif., May 5 

 BODY:
Two young men who said they shared a bed many times with Michael Jackson when they were boys said emphatically on Thursday that he had never molested them or touched them inappropriately.
 The two appeared as the defense's first witnesses after Judge Rodney S. Melville of Santa Barbara Superior Court curtly denied a defense motion to dismiss all charges after more than two hours of arguments. The prosecution rested its case on Wednesday.
 One witness, Wade J. Robson, 22, a dancer, choreographer and filmmaker, said he was 5 when he met Mr. Jackson when he came through Mr. Robson's hometown, Brisbane, Australia, on tour. Two years later, he was a guest at Mr. Jackson's Neverland ranch near here for the first of what Mr. Robson said were more than 20 overnight visits. He said he shared a bed with Mr. Jackson on numerous occasions from ages 7 through 14, at Neverland, at two apartments Mr. Jackson has in Los Angeles and at hotels in Las Vegas and Los Angeles. 
 A former maid at Neverland testified during the prosecution's presentation that she had seen Mr. Jackson groping Mr. Robson -- who was then a boy -- in the shower at the ranch. She received a settlement from Mr. Jackson in the early 1990's after accusing him of molesting her son.
 Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., Mr. Jackson's lead lawyer, asked Mr. Robson if Mr. Jackson had ever molested him.
 ''Absolutely not,'' Mr. Robson replied. He also denied strongly that Mr. Jackson had ever touched him in any sexual way. He said he had never been in a shower with Mr. Jackson.
 The second witness, Brett Barnes, 23, who described himself as an unemployed roulette dealer from Melbourne, Australia, said he was a lifelong fan of Mr. Jackson who also met him during his tour of Australia in 1987. Mr. Barnes said he first visited Neverland in 1991 at Mr. Jackson's invitation and returned at least 10 times. He said he shared a bed with Mr. Jackson ''countless times.''
 Mr. Mesereau asked him if Mr. Jackson had ever molested him or touched him sexually in any way.
 ''Absolutely not,'' Mr. Barnes replied. ''If he had, I wouldn't be here right now.''
 He added, ''I wouldn't stand for it.''
 Ronald J. Zonen, a senior deputy district attorney, questioned Mr. Robson's account.
 Mr. Robson replied, ''I'm telling you, nothing ever happened.''
 Mr. Zonen said, ''You're saying nothing ever happened when you were awake.'' 
 Mr. Robson said, ''I think something like that would wake me up.''
 The accuser in the current case, who was 13 at the time of the alleged abuse, testified that he drank heavily while at Neverland, and Mr. Jackson has been charged with plying him with liquor in order to molest him.
 Mr. Zonen showed Mr. Barnes pornographic magazines and several books depicting homosexual acts seized from Mr. Jackson's home and asked if he would be comfortable sharing a bed with a man who kept such material in his house.
 ''If it was a man I didn't know, maybe,'' Mr. Barnes said. ''But not Michael.''
 He says that he believes Mr. Jackson is heterosexual and that he has no reason to believe Mr. Jackson has a sexual interest in young boys.
 Much of the court day was devoted to the argument over the defense's motion to dismiss the 10 felony charges against Mr. Jackson. The singer is charged with five counts of child molesting or attempted child molesting, four counts of giving alcohol to a minor for purposes of molesting and one count of conspiracy to commit child abduction, false imprisonment and extortion.
 Robert M. Sanger, one of Mr. Jackson's lawyers, said the prosecution's case should be thrown out because the entire premise is ''inherently improbable and not credible.'' He said the state had failed utterly to prove that a conspiracy existed, let alone that Mr. Jackson directed it or was even aware of it.
 Mr. Sanger also said the case was tainted by repeated and willful false testimony by a number of prosecution witnesses, including the accuser, his mother and a record producer who supposedly witnessed a number of the acts charged under the conspiracy count.
 Mr. Sanger also argued that testimony about alleged sexual misconduct by Mr. Jackson in the early 1990's -- with Thursday's two witnesses, among others -- was suspect because many of the witnesses had either sued Mr. Jackson unsuccessfully or sold their stories to the tabloids. He said there was a danger that the jury might be swayed by this testimony to believe that Mr. Jackson was a pedophile and therefore not apply a strong enough burden of proof to the current charges.
 Thomas W. Sneddon Jr., the Santa Barbara district attorney, said he was not required to prove that Mr. Jackson directed the conspiracy or even that the crimes the co-conspirators intended to commit took place.
 ''We haven't alleged that he's the mastermind,'' Mr. Sneddon said. ''All he needs is to share in the goal of the conspiracy.''
 He also said the accuser's testimony was consistent and credible.
 ''This jury ought to be given the opportunity to decide for itself the credibility of these witnesses,'' Mr. Sneddon argued.
 The judge agreed and denied the defense motion without comment.

HEADLINE: U.S. CITES SIGNS OF KOREAN STEPS TO NUCLEAR TEST

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD; Thom Shanker contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5 

 BODY:
White House and Pentagon officials are closely monitoring a recent stream of satellite photographs of North Korea that appear to show rapid, extensive preparations for a nuclear weapons test, including the construction of a reviewing stand, presumably for dignitaries, according to American and foreign officials who have been briefed on the imagery.
 North Korea has never tested a nuclear weapon. 
 Bush administration officials, when asked Thursday about the burst of activity at a suspected test site in the northeastern part of the country, cautioned that satellites could not divine the intentions of Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader, and said it was possible that he was putting on a show for American spy satellites. They said the North Koreans might be trying to put pressure on President Bush to offer a improved package of economic and diplomatic incentives to the desperately poor country in exchange for curtailing its nuclear activities.
 ''The North Koreans have learned how to use irrationality as a bargaining tool,'' a senior American official said Thursday evening. ''We can't tell what they are doing.'' 
 Nonetheless, American officials have been sufficiently alarmed that they have extensively briefed their Japanese and South Korean allies and warned them to be prepared for the political implications of a test. 
 On Thursday morning, Mr. Bush spoke at length about North Korea with President Hu Jintao of China, who has been his main interlocutor to Mr. Kim's government. The White House refused to say whether the two men had discussed the new evidence, focusing instead on what officials said was Mr. Bush's determination to get North Korea back to the negotiating table in six-nation talks. 
 American intelligence agencies have debated for years over the extent of North Korea's technical abilities, and whether it has successfully turned its stockpile of nuclear fuel into warheads. That debate has become particularly fevered since Feb. 10, when the North publicly boasted that it had manufactured weapons.
 The accounts of North Korea's activities have come from three American officials who have reviewed either the imagery or the intelligence reports interpreting them. They were confirmed by two foreign officials who have been briefed by the Americans, but who cautioned that their countries had no independent way of interpreting the data.
 Officials at one American intelligence agency said they were unaware of the new activity.
 Since October, American officials have periodically seen activity suggesting preparations for a nuclear test, chiefly at the site in the northeast part of the country, near an area variously called Kilchu or Kilju. But in recent weeks, that activity appears to have accelerated. 
 Several officials said they had never before seen Korean preparations as advanced as those detected in recent days, including the digging of a tunnel. That tunnel resembles the one used in Pakistan for nuclear tests in 1998. 
 One of the creators of Pakistan's program, Abdul Qadeer Khan, traveled to North Korea repeatedly and has admitted to Pakistani interrogators that he supplied nuclear technology to the North, American intelligence officials said.
 But officials said Thursday that they had not seen any evidence that North Korea was getting outside help with its current activity. ''What we're seeing is everything you need to test,'' said a senior intelligence official who has reviewed the evidence. ''We've never seen this level of activity.''
 Asked if the intelligence agencies, which have often been sharply divided about North Korea's nuclear abilities, had differences of opinion about the satellite photographs, the official said: '' This looks like the real thing. There is wide agreement in the community.''
 But another American intelligence expert noted that so far, intelligence agencies had not seen the telltale signs of electronic equipment that is often used to monitor the size and success of a test, leading to ''some debate about whether this is the real deal.''
 The intelligence official who reviewed the imagery, and others familiar with the evidence, said it was entirely possible that the activity was an elaborate ruse by Mr. Kim, to strengthen his bargaining position with the five other nations in the talks that he has boycotted: the United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea.
 Mr. Kim is considered skilled at the art of escalating a crisis, and a senior diplomat said Thursday that the United States had not raised a public alarm ''because we don't want to play his game.''
 In late 2002 and early 2003, North Korea threw out international inspectors and said it was preparing to reprocess 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods into bomb fuel, the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies have told Congress. In recent months, they have said that they believe all 8,000 rods were turned into bomb fuel.
 The head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Vice Adm. Lowell E. Jacoby, went further last week, telling the Senate Armed Services Committee that North Korea was believed to have the ''capability'' to mount a warhead on one of its long-range missiles.
 Particular interest and concern was aroused in the White House by the construction of the reviewing stand, which appears luxurious by North Korean standards, several miles from the suspected test site.
 An American official who confirmed that the images showed the reviewing stand recalled that in 1998, after Western intelligence was surprised by a North Korean missile launching, analysts went back over satellite imagery and other data to see if they had missed anything.
 ''What was interesting is they had built a reviewing stand for that launch, but that wasn't noticed,'' he said. ''They had visitors from other countries in. We had seen movement, but we didn't know what for. The idea was that they invited other people to watch this other thing.''
 While satellite imagery is often hard to interpret, nuclear arms experts say it is easy to distinguish tunneling for a nuclear test site from, say, a mine. While both require the removal of vast quantities of rock, only a test site puts the rock and other sealing materials back into the hole after the weapon is installed deeply inside. The goal is to create a impenetrable barrier that keeps the powerful blast and radioactivity locked up tight inside the earth.
 In this case, a senior intelligence official who specializes in nuclear analysis and has seen the images said, ''you see them stemming the tunnel, taking material back into the mine to plug it up.''
 ''There's grout and concrete that goes into the hole, and normally you don't see that in a mine. A mine you want as open as possible.''
 ''There's a lot of activity,'' he added, ''taking stuff in as opposed to taking it out.''
 He described the site as isolated and rugged, with enough of a mountain extending above the hole to contain a weapon equal in force to the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
 Beyond the technical debate over North Korea's nuclear abilities and what kind of help it got from Dr. Khan's network and other suppliers over the years, the United States government has also debated whether Mr. Kim would determine a test to be in his interest.
 Many in the intelligence agencies, along with outside experts, long assumed that Mr. Kim benefited by keeping the world guessing. The absence of a test proving North Korea's weapons ability has allowed China, North Korea's major supplier of food and fuel, to argue that the country may simply be boasting, that there was still time to work out the problem, and that sanctions or quarantines of the country would only drive it into a corner.
 But that thinking has begun to shift. A senior European diplomat deeply involved in the issue said this week that he suspected that North Korea was ''now pursuing the Pakistani model.''
 Pakistan and India were both condemned and subjected to economic sanctions after their 1998 tests. But all of those were lifted after the United States determined it needed Pakistan's help immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 
 ''The North Koreans may be thinking that in two or three years, it too may be regarded as just another nuclear power, outside of the Nonproliferation Treaty, the way we now view Pakistan and India and Israel,'' the official said.

HEADLINE: Bush Administration Rolls Back Rule on Building Forest Roads

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5 

 BODY:
The Bush administration on Thursday supplanted a Clinton-era rule banning road construction in nearly 60 million acres of national forest with a complex prescription for state-by state decisions on which areas should retain protections. 
 The new rule gives governors a primary role in making recommendations. If the governors choose not to take the opportunity in the next 18 months, the Forest Service may begin an analysis of whether and where activities requiring roads, like logging and mining, would be appropriate. The final decision on the status of all 56.5 million acres once protected as roadless will rest with the federal government. 
 ''Our approach will protect roadless values,'' Mark Rey, the under secretary of agriculture in charge of the Forest Service, said in a conference call on Thursday. ''It's my prediction that many of the state rules will protect the same areas as the 2001 forest rule.'' 
 Before the earlier rule was adopted as President Bill Clinton was leaving office in January 2001, federal rules set aside about 24 million acres, prohibiting road development there. These remain protected. But as a result of Thursday's decision, about 32 million acres are now potentially subject to development pressure. 
 Existing administration policies require the approval of the Forest Service chief, Dale Bosworth, before roads can be built in any roadless area. These policies will remain in force, Mr. Rey said. 
 Mr. Rey said that by giving a prominent role to governors, the new rule will ensure that decisions are built around local conditions and reflect significant political consensus. This, he said, will reduce the likelihood that the rule will be a magnet for litigation, as its predecessor was. 
 Jim Angell, a lawyer for the environmental law group Earthjustice, scoffed at this idea, saying his group would soon challenge the new rule in the federal courts. For leading environmental groups like the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club and Trout Unlimited, the new rule -- which they variously characterized as emasculated, Kafkaesque and a sham -- is an unwelcome turning point in a decades-old battle over areas of the national forests where industry has, for the most part, not yet left a footprint.
 Spokesmen for such environmental groups and for possible Democratic presidential contenders, including Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, denounced the decision as a giveaway to industry that flouted the public will. Watersheds and wildlife habitats are now at risk, they said.
 Mr. Richardson, in a conference call organized by the National Environmental Trust, a nonprofit Washington lobbying group, argued that the rule was part of ''a wholesale assault by the administration to drill more oil or gas, to open up more roadless areas for timber'' and weaken environmental regulations. He added, ''I believe this is going to galvanize many Western states against this pro-development attitude at all costs.''
 Chris West, a vice president of the American Forest Resource Council, which is based in Oregon and represents 80 mostly Northwestern forest-product manufacturers and landowners, emphasized the benefits of collaboration in the new process. 
 ''Despite the environmental rhetoric, chain saws, bulldozers and drilling rigs are not gassing up to enter roadless areas,'' Mr. West said in a telephone interview. ''But the public ought to be gearing up to participate in a process to manage and protect these important lands,'' particularly from catastrophic wildfires. Decisions, he said, will now ''be based on the conditions on the ground.''
 The decision does not affect the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, where roadless protections had already been removed, but where there have been few bidders for newly available timber.
 To the extent that the situation in the Tongass forest reflects in fundamental shifts in the economics of the timber industry, it may be a harbinger of what can be expected in the lower 48 states. A growing percentage of wood products are now imported; Mr. West put the current level at about 30 percent. In addition, the tree farms of the Southeast are providing an increasing share of building materials.

Jobs Report Indicates Strength in Economy
Overriding earlier evidence that suggested the economy was slowing significantly, job creation and income growth appear to be holding up their end of the recovery.
 The government reported that the nation's employers generated an unexpectedly large number of jobs in April, even as they gave their existing employees additional hours of work. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said that the surge in job creation showed that ''President Bush's jobs and growth agenda has again produced results for Americans.'' [Page A1.]

Antipiracy Legislation Struck Down
A federal appeals court handed a setback to Hollywood and the television networks when it struck down an antipiracy regulation that required computer and television makers to use new technology that would make it difficult for consumers to copy and distribute digital programs. [A1.]

Insurers Say Proposal Is Unfair
Representatives of several insurance companies that are active in the military marketplace complained that proposed Pentagon rules governing on-base insurance sales are unfair to them and tilted in favor of on-base banks and credit unions. [C2.]

G.E. to Restate 3 Years of Income
General Electric said it would restate income for the last three years because of technical violations of rules for accounting for gains and losses in derivatives contracts. [C10.]

Costly Defense of Weapons Labs
The cost to protect materials for nuclear bombs from terrorists is rising so high that the Energy Department will need to close some weapons laboratories, or at least consolidate the weapons fuel that they hold, government officials and outside experts said. [A11.]

HEADLINE: In Appalachia, Stalking the Wild Ginseng Gets Tougher

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: FAIRMONT, W.Va. 

 BODY:
Alan Lockwood hefts his ginseng hoe from beside the fireplace of his mountain home and demonstrates how he edges the blade beneath a root and gently lifts it to the surface.
 He is making a smaller version of his favorite hoe, with a haft of ash and a tip the size of a matchbook, for his 5-year-old grandson. But Mr. Lockwood, 51, a ginseng hunter and dealer, is not sure what there will be for the boy to harvest. 
 The data about wild ginseng, a protected species, is sketchy. But much is sure. The deer eat the leaves, a problem quantified in a recent study. Wild turkeys eat the seeds. Timber companies and suburban developments take over the land and cut the trees that provide shade for it to grow. People across Appalachia harvest the wild root.
 The best ginseng roots -- those with the elongated neck of a Giacometti sculpture, a few twisting rootlets at the bottom and the general aspect of a wizened gnome -- can sell for more than $100 apiece. Run-of-the-mill roots go for $300 or more a pound in the booming Asian market. In China, wild ginseng is prized as a source of focus, vitality and well-being. In Appalachia, from the time of the 18th-century frontiersman Daniel Boone, it has been a prized source of income.
 Some ginseng hunters and dealers, known as wildcrafters or 'sangers by the mountain people, fret that the diminishing supply may curtail their ancient practice -- and perhaps the economic benefits that it brought to many impoverished areas.
 Cultivated versions of the root are abundant but lack the economic or backwoods appeal. Mr. Lockwood says that if ginseng root is no longer gathered by heads-down foraging miles into the maples, it is not really wild ginseng. ''I don't want to have a Disney World show where you go and dig ginseng and mushrooms,'' he said. 
 Circumstances are not promising. From the biology department of nearby West Virginia University to state agriculture researchers in Quicksand, Ky., and beyond into North Carolina and Pennsylvania, there are indications of a slow but steady decline in the wild ginseng harvest, though the extent and causes are matters of dispute.
 American ginseng, a plant whose flat pinwheels of five leaves each inspired its Latin name, Panax quinquefolius, has been listed on the second appendix of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species since 1973, meaning that the federal Fish and Wildlife Service designates states as responsible for monitoring the harvest and the export of the wild root. 
 Those wildcrafters who will discuss their work, a small subset of the reclusive group, tell varying stories about its abundance or paucity. Some see no problem, said Brian P. Jeffiers, the Johnson County agricultural agent in Paintsville, Ky.
 Others see a real issue. ''For years it's been going down,'' said Crate McCarty, 65, a school bus driver in Paintsville. ''One year back a long time ago, I dug about 15 pounds. Every year since, it's going down. Last year it was five pounds, the year before seven. It's getting harder and harder to find.''
 The current price is low by the standards of recent years. In the late 1990's, it was known to fetch close to $500 a pound. States keep records of the harvest, as reported by dealers and wildcrafters, though the suspicion of government apparent on the eastern slopes of the Appalachians suggests that the data is incomplete.
 The Kentucky harvest of wild ginseng root is the largest in the country. The volume exported by the state has fluctuated widely, but the harvests in even the good years have gradually declined since 1996.
 R. Terry Jones, a state horticulturist based in the lush mine-pocked woodlands of eastern Kentucky, and his colleague Jo Wolf found that over 19 years, 21 percent of the ginseng plots in their original survey group had disappeared. 
 Some people see overzealous 'sangers as the biggest problem. States ''made rules and no one enforced them,'' Mr. Jones said, referring to state harvest seasons from mid-August until late fall, created to comply with federal requirements. 
 A declining ginseng harvest would ripple through the local economy. ''The forests are a social safety net in Appalachia,'' said Brent Bailey, a research assistant professor of biology at West Virginia University, whose doctoral thesis found a strong positive correlation between ginseng harvests and the state unemployment rate. ''Ginseng is Plan B for many households,'' he said in an interview in his office.
 A few doors down in the university's biology department, James B. McGraw and Mary Ann Furedi have surveyed the impact of deer. They have collected five years' worth of data on 36 plots of ginseng in eight states. The seven local plots they survey intensively are checked in springtime, before the distinctive red berries have matured. Their work showed that anywhere from 10 percent to 100 percent of the plants in these plots were browsed by deer every year. The roots tended to survive one or two leafless seasons, but struggled thereafter.
 ''Current deer population densities in central Appalachia jeopardize the future of ginseng, as well as the culture of harvest and trade surrounding this important herb,'' Mr. McGraw and Ms. Furedi wrote in an article in Science magazine in February. 
 Walking in the woods a few miles from their Morgantown campus, the two pointed out a patch of perhaps seven ginseng plants, three with two or three leaf clusters, the rest small seedlings with just one. There was no evidence of deer browsing, but the plants were less than two weeks old, and some ferns nearby did show the marks of grazing. 
 ''I'm getting calls from Georgia and Virginia saying they have seen the same thing,'' Mr. McGraw said of his findings on the deer's impact. 
 The root is not likely to disappear suddenly, he said. ''Our models suggest it will be a gradual petering out.''
 Syl Yunker, who replants seeds in the Kentucky woods, creating what is known as wild simulated ginseng, says that wild turkeys, whose population is also exploding in eastern woodlands, are a bigger worry. ''Their craw breaks down the seed,'' Mr. Yunker said. ''When they pass it through, there's nothing there.'' The seed has been destroyed.

DATELINE: LUBECK, Germany 

 BODY:
TOMORROW, it will be 60 years to the day since the German Reich's unconditional surrender. That is equivalent to a working life with a pension to look forward to. It goes so far back that memory, that wide-meshed sieve, is in danger of forgetting it.
 Sixty years ago, after being wounded in the chaotic retreat in Lausitz, I lay in a hospital with a flesh wound in my right thigh and a bean-sized shell splinter in my right shoulder. The hospital was in Marienbad, a military hospital town that had been occupied by American soldiers a few days earlier, at the same time as Soviet forces were occupying the neighboring town of Karlsbad. In Marienbad, on May 8, I was a naive 17-year-old who had believed in the ultimate victory right to the end. Those who had survived the mass murder in the German concentration camps could regard themselves as liberated, although they were in no physical condition to enjoy their freedom. But for me it was not the hour of liberation; rather, I was beset by the empty feeling of humiliation following total defeat. 
 When May 8 comes round again and is celebrated in complacent official speeches as liberation day, this can only be in hindsight, especially as we Germans did little if anything for our liberation. In the initial postwar years our lives were determined by hunger and cold, the misery of refugees, the displaced and bombed-out. In all four zones occupied by the wartime allies -- Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States -- the only way to manage the ever increasing crush of the more than 12 million Germans who had fled from, or been driven out of, East and West Prussia, Pomerania, Silesia and the Sudetenland, was to force them into our own cramped living rooms. 
 Whenever the question is posed, ''What can we Germans be proud of?'', the first thing we should mention is this essential achievement -- even though it was forced on us. We had hardly become used to freedom when compulsion had to be applied. As a result, in both German states, huge long-term camps for refugees and displaced persons were avoided. The risk of building up feelings of hate was thereby diverted, as was the desire for revenge engendered by years of camp life, which, as today's world shows, can result in terrorism and counterterrorism. 
 Even then there were spokesmen for the rhetoric of liberation. So many self-appointed anti-fascists suddenly set the tone, so much so that one was entitled to ask: how had Hitler been able to make headway against such strong resistance? Dirty linen was quickly washed clean, with people being absolved of all responsibility. Counterfeiters were busy coining new expressions and putting them into circulation. ''Unconditional surrender'' was changed to ''collapse.'' Although in business, law and in the rapidly re-emerging schools and universities, even the diplomatic service, many former National Socialists maintained their hereditary wealth, stayed in office, continued to hold onto their university chairs and eventually continued their careers in politics, it was claimed that we were starting from ''zero hour'' or square one. 
 A particularly infamous distortion of facts can be seen even today in speeches and publications, with the crimes perpetrated by Germans described as ''misdeeds perpetrated in the name of the German people.'' In addition, language was used in two different ways to herald the future division of the country. In the Soviet-occupied zone, the Red Army had liberated Germany from the fascist terror all by itself; in the Western occupied zones, the honor of having freed not only Germany but the whole of Europe from Nazi domination was shared exclusively by the Americans, the British and the French.
 In the cold war that quickly followed, German states that had existed since 1949 consistently fell to one or other power bloc, whereupon the governments of both national entities sought to present themselves as model pupils of their respective dominating powers. Forty years later, during the glasnost period, it was in fact the Soviet Union that broke up the Democratic Republic, which had by that point become a burden. The Federal Republic's almost unconditional subservience to the United States was broken for the first time when the Social Democratic-Green ruling coalition decided to make use of the freedom given to us in sovereign terms 60 years ago, by refusing to allow German soldiers to participate in the Iraq war. 
 THE question today, then, is have we dealt carefully with the freedom that we did not win, but was given to us? Have the citizens of West Germany properly compensated the citizens of the former Democratic Republic, who, after all, had to bear the main burden of the war begun and lost by all Germans? And a further question: is our parliamentary democracy still sufficiently sovereign as a guarantor of freedom of action to act on the problems facing us in the 21st century? 
 Fifteen years after signing the treaty on unification, we can no longer conceal that despite the financial achievements, German unity has essentially been a failure. Petty calculation prevented the government of the time from submitting to the citizens of both states a new constitution relevant to the endeavors of Germany as a whole. It is therefore hardly surprising that people in the former East Germany should regard themselves as second-class Germans. 
 The jobless rate is twice as high as in the former West Germany. West German arrogance had no respect for people with East German resumes. The mass migration, feared from the beginning, is happening now, daily. Whole areas of the country, its cities and its villages, are being emptied. After the Treuhandanstalt, the entity responsible for privatizing East Germany, had completed its bargain sales, West German industry and banks withheld the necessary investment and loans and, consequently, no jobs were created. Here, fine exhortations have been of little use. To right this skewed situation, only Parliament, the lawmakers, can help. Which brings us back to the question of whether parliamentary democracy is able to act. 
 Now, I believe that our freely elected members of Parliament are no longer free to decide. The customary party pressures are not particularly present in Germany; it is, rather, the ring of lobbyists with their multifarious interests that constricts and influences the Federal Parliament and its democratically elected members, placing them under pressure and forcing them into disharmony, even when framing and deciding the content of laws. Consequently, Parliament is no longer sovereign in its decisions. It is steered by the banks and multinational corporations -- which are not subject to any democratic control. 
 What's needed is a democratic desire to protect Parliament against the pressures of the lobbyists by making it inviolable. But are our parliamentarians still sufficiently free to make a decision that would bring radical democratic constraint? Or is our freedom now no more than a stock market profit? 
 We all are witnesses to the fact that production is being demolished worldwide, that so-called hostile and friendly takeovers are destroying thousands of jobs, that the mere announcement of measures like the dismissal of workers and employees makes share prices rise, and this is regarded unthinkingly as the price to be paid for ''living in freedom.''
 The consequences of this development disguised as globalization are clearly coming to light and can be read from the statistics. With the consistently high number of jobless, which in Germany has now reached five million, and the equally constant refusal of industry to create jobs, despite demonstrably higher earnings, especially from exports, the hope of full employment has evaporated.
 Older employees, who still had years of work left in them, are pushed into early retirement. Young people are denied the skills for entering the world of work. Even worse, with complaints that an aging population is a threat and simultaneous demands, repeated parrot-fashion, to do more for young people and education, the Federal Republic -- still a rich country -- is permitting, to a shameful extent, the growth of what is called ''child poverty.'' 
 All this is now accepted as if divinely ordained, accompanied at most by the customary national grumbles. Worse, those who point to this state of affairs and to the people forced into social oblivion are at best ridiculed by slick young journalists as ''social romantics,'' but usually vilified as ''do-gooders.'' Questions about the reasons for the growing gap between rich and poor are dismissed as ''the politics of envy.'' The desire for justice is ridiculed as utopian. The concept of ''solidarity'' is relegated to the dictionary's list of foreign words. 
 THOUGH we initially did not know what to do with our freedom when we were given it 60 years ago, we gradually made use of this gift. We learned democracy and in doing so proved star pupils, because after all we were incontrovertibly German. With the benefit of hindsight, what was crammed into us through lectures was enough to get us a reasonable end-of-term report. We learned the interplay between government and opposition, whereupon long periods of government ultimately proved arid. The much lauded and reviled generation of '68 produced a different kind of political leaders and ultimately also tolerance. We had to acknowledge that our burdens could not be cast aside, they are passed by parents to children and that our German past, however much we travel and export, comes back to haunt us. Neo-Nazis repeatedly brought us into disrepute. Even so, we felt that democracy was here to stay. 
 It had to withstand several challenges. After the debris had been cleared and disposed of in both German states, reconstruction in the East proceeded under the constraints of the Stalinist system; but in the West, it took place under favorable conditions. What retrospectively is called the ''economic miracle'' was not, however, the result of any individual achievement but was won by many. Included in that number are displaced persons and refugees, those who had in fact to start at square one in terms of material possessions. We must not forget the contribution of foreign workers, initially politely called ''guest workers.'' In the rebuilding phase businessmen were exemplary in investing every penny of profit into job creation. The trade unions and businesses were clearly aware of the decay of the Weimar Republic, so they were forced to compromise and ensure social equality. 
 With so much toil and profit-chasing, however, the past was in danger of being forgotten. Only in the 60's did we meet the second challenge, when writers and then the student protest movement began to ask questions about everything that the war generation would sooner forget. The protest movement strove for revolution but was paid off with reform; without it, we would still be living in the claustrophobic fog of the postwar years under Adenauer. 
 The third challenge arose when the Berlin Wall fell. The two German states had existed for four decades more against than beside each other. As there was no willingness on the Western side to offer equal rights to the East, the unity of the country has so far existed only on paper. It was all done too hastily and without an understanding of what far-reaching consequences this haste would have. 
 Since then, the expanded country has stagnated. Neither the Kohl government nor the Schroder government succeeded in correcting the initial errors. Lately, perhaps too late, we have come to recognize that the threat to the state, or what should be regarded as Public Enemy No. 1, comes not from right-wing radicalism but rather, from the impotence of politics, which leaves citizens exposed and unprotected from the dictates of the economy. What is being destroyed, then, is not the state, which survives, but democracy.
 When the German Reich unconditionally surrendered 60 years ago, a system of power and terror was thereby defeated. This system, which had caused fear throughout Europe for 12 years, still casts its shadow today. We Germans have repeatedly faced up to this inherited shame and have been forced to do so if we hesitated. The memory of the suffering that we caused others and ourselves has been kept alive through the generations. Compared with other nations which have to live with shame acquired elsewhere -- I'm thinking of Japan, Turkey, the former European colonial powers -- we have not shaken off the burden of our past. It will remain part of our history as a challenge. 
 We can only hope we will be able to cope with today's risk of a new totalitarianism, backed as it is by the world's last remaining ideology. As conscious democrats, we should freely resist the power of capital, which sees mankind as nothing more than something which consumes and produces. Those who treat their donated freedom as a stock market profit have failed to understand what May 8 teaches us every year.

HEADLINE: Security Costs Could Shut Some A-Bomb Labs, Experts Warn

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6 

 BODY:
The cost to protect materials for nuclear bombs from terrorists is rising so high that the Energy Department will need to close some weapons laboratories, or at least consolidate the weapons fuel that they hold, government officials and outside experts are warning.
 Security costs threaten to eat into the budget for building and maintaining warheads, the experts say.
 After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the department re-examined potential threats to the 13 laboratories and other plants across the country where it has what it calls ''special nuclear materials,'' or plutonium and bomb-grade uranium. The department theorized that attackers might not try to steal the material, but rather fabricate a nuclear bomb on the spot and detonate it. 
 The reassessments, which included assumptions of a larger attacking force than previously, have led to sharply increased security costs, now $740million a year and highly likely to rise. The underlying problem, critics say, is that a complex that was set up for the cold war, when the pace of design and manufacture was quick, is not suited to current needs. 
 The Project on Government Oversight, a group here that has made a specialty of making critiques of nuclear security, estimated in a study it will release next week that consolidating the weapons materials could save $2.7billion over three years. 
 But, Danielle Brian, executive director of the project, said, ''No one so far has looked at the entire complex, and said, 'Why do we still need this?''' 
 In a major speech on laboratory security on May 7, 2004, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said, ''We have a responsibility to balance the important work we do at our facilities, which is often critical to the war on terror, with protecting those very same facilities against the threat of terrorist acts.'' 
 Mr. Abraham said the number of sites with special nuclear material had to be reduced ''to the absolute minimum, consistent with carrying out our missions.''
 The speech does not appear to have produced any changes, but it did result in a study by a panel of advisers to the energy secretary, who is now Samuel W. Bodman. A report is supposed to be finished next month. 
 Tightening the security rules is making the problem acute. According to Ms. Brian's group, the new estimate of the number of possible attackers is triple the size of the old one. The estimate is classified, and department officials and others would not discuss it.
 Department officials disputed the estimate of how much money could be saved by consolidating weapons material, but were quick to acknowledge that changes were needed.
 ''The weapons complex itself is clearly not what we would design if we were starting from a blank sheet of paper right now,'' said Linton F. Brooks, under secretary for nuclear security and administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the part of the Energy Department in charge of the laboratories. 
 In an interview last month, Mr. Brooks said some laboratories were hard to defend.
 ''In the Second World War, the threat was spies,'' Mr. Brooks said of one of his laboratories, Y-12, near Oak Ridge, Tenn., which has an enormous stock of weapons-grade uranium. ''So you went to a remote valley and you had a pretty good control point to make sure which people went in. If the threat has become a quasimilitary attack force, no sane person would put something in a valley.''
 According to Ms. Brian's group, another site with problems is the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which was built in a rural area of California that has become a dense suburban neighborhood. 
 A study in 1995 by the Energy Department said the special nuclear materials could be transferred out of Lawrence Livermore by 2000. In a new report, Ms. Brian's group estimated that moving out the material would save $60million to $70million for equipment required by the new security assessment, and $315million in coming years in savings on labor.
 While Mr. Brooks disputed many of the specifics in the report from Ms. Brian's organization, he said it was ''a thoughtful group.'' 
 In the last few years, just one United States nuclear site has been ''de-inventoried,'' an area of the Hanford nuclear reservation near Richland, Wash., where plutonium was processed for weapons. Thirteen other sites, including laboratories and a factory for submarine fuel, remain, even though the system produces hardly any new weapons.
 The laboratories all have a strong support by members of Congress who represent adjacent areas, because, like military bases, they are a strong economic stimulus. 
 For example, at a hearing in 2004 on security at Livermore, Representative Ellen O. Tauscher, a California Democrat whose district includes the laboratory, said it would be ''smarter to consolidate materials'' to make protection easier. For Livermore to do its work, Ms. Tauscher said, it has to have plutonium.
 A House aide who specializes in the laboratories and insisted on anonymity because of political sensitivity, said: ''You've had the beginnings of consolidation. But the complex hit stasis, where people didn't want to lose their material because they saw it as a source of their mission. If they lost the material, the next question is, Why do we have these researchers here?''

Nuclear Lab Missing 269 Computers
 IDAHO FALLS, Idaho, May 6 (AP) -- A nuclear research center, the Idaho National Laboratory, cannot account for 269 missing computers and disk drives that may have held sensitive information, the inspector general of the Energy Department says. The computers were among 998 items that cost $2.2 million and that came up missing over the last three years, a new report says.
 Laboratory officials told investigators that none of the computers and disk drives had been authorized to process classified information. But they acknowledged that there was a possibility the devices had ''export controlled'' information about nuclear technologies applicable to civilian and military use that federal laws prohibit being released to foreigners.

HEADLINE: Lender's Shutdown Upheld

 BODY:
A New York State appellate court has upheld a lower court ruling that closed a high-cost-loan operation marketing to military families near Fort Drum in upstate New York.
 The business, N.Y. Catalog Sales, had portrayed itself as a legitimate business that sold gift certificates for catalog merchandise and allowed its customers to write and cash checks for more than the amount of their purchases.
 But the office of the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, sued the business last fall, asserting that the cashed checks were actually ''payday'' loans, short-term cash advances with annual interest rates as high as 900 percent, far exceeding limits set by New York's usury laws.

HEADLINE: From 17 Housing Workers, $8,500 to Mayor's Campaign in Newark

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 6 

 BODY:
Seventeen employees of the city's housing authority, including its executive director, chief accountant and head of redevelopment, have donated $8,500 to Mayor Sharpe James's campaign for re-election this year, underscoring the continuing close relationship between the five-term mayor and the authority at a time when it has been under intense scrutiny.
 Since 2002, the 17 workers have donated a total of $22,765 to the mayor's campaign committee. During that time, the authority was using federal housing money to pave the way for a hockey arena in the city's downtown, one of the mayor's top priorities. That spending was sharply criticized in a federal audit last month. 
 The latest contributions -- all for $500 each since Jan. 1 -- were released this week by the state's Election Law Enforcement Commission.
 The audit by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development found widespread mismanagement at the authority, which provides low-income housing for roughly 32,000 residents. The findings led the federal agency to seek the repayment of $6.4 million in what it described as ''misspent'' funds. 
 The largest questionable expense, the audit showed, was the $3.9 million purchase of property in the city's downtown near the site for a proposed hockey arena that the mayor has pushed for since the 1990's. Michael Liu, assistant secretary for public and Indian housing, said the money should have been used for Section 8, the federal rent assistance program. 
 Two City Council members, Augusto Amador and Luis Quintana, have called for a criminal investigation into the mayor's role. Mr. James said last week that he did not know that the money was for low-income housing and that it should be returned if the housing authority loses an appeal due this month.
 Some of the $8,500 in contributions involved the purchase of $500 tickets to a fund-raiser Mr. James held this year on his birthday in February.
 One $500 contribution was from Harold Lucas, the executive director of the agency, who has donated a total $1,500 to Mr. James's campaign since 2002. Mr. Lucas, who was appointed by the mayor in 2002, has been under fire since September when he laid off more than 80 workers while completing a $1 million renovation of his executive suite. 
 Another official, Shaye Araromi, the assistant executive director in charge of finance and accounting -- a department that received blistering criticism from federal auditors, who found millions in undeclared losses -- has given a total $1,435. 
 Employees at other city agencies have also contributed generously to the mayor's campaigns. During the 2002 mayor's race, Mr. James received roughly a third of his campaign financing from city employees.
 The next mayoral election is in May 2006. Mayor James has not said whether he will seek re-election, though he has raised $445,000 since January.

HEADLINE: The Jobs Report From 30,000 Feet

 BODY:
It was deja vu all over again when the government released the April employment report on Friday. The latest figures show that the economy added 274,000 jobs last month, some 100,000 more than had been expected, and that 93,000 more jobs were created in February and March than had originally been reported. The numbers are surprisingly upbeat and entirely welcome. 
 But we should remember that a year ago, in the spring of 2004, the story was much the same. Back then, after more than two years of relentlessly subpar job creation, there was a three-month surge in job gains. Then, as now, the figures unleashed hope -- however tentative -- that employment and wages would improve steadily, allowing job seekers and working Americans to share in an economic recovery that, until then, had generated strong corporate profits but weak hiring and income growth figures. 
 Last year, alas, such hopes were largely dashed. And since then, troubling economic data, showing more costly oil, slower economic growth and declining consumer confidence, have piled up. What are April's numbers really telling us? With April's results in, the average job growth for the past year comes to 181,000 jobs a month. At the same point in the economic recovery in the early 1990's, an average of 307,000 jobs were being created each month. The upshot is that current job growth is decent -- about what's needed to keep the unemployment rate from rising. But it's not enough to help the economy work off the damage that periods of recession and unemployment cause, like lowered standards of living and lost savings. 
 It's also not enough to give workers much leverage in bargaining for pay increases. When inflation numbers are reported later this month, it's highly likely that April will mark the 11th month in a row in which hourly wage gains fail to keep up with rising prices. In one bright spot, the time workers spent on the job ticked up in April by 12 minutes per week. More work will probably push average weekly earnings above inflation by a few tenths of a percentage point. Still, in previous recoveries, the number of hours worked was both higher and faster-growing that it is now. 
 If April's numbers are the start of a new upward trend, great. But it's too soon to tell. Policy makers must be especially mindful that the economy has been at this juncture before, and then failed to deliver on its promise.

HEADLINE: Mint Juleps and Milkshakes

 BODY:
William Faulkner pointed out that ''the horse is economically obsolete.'' But he did so in celebrating the Kentucky Derby as a peerless crucible for thoroughbred horses to ''endure and survive until man's own nature changes.'' Strong odds today are that human nature won't change. So the Derby is on again as a classic American oddity -- that special moment each year when throngs across the country gather to watch and to pretend to speak knowledgeably about what in truth can be only a deep puzzlement for most of them: the relative strengths of the latest herd of finely bred horses. 
 But that's the beauty of the Derby. It's a two-minute competition that demonstrates how ignorance can be mass bliss as another winter yields to spring. The cliche-ridden can happily sip mint juleps, the bourbon highball that is soon to be forgotten for another year, along with the names of the horses. And this year, the knowledgeable will talk of ''milkshakes'' -- backstretch jargon for the illegal concoction of baking soda, sugar and electrolytes that can make a champion of an also-ran. 
 In a candid departure, racing officials at the major tracks are taking the occasion of Derby day to admit that they have a serious drug problem in the barns and must catch up with the cheaters. The details, spelled out in a report by The Times's Joe Drape, extend to doping horses with the venom of cobras and cone snails. New countermeasures include platoons of security guards, far more stringent blood tests and even the isolation of horses in protected barns hours before they compete.
 All this only proves Faulkner's point about human nature. Cheaters have been around the barns ever since the first bets were placed, but the thoroughbreds remain gloriously innocent. Too bad the same can't be said for their self-doping human counterparts. The contrast is yet another reason to savor the horses as they plunge into the Derby's grueling test of champions.

HEADLINE: Impact of a Stadium: A Look at Other Cities

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
For many foes of a plan to build a Jets stadium and convention center on the far West Side of Manhattan, the biggest concern is how such a megastructure would affect the neighborhood and the borough as a whole -- from light to crowd noise to views of the Hudson River. 
 Members of Community Board 4, whose neighborhood includes the stadium's proposed site, are apprehensive. ''Look at stadiums all over the country,'' said Walter Mankoff, the board's chairman. ''You find nothing but bars and parking lots in the general vicinity.''
 Officials for the Jets and the city argue that the building will be an agent of renewal, anchoring and rejuvenating an area that now amounts to little more than abandoned rail yards and urban blight. Opponents say the stadium is a brassy and architecturally undistinguished behemoth that will compromise the neighborhood's character, breed congestion and fail to foster daytime activity in a dormant area. 
 In a recent interview at his Midtown office, Jay Cross, the Jets' president, cautioned that a stadium could not shoulder the entire burden of reviving a neighborhood. ''One building can't do it on its own,'' he said. 
 Still, he added, a stadium can help. 
 He points to two others he was in charge of building: the American Airlines Arena in Miami in 1999, and the Air Canada Center in Toronto in 1998. His experience with them led to his being hired by the Jets. 
 In Miami, the development around the arena, home to the Miami Heat, a National Basketball Association team, includes a group of high-rise condominiums. Across Biscayne Boulevard, a few blocks north of the stadium, is the Performing Arts Center of Greater Miami, designed by Cesar Pelli, which includes a ballet and an opera house connected to a concert hall by a bridge. It is scheduled to open in the fall of 2006. 
 Last month, the city and Miami-Dade County announced plans for a new Miami Art Museum and Miami Museum of Science and Planetarium to be built in the neglected Bicentennial Park nearby; Cooper, Robertson & Partners is doing a master plan for the site.
 In March, a developer agreed to pay $190 million for the area's 10 acres surrounding The Miami Herald's bay-front headquarters. Plans could include residential, office, hotel and retail buildings. Yet many argue that the sports arena had little to do with Miami's development spurt. 
 ''It's done nothing for the neighborhood,'' Nancy Liebman, president of the Urban Environment League, an advocacy group in Miami-Dade County, said of the stadium. ''Would you want to live next door to an arena? It blocked the whole waterfront; the streets get clogged.''
 While Ms. Liebman said she viewed Miami's building boom as generally positive, she added that it came about largely because of government efforts to clean up the area and lure developers. ''People have confidence about coming into downtown,'' she said, ''and none of it has to do with the stadium.''
 Others say the arena deserves more credit. ''The American Airlines Arena was the beginning of the redevelopment of the entire downtown area,'' said Sherwood M. Weiser, chairman of the foundation charged with building the performing arts center. 
 ''I believe these kind of institutional buildings -- they're the catalyst,'' he added. ''Just as Lincoln Center was on the West Side of New York. The whole area has taken on a life of its own.'' 
 But Mark S. Rosentraub, a sports economist and dean of the College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University, said Miami was a ''fast-growth area'' even before the arena.
 ''You could hang up a shingle, and it was going to cause economic development,'' he said. 
 Similarly, change was already under way in Toronto before the building of the Air Canada Center, home to the N.B.A.'s Raptors and the National Hockey League's Maple Leafs. The SkyDome, now known as the Rogers Center, which opened in 1989 and is home to the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team, had begun to change the area by ferrying people to games through mass transit rather than by building a sprawling parking lot.
 ''SkyDome was the big bet,'' Mr. Rosentraub said. 
 ''The bottom line is, it worked,'' he added, noting that people are coming to games without their cars. 
 Toronto's development continues. Plans were announced last month for a $350 million hotel, condominium, shopping and entertainment complex to be built adjacent to the Air Canada Center, and for a $300 million Ritz-Carlton hotel and condominium project nearby.
 Two other major development projects are already under way: the Sapphire Tower, billed as the city's tallest residential tower, and the Trump International Hotel and Tower, also downtown. 
 In New York, Mr. Cross is also gambling on not building parking lots. Downtown stadiums should avoid ''seas and seas of parking,'' he said, which he called antithetical to sound environmental planning. He noted that transportation was already available -- meaning trains, buses and ferries, as well as the planned extension of the No. 7 subway line -- and that most football games were not at rush hour, when mass transit is crowded. The area already has some parking lots.
 Mr. Mankoff of Board 4 warned that the neighborhood already had more cars than it could handle. ''The Lincoln Tunnel is jammed,'' he said. ''So are the ramps into the tunnel. It's the worst possible place to bring 75,000 people into the neighborhood.''
 ''When it's not in use, it will be isolated and deserted, like the Javits Center is now,'' he said of the stadium, adding that he and his fellow residents would prefer a project that included residential, retail and commercial uses. 
 Amanda M. Burden, the director of the City Planning Department, asked the architect for the proposed stadium, Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, to incorporate more street-level retail space and greenery into the design, and the firm obliged. 
 But even Mr. Cross acknowledged that it was ''tough to put street life into these buildings'' when they also had to involve so much stadium infrastructure, from vast boiling rooms to cooling systems to locker rooms to storage. 
 He emphasized that his two previous arenas, like the Jets stadium, were intended for areas that were desolate or in decline. The site of the American Airlines Arena in Miami, for example, had been dominated by abandoned rail tracks, parking lots, pawn shops and the Bicentennial Park, where the homeless congregated, he said.
 ''If we were proposing to put this in the West Village, yes, it would be a problem,'' he said of the Jets stadium. ''New York has got quaint streets and neighborhoods. We also have our backyards, which are full of garbage. The West 30's are not anything New Yorkers are proud of. There isn't a neighborhood there.''
 The stadium's impact, he added, would take time to determine. 
 ''You've got to give it 20 years,'' he said. ''You've got to be patient. They can help neighborhoods,'' he said of stadiums, ''but they're not instant panaceas. They will neither repel housing or attract it. There still needs to be a bona fide reason to build housing or commercial space as part of a well-thought-through package, because it's largely market driven.''
 ''Times Square had all the good will to clean it up,'' he continued. ''But it needed developers to make commitments.'' 
 The Jets stadium gained those kinds of commitments only in March, when developers made proposals for commercial and residential towers to counter Cablevision's $760 million competing bid for the property. The deal allowed the Jets to raise their own bid to $720 million from $100 million.
 Over all, successful arenas depend on this kind of ''concentrated planning,'' Mr. Rosentraub said, citing San Diego, Indianapolis and Cleveland as examples. Still, experts say the proposed Jets stadium is a tougher draw than the Miami and Toronto arenas for stores, restaurants and housing because the building itself will have far less sports activity; the Jets play only 10 home games a year. Baseball, by comparison, has 81 home games in addition to possible playoffs; it can draw three million people a year compared with football's 800,000 -- and that's if all the football games sell out.
 But Mr. Cross pointed out that the stadium would also be the site for conventions, college football games, soccer games and police academy graduations, raising its use to a minimum of 150 days a year. ''That's us being superconservative,'' he said.
 As for daytime foot traffic, Mr. Cross said there would eventually be art expos in the convention center and pregame events, adding that a stadium was not intended to generate round-the-clock activity. ''It will be no more deserted than Park Avenue on a weekend night in August,'' he said. 
 Richard Ravitch, a former developer who served as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and was once the state's top economic development official, expressed skepticism. ''You need life and street activity to make a neighborhood,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Place Your Bets

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
After a recent column comparing Social Security with the Chilean system of private accounts, I was deluged with letters from readers eager to explain why I am a superficial nitwit. In this case, they're at least half right.
 The column was superficial because I simply looked at how much more money I'd have if I had invested my Social Security contributions in the private account of a Chilean friend and economist, Pablo Serra. The numbers were impressive -- my projected pension would be triple what I'm promised by Social Security -- but they're not as important as another consideration: which type of pension is riskier? 
 Pablo has done well because Chilean mutual funds have yielded high returns in the past two decades -- probably higher than I would have gotten from an American mutual fund, although here I'd still be way ahead of Social Security. Historically, stocks have yielded returns two to three times what Social Security pays.
 Still, stocks could yield much lower returns in the future, as critics of private accounts have pointed out in advertisements comparing the market to a slot machine and extolling the ''guarantee'' of Social Security.
 But there's also another kind of risk to consider, one that Chilean workers kept mentioning to me. The best part of their private accounts, they said, was that they'd put ''la plata donde mis ojos la vean'' -- the money where my eyes can see it. They knew they might lose some of it in the stock market, but they preferred that to watching it all disappear into politicians' hands. 
 My Social Security, far from being a guarantee, comes with a political risk that will become clear around 2017, when I'll be 64. That's when the Social Security Administration expects to start paying out more than it collects in taxes. 
 In theory, there is a trust fund to cover this shortfall. When Congress sharply raised Social Security taxes in the 1980's, the idea was to generate surpluses during the baby boomers' working years that would finance our retirement. Instead, Congress spent our money, leaving the Social Security trust fund with a file cabinet full of i.o.u.'s in the form of Treasury bills. 
 It's not a problem now, because for the next few years the baby boomers' taxes will provide an annual surplus for Social Security of about $100 billion, allowing Congress to dole out the extra money for its favorite causes, like farm subsidies and weapon systems and West Virginia buildings named after Robert Byrd. But in four years the surpluses start declining, and they turn into deficits around 2017, when Congress must begin repaying those i.o.u.'s.
 By the time I'm in my 70's, the Social Security shortfall will force Congress to find new taxes or make spending cuts that are more than half the size of the Pentagon's budget. If I make it to age 88, there will no more i.o.u.'s left in the trust fund, so everyone's benefits would have to be cut by 27 percent.
 Faced with the grim math, President Bush offered a progressive compromise last week to Democrats: protect the poor while moderating the growth of benefits for higher-income workers. Democrats refused to bite, denouncing his ''cuts'' without offering a plan of their own, and members of both parties wondered why any politician would jeopardize his party's chances in 2006 by tackling an unpleasant future problem.
 You can call the Democrats irresponsible obstructionists, but they're just following the first rule of politics: get re-elected. It's the same rule followed by the politicians from both parties who have spent the baby boomers' retirement money. Why set aside money for 2017 if it could be used to woo voters and campaign contributors for the next election?
 I can't protect my pension against political risk, but Pablo can help protect his against the risks of the stock market. As he approaches retirement, he can gradually shift his money out of stocks and into bonds, like the ones that financed the private road between Santiago and the port city of Valparaiso, which will be paid off by tolls. The Chilean pension system has billboards along the road proclaiming, ''Your savings are financing this highway, and this highway is financing your retirement.'' 
 Those billboards have been on my mind. My pension depends on 535 politicians who will be asked to vote for steep tax increases or budget cuts that they fear could cost them their jobs. Pablo's pension depends on people driving between Chile's two largest cities.

HEADLINE: China Braces for a More Valuable Yuan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
As speculators across Asia place ever larger bets on a revaluation of China's currency soon, investors and corporate executives alike are trying to prepare for what a more valuable yuan will mean for stocks and companies.
 For Romeo Dator, the portfolio manager of the U.S. Global China Region Opportunity Fund, a no-load mutual fund in San Antonio, a 20-minute departure by the yuan from its usual trading range on April 29 was a signal to sell part of the fund's holdings of PetroChina, China's biggest oil producer.
 ''Who would be impacted negatively?'' Mr. Dator asked. ''Definitely the petrochemical companies,'' reasoning that they sell oil and chemicals priced in dollars but incur costs in increasingly valuable yuan. 
 For Leon Liu, a manager of the Xingan Quanyi Bamboo and Wooden Products Company, a manufacturer of wooden coat hangers for hotels and expensive retailers, a more valuable yuan will mean that bamboo grown near the company's factory in Rong Jiang Village in southernmost China will become too expensive. He is considering wood imports from Indonesia, and possibly even opening a hanger factory there.
 And for Chen Kuang-ping, the president of the Shunde Growth Corporation, a Taiwanese-owned company here in southeastern China that assembles steel bookcases and other furniture from imported Taiwanese steel, a higher yuan could force a decision to close the local factory and move to India in search of cheaper labor.
 ''It would affect us a lot,'' Mr. Chen said. ''We prefer the yuan to stay where it is.''
 But while a strengthened yuan might cause hardships for some companies and industries, others -- both Chinese and foreign -- are likely to come out ahead. 
 Most economists who follow the pronouncements of Chinese officials closely say that managers and investors are paying far too much attention to the Chinese currency, which has been pegged to the dollar for years -- that even if China does act soon, the value of the yuan is likely to change so little that it will have a very modest effect on international trade and corporate profits. The April 29 shift was, after all, just six-thousandths of a yuan. 
 Jonathan Anderson, an economist at UBS, predicts there is an 85 percent chance that China will simply tweak its current peg of 8.277 yuan to the dollar. He forecasts that Beijing will instead link the yuan to a basket of other currencies and then let the yuan rise gradually, by perhaps 1 to 4 percent over the course of the next year.
 Mr. Anderson says there is a 14 percent chance that the yuan, also known as the renminbi, will be revalued by 5 to 7 percent, and just a 1 percent probability of a big revaluation of 15 to 25 percent.
 ''From a macro point of view the 'renminbi question' has to be one of the most -- nay, perhaps the most -- overly hyped themes in the market today,'' he wrote in a research report. ''Any reasonable adjustment scenario would have very little near-term impact at home, equally little near-term impact on China's neighbors'' and essentially no effect on the United States.
 But the possibility that China might revalue the yuan by even 5 percent -- a move the euro or yen has sometimes managed in days or weeks against the dollar -- has prompted a deluge of analysis. Some of the analysis remains valid, experts say, even if China lets the yuan move by only a percentage point or two at first but permits larger fluctuations later.
 For China, a small move of a few percentage points now runs the risk of a further surge in the flood of speculative investment already pouring into the country, as foreigners buy up apartments and other property in the hope that it will be worth more in their home currencies after further revaluation.
 But a big revaluation soon would create the risk of social instability if factory presidents like Mr. Chen shut operations, if Chinese food companies stop buying from peasants and import instead, and if Chinese companies find themselves on the wrong end of too many speculative bets on the currency.
 The most obvious effects of a revaluation would be to make imports cheaper in China and make Chinese goods more costly in foreign markets. The Bush administration has led efforts, increasingly supported by European nations and Japan as well, to persuade China to let the yuan rise.
 The picture is blurred, however, because more than half of China's imports are materials and parts that are assembled for re-export by Chinese workers earning as little as 50 cents an hour. A company running such an operation saves only on the portion of costs incurred in China, which may be less than a tenth of the retail price overseas for products like DVD players and other consumer electronics.
 Jun Ma, Deutsche Bank's chief economist for greater China, has estimated the immediate effects on earnings in various industries of a quick 5 percent revaluation in the yuan, though he said Chinese authorities were more likely to link the yuan to a group of other currencies and then let it rise 2 to 5 percent a year for many years.
 According to his estimate, the biggest winners by far from revaluation would be China's airlines, with some of them perhaps doubling their modest earnings. That is largely because airlines are among the few businesses in China that have been allowed to borrow large sums of dollars, for the purchase of planes, and they would be able to repay these loans with the proceeds of mostly domestic tickets sold for increasingly valuable yuan. Jet fuel would become cheaper as well in yuan terms, because it is priced on international markets in dollars, Mr. Ma said.
 Three possible American beneficiaries of a rising yuan, he said, are Boeing, with its aircraft exports to China; Cisco, with its sales of telecommunications equipment; and Motorola, with its large operations within China earning profits in yuan.
 Many analysts say the other winners would be automakers, notably market leaders in China like General Motors, Volkswagen and Shanghai Automotive.
 Auto assemblers in China export few cars yet, and remain heavily dependent on imports for everything from the high-finish galvanized steel for exterior body panels to safety-related systems like brakes. Jim Padilla, the chief operating officer of the Ford Motor Company, and other executives said at the Shanghai Auto Show in late April that they were trying to find local parts suppliers as quickly as possible.
 Some importers may even become exporters. Dr. Rudiger Grube, a DaimlerChrysler executive president, said that the company was negotiating to build and ship small cars from China to the United States. He added that China's edge in lower wages was so large that a revaluation of the yuan or wage inflation in China would have little effect.
 Most multinationals doing business in China have stopped commenting on the potential value of the yuan, partly because they see it as futile to guess what will happen but also because they wish to avoid offending leaders in Beijing, who have repeatedly objected in recent months to international pressure to let the yuan rise. 
 But the thousands of small and midsize businesses in China that have thrived on exports are clearly worried that their profit margins, already razor-thin, will disappear with a rising yuan. China's state-controlled media has been full of warnings of a possible rise in the yuan for the last couple of years, and equally full of advice on how to stay competitive overseas.
 Mr. Liu, the coat hangar manufacturer, has followed those lessons and readily repeats them as his company's plan.
 ''We have to raise the quality of the product and improve the styling,'' he said, describing a strategy that could someday put even more Chinese companies in competition with American rivals producing high-quality goods.
 ''Until now,'' he added, ''we've only paid attention to exports, but now we'll have to focus on the domestic market, too.''

HEADLINE: Saving Social Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 I disagree with ''A Gut Punch to the Middle,'' by Paul Krugman (column, May 2).
 But in a 1996 Op-Ed article in this paper, Mr. Krugman had this to say about the budget: ''It is heading inexorably toward fiscal disaster, as the baby boomers in the tens of millions march steadily toward the age at which they can claim Social Security and Medicare. True, the crisis is still about 15 years away.'' 
 He then said: ''Unfortunately, everything that a responsible government should be doing now -- raising taxes, raising the retirement age, scaling back benefits for those who can manage without them (that means for the affluent, not the poor) -- is political poison.''
 President Bush has now proposed slowing benefit growth for the affluent, not the poor, the idea Mr. Krugman complimented in 1996 while suggesting that no leader would be courageous enough to pursue it.
 But in his May 2 column, he called the president's proposal ''a plan to slash middle-class benefits'' and ''a gut punch to the middle class.'' 
 Robert C. Pozen, a Democrat, has a plan that the president believes could be a model for reform. Benefits for the very highest earning workers -- fewer than 1 percent -- would grow no faster than inflation. Lower-income workers would receive the fastest benefit growth of all. And everyone would receive greater benefits than today's retirees.
 Don't forget proposed voluntary personal accounts. With them, most low-wage workers could expect to receive higher benefits than even the promises the current system makes, and significantly more than what it can actually pay.

HEADLINE: Not the Week To Be or to Own The Bluest Chips

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
It was a week to give owners of blue chips the blues. The greatest names of American capitalism seemed to vie with one another to see which company could have the most depressing news.
 General Electric joined the parade yesterday, revealing that its auditors had discovered that, for the last three years, it had failed to apply correctly an accounting rule and would have to restate its financial results.
 That move will have only a small effect on annual profits, the company said, although the impact will produce much larger quarterly swings. The disclosure made it seem likely that more large American companies may have failed to correctly apply the accounting rule in question, which deals with derivative securities. 
 By the standards of the week, that was good news. On Thursday, General Motors and Ford found out that Standard & Poor's, one of the major bond rating services, had downgraded their debt to junk status. G.M. suffered the additional indignity of not even being deemed the highest quality junk.
 And on Wednesday, I.B.M. announced plans to cut employment by at least 10,000 workers and to take a quarterly write-off of at least $1.3 billion.
 The developments were unrelated, and it was coincidental that they came at the same time. But together they served to remind investors that the great names of American business are not as dominant as they once were, and may not be able to live up to their reputations. 
 I.B.M. once stood astride the world computer industry. Now it has merged its personal computer business into a Chinese company and has embarked on another round of cost-cutting. 
 The nation's two largest carmakers have been hurt by increased competition and by their own costs, which are bloated in part by the need to pay for the health care of retired workers. Rising oil prices may finally be putting a dent in American demand for sport utility vehicles, which have been a solid profit center for the carmakers.
 General Electric had been viewed as the conglomerate that managed to do lots of things well, with a financial arm that avoided making the mistakes of other financial companies in the 1980's and early 1990's. But its insurance operations were already facing questions related to products they sold that may have been used to distort results by other companies, and the new revelation about its own accounting may at least dent the company's reputation for financial expertise.
 The extent to which the problems of the blue-chip companies mirror those of the country is also limited. I.B.M. said it would cut employment more in Europe than in the United States, and the United States auto market remains relatively strong, albeit with imported brands continuing to gain market share. 
 On Friday, the Labor Department reported a surprisingly strong increase in jobs in April, and the United States stock market finished up for the week, with both Ford and G.M. shares higher than they were a week earlier, despite the credit downgrade. I.B.M. shares were marginally lower.
 To some extent, most of the news was old news anyway. The downgrading of Ford was a somewhat greater surprise than that of G.M., but bonds of both companies had already fallen in price, with yields rising, as their prospects deteriorated this year. To take one example, a G.M. bond maturing in 2025, paying 7.4 percent interest, fell on Thursday to $69 for each $100 of par value, to yield more than 11 percent. That was a loss of $4 in a day.
 But that bond's price had climbed earlier in the week, on the news that Kirk Kerkorian, a financier known for having done well buying Chrysler stock when it was depressed, was buying G.M. shares. Thursday's price for the bond was barely below where it was a week ago. The big losses were suffered well before this week. That bond had traded for more then $100 as recently as early February.
 G.E. was in some ways the largest surprise, given that it still has its own triple-A credit rating, the highest possible, and for years has maintained a reputation for financial expertise second to none. The United States accounting rule it now says it violated, Statement 133, is extremely complicated, and both Fannie Mae and the American International Group recently admitted violating it. But it still came as a shock that KPMG, G.E.'s auditors, had decided that the company had been doing it wrong for three years. That raised the possibility that other major companies will be forced to make similar admissions.
 If they do, it would continue a trend that cannot be good news, even if markets reacted well this week. The bluest of American blue chips no longer resemble the colossi they once seemed to be.

HEADLINE: War Takes Higher Toll on Blair Than Bush

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: LONDON, May 6 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Bush were bound together in the war against Iraq, and the conflict provided a backdrop for their re-election campaigns -- with its nightly images of casualties, shifting justifications for removing Saddam Hussein and waves of antiwar sentiment.
 But as became clear on Friday after the British election, that is where the similarities ended. Six months after Mr. Bush won a second term, Mr. Blair returned to 10 Downing Street visibly chastened. His party's delegation to Parliament was slashed by nearly 100 seats, a sobering setback that Mr. Blair's advisers attributed largely to his partnership with Mr. Bush in advocating the war. 
 In the American campaign, Mr. Bush arguably succeeded in turning the war into an electoral asset, linking the pursuit of Mr. Hussein to the fight against terrorism that he began after the Sept. 11 attacks. Even the failure to find illicit weapons and the continuing violence in Iraq seemed not to matter to American voters, to the frustration of Senator John Kerry, his Democratic opponent.
 But Mr. Blair's situation could not have been more different. His campaign became gripped and battered in the final two weeks by the very kind of Iraq news that seemed to roll off Mr. Bush: the death of a British soldier, the appearance of the dead soldier's tearful mother denouncing Mr. Blair and orchestrated leaks of government documents that challenged the truthfulness of the case he had made for war.
 ''The leak of documents really created an Iraqi firestorm that shifted a lot of voters,'' said Mark Penn, an American pollster working for Mr. Blair. ''It brought back a protest on Iraq that had died down.''
 The reason for the divergence was plainly the gulf between the United States and Europe when it comes to Iraq. 
 There has been no recent terrorist attack in Britain, so the visceral argument that Mr. Bush made to American audiences for invading Iraq has far less potency here. ''Britain wasn't attacked in September of 2001,'' said Daniel Finkelstein, associate editor of The Times of London and a former Conservative Party official. ''It has a different attitude to the war on terror.''
 This campaign also took place six months after the American elections, a period in which frustration among opponents of the war here has grown. ''The troops are still there and are still being killed -- there's no endgame here,'' said Christopher J. Bailey, a professor of politics at Keele University in Staffordshire.
 From the outset, antiwar sentiment in Britain has been deeper than in the United States; a demonstration in February of 2003 drew one million people in London alone. And many of those protesters were members of Mr. Blair's Labor Party, a reminder of the considerable risk Mr. Blair took in embracing the war.
 Mr. Blair received an unsettling reminder of that at what should have been a happier moment: when he was officially informed that he been re-elected to Parliament. This is part of a sometimes humiliating election night custom here, in which all the candidates stand on stage in front of television cameras to listen to the announcement of the vote count.
 One of Mr. Blair's opponents in his constituency was Reg Keys, whose son died in Iraq. ''I hope in my heart that one day the prime minister may be able to say, 'I'm sorry,''' Mr. Keys said, as an ashen Mr. Blair stared straight ahead.
 Beyond that, polling showed a sizable number of Americans thought that Mr. Hussein was involved in the attack on the World Trade Center. That suggestion is viewed with much more skepticism here by a public that is wary of the United States in general and Mr. Bush in particular, political analysts said.
 So one reason why the resurgence of Iraq news might have hurt Mr. Blair was that it reminded them of an alliance that he would just as soon they forget. ''Iraq was a unique event here because Blair owned it -- he owned it together with George Bush, who is immensely unpopular here,'' said Stanley Greenberg, a pollster advising the Labor Party. ''If you look back at this campaign, it was this continuing growing concern about Iraq. Why not apologize? Why not explain?''
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair did share one bit of political luck, drawing principal opponents who could not cash in on the war. Both Michael Howard, the Conservative Party leader, and Senator Kerry had voted for the war. Both often had to strain in finding ways to criticize their opponents on the issue.
 But there was one crucial difference that presented Mr. Blair with his biggest problem. In Britain, there was a credible choice for opponents of the war -- the antiwar Liberal Democrats. Those third-party candidates siphoned off Labor Party voters, accounting for much of the party's losses, Mr. Blair's advisers said.
 ''If the Lib Dems were not sitting there as an attractive and temporary alternative, would these same voters have gone over to the Tories?'' Mr. Penn asked. ''There was a place for them to go.'' 
 Tony Travers, a political analyst with the London School of Economics, said that ultimately what was so damaging about this for Mr. Blair was that it came at a time when the public had already grown weary of him after two terms in office. 
 ''The Iraq issue acted as a lightning rod for a more general sense of disenchantment,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Russia's Billionaires Club Now Totals 27 Members

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 3 

 BODY:
The rich in Russia are getting richer.
 Record high prices for oil and metals helped to move Russia up in the billionaire tally last year, as it leapfrogged Japan to the No.3 spot on Forbes magazine's latest list of billionaires, behind Germany, which is No.2, and the United States. 
 Some of the wealth in this booming, Communist-to-capitalist country is trickling down, but inequality is widening because of the way resources have been divided in the post-Soviet era. 
 Although wages in Russia have risen -- the average jumped 50 percent in the last three years, to 6,832 rubles ($246) a month in 2004 -- the income gap between the richest and the poorest Russians is growing, said Viktor Ivanter, director of the Economic Forecasting Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences, in a recent interview with the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta. 
 Peter Westin, the chief economist with the Aton Capital Group, said: ''People's incomes are growing across the board, and state-sector workers have had huge wage increases in the last few years, but they are still lagging behind the rich. Everyone is moving up the ladder, but the top rungs are moving faster.''
 Forbes listed the United States with 341 billionaires, or 49 percent of the world's total last year, while Germany had 57. Russia had 27, with 9 of them new to the list.
 Being in the commodities business, often combined with being on the right side of the political power structure, was the main factor deciding which Russians made the list -- and who dropped down or off it. 
 The richest Russian is Roman Abramovich, head of the oil giant Sibneft; he is worth $13.3 billion, according to Forbes, which published the list. 
 The list's most noticeable decline was that of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, once Russia's wealthiest man, now in jail and facing criminal charges related to one of the country's controversial privatizations. The value of his oil company, Yukos, plummeted after moves against it by the Kremlin. Mr. Khodorkovsky is now worth $2.2 billion, down from more than $15 billion in 2003. 
 But even as Russia benefited from the increasing value of its natural resources, 17.8 percent of Russians lived below the official poverty line last year, according to World Bank estimates. The poverty line is defined as wages of 2,451 rubles, or $88 a month.
 What worries some economists most is the widening income gap. Russia's top 10 percent of earners made nearly 15 times those in the bottom 10 percent last year, up from 12 times the year before. In developed countries, the norm is less than five, said Christopher Weafer, chief strategist at Alfa Bank in Moscow.
 ''You can't afford to have such a skew for too long,'' he said, ''because usually it's led to political uncertainty and higher investment risk.''
 Russia's economic boom is mirrored by that of China (2 billionaires on the Forbes list) and India (12 billionaires); both countries have big income gaps. But, according to Marshall Goldman, associate director of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard, there are some significant differences. 
 ''In India and China, many of the billionaires are self-made -- they founded the businesses, they invest in them,'' Professor Goldman said.
 Most of the rich Russians, however, took over state assets from ministries where they worked or through questionable means like the ''loans for shares'' program in the early 1990's, when the Kremlin sold companies to well-connected businessmen for far less than market value. 
 That poses a quandary for President Vladimir V. Putin. ''On the one hand, he has to be responsive to public anger over the oligarchs,'' Professor Goldman said. ''On the other, he must realize the Yukos affair has gotten out of hand, and hurt the economy and his standing in the international investment community.''
 Mr. Putin aims to lift the tide for everyone by doubling Russia's gross domestic product, now at $582 billion, by 2012, a target date that has shifted several times, depending on the country's progress. To some extent, the strategy is working. Last year's poverty level of 17.8 percent was down from 20.6 percent in 2003 and from more than 24 percent in 2002.
 But many specialists say a crucial piece is missing in Russia's riches-and-rags economy.
 ''The presence of dozens of billionaires, however eye-catching, is of less moment than the absence of millions of small and medium businesses,'' Stephen Kotkin, director of Princeton University's Russian studies program, said in an e-mail interview. Russia's middle class still consists mostly of salaried workers for the state or for large corporations, rather than a broad group of property owners, he said.
 The Kremlin has noticed. ''The government and the regional authorities have failed to create conditions for small and medium-sized business to flourish,'' Mr. Putin said on state-run television in March. 
 Even some Russian billionaires say they see problems with the country's wealth gap. ''It's a dubious privilege,'' Alexander Lebedev said of making the latest Forbes list with a net worth of $1.6 billion. ''The general attitude here in Russia to people who have wealth is not very positive. It's partly explained by the attitude of the rich, not paying in kind to the population of their country.''
 Mr. Lebedev, the former president of the National Reserve Bank, one of Russia's biggest private banks, also said, ''It's not very ethical if it is an unlawful source of wealth.''
 Mr. Lebedev, now a member of Russia's Parliament, is trying to persuade state television to develop a reality show that would detail the tribulations of small-business owners. Entrepreneurs would be trailed by hidden cameras ready to reveal any encounter with corrupt bureaucrats or police and endless licensing agencies and other forms of red tape.

HEADLINE: CREATION OF JOBS SURGED IN APRIL, AND INCOME ROSE

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Overriding earlier evidence that suggested the economy was slowing significantly, job creation and income growth appear to be holding up their end of the recovery.
 The government reported yesterday that the nation's employers generated an unexpectedly large number of jobs in April -- 274,000 -- even as they gave their existing employees additional hours of work.
 The employment report was the most positive news about the economy in weeks. It dented the gloom that had accumulated after a number of recent measures provided evidence that last year's robust growth might be fading. 
 ''The main thing I think these employment numbers tell you is that all this worry about the economy experiencing a significant soft patch has been exaggerated,'' said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at the Prudential Equity Group. 
 Employment rose across all sectors except manufacturing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also revised its estimates for February and March, adding 93,000 jobs -- enough to erase the impression that job growth had faltered, particularly in March.
 The unemployment rate last month was 5.2 percent, unchanged from March but well below the 6.3 percent rate of nearly two years ago. 
 The Bush administration greeted the April jobs report as a sign of better times ahead. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said in a statement that the surge in job creation showed that ''President Bush's jobs and growth agenda has again produced results for Americans.''
 For the broad group of workers below management ranks, hourly wages were up 5 cents, to $16 an hour, and up 2.7 percent over the last year. That was not enough to keep up with a 3.1 percent annual inflation rate, but the average number of hours worked in a week rose for the first time this year, and the increase in pay that resulted brought average weekly pay to $542, a rise of 3.3 percent in the last 12 months. 
 ''Unless the April numbers are a blip,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, ''they tell you that employers are feeling more optimistic about where the economy is headed than some of us who have been looking at the economy from 30,000 feet up.''
 Still, for all the good news, even optimistic forecasters were reluctant to declare that the recovery, which entered its soft patch in the first quarter, was firmly back on track.
 ''We still have the spike in oil prices to contend with,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics. ''It is entirely possible that by June many employers will say: 'Oh, my God. We hired all these people and the demand is not there to support them.' That is not my view, but it is certainly possible.''
 Whatever the uncertainties, the new jobs report killed incipient speculation that the Federal Reserve's policy makers would ease up on their regular quarter-point interest rate increases, perhaps letting the June meeting pass without one. Reflecting this sentiment, yields rose yesterday for the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond, which influences mortgage and car loan rates. Stock prices finished the day almost unchanged.
 A slowdown in the growth of labor productivity contributed to the surge in hiring, economists said, as employers moved to keep up with demand for their goods and services by adding workers and hours. Partly as a result, the pace of job creation has accelerated recently; it has averaged 240,000 a month since February and 181,000 over the last year. These averages are rising quickly enough to generate jobs for those entering the labor force and seeking work.
 For all the surge in hiring, however, there was evidence in the April report that the number of people hunting for jobs was greater than the demand for their services. The average time that the unemployed spent in their search ticked up to 19.6 weeks from 19.5 in March.
 ''You would like to see even faster job growth,'' Mr. Bernstein said, ''so that the labor market would tighten up more quickly.''
 That is not likely to happen, says James Glassman, an economist at J.P. Morgan Chase, because the great majority of the unemployed are people under the age of 45. They dropped out of the labor force when job rolls were shrinking in the early years of the recovery, Mr. Glassman said, and now are returning. 
 ''They have to come back because they are young and must work,'' he said, ''but we have a couple of years ahead of us of strong hiring before we are likely to be back at full employment and tight labor markets.'' 
 Like most of the nation's forecasters, Mr. Glassman was reluctant to raise his estimate of economic growth in response to the new evidence of strength in the labor market. Uncertainty about oil prices feeds that reluctance and explains his firm's recent decision to lower its forecast for economic growth to 3 percent in 2005 from 4 percent. That shift roughly parallels the actual drop in economic growth since last year's fourth quarter.
 ''If you are optimistic about the second half of the year, you have to assume that oil prices will ease off,'' Mr. Glassman said. ''It seems like that should happen because inventories are quite substantial, which means that suppliers are getting enough oil into the marketplace. But what should happen might not happen.''
 Job creation last month was particularly strong among construction companies, which added 47,000 workers; at restaurants, bars and coffee shops, which increased their payrolls by 35,000; in health care, up 25,000; at telephone companies, which added 9,000 employees; and in movie and television production, up 7,000.
 Manufacturing, where employment has fallen almost every month for seven years, was down another 6,000 workers in April.
 The employment report was not the only news this week suggesting that the recent dip in the economy may be temporary. While Ford and General Motors continued to lose ground to their competitors, overall auto sales rose in April despite high gasoline prices.
 ''Oil prices are up, and that is the biggest short-term risk,'' Mr. Rippe, the Prudential economist, said. ''But job growth is brisk and that will feed into consumer spending.''

HEADLINE: With Company Coming, Georgia Spruces Up Its Capital

BYLINE: By C.J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia, May 5 

 BODY:
These days work crews are rushing to resurface Rustaveli Avenue, the main boulevard here in the capital of Georgia. Scaffolding cloaks facades at the former Lenin Square, where buildings are getting fresh coats of paint. Welders are working nights to assemble a grandstand. 
 A burst of civic polishing is under way in the last hours before President Bush visits this verdant, mountainous nation of four million, where the arrival of an American president is being hailed as a welcome chance both to impress a powerful suitor and to claim a spot on the West's map.
 Mr. Bush's overnight visit will begin Monday, 18 months after a bloodless coup displaced President Eduard A. Shevardnadze, an event many Georgians now regard as an inspiration for subsequent popular uprisings that swept away corrupt post-Soviet governments in Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. 
 No American president has ever visited Georgia, and Mikhail Saakashvili, the country's irrepressibly energetic president, said the expected warm words from Mr. Bush would validate a continuing transformation. 
 ''This is a confirmation that Georgia is a front-runner, a leader in democracy,'' Mr. Saakashvili said in an address to the nation on Tuesday night.
 A year and half after the coup, known here as the Rose Revolution, rapid change remains a part of Georgian life. 
 Mr. Saakashvili, a lawyer who studied at Columbia University, has installed a team of English-speaking and mostly young ministers, attacked the country's endemic corruption, instituted standardized testing in public schools, increased tax collection, sought American assistance to modernize Georgia's 16,000member military, accelerated the sale of state assets and brought one rebellious region, Ajaria, under federal control.
 His foreign policy includes striving for membership in NATO and the European Union and proselytizing nations still under the chill of autocratic post-Soviet leaders on the virtues of democracy. He has also sent troops to Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, and in an interview with two Western journalists this week, he said he was committed to keeping a reinforced battalion in Iraq as long as the war there lasts.
 Prodded along by its new administration, Georgia has realized some impressive gains -- the national budget, for instance, has swiftly climbed to $1.9 billion from $350 million. 
 But Mr. Saakashvili's tenure has not been smooth, and his style of leadership has attracted critics. 
 The Council of Europe has warned that too much of Georgia's political power is concentrated in its president and that the nation risks drifting to one-party rule. Human Rights Watch, a New York-based organization, has documented the use of torture and condemned a plea-bargaining system that had allowed defendants in criminal cases to pay the government to avoid trial.
 The leaders of two separatist enclaves within Georgia's borders -- Abkhazia and South Ossetia -- have treated Mr. Saakashvili as an impulsive neophyte and say his drive for national reunification has risked rekindling latent civil wars. 
 One of his most strident critics, Shalva Natelashvili, chairman of the Georgian Labor Party, has labeled the president a despot who claims to be a Western man. ''We think Saakashvili is a disgrace,'' he said.
 Moreover, the asphyxiation in February of Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania has led to conspiracy theories that are at once dark, distracting and bizarre. The United States has examined Mr. Zhvania's death and called it accidental, the result of fumes leaking from an improperly installed gas heater.
 Even the president's painting spree has had its costs. Mark Mullen, an American citizen and chairman of the Georgia office of Transparency International, an independent anticorruption organization, said that after he bought a building near Tblisi's center a week ago, eight or 10 Georgian officials stopped by to issue veiled threats, warning that unless he wanted a full review of all of the property's paperwork, he must have his building painted before Mr. Bush arrived.
 Mr. Mullen was irked enough that he wrote a letter to Mr. Bush asking his favorite color. He has had no reply.
 Still, Mr. Saakashvili has thus far weathered his term with relative ease, and he and his ministers have adopted a position of accepting but playing down much of the criticism. 
 For example, Mr. Saakashvili and Foreign Minister Salome Zourabichvili said in interviews that there had been cases of police abuse, but they also said that retraining the Soviet-era force was changing the law enforcement culture. Human rights, they insist, are a government priority. ''I think it is a well-taken criticism,'' Ms. Zourabichvili said.
 Mr. Saakashvili added that he knew of no new cases of torture in the last six months, and that the pay-to-plead system had been discontinued.
 But on one point all sides agree: As Mr. Bush's arrival draws near, no amount of new paint can hide Georgia's extraordinary woes. 
 The two breakaway regions receive baldly defiant Russian support. Poverty and unemployment remain pervasive, and allegations of corruption still swirl. 
 Georgia's infrastructure is beyond tired. Though the route Mr. Bush will travel is being repaved, the country's roads are legendarily bad. Electricity blackouts are common, especially in winter. 
 Only 15 of the country's 80 T-55 tanks are working, according to Irakli Okruashvili, the 31-year-old defense minister. Every sector needs investment, but widespread foreign investment has yet to come. 
 ''The new challenge is how to improve the economy,'' said Gela Bezhuashvili, Mr. Saakashvili's national security adviser.
 Mr. Saakashvili said Mr. Bush's visit would be useful because it would give him fresh standing from which to push for more changes to improve the business climate and institutionalize the public's role in political life.
 First, he said, Georgia will open its borders, dropping a visa requirement for citizens of the United States, Canada, the European Union, Israel and Japan. Next, Georgia will eliminate 90 percent of the licenses and permits required for businesses, which he said would unclog bureaucracy and reduce opportunities for corruption.
 He also said he planned to amend the Constitution to bring direct elections to local government in 2006. Many local leaders are now appointed, a system that has prevented democracy from maturing outside the capital. The system is also too centralized to be effective, Mr. Saakashvili said.
 ''I have to select 80 heads of local administrations,'' he said. ''And I don't know 99 percent of these people.''
 He has also pledged to restore round-the-clock electricity by next year, and to connect all main cities to passable roads, and every public school to the Internet.
 As the crews rush to dress up the dilapidated capital, all signs are that Mr. Bush will be welcome. Georgians are grateful for more than $1.3 billion in American aid to Tbilisi since the dismantling of the Soviet Union, and they recognize that a succession of American presidents have stood up for Georgia against meddling from the Kremlin. 
 Relations with Russia, and distrust of the Kremlin, are among Georgia's most indelible worries. In one sign of how uneasy the relationship is, Mr. Saakashvili noted that although he had repeatedly tried to have a conversation with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, the two men had not spoken since last summer. Even the Labor Party, which plans to demonstrate against Mr. Saakashvili during Mr. Bush's stay, says it will cheer for support from the United States. 
 Mr. Natelashvili, the party's leader, used a bit of overstatement to explain how Mr. Bush's visit could appear through the lens of a tiny nation that abuts Russia and worries that Russian ambitions of empire have not waned. ''We have been waiting for a visit from an American president,'' he said, ''for 200 years.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Warns North Korea Against Nuclear Test

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Thom Shanker contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6 

 BODY:
The White House warned North Korea on Friday that conducting a nuclear test would be ''a provocative act,'' and Japan's foreign minister raised the possibility of requesting United Nations sanctions against the North.
 The White House statement came a day after The New York Times reported growing concern among administration officials and several intelligence agencies about signs that North Korea might conduct its first nuclear test at a site near Kilju in the northeast. 
 Several officials confirmed those reports on Friday, and two officials with access to the information said satellites were also watching the construction of some platforms and crates hundreds of miles from the possible test site, near a nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. 
 The construction there may suggest that preparations are being made to remove spent nuclear fuel rods from the reactor, which was turned off more than a month ago. ''It's still something of a mystery,'' said one of the officials with access to the report. ''It's not clear if this construction is related to the rods or not.'' 
 If the rods are reprocessed, they could yield enough plutonium for a couple of new nuclear weapons, officials said. But officials have not ruled out the possibility that the reactor was shut for maintenance or as part of a ruse by the North to heighten concern that it is proceeding full steam with its nuclear program.
 A few intelligence officials urged caution in interpreting the satellite evidence. While they acknowledge finding signs of continued activity near tunnels in the Kilju area, there is clearly some disagreement among intelligence agencies about whether the latest evidence indicates a drive toward a test.
 ''What worries us most is that there is a progression of openness among the North Koreans about their nuclear capabilities,'' said one senior administration official who has been studying the evidence. ''They have unfolded new phases of specificity about what they can do, and they seem to have been on a long-term path of ending the ambiguity about their capability.''
 Whatever the North's motivations, several governments issued carefully worded warnings on Friday. Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura of Japan noted that negotiations had gone nowhere for the past 11 months, and he added, ''If there is no progress we have to think of other options, such as taking this matter to the United Nations Security Council.'' He stopped short of saying what types of sanctions might be sought.
 In New York, where a United Nations meeting on the spread of nuclear weapons is under way, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the world must exert pressure on the North not to conduct a test, saying it would have ''disastrous political and environmental consequences.''
 President Bush's spokesman, Scott McClellan, told reporters on Air Force One on the way to Latvia: ''I don't want to get into discussing intelligence matters. But what I would say is that if North Korea did take such a step, that would just be another provocative act that would further isolate it from the international community.''
 Military and Pentagon officials said Friday that there was no unusual or accelerated planning under way for any military action to halt either a nuclear test or the removal of more nuclear fuel from a North Korean reactor. North Korea's ability to strike Seoul, the South Korean capital, with conventional mortar rounds from its emplacements north of the demilitarized zone between the two countries and to threaten Japan with missiles has long given the North protection from any American-led strike. These officials emphasized that a diplomatic solution to North Korean nuclear ambitions remained the No.1 choice across the Bush administration.
 At the State Department and the White House, officials said they were considering a range of options for taking the issue to the United Nations Security Council. One idea is to establish a quarantine operation -- though the administration says it will not use that word -- that would search shipments in and out of the country for weapons. But it is unclear whether China or Russia would be willing to allow such a resolution to pass in the Council.
 Officials acknowledged that even if economic sanctions were approved, there would be no way to enforce them along the Chinese border, where most of North Korea's trade takes place.

HEADLINE: In Discussing Ground Zero, Candidates Step Lightly

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

 BODY:
When the news broke on Sunday morning that construction of the Freedom Tower would be delayed because of security concerns at ground zero, Representative Anthony D. Weiner was the one mayoral candidate who pounced immediately.
 Mr. Weiner, a Democrat whose district straddles Brooklyn and Queens, quickly held a 1 p.m. news conference for the sole purpose of attacking the Republican incumbent, Michael R. Bloomberg, over the slow pace of redevelopment in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Weiner argued that the mayor was overly distracted by his plan to build a football stadium on the West Side. 
 In contrast to Mr. Weiner, two of his Democratic competitors in the mayoral race, Fernando Ferrer and C. Virginia Fields, waited until Thursday to make major remarks about the furor over the World Trade Center site, speaking out only after Mr. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki announced that the Freedom Tower would be redesigned to incorporate security concerns. Before that, the two candidates had spent the week championing their own proposals on schools, health care and other issues.
 A fourth Democratic candidate, the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, spoke about the site on Sunday, but he did not make as big a deal out of it as Mr. Weiner -- commenting on the issue during a news conference about crowd control on the Great Lawn in Central Park.
 If the security and the redevelopment of downtown proved fixating this week for the city's political, financial and chattering classes, the reactions of the four Democratic candidates varied widely, providing an early glimpse into the strategic thinking of each campaign on a visceral matter for many New Yorkers.
 Yet the candidates' responses also showed the wariness and even reluctance among politicians to mine Sept. 11 for gain. Even Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat who is running for governor next year, waited until yesterday to issue a statement, saying, ''The project clearly could have been handled better.''
 The delicate political calculus was especially apparent in the campaign of Mr. Weiner, who has styled himself as the most scrappy and fleet-footed Democrat in the race.
 Like Mr. Miller, he is also far behind in most polls, and he has been seeking attention almost anywhere he can find it. But his news conference on Sunday required more careful planning than most, he said.
 He initially considered speaking at ground zero, a natural choice to lure television cameras on a slow Sunday, yet he opted for City Hall to avoid the appearance of exploiting Sept. 11. And rather than scare voters into thinking that the Freedom Tower was unsafe, he used the security issue to argue that Mayor Bloomberg was dangerously distracted by his stadium proposal for the Far West Side.
 ''No political issue is more sensitive than ground zero,'' Mr. Weiner said, ''and you have to be extremely careful how you talk about it.''
 Or not talk about it. As the leading Democrats in the polls, Mr. Ferrer and Ms. Fields were only too happy to let Mayor Bloomberg remain on the ropes over the state of downtown redevelopment, aides said. And both candidates said in separate interviews that they speak about ground zero regularly, but also, they emphasized, responsibly. 
 Some Democrats have privately criticized Mr. Weiner for overdoing the issue when he inserted security-related remarks into a speech on Tuesday about health care.
 Mr. Ferrer, a former Bronx borough president, said, ''I'm speaking every day about the issues facing New York, from safety to economic stability to education.'' 
 And Ms. Fields said: ''Perhaps it would have been better to speak earlier on security, perhaps not -- who knows? I would say my focus on Lower Manhattan Development has been ongoing for years.''
 The fact is that many New York voters may be unaware of the Ferrer and Fields positions on ground zero, political analysts say. By not using their bully pulpits on the issue this week, the two were not widely seen as showing leadership on the issue, or influencing the Pataki-Bloomberg decision on Wednesday to redesign the tower, analysts and some rival Democrats say.
 ''A lot of politicians figure that if the mayor is in the soup, let him stay in the soup,'' said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute and a close observer of the mayoral race. ''But if Freddy and Virginia wanted to exert leadership on the ground zero issue, they didn't succeed.''
 Republican leaders take a slightly different view of the leading Democratic candidates. They say that Ms. Fields, as the Manhattan borough president, could not speak out forcefully because she has done little on the security situation at ground zero; she disagrees, saying that she has pressed for federal financing for emergency preparedness.
 As for Mr. Ferrer, Republicans have taken to belittling him, saying he is now scared of controversial issues after a few early fumbles, like his statement in March that the police shooting of an unarmed African immigrant in 1999 was not a crime.
 ''Virginia Fields has little credibility on ground zero,'' said James A. Ortenzio, the Manhattan Republican Party chairman. ''And Freddy has moved so far back into the cave that he can't see anything.''
 As for Mr. Miller, one of his aides dug up a 2002 report in which the Council speaker raised safety concerns about the trade center site -- proof that he was not to be outdone on the issue, by Mr. Weiner or anyone else. In an interview, Mr. Miller also went further than other Democrats in saying that not only the Freedom Tower but also the entire ground zero master plan should be reconsidered. 
 ''Who comes up with the quippiest quip is not what leadership is about on this issue,'' he said, in a reference to Mr. Weiner. ''I don't want this to be a campaign issue; I want this to be fixed.''

HEADLINE: Groton Anxiously Awaits Closure List

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
JOHN C. MARKOWICZ has spent the last three years leading an effort by business and government officials to protect southeastern Connecticut from the 2005 base-closure process, and in the coming week he will find out whether their efforts have had any effect. By Friday, possibly as early as Tuesday, the Pentagon is to issue a list of the bases it is recommending be shut down to save money.
 For almost a century the submarine base and the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton have been mainstays of the Connecticut economy, and though they have shrunk considerably since the end of the cold war, a report released on Wednesday said they still contribute an estimated $3.3 billion a year and 31,500 jobs to the state economy.
 The report by the state Department of Economic and Community Development said there are about 8,700 jobs at Electric Boat, 2,400 civilian employees at the sub base and the rest of the jobs are in companies that do business with the base or Electric Boat. 
 Mr. Markowicz, chairman of the Subase Realignment Coalition, said he would like to say that the effort is coming down to the homestretch, but in fact, even if the Pentagon recommends the Groton base remain open, there are other hurdles. The base could be added to the list by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, an independent panel established by Congress, which will evaluate the Pentagon's list. The commission has until Oct. 20 to develop a final list. The president and Congress must accept or reject the list in its entirety, which could drag out the process to the end of December.
 ''I'm back and forth -- some days I feel confident, some days I wish we had more time,'' Mr. Markowicz said. ''It's because we're dealing with rumors at this point. I want cold, hard facts.''
 At least after this week, Mr. Markowicz and his supporters will know how much work they face. If Groton is on the list, they will have to redouble their efforts -- it will take a vote by seven of the nine commission members to remove it. If it is not on the list, they will still monitor the commission's work to make sure Groton is not added.
 ''I'm a conservative kind of guy, a worrier,'' Mr. Markowicz said. ''Until that list is approved by the president and goes through the 45-day period in Congress, I won't be sleeping at night. In my mind, this isn't over until Christmas.''
 The Naval Submarine Base has more than 10,000 military and civilian employees, but more than just the base is at stake. Electric Boat, a shipyard about two miles south of the base, would also suffer if the base closed because most of its work today consists of submarine repair. Although John Casey, the president of Electric Boat, has repeatedly said the company would not automatically fold if the base closes, many people believe it could not hold on for long.
 ''For a company that has a single customer, and that customer moves away, that's something that you have to consider,'' said Jeff Blodgett of the Connecticut Economic Resource Center. ''Maybe not the first year or the second year, but by the fifth year or the 10th year they'd probably be looking around and saying, 'We might be able to improve profitability if we were in Virginia or Georgia.'''
 Supporters of the base have tried to turn its proximity to Electric Boat, which designs and builds submarines, into an advantage for the base. They argue that the Navy can put the ships into periodic yearlong overhauls without having to relocate crews and their families, and the submarine crews can more easily advise the company on the design and construction of submarines. In addition, the base is an hour away from the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Newport, R.I., the pre-eminent submarine-warfare research center.
 ''There is no other place in the world, not just the United States, where you have that kind of synergy,'' said Representative Rob Simmons, a Connecticut Republican whose district includes New London. ''If you close the base, you begin the process of unraveling and destroying that industrial base.''
 The coalition has been encouraged by comments from Navy Secretary Gordon England and Admiral Vernon Clark, the chief of naval operations, that they do not want to concentrate all their ships in a handful of bases, which seem to support keeping Groton open because it is the only Navy warship home port north of Virginia on the East Coast.
 In addition, last-minute lobbying by Gov. M. Jodi Rell and others convinced President Bush to put a Connecticut resident, Lloyd Newton, a retired Air Force general and a vice president at Pratt & Whitney in East Hartford, on the base-closure commission.
 ''Certainly, his vast experience and background will serve him well,'' Governor Rell said last month. ''The commission has a very tough job before it. What we wanted to do was make sure there was representation from the Northeast.'' 
 The backers of efforts to save the base know they face a tough battle on other fronts. The Pentagon has said that bases that support joint operations are more likely to survive -- for instance, a base with an airfield to accommodate Navy, Air Force and Marine jets. 
 Because none of the other services operate submarines, there are limits to the number of joint operations the base can support, although the Navy-Marine Corps Reserve Center that used to be in New Haven recently moved to the Groton base, bringing with it 450 drilling reservists. The coalition has been pushing for more cooperation between the base and the Connecticut Army National Guard and for establishment of a joint state-federal Homeland Security office to open at the base.
 But there is little Mr. Markowicz and his group can do about one of the base's most significant vulnerabilities: the declining submarine force. From a cold-war high of 100 submarines, the nation's undersea fleet is barely more than half that today, and most naval analysts expect it will drop to 41 or fewer over the next several years. If it drops far beyond that, the Navy could easily base all its submarines at ports in Norfolk, Va., and Kings Bay, Ga.
 ''I figure as long as there are 16 or more submarines in the Atlantic, we're in pretty good shape, and the higher that number is the more comfortable I would feel,'' Mr. Markowicz said. ''A force of 40 should give us 16 in the Atlantic.''
 The congressional delegation, meanwhile, has ramped up its lobbying effort on the issue. Senators Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph I. Lieberman, both Democrats, met with Anthony J. Principi, the former United States secretary of veterans affairs, within days of the announcement that President Bush had chosen him as chairman of the base closure panel. Mr. Lieberman said Mr. Principi had told him that the military value of a base would be the overarching consideration.
 ''Military value is a factor that goes beyond cost, or money saved, and we've got a strong case to make for the sub base on its military value,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''If you're coming in really concerned about national security, you're not going to close Groton. If you coming in just to save a few bucks, maybe you'd look at it, but it would be a pretty dumb thing to do.''

HEADLINE: A Blog Revolution? Get a Grip

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
DON'T ask Nick Denton, publisher of Gawker Media and its growing list of popular Web logs, about his empire. ''People come up to me as if it's witty and say, 'How is the empire going?''' Mr. Denton said, ''which is pretty pathetic.'' 
 Don't ask him about his business plan, either. He says he never had one. The only reason he formed the company, he said, was to make his network of blogs -- which includes Gawker, the flagship chronicle of Manhattan news and gossip; Fleshbot, the thinking person's diary of smut; and about 10 other titles -- more attractive to advertisers. 
 ''It doesn't help with readers,'' he said. ''It's actually a disadvantage, because it looks corporate.'' 
 At a time when media conferences like ''Les Blogs'' in Paris two weeks ago debate the potential of the form, and when BusinessWeek declares, as it did on its May 2 cover, that ''Blogs Will Change Your Business,'' Mr. Denton is withering in his contempt. A blog, he says, is much better at tearing things down -- people, careers, brands -- than it is at building them up. As for the blog revolution, Mr. Denton put it this way: ''Give me a break.'' 
 ''The hype comes from unemployed or partially employed marketing professionals and people who never made it as journalists wanting to believe,'' he said. ''They want to believe there's going to be this new revolution and their lives are going to be changed.''
 For all of the stiff-arming and disdain that Mr. Denton brings to the discussion of this nonrevolution, however, there is no question that he and his team are trying to turn the online diarist's form -- ephemeral, fast-paced and scathingly opinionated -- into a viable, if not lucrative, enterprise. Big advertisers like Audi, Nike and General Electric have all vied for eyeballs on Gawker's blogs, which Mr. Denton describes as sexy, irreverent, a tad elitist and unabashedly coastal. 
 He says that there is no magic behind Gawker Media, his three-year-old venture based in New York. To his mind, it is built around a basic publishing model. But like it or not in the overheated atmosphere of blog-o-mania, Mr. Denton, 38, remains one of the most watched entrepreneurs in the business. 
 If his reluctance to be interviewed is theater, it is deft theater. A British expatriate and former Financial Times reporter, Mr. Denton is tall, slim, and salt-and-pepper handsome, with the slightly embarrassed air of someone who invested in the dot-com boom and came out unscathed. (He made millions in two previous ventures -- including a company called Moreover Technologies, an online news aggregator that presaged the twitchy, check-this-out linking that now make blogs de rigueur reading for desk jockeys worldwide.) 
 STRIDING toward the unadorned third-floor TriBeCa loft that is the closest thing to a Gawker nerve center, Mr. Denton reiterated, in a polite, sometimes halting staccato that often fades into a string of inaudible syllables, that he would not discuss money. He declined to say if Gawker was profitable, or how much he paid Gawker's dozen or so bloggers -- editors, as the company calls them. 
 He fired up a Marlboro Light and, hustling across Canal Street, chattered obliquely about overhead (minimal in the blogging business), libel (always a concern) and Fred Durst. 
 In March, Mr. Durst, the Limp Bizkit front man, sued Gawker, among other sites, for linking to a sex video in which he appeared. 
 ''Honestly, though, we don't know why you're so mad at us,'' Gawker's editor, Jessica Coen, sneered in a March 4 entry. ''The situation is really rather simple. Someone sent us a link to a video of your penis, we went into shock, and we shared it with the world for about two hours. Then we wept, found God, took a hot bath, and removed the video from our site.''
 Mr. Durst eventually dropped the suit. 
 A grueling climb led to the quiet, whitewashed loft space where a few Gawker Media hands -- including Lockhart Steele, the company's managing editor, and Gina Trapani, the editor of one of the company's newest blogs, Lifehacker -- were plucking away at laptops. (Gawker shares the space with another blogger, Maxwell Gillingham-Ryan of Apartment Therapy.)
 Mr. Steele, who joined the company in February, is the den mother for Gawker's far-flung collection of bloggers and is in near constant communication with them throughout the day via Instant Messenger. About half of the editors live in New York. The rest are distributed around the country. In California, Mark Lisanti edits Defamer, the Los Angeles counterpart to Gawker, and in Colorado, Brian D. Crecente edits one of the newer sites, Kotaku, dedicated to video games. In New Orleans, John d'Addario edits Fleshbot, while Ana Marie Cox covers political gossip from Washington on Wonkette. 
 Each editor is under contract to post 12 times a day for a flat fee, Mr. Steele said. (Gawker has two editors and now posts 24 times a day.) It is best to have eight posts up before noon, if possible, to keep readers coming back, he said. 
 The editors scan the Web for the best tidbits. Readers, and apparently even published authors, send in tips. When a Gawker site highlights articles from, say, The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times, it is likely, both Mr. Steele and Mr. Denton said, that the article's author sent an e-mail message to Gawker pointing out its existence. (This reporter's naivete about this process was met with gentle laughter.)
 Site traffic is a particular obsession. Gawker draws just over a million unique visitors a month; Fleshbot, the most popular site, lures nearly twice that number, and Gizmodo, a site dedicated to gadgets, roughly 1.5 million. All editors can earn bonuses if they manage to generate spikes in traffic -- say, with a link to the latest Paris Hilton crisis or Fred Durst's anatomy. 
 Ms. Trapani's hour-by-hour traffic statistics serve as the desktop image on her computer. ''It's extremely fast paced,'' she said. ''It's a lot of output. Some days it's overwhelming without a doubt. Other days it goes really smoothly if I get some good reader tips and there's something great going on.'' 
 Like Mr. Denton, she was careful not to discuss specifics of Gawker's business, including how much its editors are paid. But a published interview with Mr. Steele earlier this year provides some insight. Bloggers are paid a set rate of $2,500 a month, he told a digital journalism class at New York University taught by Patrick Phillips, the editor and founder of I Want Media, a Web site focusing on media news.
 When asked in the class if the company was in the black, his response was straightforward. ''It is profitable,'' Mr. Steele said. ''We're very small, have no overhead, no office space. Everybody works from home. And you heard what we pay our writers. Nick founded Gawker very specifically with the idea of starting a whole bunch of blogs in very niche topic areas, hire freelance writers to write each of them, hopefully draw a lot of eyeballs and then sell advertising around it. He had the idea that no one site would probably ever make a fortune. But if you have 10 sites each making $75,000 a year, then, O.K., maybe it's not like Conde Nast money, but it's a nice little business.''
 Mr. Denton chafed at the mention of Mr. Steele's interview. He said it was misreported and was supposed to be off the record. Mr. Phillips said that no such arrangement existed, and that the posted interview was an exact transcript from a recording of the session. 
 Whatever the circumstances, for those quivering about the revolutionary potential of blog publishing, or wondering what makes ventures like Gawker tick, there couldn't have been a plainer explanation. 
 The simplicity of the model may be why Mr. Denton is alternately guarded and dismissive of all the hype surrounding blogs. He seems to recognize that he is not up to anything particularly trailblazing, and that it's only a matter of time before others catch on. Competitors like Jason Calacanis's Weblogs, with its network of more than 70 consumer and niche blogs, are already copying the Gawker model. 
 The idea of grouping the blogs, Mr. Denton said, was to give the company an air of respectability. ''The only reason we're listed as a group at all is for advertisers,'' he said. ''Advertisers treat Gawker titles more seriously because it's part of a group.'' 
 In other words, Gawker speaks their language. It has a publication schedule and can traffic in digital marketing babble like ''frequency capping'' (how often an advertising spot runs) and ''skyscrapers'' (tall, thin ads).
 Such familiarity with the ways of Madison Avenue makes a difference in the world of blogs, where marketers still fear to tread, said Jill Griffin, who is now a senior vice president and group account director at Media Contacts, the interactive division of the Media Planning Group of Havas. Earlier, when she was a digital strategist at the marketing firm OMD, Ms. Griffin was one of the first advertising executives to bring big-name clients to blogs -- including Absolut and G.E. to Gawker. 
 ''I think it was in mid-2003,'' Ms. Griffin said. ''It was just myself and some friends and business associates in the professional advertising community. We just started reading Gawker because we thought it was a hoot.'' She said that after realizing that they were all single, young, well-paid and casting their gaze on this fertile space, she thought, ''We've got to get on that.'' 
 On the Gawker sites, C.P.M. rates -- the cost for every 1,000 times an ad is presumably seen by visitors -- can run anywhere from $4 for a small, button-sized ad to $50 for exclusive-sponsorship ads, in which an advertiser helps underwrite the debut of a new Gawker site. (Sony did this for Gawker's blog Lifehacker.) 
 Mr. Denton says that a clear line is drawn between news and advertising, and that so far none of the companies buying space on the sites -- including the Times auto section, which advertised on the car blog Jalopnik -- have ever tried to influence content. The editors are expected to write a ''thank-you to our sponsors'' at the end of each week, although this is typically done sarcastically -- for example, thanking advertisers for keeping the staff well-stocked in crack cocaine. 
 ''It goes beyond any kind of question of church and state or journalistic ethics that the whole editorial tone of the Gawker sites is absolutely wrapped up in the notion of take no prisoners,'' Mr. Denton said. ''It owes nothing to anybody, and if one ever started compromising that, it would be grim.'' 
 But others have begun to wonder if the brand itself is a form of compromise. Stowe Boyd, president of Corante, a daily online news digest on the technology sector, suggests that there may be something lost when networks like Gawker Media and Weblogs turn blogs into commodities, churned out for a fee, owned by an overlord and underwritten by advertisers. 
 ''They're pursuing a very clear agenda and they've done very well with that,'' Mr. Boyd said of Gawker. ''But they're just an old media company in new media clothes, and I still maintain that they are missing part of the point.'' 
 The point, Mr. Boyd said, is that blogging is unique because of its spontaneity and individualism, and that bloggers, like dancers and sculptors, are most interesting because they are ''pursuing their muse.'' 
 The editors on Gawker are talented, entertaining and informative, Mr. Boyd said, but also indistinguishable from any freelance writer, with no ownership of what they produce. ''These people are hirelings,'' he said. ''What they are cranking out are the 700 words they signed on to produce.'' 
 Other critics of the blog movement wonder whether the hoopla over the commercial viability of blogs -- particularly as publishing ventures -- is overstated. ''Blogs primarily excel at marketing and promotion for companies or individuals,'' Mr. Phillips of I Want Media said. ''I think blogging can catapult unknown writers, and it can give them a platform if they're talented. But as a stand-alone business, I think the jury is still out on that.'' 
 Mr. Denton, who says that no one, least of all him, is becoming rich publishing blogs, would seem to agree with that notion. It's not about the money, he said -- or about corrupting the art of the blogger. ''If someone is saying that we publish according to a routine of at least 12 posts a day and begin in the morning and if someone is sick we replace them, then I plead guilty,'' he said. ''We believe in regular posting schedules.'' 
 But he also says that nothing he is doing prevents other blogging models from taking shape, or independent bloggers from logging on and doing what they have always done. ''Some of my own favorite sites are ones that have no consistency beyond the wit and charm of the writer,'' he said. ''There's room for both.''
 And there is, apparently, a ceiling on Gawker's expansion. Last month, the company started Sploid, a Drudge-like headline news blog with a tabloid look, and Mr. Denton says two more titles are planned for the short term, although he would not be specific about the particular consumer itches he'll be scratching this time. Having covered everything from BlackBerries to Beltway gossip, it's hard to imagine what else looms, but he said writers had already been lined up.
 That will bring the number of titles to 14, and Mr. Denton indicated that 17 seemed a good stopping point, if for no other reason than that is the number of titles published by Conde Nast. 
 He also plans to reintroduce Gawker's ''blog of blogs,'' called Kinja -- a service that even Mr. Denton says was rather badly deployed and even more awkwardly explained in its original form. A team of programmers has been working for the last two years to revamp the service, which allows users to explore and scan their favorite blogs in one place. The new version will be ready in about a month. 
 SO, onward goes the nonrevolution. ''If you take the amount of attention that has been devoted in the last year to Web logs as a business and something that's going to change business and compare that with the real effect and the real money, it's totally disproportionate,'' Mr. Denton said, ''in the same way all the coverage of the Internet in the late 90's was out of whack.
 ''There are too many people looking at blogs as being some magic bullet for every company's marketing problem, and they're not,'' he added. ''It's Internet media. It's just the latest iteration of Internet media.''

HEADLINE: Playground on the Air

BYLINE: By HERB SCANNELL; As told to Amy Zipkin.

 BODY:
MY mother's from Puerto Rico and my father's from Boston. Starting from the time I was 8 or 9 my brother, two sisters and I would go down from Huntington, N.Y., to Puerto Rico for several weeks during the summer with my mother and stay at my Aunt Josie's house. She had a three-bedroom apartment in the Miramar section of San Juan, and my brother and I slept on an open-air porch, really a terrace.
 My brother was six years older, and I wanted to be a teenager. Every morning we'd walk over to the hotels, the Caribe Hilton or the Normandie, sneak into the lobby and pretend we were guests. We'd bring our snorkel masks and stay all day long and just be beach boys. There was a sense of freedom with beach life. It wasn't a vacation like the other kids in the neighborhood had. They went to Pennsylvania Dutch Country or Vermont. 
 I went to Boston College. A lot of people were on the college radio station, WZBC-FM, because they hoped to get jobs in radio afterward. I looked at it as a big playground. Punk and new wave, and the music that came out in the late 1970's as a reaction to the overblown progressive rock, were bubbling up in a lot of different places. I wanted to run the radio station and wrote an application to student activities, and ended up competing against the person who had been my boss. I wanted it to be more about personal taste and less about a training ground. I got the job. I was a junior and WZBC-FM became an alternative radio station. The station became really respected in Boston.
 I couldn't get a job in radio when I graduated. I didn't know a lot of people in radio and my parents were social workers with no connection in the media. So I looked at the classifieds and found a job in admissions at Baruch College. I went to high schools, set up a table and talked to students about the school. 
 It was a tough experience. The city was coming out of an economic crisis in the 1970's and I went to every school -- good, bad and indifferent. It was eye-opening. One day I went out to East New York. From the elevated No.3 line I could see a lot of buildings were burned out. One of the few pockets of activity in the area was at the school.
 After a year, a friend helped me get a job in the promotion department at WHN, the country music station. I rode the subways there, too, to monitor our advertising campaign. And I would count how many posters of Dolly Parton, Crystal Gayle and Kenny Rogers were on each subway line. Shortly after I got there the vice president of the department left the company, as did the promotion director and promotion manager. I became the de facto head of the department at age 22. I learned a lot. 
 I came to Nickelodeon from Showtime and had been here two years when I got the idea to develop a show where a 12-year-old talked directly to the audience. It was called ''Clarissa Explains It All.'' It defied conventional wisdom at the time. This was 1989. Shows were always made starring boys, because boys will watch boys and girls will watch boys. And I asked, ''Why can't a girl have a show of her own?''
 I took this live-action-character idea and soon different women from the company started commenting about it: ''I like Clarissa, but I think she's too pretty.'' ''I like Clarissa, but think she should shop in the Junior Miss department.'' 
 I took the idea to a focus group, and the room was packed with women executives on one side and children on the other side of a one-way mirror.
 Then the moderator asked the children, ''What do you think of the show?'' One girl said: ''I think my parents should watch it. I think they would understand me better.'' And I breathed a sigh of relief. The show went on the air in 1991.

HEADLINE: In Western Resorts, Second-Home Boom Is Paying the Rent

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: VAIL, Colo., May 4 

 BODY:
Like many a ski bum before her, Jodi Link waits on tables to make ends meet. But her dreams go far beyond the next epiphany of perfect snow or a perfect run. 
 In January, Ms. Link and a friend, Brooke Burgee, founded a two-woman company called Lights On that offers hotel-style concierge services to absentee second-home owners and part-time vacation renters here in the high country of central Colorado. They will find a fly-fishing instructor, wash the sheets or do the shopping. If the business takes off, Ms. Link, 27, vows that she has waitressed her last.
 So enter two more competitors into the multibillion-dollar second-home industry, which has increasingly dominated -- some critics say swallowed -- the economic and social life of Vail and other resorts. 
 Tourism and real estate have always been harnessed together in vacation spots: people come for a visit and end up scanning the classified advertisements in search of ''2brs, fplc and vu.'' But more and more, housing and the jobs it creates are the economic engine. Here in Eagle County, where about half the housing stock is owned by people who live somewhere else, the world famous ski slopes have become just another amenity that homeowners demand, along with golf and shopping. 
 Some longtime residents bemoan the change. They say that a culture of real-estate calculation, and the sprawling swirl of stores and services catering to the needs of outside owners, are strangling the soul of an area that once prided itself on its distance from the madding crowd. 
 Others, like Ms. Link and Ms. Burgee, a 26-year-old Vermont native who discovered Vail's business charms last year on vacation, mostly see benefits. 
 Work in the second-home industry, they say, tames the up-and-down seasonal cycles of tourism. The jobs generally pay much better than restaurant or hotel work, and the work never ends. Structures made of wood need constant upkeep at an elevation of 8,500 feet, and new owners are prone to renovate. 
 Of the 33,530 jobs in Eagle County in 2002, 45 percent were tied to the second-home industry, according to a study by the Northwest Colorado Council of Governments, a municipal planning and research group. Only 27 percent were generated by winter and summer tourism. The money fueling the local economy was almost as lopsided, with an estimated 38 percent derived from spending by second-home owners, compared with 31 percent from tourism. 
 Tourism experts say many other resort communities are probably moving along the same track as Vail, although few have been studied as thoroughly. The pattern, they say, has become well established in the Rockies, from Aspen to Whistler Blackcomb in Canada: visitors become owners, and owners remake resorts in their image. 
 ''Invariably, there's some kind of point where, because of investment in the community, people start to say, 'We want this place changed to meet our needs,''' said Prof. Peter W. Williams, the director of the Center for Tourism Policy and Research at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia. ''It's subtle at first, but then the new entrants become the power brokers.'' 
 State officials say that the second-home wave came late to Colorado compared with the oceanfront areas on the East and West coasts. But the lag meant that second-home building coincided with a national surge in wealth in the 1990's. Flying to a second home in the mountains was suddenly within the reach of more people, who could pour more money into bigger and more opulent getaways.
 ''Housing has come to mean much more than just sleeping quarters for skiing,'' said Elizabeth W. Slifer, the president of Slifer Designs, an interior design firm specializing in Eagle County's second-home market. ''Now it's more about estate planning and retirement and social status.'' 
 The housing surge also created a kind of demographic time bomb as more owners -- the average age is around 55 -- approach retirement. No one knows how many may decide to retire to Eagle County, where the population has doubled since 1990 and is expected to double again in the next 20 years, to about 80,000. 
 The state demographer, Jim Westkott, said he thought even those numbers might underestimate the growth. If the individual choices of thousands of second-home owners coalesce around Vail, he said, Colorado's newest metropolitan area, defined as any population center of 100,000 people or more, could emerge here almost overnight. 
 ''The more full-time residents you have, the more full-time workers you need, and that means more schools, more malls and more traffic,'' Mr. Westkott said. ''Somewhere around 2010, when the baby-boomers turn 65, or sometime thereafter, is when it's all going to start.''
 Some resort industry experts and local residents say image itself could become a problem, if a gray-haired, relaxed-fit style starts to supplant the scruffy mystique of footloose outdoor adventure that resorts like Vail depend on.
 ''The new people don't want it difficult, they want it easy,'' said Greg Johnson, 52, who came here 31 years ago from Washington, and now makes his living as a carpenter, working mostly on high-end second homes. ''There was no shopping: if you wanted Denver stuff you went to Denver, and people liked it that way. Now they're turning this place to what we all left behind.'' 
 Officials at Vail Resorts, and in the town government, scoff at the notion that aging owners of second homes are a threat. Older people might have their names on the deed, they say, but extended families are often the biggest users, and that means a constant injection of new blood and new exposure to the area.
 ''The 55-year-old wants to have Vail speak to their grandchildren,'' said Suzanne Silverthorne, who as an information officer for the town of Vail often communicates by e-mail with far-flung second-home owners about town business. 
 Ms. Silverthorne's list includes many people in the Denver area, about 90 minutes away by car, but the numbers of owners in New York, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles are not far behind. 
 In many ways, urban planners say, the second-home phenomenon is creating a social experiment, with three classes thrust together in one place: the owners, the year-round local service workers who supply and cater to the owners, and the seasonal resort workers who are increasingly being drawn from foreign countries. 
 Colorado ranked second in the nation last year, after Texas, in the number of temporary work visas, many of them for work in the ski resorts. Eagle County planning officials say that 36,000 people could be commuting into the county every day by 2025 from elsewhere in Colorado. 
 ''How do you integrate these three separate groups into a sense of community as we have traditionally thought of it?'' said Prof. Patrick T. Long, who teaches tourism planning and sustainable tourism at the business school at the University of Colorado at Boulder. ''I don't think we know the answer yet.''
 At Lights On, ambition and hope are the driving forces. As Ms. Link and Ms. Burgee folded towels, hung a picture and checked on a hot tub at one of their houses on a recent afternoon, their talk was full of buzz about networking and business leads.
 Eventually, they say, they will need to start hiring people themselves and have already given some thought to what kinds of employees they want and do not want. Punctuality is essential, which eliminates, they say, the stereotypical ski bum. 
 ''The typical transient worker in Vail is a snowboarder by day who has trouble showing up for work in the morning,'' Ms. Link said. ''That's the kind of person we're trying to eliminate from our lists.''

HEADLINE: Market Has a Good Week Despite Bad News

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market rallied last week, despite epochal news that was, on the face, mostly negative. General Motors and Ford, two bulwarks of the American economy, had their bond ratings cut to junk status on Thursday. 
Standard & Poor's said the action reflected the carmakers' long-term ''competitive disadvantages.'' 
 G.M. shares might be expected to plummet on such news, and drop they did -- but not as much as they rose earlier in the week, after the financier Kirk Kerkorian said he would increase his stake in G.M. to nearly 9 percent of the stock. G.M. closed with a weekly gain of 15.3 percent, the biggest in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 Some investors saw Mr. Kerkorian's bid as a sign that the market was undervalued, and for the week, the Dow rose 152.89 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 10,345.40. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 14.5 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 1,171.35. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 45.7 points, or 2.4 percent, to close at 1,967.35. 
 In the bond market, the Treasury said that it might bring back the 30-year bond -- an indication that government debt is likely to grow. Nevertheless, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose only slightly, to 4.26 percent from 4.20 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Whoops! We Seem to Have Misplaced Your Identity

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is a historian and author based in Silicon Valley. E-mail:ddomain@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE diesel-powered utility van is the unappreciated speed demon of the digital age. Even lumbering along city streets in stop-and-go traffic, it can move a trillion bytes of corporate data across town far faster than if they were sent across the Internet.
 The homely Ford Econoline 350 is the workhorse of Iron Mountain, the dominating presence in the off-site data protection business. Its customers include more than three-fourths of Fortune 500 companies, and it had revenue of $1.82 billion last year, earned largely out of public sight as its unmarked vans shuttled among the back-office operations of its clients.
 Last week, however, Iron Mountain lost the luxury of going about its rounds invisibly. Time Warner, one of its clients, disclosed that personal information -- including names and Social Security numbers for 600,000 current and former employees -- had gone missing six weeks earlier while in the care of an unnamed ''leader in data storage.'' 
 The data had been, in fact, in an Iron Mountain van, and the few details about the incident that it and Time Warner have grudgingly divulged -- such as the fact that the pick-up at Time Warner was 1 of 19 the van made bouncing around Manhattan on the fateful day -- raise all sorts of questions.
 To begin with, why would such sensitive information be handled less like a guard-this-with-your-life briefcase entrusted to Brinks than like a fungible bundle handed to the Dy-Dee Diaper Service? Why was the data unencrypted? And why were trucks involved at all? 
 Why wasn't the backup done via a secure online connection, an option that Iron Mountain offers as well as physical pickup? Why doesn't Iron Mountain eliminate the risk of midroute problems and retire its fleet of Econolines? 
 Time Warner blamed Iron Mountain for the potential breach of confidential employee information and would say nothing more about the event. Its tapes were last seen on Iron Mountain's vans, so its position is that it's Iron Mountain's responsibility; end of discussion.
 Iron Mountain, for its part, gallantly declined to take Time Warner to task. It could have done so by saying how foolish Time Warner had been to send out sensitive personnel files in unencrypted form. Then again, Iron Mountain itself had failed to advise clients to encrypt files until April 21, when it issued a press release on the subject. This was too late to help Time Warner, whose tapes had disappeared a month earlier.
 Time Warner has now publicly vowed to floss regularly and encrypt always.
 Iron Mountain has adopted a scattershot approach in its public appeal for exoneration. Disappearing tapes -- what its chief executive, C. Richard Reese, calls ''inadvertent disclosures'' -- are a rare problem: 12 instances for every five million pick-ups or deliveries. Mr. Reese said he viewed the rarity of error as exemplary.
 Jim Stickley, one of the founders and the chief technical officer of Trace Security, a consulting firm based in Baton Rouge, La., is not impressed: ''Imagine the Secret Service said that about presidents: 'Well, we protected most of them.'''
 Another argument pressed by Iron Mountain is that it knows of no instance when the loss of tapes has ''resulted in the unauthorized access of personal information.'' Then again, have previous problems involved tapes filled with 600,000 names and matching Social Security numbers thoughtfully left unencrypted?
 Iron Mountain also takes too much comfort in the fact that the missing tapes are labeled only with a bar code. The company reasons that a thief in search of Time Warner's employees would not know which van to hit and which tapes to grab.
 But why assume a crime of planning and cunning? If the tapes landed accidentally in the hands of someone, who knew someone with the technical competence to take a look at their contents -- in unencrypted form, not a difficult feat -- what person of ill motive would toss aside those 600,000 names and Social Security numbers?
 Iron Mountain's best defense is that its reliance on trucks, which must be loaded and unloaded by all-too-fallible humans, is unavoidable for technical reasons. Online backups are not feasible for large companies, given the sheer mass of data, which has grown faster than the bandwidth of corporate Internet connections.
 Illustrative numbers provided by Iron Mountain would seem to settle the question. Consider a customer with 22,500 gigabytes (22.5 terabytes) of data that need to be ready for recovery from a disaster. Compressed -- and, one hopes, encrypted -- these fit onto 300 backup tapes, easily transported by the Econoline.
 Now consider the challenge of alternatively moving that data over the wire. Even with a pair of OC3 lines, each with 250 times the bandwidth of a home broadband connection, you would need more than 82 hours to send one set -- though let's not forget that 8 to 10 hours are saved because tapes do not have to be created. 
 And if disaster were to strike, it would take 82 hours to send these terabytes back over the wire for restoration. That's why ''we're not driving the truck out of the equation,'' Mr. Reese said.
 THE example, however, best matches a picture in which the computing resources of the largest corporation consist of a single mainframe, all of its many terabytes of data concentrated in one place, susceptible to a single disaster.
 Bud Stoddard, the chief executive of AmeriVault, a rival company based in Boston that offers online backup services, says corporate data is distributed across thousands of servers and desktops. ''Disasters happen every day, but they hit a server, or a department, or a building.'' he said. ''They do not take out an enterprise's total data set.''
 His company -- as well as Iron Mountain -- offers online disaster protection by copying data via the Internet to off-site servers. This eliminates the problem of limited bandwidth, as only incremental changes to a file, not the entire file, need to be sent. It also eliminates another potential problem: a faulty tape, discovered only when it is needed for restoration. 
 Because of falling storage and bandwidth costs, it's now economically feasible to prepare for disaster by going digital instead of diesel, using a secure Internet connection to make an offsite mirror image of a corporation's vital data. 
 And should catastrophe strike, a company need not wait hours or days for its backup data to return by wire: AmeriVault can load 500 gigabytes of backed-up data onto a portable drive, then speed it to a client. For that rare emergency, the trusty Econoline can be summoned for duty.
 Had Time Warner used the Internet to back up its data, the company would not now find itself reassuring its millions of subscribers -- 21.7 million on AOL alone -- that only employee information was in the missing tapes. 
 The company has offered to the individuals listed in the database a one-year subscription to Equifax's Credit Watch service. Iron Mountain has not stepped forward to pick up the bill. It adheres to the same view as photo processors: if something goes wrong when your film is in their possession, they'll replace the film, but they take no responsibility for the lost photos.
 ''Under standard liability, we are not responsible for the information stored on the tape,'' said Melissa Burman, an Iron Mountain spokeswoman. ''That's because we never know what information is stored on any particular backup tape.'' 
 But when a missing tape could expose hundreds of thousands of people to identity theft through no fault of their own, many of whom may retain lawyers happy to work on contingency, Iron Mountain and similar companies are probably glad they never know the contents.
 This unfortunate event, seemingly similar to a long list of recently revealed security incidents involving other companies and organizations, should stand apart for one reason: it could have been avoided so easily. It would have been a nonevent had Time Warner encrypted its personnel files before shipping them. 
 Mr. Stickley of Trace Security advocates making encryption a matter of law: ''The government should be stepping in and say, 'You must encrypt information that can ruin people's lives,''' he said. ''It's that simple.''

HEADLINE: The Oz of the Middle East

BYLINE: By SETH SHERWOOD. 
SETH SHERWOOD is a freelance writer based in Paris.

 BODY:
DOWN gleaming silvery escalators they glided, eyes afire and credit cards in easy reach. As a warm Tuesday night hung languidly over the Persian Gulf, a multicultural pageant of shoppers, diners and drinkers fanned out into the majestic, wintry-cool shopping mall beneath the Middle East's tallest building, the 1,163-foot Emirates Office Tower in Dubai. 
 Indian matrons in colorful saris and Middle Eastern women in black veils strolled through the pristine, white marble corridors, pausing to consider the worthiness of Gucci totes, Bottega Veneta shoes and Cartier diamonds. White-robed Middle Eastern businessmen, fat gold watches glittering from the edges of their sleeves, talked into green-glowing cellphones. Three Arab men in baggy jeans, looking like cast members from an Al Jazeera version of ''The O.C.,'' chatted warmly with three young European-looking women in spangly tops. Just behind them, boisterous British expatriates in business suits tried to push into the fray of Ladies' Night at an overpacked bar called Scarlett's. 
 Outside, night-shift taxis and BMW's streamed down crowded highways, cruising near the soaring, sail-shaped Burj Al Arab, which bills itself as the world's highest hotel -- snaking around the rising foundation for the world's tallest building (the Burj Dubai, which at more than 2,300 feet, will surpass the current pretender, the 1,667-foot Taipei 101, when it opens in 2008), and skirting the construction sites for two competing retail projects, each of which insists it will be the largest shopping mall in the world. 
 From out there, the illuminated Emirates Office Tower, rising silently over the throbbing music at Scarlett's, and its nearly identical neighbor, the slightly shorter Emirates Hotel Tower, looked like flaming arrows shooting toward the stars.
 Bigger, taller, grander, richer, only. Dubai, one of the seven city-states of the United Arab Emirates, has already undergone an extreme makeover, in less than a decade, that would awe the most ambitious builder. And as it continues trying to write its own chapter in the record books, travelers from all over the globe are coming to luxuriate in otherworldly thread counts and truffle-loaded restaurants at the five-star hotels; romp in the surf at fine white beaches (bikinis allowed); dance to tunes spun by international D.J.'s in myriad nightclubs; and fill shopping bags, unhindered by sales taxes, at dozens of malls and the gold souk, the largest gold market in the world.
 ''Dubai will shock anyone who isn't from Las Vegas, Nev.,'' said Ole Bech-Petersen, 35, a Danish advertising executive, who pronounced himself ''completely seduced'' after his first trip to Dubai in March, when he stayed at the plush Emirates Hotel Tower, dined at the Burj Al Arab's underwater restaurant and made impulse buys in the gold souk and the new Mercato shopping mall.
 Cynthia Moureto, a retailer in her 20's from Manhattan, sampled Dubai with her sister in February and came away equally impressed. ''We'd heard from people that it was a very up-and-coming city full of great shopping and wonderful hotels, lots of tourists, lots of new business opportunities, lots of action, lots to do,'' she said. ''They were right.'' She and her sister soaked up treatments at the Shangri-La hotel's spa and partied until the wee hours with an international crowd at the Trilogy nightclub.
 Some 5.45 million travelers passed through the gates of this Middle Eastern Xanadu in 2004, a 9 percent jump over the year before and a nearly 20-fold increase from a mere decade earlier, according to Pascal Maigniez, the director of the Paris office of the Government of Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing. Two-thirds came on business, bound for places like Internet City, a five-year-old office park with offices of hundreds of technology companies including Microsoft, Oracle, I.B.M., Siemens and Sony. But more and more, Dubai is a tourist destination.
 ''When I first started going to Dubai, no one had heard of it,'' said Sandra Morgan, 42, who lives near London and has visited seven times in the past few years. ''Now everyone wants to go.'' She likes the array of ethnic restaurants, the long beachfront and good values -- especially in jewelry -- and feels a friendly vibe. ''The service is great,'' she said, ''the hotels are first-class, and there are so many shops.'' 
 Joining the pleasure seekers and international executives are the fortune seekers, rich and poor, who fly in from India, Pakistan, Iran, Lebanon, the Philippines, Europe, Australia and South Africa. Only a fifth of Dubai's resident population of 1.2 million is made up of citizens. The other 80 percent are expatriates, including an underclass of foreign workers in construction and menial jobs, and though Arabic is the official language, English, the language of commerce, holds this global gumbo together. Only a third of Dubai's residents are female.
 To accommodate the arriving masses, Emirates Airlines is spending $19 billion to scoop up 45 of the world's largest passenger planes, the new Airbus A380. 
 Concerned that Dubai is running out of beachfront, its crown prince, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, is having three palm-tree-shaped islands created on sand being dredged from the Gulf and held in place by enormous plastic membranes. Plans for the property include opulent apartment towers and as many as 100 new hotels, including Hydropolis, billed as the earth's first underwater resort. Also coming is an archipelago of artificial islands resembling a map of the earth, covered with plush part-time residences for far-flung millionaires and billionaires and called simply The World.
 ''It's like Sea Monkeys!'' Laurence Thorpe, a frequent business traveler from Australia, shouted one evening between sips of Stella Artois beer in a deafeningly loud beachfront club-restaurant called Boudoir. (Sea Monkeys are a novelty powder, really dried brine shrimp, that transforms into swimming creatures in water.) ''You start with nothing, just sand,'' he said, as a sea of well-off Lebanese travelers and expatriate professionals danced around him, toasting in Arabic and French. ''You add water and -- presto --instant city!'' 
 Actually, you add oil. Petroleum has underwritten Dubai's boom. But its reserves will be depleted within a decade, and the country's rulers have deliberately diversified the economy. Oil now accounts for just 8 percent of national income. Tourism brings in 17 percent. 
 Dubai is a metropolis of bone-white apartment blocks, green palm trees and amazing, odd juxtapositions. Thudding jackhammers mingle with the call to prayer. At Nad al Sheba racetrack, old-world camel racing by day gives way to glitzy thoroughbred action by night (the $6 million purse for one annual race in Dubai is, of course, the world's richest). Cruising the city by taxi on a five-day visit in February, I was reminded of the hot, flat sprawl of Tampa or Houston -- until I glimpsed a fully veiled woman driving alongside my cab and saw two men in checkered headdresses pulling their Lamborghinis parallel to chat. Glossy financial magazines share rack space with titles like International Falconer. 
 Buried deeper among the commercial towers and retail palaces, you can still find traces of the old Dubai, a sleepy fishing and pearl-diving village that grew into a modest city in the 19th century, fueled by trading and, some say, smuggling. Hidden in the Bastakiya neighborhood, where Arab and South Asian laborers pay a few coins to be ferried on traditional timber boats across Dubai Creek, are the city's oldest building, a late-18th-century fort holding the Dubai Museum, and its newest cultural innovation, its first gallery district.
 A local art scene is ''finally getting there,'' I was told by Sana Khan, a New Jersey transplant who manages XVA, a gallery, cafe and guesthouse in a converted barjeel, a traditional mansion with a rectangular open-air tower and a courtyard soaring wind tower. 
 Dark hair pulled back and wearing a loose-fitting black dress, she shuffled around an art-book-lined office while in the nearby exhibition area some middle-aged British women admired grainy photographs of Parisian street scenes and pocketed invitations to an opening for an Iraqi textile artist. But for a city of its size, Dubai still has surprisingly little cultural life. 
 The city has worked at image-building by holding golf and tennis tournaments featuring the likes of Tiger Woods and Venus Williams, and playing host to an international film festival and meetings of the World Bank. But overwhelmingly, a trip to Dubai is about sun and sand, food and partying -- and above all, shopping. 
 The merchandise hunt reaches a glittering zenith in the gold souk, a network of streets where 400 storefronts drip with gold necklaces, earrings, watches, brooches, rings and toe rings. With the heat, the 24-karat cornucopia can be so exhausting to absorb that roving men with trays of Fanta sodas and bottled water -- freelance waiters, basically -- do good business offering refreshments to the sweating tide of dumbstruck international shoppers. The market's shadier dealers approach strolling tourists with unsubtle come-ons like ''Hey, Boss, Bulgari-Tivoli-Gucci-Movado?'' 
 The nearby spice souk, where the merchant stalls are crowded with large bins of fragrant saffron, coriander and other exotic ingredients, is considerably more tranquil. 
 Eventually, however, all roads lead to the malls -- 40 of them, purveying everything from Korean toys to luxury cars and struggling to differentiate themselves from one another. Wafi City Mall works at rising above the crowd with an Egyptian theme, featuring ersatz pyramids and sphinxes; the planned Ibn Battuta Mall, named for an Arab explorer, will borrow architectural elements from countries he visited, including Persia, China and India. The developers say that it will also hold the world's largest maze.
 On a busy afternoon at Mercato Mall, a colonnaded fantasyland modeled on a Renaissance-era Mediterranean village, the retail fever was epidemic. Emirati boys in white dishdashas and new baseball caps queued up for ''Meet the Fockers.'' Heavily made-up Iranian women in black chadors fingered sunglasses and flashy scarves in a clubwear boutique. Russian tourists, arms well tanned from days at the beach, swiped credit cards at Cerutti and Nine West. 
 The city was celebrating what seemed a redundant event: the 10th annual Dubai Shopping Festival, basically a giddy month of sales and giveaways that rakes in more than a billion dollars a year, drawing feverish interest with a series of raffles with lavish prizes like a personal fleet of 10 Nissans. ''One World, One Family, One Festival,'' ubiquitous signs declared, appealing to humanity's universal desire for a Chanel pantsuit. 
 At the Mercato's noisy Starbucks, two Libyan hipsters sat down with their lattes, visibly tired. ''We've been mall-hopping all day,'' said Sufian Swed, a 24-year-old from Tripoli who was working in Dubai. He added with a laugh, ''It's kind of sad.'' His friend, 29, an import-export specialist named Mohamed Abdulsaloum, surveyed the afternoon's haul: a nutrition book and some sweaters. ''I think they bump the prices up two weeks before the festival and then knock them down and call it a discount,'' he said. Then they pulled out the day's main score, two Dubai Shopping Festival souvenir coins. Each one represented an entry in a drawing to win 100 kilograms of gold. 
 The festival's heady atmosphere can inspire outlandish behavior. One afternoon I watched a line of contestants hurl squadrons of paper airplanes into a slowly revolving convertible in hopes of driving it home. And at my hotel that evening, I held the elevator door for a college-age Middle Eastern woman loaded down by bags bursting with huge boxes of Kellogg's Corn Flakes. 
 ''You came all the way to Dubai to buy cornflakes?'' I asked in disbelief.
 She shot me a confused, slightly offended look. ''I love cornflakes,'' she said at last. 
 To fuel the legions of global power shoppers, Dubai bursts with restaurants. The slick Asha's, owned by the famous Indian singer Asha Bhosle, serves upscale Indian food. Fine French cuisine comes courtesy of another celebrity, the foul-mouthed former Scottish soccer player Gordon Ramsay, who landed three Michelin stars for the London restaurant that bears his name before starring in his own British reality television series, ''Hell's Kitchen.''
 Downscale dining, though harder to find, can be more interesting. At Ravi, in a neighborhood of working-class South Asians and Iranians, men in long, loose shirts sit elbow to elbow devouring rice, curries and soft nan, the hand serving as spoon and fork. If you go there, order the succulent cubes of grilled mutton tikka -- the waiter will resign himself to seeking real cutlery when he sees you're a stranger in town. At the waterside Fatafeet restaurant, couples smoke fragrant apple tobacco from the long tubes of billowing shisha pipes while families feast on tabbouleh and pomegranate juice. 
 Many Dubai vacationers bring children, who play at the beach and hurtle downhill on water slides at the Wild Wadi Water Park. In a challenge to a typical tourist reaction in Dubai -- that the whole place is an overgrown Disney World -- an immense patch of sand near downtown is now being transformed into a new $19 billion theme park, Dubailand, described on its Web site as ''the biggest, most varied leisure, entertainment and tourism attraction on the planet.'' 
 At twilight at the week's end, you can almost hear the shouts of ''Thank God it's Thursday.'' With no work on Friday, the Muslim Sabbath, Dubai goes into session as the Middle East party capital. From cheesy populist clubs animated by Filipino cover bands to the exclusive Skyview Bar at the Burj Al Arab hotel -- where admission requires reservations days ahead and a cover charge of $45 (170 dirhams, at 3.75 dirhams to the dollar) -- the Arabian night promises conviviality for every social stratum. Yet until the Maktoums build something along the lines of a liquorland -- not likely in Islamic Dubai -- alcohol is generally restricted to hotels, which can seem more like towering night life complexes where some people happen to sleep.
 Amid the hullabaloo one Thursday at MIX, a huge club in a playful curvy-silver space that suggests both Frank Gehry and Dr. Seuss, the young expats bouncing to Nelly and 50 Cent didn't even notice T-Bone, a popular London D.J., as he slalomed through the mostly Anglophone crowd, the only black man in the place, and sidled up to the densely packed bar to wait for his turn in the D.J. booth.
 Across town, in the Moroccan-themed Tangerine, a 20-something woman in a white miniskirt hung on to the sleeve of a 60-something man in an ill-fitting tweed blazer as both leaned jauntily against a wall. Whatever they spoke about, mouth to ear, was obliterated by the deafening, chest-crushing hip-hop beat that resounded off the carved wooden screens and mosaic tile floor.
 In a dark corner nearby, a beanpole-like bald man from Liverpool looked at the odd old-young crowd and ersatz North African decor and made a remark that is probably repeated at least once every day in Dubai. ''The whole thing is totally fake,'' he said to his date, ''but no one seems to care.'' 

In Dubai, to Buy, to Eat and to Stay

Getting There
 Emirates, www.emirates.com, the national carrier for the United Arab Emirates, operates flights from Kennedy airport to Dubai International, with one stop. As of late April, fares in May started at $1,138. International carriers like Air France and Alitalia have one-stop flights to Dubai from New York. Continental, in partnership with Emirates, offers flights from Newark that connect through London or Paris. Fares start at $1,072. 

Getting Around
 Dubai has three main areas. Deira, the easternmost section of the city, is home to the major souks, the airport and several top hotels. Bur Dubai is the catch-all term for the many districts in the city's geographical and commercial center. Jumeirah, the coastal strip in the southwestern part of the city, contains many luxurious beachfront hotels.
 Taxis are the most efficient means of getting around. Clean and abundant, they congregate at city hotels, malls and landmarks, and they can be hailed on the street. Fares operate according to the meter. Expect to pay $2.50 to $4 (prices based on 3.75 dirhams to the dollar) to cruise around Bur Dubai, $5 to $8 to go from Bur Dubai to Deira and $8 to $13 to make the trip from Bur Dubai to Jumeirah.
 Numbered street addresses in Dubai tend to be vague or nonexistent. Fortunately, taxi drivers know the locations of nearly all the hotels, malls and major points of interest that travelers visit. If your destination isn't one of these, try to take along a map and a phone number for the driver.

Security
 The United Arab Emirates maintains good relations with the United States. Still, it's perhaps worth noting that three of the Sept. 11 hijackers were from the emirates, and the country's proximity to reported terrorist hot spots -- notably Saudi Arabia -- has caused some Western governments like those of Britain and Australia to issue general warnings about travel in the region. 

Where to Stay
 With dozens of five-star hotels available and scads more on the drawing board, the city is a head-spinning buffet of gargantuan lobbies and stratospheric thread counts. In this country, three- or four-star hotels provide the ''budget'' option.
 Madinat Jumeirah, (971-4) 366-8888, online at www.madinatjumeirah.com, the most discussed mammoth property of the last year, is a sprawling seaside complex containing two Arabian-themed hotels, 29 luxurious guest houses, a recreated traditional souk, a network of canals and more than 45 restaurants and bars. Double rooms from $520.
 Dubai Marine Beach Resort and Spa, Beach Road, Jumeirah, (971-4) 346-1111, www.dxbmarine.com, is an oceanfront property with some of the hottest restaurant-clubs in town. Sho-Cho is a futuristic sushi lounge, while the bar-restaurant El Malecon is a slice of old-time Havana decadence. Boudoir, a sultry French restaurant, becomes a throbbing party scene in the wee hours. Doubles from $219.
 The two modern Emirates Towers buildings, Sheikh Zayed Road, (971-4) 314-3555, www.emiratestowershotel.com, define the Dubai skyline and cater to a very upscale business clientele. The shopping arcade has many high-end clothing and jewelry stores, trendy bars, and a slew of restaurants. Doubles from $333. The chic 50th-floor restaurant and lounge, Vu's, (971-4) 319-8088, offers a wonderful panorama of the city. 
 The Ibis World Trade Center, at the Dubai World Trade Center, off Sheikh Zayed Road, (971-4) 332-4444, www.ibishotel.com, with only three stars, is practically a flophouse by Dubai standards. In other words, there are no butlers or helipads. Still, it's extremely clean, centrally located and served by a couple of restaurants and bars. Doubles from $79.

Where to Eat
 The array of nationalities in Dubai translates into an abundance of global cuisines. Ethnic foods from nearby countries -- especially India and Lebanon -- should not be missed.
 At Asha's, Waficity Pyramids, (971-4) 324-4100, www.ashasrestaurants.com, the stylish Bombay lounge interior is the right complement to the contemporary Indian cuisine. Choose between the traditional menu (samosas, kebabs) and the fusion menu, which includes a tandoori-smoked salmon appetizer ($9) and a duck breast cooked in cardamom and honey ($17). 
 Al Nafoorah, (971-4) 319-8760, in the lower level of the Emirates Towers, is an elegant Lebanese restaurant serving delights like lamb makenak (sausages in lemon juice, $5), lubia bil zaite (marinated green beans with tomato, garlic and olive oil, $4.50), and a mixed grill with three types of meat kebab ($12). 
 The British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay runs Verre, in the Hilton Dubai Creek, (971-4) 212-7551, a discreet haven of contemporary French cuisine. Start with quail breast cooked with wild mushrooms ($18.50) and move to Tasmanian salmon with seared scallops and caviar veloute or roasted lamb (each $35). 
 The Wharf, in the Mina A Salam hotel. (971-4) 366-6152, overlooking one of the faux (but charming) canals in the Madinat Jumeirah complex, the Wharf specializes in imaginative seafood dishes like crab and lobster salad with avocado and tomato salsa ($16), tuna carpaccio with pan-fried foie gras ($17) and roasted red snapper risotto ($25).

Where to Dance
 Club life starts after 11 p.m. most nights, and places generally stay open until 3 a.m.
 Tangerine, Fairmont Hotel, Sheikh Zayed Road; (971-4) 311-8100.
 Trilogy, Madinat Jumeirah; (971-4) 366-6917.
 MIX, Grand Hyatt Dubai; (971-4) 317-2570.

Where to Shop
 The Egyptian-themed Wafi City Mall, (971-4) 324 4555, www.waficity.com, has what is probably Dubai's most comprehensive mix of upscale stores, fine dining, cool cocktail lounges and entertainment -- as well as a spa.
 The Mediterranean-style Mercato Mall, (971-4) 344-4161, www.mercatoshoppingmall.com, one of the newest additions, has 90 shops and restaurants and a lively, young atmosphere. Stores include Diesel, Mango, Polo Jeans, Fleurt and Cerruti. 
 For a less corporate retail outing, hit the dazzling gold souk in the Deira district (and haggle like crazy if you plan to buy) or the crowded street-level shops in the Al Karama neighborhood. You'll see all your favorite brands counterfeited with varying degrees of skill.

What to See
 The Burj Al Arab, (971-4) 301-7777, the world's tallest and arguably most luxurious hotel -- chauffered Rolls-Royce, anyone? -- has become so iconic that its distinctive shape graces Dubai license plates. Rather than pay some of the world's tallest prices for a suite (they start at $1,467 for the smallest), go for a drink at the Skyview bar (which still charges $45 for the privilege, plus two drinks and canapes). Reservations, (971-4) 301-7600, are vital.
 Camel racing takes place at Nad Al Sheba racetrack, (971-4) 336-3666, starting around 7 a.m. on Thursdays and Fridays in the winter and spring. 
 Dubai Museum, Al Faheidi Fort, Bastakiya, (971-4) 353-1862, is in a building from the late 1700's, and contains a recreated Bedouin village and exhibits on desert Arab life over the centuries. Admission is 80 cents. SETH SHERWOOD

HEADLINE: This Is Your Brain on Motherhood

BYLINE: By Katherine Ellison. 
Katherine Ellison is the author of ''The Mommy Brain: How Motherhood Makes Us Smarter.''

DATELINE: San Francisco 

 BODY:
ANYONE shopping for a Mother's Day card today might reasonably linger in the Sympathy section. We can't seem to stop mourning the state of modern motherhood. ''Madness'' is our new metaphor. ''Desperate Housewives'' are our new cultural icons. And a mother's brain, as commonly envisioned, is impaired by a supposed full-scale assault on sanity and smarts. 
 So strong is this last stereotype that when a satirical Web site posted a ''study'' saying that parents lose an average of 20 I.Q. points on the birth of their first child, MSNBC broadcast it as if it were true. The danger of this perception is clearest for working mothers, who besides bearing children spend more time with them, or doing things for them, than fathers, according to a recent Department of Labor survey. 
 In addition, the more visibly ''encumbered'' we are, the more bias we attract: When volunteer groups were shown images of a woman doing various types of work, but in some cases wearing a pillow to make her look pregnant, most judged the ''pregnant'' woman less competent. Even in liberal San Francisco, a hearing last month to consider a pregnant woman's bid to be named acting director of the Department of Building Inspection featured four speakers commenting on her condition, with one asking if the city truly meant to hire a ''pregnancy brain.''
 But what if just the opposite is true? What if parenting really isn't a zero-sum, children-take-all game? What if raising children is actually mentally enriching for mothers -- and fathers? 
 This is, in fact, what some leading brain scientists, like Michael Merzenich at the University of California, San Francisco, now believe. Becoming a parent, they say, can power up the mind with uniquely motivated learning. Having a baby is ''a revolution for the brain,'' Dr. Merzenich says.
 The human brain, we now know, creates cells throughout life, cells more likely to survive if they're used. Emotional, challenging and novel experiences provide particularly helpful use of these new neurons, and what adjectives better describe raising a child? Children constantly drag their parents into challenging, novel situations, be it talking a 4-year-old out of a backseat meltdown on the Interstate or figuring out a third-grade homework assignment to make a model of a black hole in space.
 Often, we'd rather be doing almost anything else. Aging makes us cling ever more fiercely to our mental ruts. But for most of us, our unique bond with our children yanks us out of them.
 And there are other ways that being a dedicated parent strengthens our minds. Research shows that learning and memory skills can be improved by bearing and nurturing offspring. A team of neuroscientists in Virginia found that mother lab rats, just like working mothers, demonstrably excel at time-management and efficiency, racing around mazes to find rewards and get back to the pups in record time. Other research is showing how hormones elevated in parenting can help buffer mothers from anxiety and stress -- a timely gift from a sometimes compassionate Mother Nature. Oxytocin, produced by mammals in labor and breast-feeding, has been linked to the ability to learn in lab animals.
 Rethinking the mental state of motherhood is reasonable after recent years of evolution of our notion of just what it means to be smart. With our economy newly weighted with people-to-people jobs, and with many professions, including the sciences, becoming more multidisciplinary and collaborative, the people skills we've come to think of as ''emotional intelligence'' are increasingly prized by many wise employers. An ability to tailor your message to your audience, for instance -- a skill that engaged parents practice constantly -- can mean the difference between failure and success, at home and at work, as Harvard's president, Lawrence Summers, may now realize. 
 To be sure, sleep deprivation, overwork and too much ''Teletubbies'' can sap any parent's synapses. And to be sure, our society needs to do much more -- starting with more affordable, high-quality child care and paid parental leaves -- to catch up with other industrialized nations and support mothers and fathers in using their newly acquired smarts to best advantage. That's why some of the recent ''mommy lit'' complaints are justified, and probably needed to rouse society to action -- if only because nobody will be able to stand our whining for much longer. 
 Still, it's worth considering that the torrent of negativity about motherhood comes as part of an era in which intimacy of all sorts is on the decline in this country. Geographically close extended families have long been passe. The marriage rate has declined. And a record percentage of women of child-bearing age today are childless, many by choice.
 It's common these days to hear people say they don't have time to maintain friendships. Real relationships take a lot of time and work -- it's much more convenient to keep in touch by e-mail. But children insist on face time. They fail to thrive unless we anticipate their needs, work our empathy muscles, adjust our schedules and endure their relentless testing. In the process, if we're lucky, we may realize that just this kind of grueling work -- with our children, or even with others who could simply use some help -- is precisely what makes us grow, acquire wisdom and become more fully human. Perhaps then we can start to re-imagine a mother's brain as less a handicap than a keen asset in the lifelong task of getting smart.

HEADLINE: The Fathers' Crusade

BYLINE: By Susan Dominus. 
Susan Dominus is a contributing writer for the magazine. Her most recent cover article was about adult children of gay parents.

 BODY:
After tomorrow, I'll have done everything there is to do, ''Jason Hatch said one night in February, staring wistfully into a near-finished glass of beer at a bar in Shrewsbury, England. Just a few hours earlier, he and some friends were enjoying a raucous, boisterous evening, all but driving out the other diners at a decorous French restaurant. Now, after several drinks at the bar, the lateness of the hour and the increasing proximity of Hatch's plans for the next day seemed to be catching up with him, and his mood took a turn toward the tense. By the following afternoon, Hatch, a 33-year-old former house painter and contractor, intended to scale a government office building near the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street. His friends, many of them co-conspirators, had gone home, the revelry had died down and he was clearly trying to regain some focus. Was he getting nervous? ''The police say Jason doesn't have fear like other people,'' he said, speaking of himself in the third person, perhaps hoping they were right. 
 If, earlier in the evening, others at the restaurant looked over to Hatch's table (and given the noise emanating from it, they surely did), they would have seen that Hatch wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the purple logo of Fathers 4 Justice, a political group that is well known in Britain for staging high-profile stunts to raise awareness about the custody rights of divorced and separated fathers. (In one memorable incident, a member pelted Prime Minister Tony Blair with a condom filled with purple flour.) Some might even have recognized Hatch and made a note to mention their brush with semi-celebrity to their friends: this was the man who scaled Buckingham Palace last year dressed as Batman, unfurling a banner in support of fathers' rights and spending more than five hours perched on a ledge near the palace balcony as security officers tried to talk him down. The event, which made news around the world, saturated the British media for nearly two days.
 Hatch was arrested, but he was promptly released and never charged with a crime. ''I even got me ladder back,'' he likes to mention. Nonetheless, the police keep a close eye on him, even outside his own country. Several months after his Buckingham Palace stunt, Hatch, hoping to broaden his group's support in the United States, flew to New York, where a team of police tailed him and his colleagues for the duration of the five-day visit. (The cops finally announced themselves, befriended Hatch and his fellow would-be protesters and ended up escorting them to various downtown nightclubs, passing them off as royalty -- anything, apparently, to keep them from putting on capes and scaling the Brooklyn Bridge.) 
 At the bar in Shrewsbury, as Hatch fretted about the details of his next major stunt -- could he get a lighter ladder by tomorrow? -- he seemed overtaken by melancholy. He hadn't been sleeping, he said; his head ached. Three and a half years ago, Hatch's second wife left him, taking their two children with her. When he finally caught up with them, a family court granted him visitation rights. He later claimed in court that his wife regularly ignored the ruling, refusing to let him see the kids, but, he told me, the court did little to satisfy him. ''It really takes it out of me,'' he said. It had been so long since he'd seen his kids -- Charlie, who's 5, and Olivia, who is a year younger -- that their mother now claims they didn't want to see him, he said. They had started calling their grandfather Dad. (His wife has declined to speak to the press, other than to say that Hatch's activism has disturbed the children.) 
 Hatch first contacted Fathers 4 Justice a year and a half ago, after reading about their protests in the newspaper. The group's founder, Matt O'Connor, a 38-year-old divorced dad with a gift for public relations, visited Hatch at his home in Cheltenham to gauge his commitment -- and, as it turned out, to scope out some possible locations for protests. Two weeks later, Hatch found himself with three other fathers, standing atop a 250-foot-high suspension bridge in Bristol, dressed like a superhero, hanging a Fathers 4 Justice banner. For the 28 hours that Hatch and his colleagues remained on the bridge, the police rerouted commuters, as reporters and curious pedestrians gathered below. After years of ineffectual legal struggle, Hatch could finally see results: traffic had literally stopped on account of his cause. He went on to scale a series of other targets, including several court buildings, York Minster Cathedral and, finally, Buckingham Palace. The grandiose, symbolic gesture had become more satisfying than the niggling, humiliating legal maneuverings that never seemed to pan out.
 Hatch's sense of despair about his estrangement from Charlie and Olivia has apparently swept away any concern he might have had about the most basic requirement of parenthood: his continuing good health. When he scaled the ladder at Buckingham Palace, the guards cocked their rifles, a sound captured chillingly on a videotape of the event. ''I'm not afraid to die, but I don't want to,'' Hatch, who now has a 14-month-old daughter with his current girlfriend, Gemma Polson, told me. ''I feel sorry for Amelia, obviously -- Amelia being me little daughter. If anything happens, she's going to lose out, but I still have to do it. I still have to go out there and get the law changed, and when the law's changed, you won't see me again.''
 Now a full-time salaried havoc-wreaker for Fathers 4 Justice (the group raises money through membership fees), Hatch has a martyr's self-righteousness but also an adman's instinct to feed the media beast ever bigger morsels of a story. ''If I got shot, but survived,'' he said just before heading to bed for the night, ''that would be brilliant.''
Although some of the issues raised by Fathers 4 Justice concern quirks of the British custody system, most of them overlap with demands of divorced-fathers' groups in other countries: stronger enforcement of visitation rights, more shared-custody arrangements, a better public and legal acknowledgment of a father's importance in his child's life. In the United States, the influence and visibility of those groups have waxed and waned since the mid-70's, but they appear to be agitating now as never before. In the past year, class-action suits have been filed in more than 40 states, claiming that a father's constitutional right to be a parent guarantees him nothing less than 50 percent of the time with his children. And on the legislative front, last spring Iowa passed some of the strongest legislation to date in favor of joint physical custody -- the division of the child's time between the two parents as close to equal as possible. The policy, which resembles some legislation that Maine passed in 2001, encourages judges to grant joint physical custody if one parent requests it, unless the judge can give specifics to justify why that arrangement is not in the best interest of the child.
 There are dozens of fathers' rights groups in the States, including the American Coalition for Fathers and Children, Dads Against Discrimination and the Alliance for Noncustodial Parents Rights. They may not have the name recognition that Fathers 4 Justice has on its own turf, but they work quietly behind the scenes, pushing for custody laws like the ones Iowa and Maine have passed, lobbying Congress and generally doing what they can to improve not just the rights but also the image of divorced fathers. In this last task, oddly enough, these groups have benefited from federal initiatives designed to motivate divorced or never-wed fathers who care all too little about their kids, as publicly financed ad campaigns remind the public how indispensible fathers are. (''Fathers Matter,'' shouted ads on New York City buses last year.) 
 Fathers' groups also benefit from a more general recognition that fathers, at least in some socioeconomic circles, are now much more involved in their children's lives. Some of that involvement is born of necessity, given how many mothers work, but necessity also seems to have effected a cultural shift, ushering in the era of the newly devoted dad. The traditional custody arrangement, with Mom as sole custodian and Dad demoted to weekend visitor, may have been painful, but practical, in a family with a 50's-style division of labor; but to the father who knows every Wiggle by name, the pediatrician's number by heart and how to make a bump-free ponytail, such an arrangement could be perceived as an outrage, regardless of what might be more convenient or who is the primary caretaker.
 On the other hand, divorced dads still face some serious image problems, a function of well-known statistics that are hard to spin. In the United States, in the period following divorce, one study has found, close to half of all children lose contact with their fathers, with that figure rising to more than two-thirds after 10 years. Although child-support payments have crept up in recent years, in 2001 only 52 percent of divorced mothers received their full child-support payments; among women who had children out of wedlock, the number was around 32 percent. Fathers' rights groups have a tall order explaining those statistics, convincing judges -- and the country at large -- that if fathers skip town, or refuse payment, it's a function of how unfairly family courts treat them rather than the very reason that the courts treat fathers the way they do. Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for Women, told me that fathers' rights groups are ''focused only on the rights of fathers, and not on the rights of children, and particularly, not on the obligations of fathers that should go with those rights.''
 Some fathers' rights advocates in the United States fear that the Fathers 4 Justice approach to image overhaul will slow the movement's bid for respectability, but others are ready to try some kind of major action. To date, none of the fathers' groups in the States have managed to spark a sympathetic national dialogue in the way Fathers 4 Justice has done in England -- striving to recast divorced dads, en masse, as needy and lovable rather than as distant and neglectful. Without that sea change, fathers' groups here in America acknowledge, there's only so far they can go in changing the way judges rule, no matter what the laws can be made to say.
In January, Ned Holstein, president of Fathers and Families, a Massachusetts organization committed to improving fathers' access to their children, decided to devote one of the group's bimonthly meetings to a debate about the merits of Fathers 4 Justice-style tactics. To date, Holstein's organization has pursued its goals through traditional nonprofit pathways: hiring a lobbyist, an intern, a program coordinator, all financed by member-donated dollars. The group reached a milestone last fall, when it managed to put a nonbinding question about shared custody on the ballot for the November elections; 86 percent of those who voted on the issue supported a presumption of joint physical and legal custody. Despite the results his approach has yielded so far, Holstein told me before the Fathers and Families meeting, he was curious to see how his constituency would respond to the idea of following Fathers 4 Justice's lead, opting for what he calls ''the flamboyant route.''
 Holstein, now 61, resolved his own divorce amicably about 10 years ago, arranging for shared physical custody of his kids. But the court consistently treated him, he says, like a crank, and he started to collect stories from fathers who fared far worse. Before long he had a cause. A doctor who frequently testifies in trials, Holstein has an easy way with statistics and studies and evidently enjoys his public role. As he drove me to the group's meeting at a private school in Braintree, Mass., he made an eloquent case for increasing fathers' access to their kids. He has no problem with the existing ''best interests of the child'' guideline that judges follow in reaching custody decisions, he explained. He simply contends that, as a matter of practice, judges underestimate how important a father's active involvement is to the best interest of the child -- and weekend visits twice a month don't constitute active involvement, in his view. ''At that point,'' Holstein said, ''visitations become painful, because they remind parent and child of what they don't have, which is intimacy.''
 Holstein arrived at the school to find 40 or 50 men and a handful of women (mostly girlfriends and second wives) already there -- a fairly typical turnout, he said. After a short, rousing speech to start, Holstein turned the subject of the meeting to Fathers 4 Justice. Matt O'Connor, the British group's founder, had declared purple the color of the international father's movement, and Holstein said he was hoping the men in the audience would consider wearing a purple ribbon. ''I hope you will join me, and won't decide it's too . . . whatever,'' he said with a nervous laugh. ''Now I need someone to go around with the scissors, so we can cut up and pass around some ribbons.''
 This apparently sounded suspiciously like sewing; there was an awkward silence. Finally, a woman in the third row raised her hand, but Holstein balked. ''We can't let a woman do this!'' he said.
 ''She wants it done right!'' someone chimed in, getting a big laugh. Soon enough, a middle-aged man in a mock turtleneck and khakis rose to the challenge, and the ribbons started circulating.
 Choosing purple was one of Fathers 4 Justice's more savvy branding decisions. The color works for the group for the same reason Holstein worried his fathers might feel too ''whatever'' wearing it -- it's sort of a silly color, a kid's color and definitely not macho. Given the particular American constructs of masculinity, it's not clear how other elements of the Fathers 4 Justice aesthetic would play in the States: could a man running around in public in tights and a cape, mocking the law and defying security, ever be an emissary on behalf of American fatherhood? For some time now, O'Connor has considered starting a march of fathers in drag (''It's a drag being a dad,'' the signs would read), which suggests the size of the gap between his sensibility and that of the average American.
 Humor has clearly been a key to the success of the British campaign, distancing Fathers 4 Justice from overtly misogynist groups like the Blackshirts in Australia, masked men in paramilitary uniforms who stalk the homes of women they feel have taken unfair advantage of the custody system. O'Connor realized early on that men marching in the street and shouting look like a public menace rather than like nurturing caretakers deserving of more time with their children. In England, the group has managed to offset that threat with goofy playfulness while holding on to enough dignity to maintain respectability. That balance might be even harder to strike in the States. 
 In the auditorium, Holstein's fathers sat for half an hour and watched video footage of Fathers 4 Justice, much of it set to a stirring soundtrack of U2 songs. ''Would everyone who's willing to be arrested please get on the bus?'' Matt O'Connor called out during one protest. There were scenes of a father and his daughter playing with their pet sheep, which the father had dyed purple; scenes of dozens of men dressed as Father Christmas staging a sit-in at the children's-affairs office of a government building; and scenes from two of the group's largest protests: the Men in Black march (which featured about a thousand fathers, as well as supportive mothers and grandmothers, dressed in sunglasses and black suits, to symbolize their grief), and the Rising, a march through London that drew more than 2,000 protesters.
 Afterward, Robert Chase, a 39-year-old clean-cut Dartmouth graduate who met with Jason Hatch and his colleague when they came to New York, led the group in brainstorming protest ideas of their own. Men started offering suggestions: they could protest from one of Boston's duck boats; they could march to the harbor for a Boston Tea Party, only throwing their divorce decrees, not tea, into the water; they could dress up like Barney; they could dress up in burkas! The group seemed receptive to costumes, but there wasn't much enthusiasm for storming court buildings. 
 ''I'm not in the mood to get arrested,'' one man called out. ''I got arrested enough during my divorce.'' This got a laugh.
 ''I like the idea of a parade, but it needs to be funny,'' another man said.
 ''Humor!'' Holstein exclaimed. ''Humor works better than anger!''
For most of American legal history, the laws required judges to consider sex the most significant factor when making custody decisions, although which sex had the advantage changed over time. Until the mid-1800's, under common law, a father's right to custody in the event of a divorce was so strong that it practically functioned as a property right. Toward the end of that century, this principle was reversed by the ''tender years'' doctrine -- the presumption that young children need to be with their mothers -- which lasted in a handful of jurisdictions into the early 80's. For the most part, however, by the late 70's, the ''tender years'' doctrine had given way to the less prejudiced, but also less clear, directive that judges base their decisions on the so-called best interest of the child. Today many fathers' rights advocates -- particularly those who filed the 40-some class-action lawsuits demanding a 50-50 split of custody -- would like to usher in a new paradigm: one that values parental rights as highly as the child's best interest. 
 Michael Newdow is one of the fathers who have been trying to make that case. He is best known as the California emergency-room doctor who represented himself last year in a case before the Supreme Court, arguing that the words ''under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance violated the establishment clause of the United States Constitution. Newdow, an atheist, brought the suit on the grounds that the pledge forced the government's spiritual views onto his daughter, impeding her freedom of religious choice. The Supreme Court ruled that Newdow, given the particulars of his case and his custody issues, didn't have the standing to bring the suit. For five years leading up to his appearance before the Supreme Court, Newdow had two driving passions in his life: fighting for more custody of his daughter and fighting to eliminate ''under God'' from the pledge. When the court dismissed his case, the two passions collided and combusted, the destruction of one cause taking the other down with it. 
 Though he still practices emergency-room medicine, Newdow finds time to tour the country, speaking at conferences and law schools about the separation of church and state. Last winter, I met up with him at the University of Michigan Law School just after he finished giving a talk to some students. He was carrying a guitar and looked a little flustered, two details that turned out to be related: during his talks, he likes to sing a song he wrote about the establishment clause, only this time he flubbed the lyrics.
 Fast-talking and faster-thinking, Newdow, 51, is a tall, thin man who manages to look crisply dressed in even informal clothing. Conversationally, he toggles between two modes, aggrieved and outraged, and he has an expressive face that seems well designed to reflect those emotions. That evening, sitting in the lobby of the Michigan Union, he talked for close to two hours about his troubles -- the custody battles he endured with his daughter's mother (whom he never married); the impassioned exchanges that alienated the family-court judge; the injustices he feels he suffered at the hands of foolish mediators; the court appearances over all manner of arcane disputes, including whether he could take his daughter out hunting for frogs one night (no) and whether he could take her to hear him argue before the Supreme Court (again, no). Although the courts deprived him of final decision-making power over his daughter, who is now 10, he does spend about 30 percent of the time with her, a relatively generous arrangement. Nonetheless, Newdow, who has spent half a million dollars on legal fees, the lion's share of those incurred by his child's mother, claims that the family-court system has ruined his life. He's a second-class parent, he said; he can't do the things he'd like to do with his daughter. The system allows his daughter's mother to stifle his freedom to care for his child the way he'd like. ''It's as bad as slavery,'' he said. 
 As a spokesman on behalf of fathers' rights -- or rather, as he makes a point of stressing, all parents' and children's rights -- Newdow is a brilliant, confident speaker, but sometimes he lacks a light touch. Hyperrational, occasionally tone-deaf, he'll admit that he knows enough to know that his logic often offends people, sane as it seems to him. Early on in our conversation, when he started to digress about the imbalance in reproductive rights -- women can choose to end a pregnancy but men can't -- he cut himself off. ''That's another issue, and it alienates people, and I don't want to alienate you,'' he said. ''Although I will eventually.'' It wasn't a threat, or a joke, or a regret -- it was just, to him, by now, a probability.
The following day, Newdow delivered a second talk at Michigan, this time on the subject of family law, to 50 or 60 students who filled a classroom. (Newdow himself attended Michigan Law School before becoming a doctor.) While the students listened, tossing back free pizza that a student group had provided, Newdow began discussing Troxel v. Granville, a 2000 Supreme Court ruling that has been warmly embraced by fathers' rights advocates. In that decision, the court held that a grandparent's visitation rights could not be granted without a parent's consent, even if a grandparent's visits were in the best interest of the child. In Troxel, Newdow noted, the court stated that parental rights are ''perhaps the oldest of fundamental liberty interests recognized by this court.'' If to be a parent is a fundamental constitutional right, he asked, how can the government violate that right without a showing a compelling state interest?
 A hand went up. ''Isn't the best interest of the child a compelling state interest?''
 This is one of Newdow's favorite questions. ''How do you prove what's best for the child?'' he asked. ''Somebody tell me what's best for the child. Let's take lunch. McDonald's or make tuna fish at home -- what's best? O.K., lunch at home, you don't risk a car accident, maybe the food's healthier. McDonald's, on the other hand, maybe it's more fun, maybe the kid sees something new, gets the confidence to go down the slide for the first time. When you're talking about two fit parents, who's to say what's best?'' 
 But what also worried Newdow, he continued, was not the problem of how to determine what's ''best'' for the child, but rather the assumption that you can deprive someone of his or her fundamental parental right simply in order to make a child's life more pleasant. Of course, he conceded, society has an obligation to protect those, like children, who cannot protect themselves. But there is a world of difference between protecting someone from harm and improving his life more generally. ''We've gone from protection to suddenly 'make their lives better,''' he said. ''And that's a violation of equal protection -- because you're taking one person's life and ruining it to make another person's better. If you can show real harm to the child, the kind of harm that the state would protect any child in an intact family from -- abuse, neglect -- sure, of course, protect it. But when it's just what someone thinks might be better for the child, you have to weigh that compared to the harm suffered by the parent.''
 In short, forget for a moment about tending to a child's optimal well-being: what about what's fair? If a child's parents are still married, courts don't worry about whether it's in the best interest of the child to go frogging late at night -- so why should they have the power to weigh that issue the instant two parents separate? Split the custody 50-50, Newdow proposes, and let each parent make independent decisions during his or her time with that child.
 A young woman with long dark hair raised her hand. ''So you want to just split the kid 50-50, like Solomon?'' she asked. All around her, students looked either amused or incensed by the argument Newdow was making.
 ''Why is 70-30 so much better?'' he countered. ''And if 50-50 is so terrible, why do courts have no problem with parents who mutually agree to 50-50 arrangements?'' 
 A quiet girl in the front row had a trickier question. ''What about when one parent wants to do something that permanently prohibits the other parent's freedom to exercise their own constitutional right to parent the way they see fit?'' she asked, searching for an example. ''Say, getting her daughter's ear pierced. You can do that on your own time, but it's permanent.''
 For that kind of thing, Newdow conceded, you go to court. Here his logic seemed to be leading him to strange places: a father could take his teenage son to a strip club, but over an ear-piercing, he'd have to go to court?
 The young woman's question illustrated the particular thorniness of parental rights. By exercising his or her own right, a parent may end up negating the other's. An accuser's right to hire an attorney doesn't complicate the right of the accused to legal defense; my right to free speech doesn't inhibit your right to the same. But if two parents are at odds, parental rights become a kind of zero-sum game of constitutional freedom.
 David Meyer, a University of Illinois law professor who specializes in the intersection of family and constitutional laws, agrees with Newdow that the courts have recognized a fundamental parental right. The problem, Meyer says, is that so-called strict scrutiny -- the process by which the court determines whether there's a state interest so compelling that it should override a fundamental right -- is complicated when multiple people in a single family are asserting their fundamental constitutional rights. In Troxel, he notes, ''the court was forced into a mushy kind of balancing test, balancing the interests of the children and the parents and all kinds of facts.'' In his opinion in Troxel, Justice Clarence Thomas raised the question of why strict scrutiny wasn't being applied. ''None of the other justices answered him,'' Meyer told me. ''But implicitly the answer is: it just doesn't work here.''
 Although Newdow rarely loses his temper, his complicated rationales for simple solutions can exasperate those who engage him in any conversation about the subject of custody. Joining Newdow at an informal law-school dinner the night before he spoke, Christina Whitman, a former professor of Newdow's, lost little time on congratulations before challenging him. ''Your [constitutional] right guarantees you equality in making your case before the judge,'' she pointed out, ''but it doesn't guarantee you equal custody. You have the right to an answer, not an answer you'd like.'' Only if the court's decision was arbitrary, she pointed out, would it be a violation of his constitutional right.
 Newdow replied that the judges' rulings are, in fact, arbitrary, often depending on the expert opinion of psychologists to whom he grants zero scientific credibility. He cited textbook cases of judges making absurd decisions based on their own value judgments about what kind of parent would be the better custodian.
 ''But just because unfair decisions happen doesn't mean 50-50 is the answer,'' she said. ''That's a child's approach to equality.''
 The two went round and round until Whitman took a breather to ask how old Newdow's daughter was. ''Ten,'' he told her. Whitman laughed. ''Just wait two years,'' she said, clearly speaking from experience. ''You won't want her anymore.''
Standing on the plaza outside Boston City Hall, an observer had to take a close look, amid the sea of Red Sox caps, to see the signs of romance on Valentine's Day. A teenager walked across the plaza with a handful of red and white carnations; a minute or two later, a man in a business suit passed by briskly, a Mylar balloon trailing behind him. As another man in a suit helped a young mother get her stroller down the plaza stairs, a deep chanting from the street below made its way to the plaza -- the echoing, slightly eerie sound of shouted slogans magnified by a bullhorn: ''It's Valentine's Day, and we can't see our kids!'' And then: ''What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!''
 Robert Chase, the Dartmouth grad from the Fathers and Family meeting, didn't have much luck persuading those fathers to take to the streets, but he had managed to round up 30 or so protesters, a few from New Hampshire, his home state, to march under the banner ''Fathers 4 Justice US.'' (Similar protests were organized in 11 other cities across the country that day.) An entrepreneur who runs his own consulting business, Chase has custody of his two sons every other weekend. Several years ago, he lost the right to a third weekend per month when a judge determined that it was logistically onerous for the kids, which is what their mother argued in court. It was the last in a series of outcomes over the years that disappointed him. Chase, who speaks in considered, wholesome-sounding phrases, says that he has made peace with the arrangement now, especially since his children are teenagers with lives of their own. But he mourns the opportunities lost.
 ''We can't reclaim the together-time we lost while they were growing up,'' he told me. ''When you're spending only two or four days a month with your kids, you can't really teach them values, the difference between right and wrong. All you can do is love them, provide a positive example and hope they're getting what they need when they're outside your influence.''
 In the years after the breakup of his marriage, Chase initially sought the help of various fathers' groups, but he told me he felt that most of them ''didn't do anything but sit around and complain.'' Like Jason Hatch, he got interested in Fathers 4 Justice after reading about the group in the news. A father for the first time at 22, Chase, now 39, said it suddenly occurred to him that his older son, now 17, could be a father himself in five or six years. He decided he should take whatever action was possible to make sure his sons and any future grandsons wouldn't encounter the same custody system he faced, should they ever suffer an unhappy divorce.
 Outside City Hall, Chase and his team, mostly men but including a few women, started shuffling their way down Congress Street, some of them blowing whistles and horns. One man wore a devil's mask, with horns atop his head, and a judge's robe; another man in a judge's robe looked even scarier, with a mask of blue eyeballs, no nose, missing teeth, a misshapen skull and several well-placed boils. Other men, including Chase, were dressed in sunglasses and white decontamination suits that had purple hand prints (a Fathers 4 Justice symbol) smeared on them. Something about the mix of white and the flowing robes lent the men a vaguely Klannish aesthetic. As they whistled and bellowed their way down the street, they seemed to have lost sight of Ned Holstein's exhortation to try humor, not anger. A mother with her child approaching them on the street crossed over to the other side.
 After a half-hour or so of chanting and marching, the group arrived at the main family-court building in Boston. At the plaza of the courthouse, one protester started beating a drum. A compact man with a neatly trimmed beard, a green tie and a houndstooth cap left the courthouse and passed the protesters. ''It could happen to you!'' the protesters chanted.
 ''It did happen to me,'' the man said. ''She went nuclear on me.'' In the fathers' rights community, the real weapons of mass destruction are false allegations of abuse. Fathers' rights advocates claim it's all too easy for women to use that strategy; feminists counter that too many family-court judges dismiss women's valid concerns about domestic violence. ''Two years and three-quarters of a million dollars later,'' the man continued, ''I got full custody of my kids, and was fully exonerated. But I've been living this for two years.'' Now the man, who declined to give his name, watched as some of the protesters performed some street theater: a monster in a judge's robe tearing up a kid's photo, one of the fathers punching him to the ground, a man in a decontamination suit with a broom pushing at the heap of a human on the street. ''I don't know about this,'' he said, gesturing at the protesters' garish pantomime. ''But the system does need fixing.''
 While they were marching, members of Chase's group passed out fliers promoting fathers-4-justice.org and detailing all the harms that children without fathers are more likely to suffer -- drug problems, depression, less education. Unlike Michael Newdow, Chase pays little attention to legal rights, arguing exclusively that the interests of the father are aligned with those of the child, given all the social-science research that suggests that fatherless children fare poorly. 
 But some scholars argue that this reasoning mistakenly assumes that children's welfare works roughly on a sliding scale -- that if children with no fathers at all suffer various emotional and social setbacks, then children who see their fathers only, say, every other week might suffer roughly half those setbacks. Margaret Brinig, a professor of family law at the University of Iowa, has examined a longitudinal study of a national sample of more than 20,000 junior-high and high-school children, close to 3,000 of whom had divorced parents and lived with their mothers. Studying that select sample, she found that there was only one sort of custody arrangement that noticeably harmed children: having the child visit the father for sleepover visits only several times a year. Children in such arrangements, Brinig found, were significantly more likely to suffer from depression and fear of dying young. But whether a child had a sleepover with his father a few times a month or a few times a week didn't seem to influence that child's well-being in any measurable way. (Kids who had sleepovers with their fathers several times a month were less likely to abuse drugs and alcohol than kids who didn't, but Brinig posits that result as an exception to her overall conclusion.)
 Fathers' advocates like Ned Holstein argue that Brinig's study might have found more positive results if more of the fathers in it had 50-50 custody, creating more intimate relationships, rather than measuring the difference between, say, one night a month and two nights a month. ''It's like prescribing one aspirin for cancer or two aspirin,'' he said. But Brinig remains wary of a presumption of joint physical custody. ''There's quite a bit of evidence to suggest that joint physical custody is definitely not good for kids when there's a high-conflict situation between the parents,'' she told me. The more shared the custody, the argument goes, the more the parents have to interact and the more the children are exposed to nasty exchanges and power plays. Fathers' rights advocates, by contrast, contend that it's the current winner-take-all system that creates conflict by forcing fearful parents into vitriolic attacks.
 Since the early 90's, scores of studies on the subject of joint custody have been fired back and forth between the competing camps -- studies suggesting that joint physical or even joint legal custody, which gives each parent some decision-making power, fuels conflict; studies claiming that sons fare worse with a mother's sole custody; studies suggesting that children crave stability; studies suggesting that joint physical custody improves child-support payments; and so on. Some of the studies, accurate though they may be, can lead to difficult, even distasteful conclusions. Should policy really be based on studies that basically conclude it doesn't matter how often a father sees his kid, so long as it's more than a few times a year? On the other hand, it's almost impossible to measure how a presumption of joint physical custody affects the motivations of parents on both sides, how that extra bargaining chip might be abused. In one particularly influential study, researchers at Harvard and Stanford found that even in cases in which joint physical custody was granted, the arrangement often devolved into a primary-custodian situation, with the mother taking more responsibility -- but perhaps receiving less child support under the equal arrangement.
 Robert Mnookin, director of the Harvard Negotiation Research Project and a professor at Harvard Law School, is the rare expert who concedes that each side has legitimate concerns. A presumption of joint physical custody would have ''some nice symbolic attributes,'' he told me; but he worries about how it would play out in practice. He notes that the parents whose custody negotiations end up going all the way to court tend to be the parents who fight the most. In those cases, he argues, forcing judges to implement joint physical custody is a bad idea for the kids, since it only perpetuates their exposure to the conflict. He contends, however, that if divorced parents know that a judge is disinclined to award joint physical custody in circumstances with a high degree of conflict, it creates an incentive for a parent who wants sole custody to create conflict. Mnookin says he doesn't favor the presumption of joint physical custody, although he concedes that without one, the system gives mothers an advantage. ''In times of cultural transition like this,'' he said, ''the law struggles.''
As Chase's group was marching through Boston, men all over the city paused to nod grimly and unload stories of how they felt they'd been abused by the custody system, or of how a friend had been. They weren't offering broad theories about constitutional rights or citing chapter and verse from social-science studies. Their complaints were mostly about the logistics of the system, its (to them) arbitrary rule over their finances, its judgments about their life choices, the punishments it doles out, its power to splinter into useless small pieces whatever relationship they'd struggled to build with their children -- all complaints that probably would have been echoed by as many women, had it been women marching down the street protesting about mothers' rights to custody.
 One man in a blue oxford shirt ran down from his third-story office to get some contact information from Chase's group -- his brother-in-law, he said, was about to be arrested because he could no longer keep up with the child-support payments the court demanded. Another man said he had lost custody because he was home with the kids. ''And a man who's home with the kids isn't a homemaker; he's just unemployed,'' he said. Another passer-by had lost custody of his kids, he said, because he wasn't the primary caretaker; the child-support payments were killing him, he said (in Massachusetts, they can run up to 30 percent or more of gross income) and even still, he didn't have nearly as much time with his kids as he would have liked. The court held his wife in contempt for blocking his visitation, ''but she didn't care,'' he said. ''It's a slap on the wrist.'' A man with a Scandinavian accent, wearing a black zip-down sweater, said that he was supposed to see his kids every third weekend but that his wife moved out of state and uses every legal loophole she can to stop him from seeing them.
 Boston that morning felt like a city of walking wounded -- men who stopped on their way to or from their workplaces to compare notes with one another about their losses; men who seemed eager to get someone to pay attention to what they saw as the tragic absurdities of their lives. Their stories came out fragmented, no doubt one-sided, but moving nonetheless. They were short chapters in much longer novels that could be written, that have all but been written, in fact, by those who have best captured modern-day male alienation -- Andre Dubus, Robert Stone, Richard Ford, David Gates -- with their stories of imperfect men and frustrated women and misunderstandings and low expectations all around. The city blocks that Chase's protesters walked must have contained thousands of divided families, and every one of the fathers in those families has hundreds of stories, every one of which he would happily tell to a family court, if only the judge had the time to really listen.
The morning Jason Hatch was scheduled to scale the building on Downing Street, Matt O'Connor, the Fathers 4 Justice founder, was sitting nervously at the coffee shop of the Thistle Hotel in London, a few blocks from Downing, waiting for a phone call. Leaders of social movements may have once hailed from the ranks of unions, sweatshops and churches, but it seems inevitable that in today's culture, O'Connor, one of England's most successful activists, had a career as a brand designer for hip restaurants. Sitting with his girlfriend at the time, Giselle, a yoga instructor, O'Connor left his cellphone out on the table, waiting for it to sound its customary ring: the theme song from ''Mission: Impossible.'' In the days before, whenever he spoke to me about Hatch's plan, he would take the battery out of his phone to thwart the government agents he was convinced could otherwise listen in. The police, he suspected, had been given advance warning of a few recent Fathers 4 Justice stunts they had managed to disrupt. As he waited for the phone call, he rehearsed for me some of his sound bites: ''Our government is turning a nation of fathers into a nation of McDads'' was one; ''We have a government of dysfunctional misfits who are trying to create a generation of dysfunctional kids'' was another.
 O'Connor wasn't sure he'd have the chance to use his one-liners. Fathers 4 Justice had had a string of bad luck lately, and the security at Downing Street was thick. He was in the process of describing to me how Hatch had cased the building when his phone rang. It was a colleague on the scene at Downing Street calling from his cellphone. ''He's up!'' he yelled. O'Connor, in his camel's-hair coat and snakeskin boots, and his girlfriend, chic in oversize sunglasses and a broad hat, ran out the door of the coffee shop and hailed a cab. Heading for the site a few blocks away, catching their breath in the taxi, they could hear the sirens of police cars heading in the same direction.
 When we arrived at Downing Street, the area surrounding the building had been cordoned off. High up enough that he looked quite small, Hatch, dressed as Batman, was standing on a ledge, along with two other men, both Fathers 4 Justice members, one dressed like Robin, the other dressed like Captain America. The three men had driven a truck up to the side of building and onto the pavement, mounted a ladder and, without a hitch, climbed up. They had made their way across the balcony to the corner of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office building, where they stood on what looked like a fairly narrow perch. They hung a large banner, reading ''Access Denied.'' The police apparently didn't notice anything until the men were already up and a crowd of onlookers had started cheering. 
 A cluster of boys in their school blazers waved wildly up to the men. Hatch put on his mask and twirled his cape. Six or seven teenage girls, also waving wildly, started screaming, Beatles-fan style, and blowing Hatch kisses. He blew a few back. Some more tourists and locals joined the crowd, and several large men in sunglasses and street clothes seemed to be keeping a particularly keen eye on the crowd. ''How are you, darling?'' Giselle said into O'Connor's cellphone, looking up nervously at Hatch, who had his own phone pressed to his ear. 
 Reporters lined up to get their sound bites from O'Connor. The press turnout was solid but perhaps a bit perfunctory. The media in England had already addressed the security angle in previous coverage, and after Buckingham Palace, every possible angle on paternity in Britain had been thoroughly worked. ''Right, we don't need to hear their message again, do we?'' I overheard a BBC reporter say into his cellphone to his producer. The press had also already exhausted its love affair with Hatch as Hero Dad. It had become public knowledge that Hatch had been convicted of threatening his second wife and that he had another child, with his first wife. After he scaled Buckingham Palace, his girlfriend told the press that she had dumped him because he was devoting too much time to Fathers 4 Justice and not enough to their baby. (The two have since reconciled -- ''I was very post-partum'' at the time, she told me -- but that story hasn't received as much play.)
 As the afternoon wore on, the already gray day turned a little grayer, and a cold, wet wind picked up. The reporters down below, in scarves and boots, complained about their chilled feet. Several hundred feet up, on the ledge, it could only have been colder and windier, with superhero tights providing little protection. The three men had brought a knapsack filled with chocolates and Red Bull, but eventually the cold and the fatigue got to Captain America, who came down around 5 p.m. An hour or two later, Robin capitulated, too. By then, the crowd of bystanders had pretty much dissipated, but Hatch stayed put, his cape wrapped around him for warmth. Long after everyone else had gone home to dinner and kids and, finally, bed, he was still on the ledge, an outraged father, determined, cold and alone.

HEADLINE: The Stock Market Is Still Pressing the Reset Button

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
DEPENDING on whom you ask, the recent stock market sell-off can be attributed either to inflationary fears or to the slowing economy. But some people say it's also tied to a longer-term problem facing investors: the fact that five years after the stock market bubble burst in 2000, unleashing one of the grisliest bears in history, there are still signs of froth.
 ''You might think that with the stock market significantly lower after all this time, investors would be chastened,'' said Ben Inker, director of asset allocation at GMO, an investment management firm in Boston. 
 But it often takes six or seven years for returns to revert to their historical norms, he said. Despite the recent bear market -- from its peak in March 2000 to its trough in October 2002, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost nearly half its value -- blue-chip stocks have still posted average annual gains of 13.2 percent over the last 20 years, according to Ibbotson Associates, the investment consulting firm. 
 That's well above the 10.4 percent average annual return that stocks have delivered since 1926.
 Given that equities are coming off of one of the biggest bubbles in recent history, it may take much longer this time for stocks to reset to their norms. That may mean a prolonged period of below-average returns. 
 How much below average?
 Mr. Inker has very low expectations for stocks. Over the next seven years, he predicts, domestic equities will deliver average annual returns of only around 1 percent. Assuming inflation of around 2.5 percent, that means a real return of minus 1.5 percent a year.
 But haven't stocks already lost more than 2 percent a year, on average, over the last five years? That's true, but sometimes it takes more than a decade for stocks to get going after a big meltdown. After stocks peaked in the mid- to late 1960's, for instance, the Dow Jones industrial average was virtually flat until 1982.
 David Chalupnik, head of equities at the First American Funds, isn't so pessimistic. He says he thinks stocks may gain 7 percent a year, annualized, over the next 25 years. But that is still around three and a half percentage points below stocks' long-term average.
 While he acknowledges that stocks have already suffered tremendous losses, he notes that many of the underlying economic attributes that led to above-average returns in the 1980's and 90's are likely to deteriorate. ''From a productivity point of view, an earnings point of view, and a growth point of view, we're starting from such a high point,'' he said. 
 To be sure, a good deal of the market's excesses have been wrung out. For example, the price-to-earnings ratio for the S.&P. 500, based on trailing four-quarter earnings, is around 19. That is down considerably from the 2001 peak of more than 46.
 But Clifford S. Asness, managing principal at AQR Capital Management in Greenwich, Conn., relies on a different P/E ratio, one made famous by the Yale economics professor Robert J. Shiller, and finds that stocks are still historically expensive. 
 Mr. Asness has taken the current price of the S.&P. 500 and divided it by the 10-year average of trailing corporate earnings. By that measure, the S.&P. trades at a P/E of around 26. With the exception of the late 1990's, the last time the market was this expensive was in the years leading up to the Great Depression.
 Many investors may not want to hear that. ''People have an almost moralistic view,'' he said, ''that they've endured such heck in recent years that things must be cheap in the stock market.'' He said stocks were likely to gain around 7 percent annually -- or 4 percent in real returns -- in the coming years.
 In some ways, that's a relatively optimistic forecast. Mr. Asness has studied the market's performance back to 1927, based on valuations. When stocks trade at 19.9 to 31.7 times their 10-year average real earnings -- as they do now -- they've typically lost 0.1 percent a year, in real returns, in the subsequent decade.
 What does it all mean for investors? For starters, there's a strong chance of another major bear market, or of more frequent corrections in coming years than we're accustomed to facing.
 The fact is, investors who cut their teeth in the 1980's and 90's were spoiled by unusually long bull markets. But since 1900, bull markets have lasted only 718 days -- or roughly two years -- on average, based on the gains in the Dow Jones industrials, according to Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla. 
 The rally in the equity markets that started in October 2002 is already two and a half years old. 
 IF stock returns are lower in coming years, low-cost, tax-efficient investing strategies will gain popularity, says Harold Evensky, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla. Mr. Evensky says he believes stocks will return around 8 percent a year, on average, in the coming decade, with inflation averaging around 3 percent. 
 In such an environment, Mr. Evensky said, ''if you can shave half a percentage point in taxes and half a percentage point in fees, you just saved 20 percent of your real returns.'' 
 Ultimately, the best strategy for investors in a low-return environment is simply to save more money, says Rande Spiegelman, vice president for financial planning at the Schwab Center for Investment Research. 
 ''We've gotten used to the market doing our savings for us,'' Mr. Spiegelman said. ''Hopefully those days aren't over just yet.'' But if they are, investors will have to pick up the slack.

HEADLINE: Even in Gay Circles, The Women Want the Ring

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

DATELINE: Boston 

 BODY:
LAST year, three months after the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to ban gay couples from marrying, a young woman named Bernadette Smith embarked on a reinvention. Ms. Smith abandoned her job running a community outreach program in Boston to become a wedding planner for gay couples, declaratively naming the new business she created It's About Time.
 May 17 will be the anniversary of the landmark legalization of gay marriage and in the months since last spring, Ms. Smith has produced a wedding in a bowling alley with pizza and tiki lamps, a party at an oceanfront home documented by a watercolorist, and pagan nuptials officiated by Wiccans, where guests were shepherded from ceremony to reception in rented street cars. Only one consistent trend has emerged in her operation: most of her clients have been women. In the coming months she will oversee eight weddings, only one of them for a male couple. 
 Although women have served at the front lines of litigation efforts in the emotional debate over same-sex marriage, the issue's most vocal opinion leaders have been men, often leaving the impression that marriage is the preoccupying goal of one sex more than the other. Yet of the close to 5,400 couples who have married in Massachusetts since last May, a figure that represents nearly a third of all same-sex partner households in the state identified by the census, almost two-thirds of the couples have been women. Boston was one of the few cities and towns in the state where male marriages outnumbered female ones.
 Sociologists and gay-marriage advocates explain the discrepancy largely in terms of the social and economic realities that shape conflicting attitudes about marriage. What the figures show, Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts said last week, ''is that gay and lesbian differences aren't the most important ones in society, but the differences between men and women are.''
 On some level the statistics in Massachusetts bear out the culturally obvious: that men carry the greater weight of ambivalence on the subjects of marriage and family. On another level the numbers may reflect a wish among women to override the economic vulnerability of living independently. ''Women are situated differently in the occupational labor force; there's more value to their marrying,'' said Christopher Carrington, an anthropologist who has studied gay and lesbian couples. Research conducted by Lee Badgett, an economist and director of the Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies, showed the average household income of lesbians in Massachusetts is 20 percent lower than it is for gay men. 
 DIANE DiCARLO and Jeanne Leszczynski, a Needham, Mass., couple who have been together for 12 years, have had marriage conversations involving finance. Ms. Leszczynski, a laboratory director at the University of Massachusetts, brings greater assets to the relationship than her partner.
 For some time Ms. DiCarlo, a retired drapery maker who is 54, remained unconvinced that marriage should be pursued purely on romantic terms. ''How could I make a vow and say I'm never going to get divorced when so many people get divorced?'' she said. 
 Ms. DiCarlo's views began to change when her partner began to think about marriage as a means of long-term financial custodianship, rather than merely as an idealized vow of fidelity. ''Things could happen, we could separate, people's needs systems change,'' Ms. DiCarlo explained. ''But marriage means that a person is taken care of for life.'' The couple are currently arranging for a prenuptial agreement.
 Gay marriage in Massachusetts remains secure until the end of the year, when the issue is to be taken up once again in the State Legislature and potentially put to a popular vote. A public opinion poll conducted by The Boston Globe in March found popular support for gay marriage in the state at 54 percent, an 18-point increase over the previous year. The number of gay marriages themselves have declined since the initial rush last spring; more than half of them occurred in the first six weeks of legalization.
 Elsewhere in the nation 14 states have amended their constitutions to ban gay marriage since 2004, Kansas being the most recent. In California current litigation aims to challenge the state's prohibition against same-sex marriage.
 Like Ms. DiCarlo and her partner, a majority of the women who have married in Massachusetts -- 67 percent -- are over 40, and many are beyond childbearing age. Nevertheless, sociologists say, the presence of children in women's lives is another factor influencing uneven marriage rates. Approximately one-third of all lesbian households nationwide contain children, according to the 2000 census, compared with about one-fifth of gay male households. 
 ''I'd say the primary reason is that women are more likely to have children and thus seek the legal and economic protections that children require and marriage provides,'' said Gretchen Stiers, the author of a 1998 study, ''From This Day Forward,'' which examined gay and lesbian relationships. 
 According to the Massachusetts office of vital statistics, 29 percent of female couples who married between May and December of last year had a partner who had previously been married (as opposed to 19 percent of the male couples); many of the women may have entered these new couplings with children from former ones.
 In many instances, though, there's another force at play: the cultural programming that prompts fantasies of tiered cakes and lilies in 6-year-old girls. 
 For Abby McDonald and Tara Donner, who are to walk down the aisle of the Arlington Street Church in Boston on June 11 in white gowns, accompanied by their fathers, the desire to marry was driven almost entirely by intimate and conformist urges. Ms. Donner, a Wellesley graduate, read Martha Stewart Weddings in college. Neither woman had been in a serious relationship before they came together three and a half years ago, and neither had been particularly interested in a commitment ceremony or civil union, arrangements they say lack marriage's emotional core. 
 ''Abby was definitely ready to get married before I was,'' Ms. Donner said after a visit to the seamstress for joint bridal gown alterations. The two had begun discussing marriage as soon as it seemed a legal possibility in November 2003. ''It took me a while to get on the same page,'' Ms. Donner said. ''I knew I wanted to marry eventually, but I wasn't ready right then. I wanted that full feeling of assurance, everything to feel just right, and it took a few months.'' 
 Once Ms. Donner found herself in the proper spirit, they purchased matching diamond engagement rings, proposed to each other on the Wellesley campus on June 11, and elected to spend a year planning a wedding rather than marry quickly in the flush of last spring's excitement. 
 ''It was important to us to show that we weren't getting married simply because of a change in the law,'' Ms. McDonald said. ''We're getting married like everyone else, on our own schedule. We wanted to own it in a way that felt right to us, not in the way the political landscape would force us.''
 The couple's reception for 120 guests will be held at the College Club of Boston, paid for in large part by their parents. Friends of theirs, another female couple in their 20's, will marry the following month in the presence of 200 guests.
 In the view of Gary Gates, the senior research fellow at the Charles R. Williams Project on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy, at the University of California, Los Angeles, law school, that many gay couples, both female and male, seem inclined toward conventional weddings in Massachusetts reflects the changing demographics of gay life. 
 ''For a long time the gay rights movement was about the right to be different; now it's very much about the right to be the same and that's a dramatic change,'' Dr. Gates said. ''Today you have more gay people coming out and staying where they live and so it is not surprising that we'd be seeing people behaving more traditionally.'' 
 The reality of gay marriage in Massachusetts has left some young people susceptible to the same sorts of pressures families have always levied on unwed children. Not long after the courts made gay marriage possible, Alison Rheingold, 34, who lives north of Boston and has been with her partner for six and a half years, began receiving inquiries from relatives about a wedding they presumed would happen right away. 
 ''I have an uncle who is a lawyer in New York, and he called and asked, 'When are you getting married? That is what people do, they get married.''' Ms. Rheingold remains uncertain about her marital ambitions because she is still not sure whether or not she would like children.
 THE predominance of female marriages is not unique to Massachusetts. More women than men married in San Francisco when the mayor of the city permitted 4,000 same-sex marriages to be performed over several days last year until the California Supreme Court issued a ruling nullifying them. In British Columbia, where marriage has been legal since 2003, more than 1,100 female couples have married, compared with 860 male couples. 
 ''Both gay and lesbian identities require for a sense of personal integrity a rejection of the dominant messages in the culture, and I'd suggest that for gay men it's a more deeply rooted or dramatic rejection,'' said Kate Kendell, the executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights. Ms. Kendell says that marriage for gay women is simply less fraught in some sense because lesbian life is more immune to cultural prejudices. 
 ''I grew up, and I could walk down the street in Utah, holding hands with my girlfriend, and people might think we were affectionate friends,'' Ms. Kendell said. ''Men can't hold hands without the immediate reaction that they're committing a transgression and that they're gay. The vast majority of hate crimes are against transgendered women and gay men. Far fewer are perpetrated against lesbians.'' 
 For some men there may remain far more quotidian reasons for inoculating oneself against marriage. Kenn Freed, a certified public accountant who is gay and advises many gay clients in Boston, has been advising them in the past year to avoid marriage on the grounds that it is unnecessarily punishing from a tax point of view. Though the Massachusetts tax code recognizes same-sex marriages, the federal government does not. 
 Mr. Freed notes that marriage lessens the potential deductibility for couples on medical expenses, certain property losses and unreimbursed business expenses. Mr. Freed, who is also a financial planner, has seen many clients during the past year seeking counsel on whether to marry. He was surprised to discover that more men than women heeded his advice.
 ''They'd paid for the hour, and they wouldn't listen to me,'' he said. ''I've had wealthy women say, 'We have to join this movement and be counted; we understand that there's a cost,' but they just didn't care.''
 As for Mr. Freed, marriage is unlikely to play a role in his own future. ''When I think about all this I think of a New Yorker cartoon where a couple is reading an article about gay marriage in the newspaper, and they say, 'Haven't these people suffered enough?'''

HEADLINE: Flamenco's Strange New Moves

BYLINE: By VALERIE GLADSTONE

DATELINE: JEREZ DE LA FRONTERA, Spain 

 BODY:
SINCE 1994, the Jerez Flamenco Festival has drawn flamenco lovers, many of them American, to this small, pretty town in the heart of Andalusia. For 15 days, they see exhibits, master classes and performances by both new and established dancers and musicians. On a cold and rainy late winter night, a crowd of shivering festival patrons hurried into the Teatro Villamarta for a premiere from Maria Pages, a leading light of the flamenco revolution that has turned this traditional dance form into a hot show-biz commodity. 
 The Pages Company's ''Songs Before a War'' (''Canciones, Antes de una Guerra'') showed clearly that commercial success is not necessarily a good thing. Ms. Pages, who won a wide following in the flamenco segment of ''Riverdance,'' was trying to use this soulful, ancient dance to convey an antiwar message. Supplanting the usual keening vocals and thrumming guitars with popular music associated with war, she kicked up her heels to Louis Armstrong's ''When the Saints Go Marching In'' and to African songs sung by Tsidii Le Loka. In the final moments, a curtain painted with a map of the world unfurled behind the performers as John Lennon's ''Imagine'' played over the sound system. 
 Ms. Pages, who will take ''Canciones'' to the International Festival of Music and Dance in Granada in June, is sinuous and eloquent when dancing traditional flamenco, and she knows how to move dancers around the stage. But this show, with its corny, incongruous elements, proved simply labored. 
 And it is not alone. The so-called ''new'' flamenco that has been developing over the last decade is mired in a crisis born of its success. As audiences have gotten bigger, a kind of artistic inflation has set in, with shows becoming more ambitious and more pretentious. At this festival, which often serves as a preview of the flamenco that will be seen in the United States the following year, major stars like Eva Yerbabuena, Antonio Canales and Ms. Pages all seemed unable to deliver mature, complex work. Only the relatively unknown Rafaela Carrasco managed a piece worth exporting. 
 The festival's director, Francisco Lopez, is aware of the problem. ''What we see now is dancers trying to make the transition from an entertainment designed for a party or cafe to producing modern shows for large audiences,'' he said. ''It's going to take time. Flamenco is really in its adolescence.''
 Miguel Marin, who packages the annual tour Flamenco Festival U.S.A., and who comes to Jerez every year looking for dancers and musicians to take to the United States, has seen first-hand the phenomenal growth of the flamenco audience both in Spain and abroad. In 2001, his festival's first year, he scheduled 11 shows in 3 cities. Last year there were 50 shows in 11 cities. ''In New York the first year,'' he said, ''3,639 people attended three concerts. Last year, 13,595 attended eight concerts, and many concerts sold out.'' 
 Given the rousing response of audiences both at home and abroad to their less traditional efforts, Spain's flamenco artists may not see any reason to change or grow. While foreigners continue to enjoy old-fashioned, highly theatrical flamenco performances, like those regularly presented by Noche Flamenca in New York (which is playing this month at Theater 80 in the East Village), the Spanish have largely had their fill. They are far more interested in artists who incorporate contemporary music and movement and in works that tell stories. But for several reasons, intrinsic to flamenco and to Spain, few artists are up to the challenge. 
 Flamenco was born in ancient Gypsy settlements in southern Spain some 150 years ago, but the concept of a flamenco show is new. Since its beginnings, flamenco has largely been a soloist's art, performed casually and spontaneously in homes and cafes. Over time, certain combinations of movement became connected with traditional songs, and dancers usually proved their artistry not by choreographing new steps but by imbuing the old with a display of spirit and virtuosity -- rather like ballet dancers in ''Swan Lake'' and ''Giselle.'' 
 Since flamenco artists have a rich source of traditional dance forms to use as reference for their solos, they have not pursued choreographic training. And few flamenco songs tell stories. They consist of four or five brief lines that evoke emotions. So learning how to embody a character or dramatize a narrative is not part of a flamenco dancer's preparation. 
 When asked about their training, the dancers usually point out that they have studied with the greats from their hometowns in Andalusia and spent a few years with a noted flamenco company. Now, because of expanding opportunities, dancers start troupes long before they are seasoned artists. They rarely understand what choreography entails, Mr. Lopez said.
 ''If a flamenco dancer is called in to choreograph for the National Ballet of Spain,'' he added, ''he or she teaches the whole company one of his or her signature routines. Then the whole company copies it, and they'll do it all together. That's what they call choreographing.'' 
 Another difficulty for flamenco artists trying to extend the form is the relative poverty of contemporary Spanish dance. Artistically isolated from the rest of the world during the Franco regime, Spain missed many developments in dance between 1939 and 1975. There are Spanish choreographers whose work has made it to the international stage, like Nacho Duato and Ramon Oller. But Spain's modern dance culture, far less developed than those of other European countries, has given flamenco artists few models to emulate. Trying to expand the lexicon, they borrow ballet pirouettes or Graham contractions. Ms. Pages even added a Hollywood soft shoe to one piece. But they have difficulty integrating these moves with flamenco style. 
 In some ways, flamenco today resembles American modern dance before Martha Graham: Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis and the other soloists who preceded her probably did not worry much about the paucity of group works. It took Graham's expansive choreographic vision to establish modern dance as a significant alternative to ballet. Flamenco will remain an uneven patchwork of inspired solo dancing and embarrassing new choreography until it is transformed by a similar maverick.
 The festival here did offer hope. Rafaela Carrasco, who presented ''A Glance at Flamenco'' (''Una Mirada del Flamenco''), appears on her way to creating truly original and modern flamenco, without gimmicks or pedantry. Her beautiful show was filled with atmospheric images evoking sensations and dreams. The musical arrangements included solos for cello, tabla and piano that worked well with the traditional instruments. But above all, Ms. Carrasco choreographed with contrapuntal complexity, meshing traditional moves with her own idiosyncratic and fluid style. 
 ''Flamenco has its limitations,'' Ms. Carrasco said. ''There are a lot of emotions that need other types of movement. That's why I've developed my own technique. I also make sure that my musical arrangements support my style. I learned a lot from the choreographer Mario Maya about theater. Still, we should have places to study choreography.
 ''It is very exciting being a flamenco choreographer in Spain today. It is also very lonely.''

HEADLINE: The Perfect Storm That Could Drown the Economy

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS

 BODY:
WE seem to be living in apocalyptic times. On NBC's ''Revelations,'' Bill Pullman and Natascha McElhone seek signs of the End of Days. In the Senate, gray-haired eminences speak of the ''nuclear option.''
 The doomsday theme is seeping into the normally circumspect world of economics. In April, Arjun Murti, a veteran analyst at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, warned that oil could ''super-spike'' to $105 a barrel. And increasingly, economists are prophesying that the American economy as a whole may be sailing into choppy waters.
 Just look at the many obvious and worrisome portents. The government each year spends much more than it brings in, and so the nation has a large budget deficit ($412 billion in fiscal 2004, and growing). Americans also import far more goods than they export, and so the nation has record trade and current account deficits. 
 As consumers, Americans personally spend significantly more than they earn. Worse, some imbalances are eerily reminiscent of conditions that helped touch off recent economic crises: Mexico in 1994, Asia in 1997, Russia in 1998 and Argentina in 2002. Throw in rising interest rates, warnings of a housing bubble and the potential for higher inflation and slower growth (aka stagflation) -- and you can understand why some economic analysts may be plumbing the New Testament for inspiration. 
 The forces propelling and buffeting the economy are like a series of interrelated and interconnected weather systems. Could they be setting the conditions for a perfect storm -- a swift series of disturbances that causes lasting damage? If so, what would it look like?
 ''There's a pattern that is familiar from so many other countries that have gotten into debt problems,'' said Jeffrey A. Frankel, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ''A simultaneous rise in interest rates, fall in securities prices and depreciation of the currency.'' 
 Of course, economists, always armed with bandoliers of caveats, are quick to warn that the economy is relatively healthy. Job growth numbers released on Friday were strong, with 274,00 new jobs created in April. 
 And they warn against drawing parallels too sharply between the mighty United States and emerging markets. The dollar remains the world's reserve currency, and the United States is a global military and political hegemon. And the nation has been able to borrow huge amounts for years without suffering a crisis. 
 That said, how might a perfect storm be created? It would likely gather overseas, and wouldn't necessarily take the form of a terrorist strike or oil shock. The United States finances its spendthrift ways by selling dollars and dollar-denominated securities (like Treasury bills) to foreign creditors, mostly to central banks in Asia. To sustain growth, the United States needs foreign creditors to continue to add to their piles every day. 
 Any signs to the contrary are worrisome. In February, when the Korean government suggested that the Bank of Korea might diversify its foreign exchange holdings, ''this seemingly innocuous statement set off a small panic in our stocks and bond markets,'' said James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
 If the Bank of China, which has been accumulating dollars at the rate of $200 billion a year, decides to cut back on new purchases, either to diversify or to let its currency appreciate, the United States would quickly have to offer sharply higher interest rates to retain existing investors and entice new ones. Nouriel Roubini, an economics professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, estimates that if China cut its rate of accumulation by half, long-term interest rates in the United States could rise by 200 basis points over a few months and the value of the dollar would fall.
 Such a rising tide -- the yield on the 10-year bond shooting from 4.25 to 6.25, the average 30-year mortgage rising from 6 percent to 8 percent -- would mean instantly higher borrowing costs for the government, businesses and consumers. It would drench Wall Street, soaking the stocks of giant interest-rate-sensitive blue chips like Citigroup and making life difficult for speculative, debt-ridden companies. Some highly leveraged hedge funds or investment banks caught on the wrong side of trades would incur significant losses. 
 The United States weathered a sharp decline in the stock market just a few years ago, in large part because of the housing market's strength. But a sharp rise in interest rates would literally hit home. For new home buyers, or for people with adjustable rate mortgages, 200 extra basis points of interest on a $400,000 mortgage would represent $8,000 a year in extra payments. If mortgage rates were to rise sharply, housing prices would level off and perhaps do the unthinkable: fall.
 Suddenly, the mechanisms that have allowed consumers to keep the economy afloat -- the ability to realize profits from selling homes, to refinance mortgages at lower rates and to borrow cheaply against home equity -- would be broken. In the absence of sharply rising wages, that $8,000 in extra interest would be $8,000 less to spend at Home Depot, or at the Cheesecake Factory, or at Disney World.
 ''Personal expenditures in the past 15 months have been largely financed by borrowing,'' said Wynne Godley, a Cambridge University economist who is affiliated with the Levy Institute at Bard College. ''And even a reduction in the pace of debt creation will force people to start spending less, on a big scale.''
 If the dollar weakens and consumption falls, the trade and current account deficits would start to narrow. But the United States economy would slow and, perhaps, even shrink.
 ''The result would not be a full-blown financial crisis most likely, but it would still be a major recession,'' said Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics and political science at the University of California at Berkeley.
 What would create the full-blown crisis? When the slowdown starts to radiate across the globe, said Catherine L. Mann, senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for International Economics. 
 For years, the American consumer has been the engine of global growth, by gobbling up the output of oil wells in Saudi Arabia and factories from Mexico to China. ''The slowdown in consumer spending is going to have a negative influence on the global economy through reduced international trade,'' Ms. Mann said. 
 What's more, a recovery would be comparatively slow in coming. When the global economy came to a screeching, synchronous halt in 2001, the United States led much of the world back to growth because the federal government went on a stimulus binge for several years: Congress significantly increased government spending while cutting taxes, and the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to historic lows, and held them there. 
 But in the perfect economic storm, none of these three powerful levers would be readily available. Today's deep budget deficits make both significant tax cuts and spending increases unlikely. And rising interest rates would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the Federal Reserve to reduce the cost of borrowing.
 It sure sounds alarming. But as the clouds gather and the wind stiffens, we sail onward, with no apparent adjustment in course, full steam ahead.
 Why aren't we rushing to take evasive action? Why is Congress adding new spending while it passes new tax cuts? Why aren't financial institutions encouraging Americans to pay down their debt rather take on more? 
 A lot of it has to do with timing. While many economists are willing to imagine in detail what a perfect storm would look like, virtually none will forecast precisely when -- or if -- it will start. And so it remains a vague and distant possibility.
 Besides, adds Jeffrey Frankel, ''some of us have been warning of this hard-landing scenario for more than 20 years.''

ASSASSINATION VACATION
By Sarah Vowell.
258 pp. Simon & Schuster. $21.
 Not long ago, I made the mistake of thinking there was something new-ish under the sun. The occasion was the protracted, nearly concurrent death watches for Terri Schiavo and Pope John Paul II, during which the news media felt compelled to highlight every detail of physical decay, no matter how intimate. Terri Schiavo has just received a morphine suppository! The Pope is being fed through his nose! I don't mean to sound lofty or scornful; I was glued to the tube, too. But for the dying, this gruesome play-by-play seemed a horrible violation, and also a uniquely contemporary one -- yet another symptom of a culture with serious boundary issues.
 Then I read Sarah Vowell's ''Assassination Vacation,'' a learned, engagingly discursive, funny, sometimes even jolly ramble -- literally -- through the landscape of American presidential assassinations. Vowell, a journalist and essayist in the McSweeney's orbit, reminds us that after James A. Garfield was shot in the back on July 2, 1881 (the 20th president was boarding a train in Washington, bound for a New England vacation after only four months in office -- how George W. Bush-like), he lingered on for two and a half months before finally succumbing, and that during this protracted farewell, the citizenry was just as riveted by the president's fluctuating condition as we would be today. Crowds gathered at newspaper and telegraph offices to await the icky medical bulletins emanating from what turned out to be Garfield's deathbed. One day, for instance, the world learned he had had a ''free discharge of healthy-looking pus.'' And after he finally left this mortal coil, the poor man suffered one last invasion of privacy: his spine, removed during autopsy, was passed around to jurors during the trial of his assassin, a delusional man who had been haunting the White House and the State Department in hopes of being named ambassador to France. To what evidentiary purpose Garfield's spine ended up in jurors' hands, Vowell does not say -- even in death, most politicians would be mortified to have their backbones examined -- but the incident does serve as proof that when it comes to ghoulishness, you'll rarely outdo the 19th century, and this despite its lack of 24-hour cable news networks and their attendant programming needs.
 ''Assassination Vacation'' revels in such small epiphanies. Having made the commercially courageous decision to avoid the catnip that is the Kennedy name, Vowell restricts her gaze to America's first three presidential murders: those of Abraham Lincoln, Garfield and William McKinley. Mixing travelogue, history, personal essay and social criticism, she follows the loose formula perfected in two previous collections of magazine pieces and adapted versions of her appearances on public radio's ''This American Life,'' where she is a regular. (She has entertained an even larger audience as the voice of Violet, the sulky teenage daughter in ''The Incredibles.'')
 Here, displaying heroic obsessiveness, she dedicates herself to visiting virtually every historical site associated with the three assassinations no matter how tangential, roaming as far afield as the Dry Tortugas, 70 miles off Key West, where four of the conspirators in Lincoln's shooting were locked up. And then it's off to Mount Marcy in the Adirondacks, which is where, in 1901, Vice President Theodore Roosevelt had been enjoying a ''bully good tramp'' through the woods when he learned that McKinley, gut-shot by a gloomy anarchist, was near death and that he, Roosevelt, would soon be president. Never at a loss for a bus ticket or a friend willing to drive her to a weed-choked cemetery, Vowell shows herself to be a connoisseur of half-hidden historical plaques, recreated sitting rooms and docents in hoop skirts. She suffers for her quest. ''Going to Ford's Theater to watch the play,'' she notes, ''is like going to Hooters for the food.''
 Vowell attributes what she calls ''this whole morbid assassination death trip'' to, in part, her anger at the current president and his policies, particularly the war in Iraq -- to which she draws a parallel with McKinley's elective attack on Spain. (This isn't just a lefty reflex: Karl Rove is also said to be fond of McKinley-Bush parallels.) Her ''simmering rage'' at the president alarms her: 
 ''If I can summon this much bitterness toward a presidential human being, I can sort of, kind of see how this amount of bile or more, teaming up with disappointment, unemployment, delusions of grandeur and mental illness, could prompt a crazier narcissistic creep to buy one of this country's widely available handguns. Not that I, I repeat, condone that. Like Lincoln, I would like to believe the ballot is stronger than the bullet. Then again, he said that before he got shot.'' 
 Readers who aren't offended by the preceding passage will find much to engage them. Vowell makes an excellent traveling companion, what with her rare combination of erudition and cheek. Structurally peripatetic, ''Assassination Vacation'' is like a real vacation in that its lack of a rigorous itinerary, its willingness to wander hither and yon as Vowell's interest is piqued, can be refreshing -- if you are not the sort of person who absolutely insists on arriving at the B & B in time for the lovely tea service. As you may have guessed, this book is an often astounding compendium of forgotten history and trivia, to the extent that those are two different things. We learn, for instance, that the canny thespian John Wilkes Booth, stalking Lincoln that fateful April evening at Ford's Theater, waited for a surefire laugh line to cover his shot; and that the line, a rejoinder in which a female character is dismissed as a ''sockdologizing old man trap,'' hasn't aged all that well. Still, as Vowell writes, ''it is a comfort of sorts to know that the bullet hit Lincoln mid-guffaw. . . . At least his last conscious moment was a hoot.'' 
 At some point, though, you do crave a little traction where the wheels hit the road. For all its larkiness, ''Assassination Vacation'' means to be a serious book about a troublesome subject. It is a serious book, although I'm not sure what Vowell is ultimately trying to say. I'm not sure she knows, either; she tacitly admits as much by avoiding conclusions as if they themselves were gloomy anarchists or lunatic ambassadors manques, although she does draw one interesting comparison:
 ''The egomania required to be president or a presidential assassin makes the two types brothers of sorts. Presidents and presidential assassins are like Las Vegas and Salt Lake City that way. Even though one city is all about sin and the other is all about salvation, they are identical, one-dimensional company towns built up out of the desert by the sheer will of true believers. The assassins and the presidents invite the same basic question: Just who do you think you are?''
 Vowell seems to consider this a rhetorical question, and perhaps rightly so. Assassination, as a subject, may seem like one of those perfect, irresistible windows on the American psyche, like baseball, or the mob or Marilyn Monroe. But when you look more closely, assassins themselves may be too ornery and too peculiar, their motives too singular, their moments in history too specific to serve as useful dots for connection -- a moral you could also draw from Stephen Sondheim's struggles with the fascinating, equally larky, but ultimately incoherent musical ''Assassins,'' another take on this same sorry subject. Vowell, for her part, pretty much throws up her hands when it comes to Larger Meaning and heads for the next historical marker. Not to sound like Deepak Chopra or Mitch Albom, but it's best to read this book for the journey, not the destination.

IRRESISTIBLE EMPIRE
America's Advance Through Twentieth-Century Europe.
By Victoria de Grazia.
Illustrated. 586 pp. The Belknap Press/Harvard University Press. $29.95.
 Victoria De Grazia slaps Europeans in the face with her title: face it, mes amis, you are part of the American empire. Zut alors! As a proud European, I confess to letting out a small splutter. Didn't we just snub the emperor-president, George W. Bush, by rejecting great swaths of his foreign policy? Don't we have a social democratic model that avoids the vertiginous inequalities of the United States? Aren't we free and self-determining democracies, building up our own superpower based in Brussels? 
 Well, maybe -- but if Charlemagne or Napoleon could see their continent today, they would be with de Grazia. One glance at Europe's great capitals, and they would assume Europe had been conquered, occupied and settled by Americans. The men who dreamed of l'Europe profonde would curse the ubiquity of Eminem as they sat in the greasy KFC on the Falls Road in Belfast munching their Chicken Popcorn. They would stagger their way around Italy's most beautiful city, guided by a McDonald's map of McVenice. 
 ''Irresistible Empire'' is the story of how this happened, of how an imperium came to Europe in the form of an emporium. Unlike the Middle East and Latin America, Europe has seen only the peaceful face of America's empire. De Grazia, a professor of history at Columbia University, shows how -- in just one century -- the Old Continent was subject to slow conquest by a million consumer goods. 
 She talks us through the rise of a string of outwardly banal institutions: Rotary Clubs, supermarkets, the Hollywood star system, corporate advertising. With the careful skill of an expert defusing an explosive, she teases out the dense clusters of political ideology embodied in these seemingly everyday social institutions. 
 The old European capitalism was epitomized by the small neighborhood store. At its core was ''a commercial ethic that still sought trust in the longevity of contacts and the solidarity of face-to-face contacts.'' Slowly, this model was eclipsed by an American capitalism epitomized by the out-of-town supermarket, big, anonymous and neon. The local, the diverse and the class-segmented were all ironed out in favor of a mass standard of consumption.
 Instead of the Great Man theory of history, de Grazia gives us the Great Bargain theory. It's startling just how rapidly Europe has been changed by this new model. Who knew, for example, that in the late 1950's there was not a single supermarket in Milan, and this was by no means untypical for a European city? How many of us realize that as recently as 1954, only 9 percent of French people had a refrigerator? Yet in a work crammed with exhaustive research, the reader pines for analysis. All of contemporary European politics spins on the question: Were the developments de Grazia details good for Europe? 
 The answer cannot be squeezed into the simple-minded good-and-evil story craved on both sides of the Atlantic. De Grazia concentrates primarily on the areas where Americanization has had a broadly positive effect. But even the Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci wrote lovingly in his ''Prison Notebooks'' of how Americanism and Fordism were hollowing out the old feudal snobberies.
 Perhaps unwittingly, de Grazia steers away from the areas where corporate Americanization has been pernicious for Europe. I would like to see her turn her remarkable skills to charting the effect of American corporate buyouts on Europe's news and entertainment media. Nor does she mention the environmental impact of this economic system. And is any analysis of European supermarkets complete without mentioning the biggest public health scare on the continent for 50 years? The supermarkets, relentless pressure for cheap food and industrial agriculture all pushed farmers to feed processed meat to cattle -- thus leading to Mad Cow disease.
 The other gap in de Grazia's narrative concerns a strange historical irony: Americanization gave birth to the idea of Europe. ''Henry Ford was as much a father of the European idea as anyone from Europe, given his company's pioneering effort to treat the European region as a single sales territory,'' she notes dryly. She's right, but the point is left hanging. Ford set in motion the conflict that will define the European Union over the coming decades. It can be summarized in a simple question: Does Europe exist to achieve Ford's goal -- one vast market for American goods -- or to resist this possibility and create a distinctively social democratic alternative?
 De Grazia focuses on one relatively minor European-resistance cause -- the slow food movement -- and at first it seems an eccentric choice. Founded in the late 1980's, it has a simple purpose: to give everybody the time and space to eat good, unprocessed food slowly and carefully. When America waves a Big Mac, the Slow Foodies want Europe to wave a bowl of freshly cooked pasta al dente. But if they are few in number, their approach symbolizes the wider European reaction to American neoliberalism: slow down. Europeans want long vacations, generous welfare states and flexible work hours. They -- we -- are trying to articulate a different model of consumerism that values leisure and family as much as work, work, work. Can this work? Is there a way to combine America's dazzling consumer economy with social justice and environmental sanity? 
 Like many Europeans, I have a dystopian vision of the death of Europe as an alternative to America. Far from resolving tensions across the Atlantic, the irresistible empire's blanding out would simply produce a long European grudge, a quiet rage that we had sold our identity for a bag of Doritos. I see it now: Napoleon and Charlemagne sit grumbling in a doughnut shop after a long day in the new Euro-America. Napoleon swallows hard on a Krispy Kreme, turns to a weeping Charlemagne, and whispers, ''Dude, I so hate America.''

HEADLINE: Smart? Fine, but Do You Know What to Do With the Olive Pits?

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
At the annual senior etiquette dinner at Salve Regina University in Newport, R.I., in February, one student, Jennifer Bladykas, was surprised to learn that reaching for the salt before tasting her entree tells people she is prone to rash decisions. She also learned where to put the spoon after stirring her coffee, and in what direction to pass bread. 
 ''Dining out seemed so simple, but I realize now it says a lot about your character,'' said Ms. Bladykas, a Long Island native who will begin a job with a New York City marketing firm after graduation. 
 Courtney Richardson, a senior at Lehman College in the Bronx, now knows that if the host orders a salad but he wants steak, he's eating salad, too. And after attending a March session of Goofs, Goblets and Getting the Edge, a program at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Brandon Lee, a junior, sees the wisdom of doing without leftovers. ''I probably would have said yes to the doggie bag,'' Mr. Lee said. ''But they told us never to do that. It's not the Last Supper; it's business.'' 
 It used to be that college seniors and graduate students prepared for the work world with just the usual round of workshops on resume writing and interview skills. But as this generation prepares for life after college, they are also flocking to seminars on dining etiquette, an offering on the rise at colleges and universities nationwide, to learn the fine points of dealing with olive pits and missing dessert forks.
 Philip Gardner, an economist at Michigan State University who studies college labor market trends as director of the Collegiate Employment Research Institute, said students were doing much more than they used to in preparation for the work world. ''The job market is still very competitive,'' he said, ''and there is a lot of experienced labor out there also looking for work.'' 
 At Marist College, the waiting list for the twice-a-semester dining etiquette program is hundreds of students long; the Dining for Success program at the State University of New York in Binghamton was so popular last fall that it had to be moved to a bigger hall. 
 Etiquette consultants say business is booming. ''I started doing Girl Scout troops and PTA trainings in the late 1990's, but my business has increased 100 percent since 2000,'' said Maureen Wild Sanders, founder of High Road Solutions, a business protocol training firm in Bridgewater, N.J. ''Now 75 percent of my clients are in higher education or corporations.'' 
 Although good manners have always been important in business, etiquette specialists say its importance lapsed in the heady days of the late 90's. 
 ''You had these young entrepreneurs wearing sandals and a T-shirt to work, and that spilled over into blue-chip corporations, who questioned their buttoned-up culture,'' said Pamela J. Holland, co-author of ''Help! Was That a Career Limiting Move?'' (Career Skills Press, 2001) and chief operating officer of Brody Communications in Philadelphia, which provides dining etiquette training to corporate clients. ''I think this renewed interest in civility and manners is a reaction to that.'' 
 The lack of formal dining knowledge seems especially acute in Generation Y -- generally considered anyone born after 1980. James Chung, president of Research Advisors in Boston, a strategy and research firm that focuses on generational demographics and shifts in social attitudes, says this generation has grown up during a fundamental shift in American family structure and a move away from formality in culture generally. 
 ''This was a very mobile generation of kids -- they spawned ubiquitous eat-on-the-run products and supersize drinks that fit into minivan cup holders -- and they lost the habit of valuing and respecting family dining time,'' Mr. Chung said. 
 Of course, a business meal is not a family dinner, and keeping elbows off the table will not be enough to impress a potential employer. Students at college etiquette seminars are usually asked to completely rethink the way they view a meal. 
 Ann Marie Sabath, founder of At Ease, a Midtown Manhattan etiquette training firm, and author of ''Business Etiquette: 101 Ways to Conduct Business With Charm & Savvy'' (Career Press, 2002), conducted the dining etiquette program at Lehman College in April. She tried to impress on students that business meals ''aren't really about eating.'' 
 ''These kids don't realize that dinner or lunch is an interview; the food is just an excuse for getting together. We teach them everything from what to order to how to eat -- no cutting up all the food beforehand, no chewing on the ice when the drink is done.'' 
 At Marist College, etiquette training includes a multicourse dinner of challenging foods, like salads with cherry tomatoes and olives with pits, French onion soup and pasta with red sauce. 
 SUNY Binghamton began its dining etiquette program in 2003 in response to feedback from employers and alumni that its students were ''smart but needed to strengthen their savvy and social skills,'' said Nancy Paul, director of the school's career development center.. 
 Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., holds a four-course dining etiquette workshop each spring, and Richard L. White, director of career services, said he was surprised at the general level of naivete.
 ''Students ask things like what to do with food stuck in your teeth, what to do if you spill something, drop your fork, don't like your food,'' he said. ''They are also very concerned about making conversation during meals. This generation lives on the Internet and simply doesn't know how to make social chit-chat.''
 Although it is Generation Y entering the work force, their predecessors in Generation X -- now aged 26 to 40 -- are often in middle and even senior management, and companies increasingly call on consultants like Ms. Sabath to help them brush up on etiquette skills. Ms. Sabath said 60 percent of her clients were corporations wanting to make sure employees did not embarrass themselves or the company when conducting business socially. 
 Pauline Winick and Dale Webb, founders of the Protocol Center in Miami, said corporations were about the same percentage of their clients. ''We are often asked to train midlevel employees,'' Ms. Winick said, ''because the company can't send them to work with a client until they know their level of social skill.'' 
 Regardless of one's place in the work hierarchy, it is hard to argue against good manners, said Ms. Wild Sanders. ''If you are competing for a job or promotion against others with the same level of competency but you have the social skills, too,'' she said, ''you always clobber the competition.''

HEADLINE: Stony Brook Wins Battle Over Property

BYLINE: By BARBARA GERBASI

 BODY:
AFTER almost three years of conflicting visions and stalemated negotiations, the Gyrodyne property, a bucolic strip of land bordering a stretch of Route 25A in St. James, will become part of a research and development center at Stony Brook University. 
 The Gyrodyne Company of America, which has owned the property since 1951 and built pilotless helicopters there until 1973, had hoped to build a luxury golf community with 80 town houses and 256 houses. 
 The university wanted to build a research and development campus and, after fruitless negotiations, began efforts last year to acquire the largely undeveloped tract through condemnation proceedings. 
 A four-judge panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court ruled on April 25 that Stony Brook could proceed with its plans to annex 246 acres of the 314-acre Gyrodyne property and build its research and development campus. The tract, which is next to the university, is also known as Flowerfield.
 Work on the first building, which will house the Center for Excellence in Wireless Technology, is expected to start early next year. It will be financed through Gov. George E. Pataki's Statewide Center for Excellence Initiative; $50 million was allocated for the project, which straddles Brookhaven and Smithtown.University officials said that 133 other major research universities in the United States had research-and-development parks and that the absence of one at Stony Brook would limit its ability to stimulate the Long Island economy if young scientists and entrepreneurs left for opportunities elsewhere. 
 John Jay LaValle, Brookhaven's town supervisor, called the court's ruling a crucial decision for the future of Long Island's economy. 
 ''The development of these research centers will spin off new technologies and high-paying jobs to the Long Island economy,'' he said. 
 Not everyone is as enthusiastic about the project. 
 ''A planner looks at this project from another perspective,'' said Frank DeRubeis, the director of planning for the Town of Smithtown. ''They are proposing something that is reasonably low key, but who knows what may happen in the long run? The plan could change. They are not bound to it. 
 ''Right now the primary access to the new part of campus will be through Nicholls Road, which could accommodate the extra traffic. However, if they were to change access to Route 25A, a road that is already operating at capacity, it would be a problem.''
 Peter Pitsiokos, the executive vice president of Gyrodyne, took a wait-and-see approach, too.
 ''It remains to be seen if the state does indeed have the money to purchase the land at the fair market value,'' he said, adding that it could be as much as $100 million.
 Gyrodyne has no plans to appeal the court's ruling. ''They didn't leave us any hope,'' Mr. Pitsiokos said.
 The company will continue to own 68 acres at the site and to lease its industrial park there, with 70 tenants. 
 The university's plans call for 100,000 square feet of offices and research laboratories in the first phase of the project in a three-story brick and metal-panel building. 
 Patrick Calabria, a university spokesman, said that the labs would support highly specialized electronics and research programs focusing on wireless devices and communications, networking and software systems, especially cybersecurity. 
 This first building is scheduled to be followed by nine others over 10 years. The plan suggests that part of the space could be occupied by businesses that team up with the university in corporate research and product development.
 The 246 acres are undeveloped and will require no change from the current zoning, light industrial.
 These are the nine other buildings: 
 The recent state budget provides $22.2 million for a Center for Computational Neuroscience. 
 The Nanoscience and Technology Research Center will be a 75,000-square-foot lab building that would combine physical- and life-science research and engineering. 
 The Development Partners Research Center would develop practical applications for discoveries made on campus.
 The Development Facility will be a proving ground for emerging technologies.
 The Software Incubator Facility will have 50,000 square feet for software development. 
 The High-Tech Competitiveness Institute will house a research center to help established industries eliminate waste. 
 Three other research-and-development buildings similar to the Development Partners Research Center are also planned. 
 ''The cost of any future buildings will be financed in a variety of ways, either through capital budgets or through partnerships with private industry, who would like to take advantage of the research and intellectual capital,'' Mr. Calabria said.

HEADLINE: Golf Homes Attract Even Those Who Don't Play

BYLINE: By ROBERT JOHNSON

 BODY:
IN the game of golf, a triple bogey -- three strokes over par on one hole -- is bad news. 
 The market for homes in communities located on golf courses would seem imperiled by an economic triple bogey of sorts right now: golf equipment sales are dwindling, the number of new golfers is flatter than a Texas fairway and golf courses are going out of business in the United States at about double the rate of a decade ago, 63 last year.
 None of that matters to Dr. Paul Capito, a radiologist who recently bought a 4,500-square-foot home on the golf course at Uwharrie Point in rural North Carolina about 50 miles west of Pinehurst. Dr. Capito doesn't even play golf. ''Never in my life,'' he said. 
 ''I have five children, ages 3 to 10, and I was drawn to the Uwharrie Point development because of the many amenities there besides golf: a beautiful lake, nature trails and excellent security,'' he said. ''It's gated and you have to talk to a real person to get in.'' There are also classes in art and gardening, and a guided trip to an area museum that he hopes will interest his children. ''The fact that it's a golf community is just part of the overall ambience; it's a lovely, quiet and safe place.'' He said houses there range from $650,000 to $1.8 million.
 Nongolfers like Dr. Capito are perhaps the major reason that the waning popularity of the links doesn't daunt the developers of golf-oriented subdivisions. In fact, the strategy of building golf courses as part of housing developments is a more popular play than ever. 
 Of the expected 150 new golf courses being built around the country this year, about 60 percent will be part of residential developments, according to the National Golf Foundation, a research group in Jupiter, Fla. In the 1990's, only about 30 percent of new courses were surrounded by homes. Only about one-fifth of the nation's 15,000 total golf facilities are in communities. Most of the rest are at individual country clubs or part of public park systems.
 So what's behind the optimism of golf community builders? They're discovering increasingly strong demand for housing in such subdivisions from nongolfers.
 ''Even though the popularity of golf isn't rising the way it once was, the premiums on golf development homes over comparable housing nearby that isn't on a course is now 30 percent to 40 percent in some areas,'' two or three times the typical markup in the 90's, said Jeff Woolson, managing director of CB Richard Ellis Golf Operations, a consulting firm in Carlsbad, Calif.
 One strategy of the developers who are building more golf community homes is that many are quietly cutting construction costs. The typical course and clubhouse in a community in the mid-90's cost $5 million to $10 million, said Tom Clark, a course designer in Kensington, Md. But lately the typical amount invested by developers is $2.5 million to $4 million, he said.
 One caveat presented by a bargain-priced golf course is that the surrounding community won't have the marketing power that comes from having a facility branded with the name of a famous professional player like Jack Nicklaus or Arnold Palmer. 
 Will cheaper golf courses affect the appreciation of home values in the community? Mr. Clark says no, because it won't matter to the nongolfers who have become the main buyers in these developments. Still, real estate agents say that all golf community shoppers should check into the quality of the course's construction and the developer's plans for maintaining it.
 Nongolfers are attracted to golf communities for reasons having to do with lifestyle, said Lewis Goodkin, a real estate researcher and consultant in Miami. ''We know that many people who buy homes on the ocean rarely, if ever, go swimming in the surf or own boats,'' he said. ''That isn't the point, and golf often isn't what lures them to golf communities.'' 
 Instead, the big draws include green space and peace and quiet. ''The golf course out back of your house can seem like an extension of your lot. It's a gardenlike atmosphere,'' Mr. Goodkin said. 
 The golf courses themselves are usually owned by the developer, with memberships available to people who live there but not required. Memberships are also sold to outsiders. 
 So attractive are the nongolf attributes of some of these developments that they thrive through the worst imaginable calamity: the golf course closes for lack of business. That happened in 2002 in the Bink's Forest community of West Palm Beach, Fla., where Larry Olevitch is among the 550 homeowners. ''The golf course folded, but our houses kept selling as fast as people would put them on the market,'' said Mr. Olevitch, a television marketing manager who paid $365,000 for his 3,500-square-foot house near the 17th tee in 1999. Similar houses in the Bink's Forest area are now selling for more than $600,000.
 There are various selling points of Mr. Olevitch's erstwhile golf course home, he said: one is that it is gated, and another is that it's ''a neighborhood of upscale homes and the golf course, while abandoned, has continued to be an amenity -- it's still quiet, green space.'' It is also, he said, in a desirable public school district. 
 The fact that the golf course was recently bought by a new owner with plans to refurbish it doesn't seem essential to Mr. Olevitch. ''I think that will be a good thing, but it hasn't been a disaster that the golf course closed,'' he said. 
 Some home buyers, in fact, find that life at the edge of a thriving golf course has drawbacks. ''You get the balls bouncing into your yard and banging into the house,'' said Mr. Goodkin, the consultant. ''Gardeners are always mowing and blowing to keep the course immaculate. And you keep hearing the players' expletives.'' 
 He lived on a golf course in Palm Springs, Calif., for several years but sold that house in the mid-90's. ''I just got tired of living with golf,'' said Mr. Goodkin, who still describes himself as ''a golf devotee.'' 
 But many home buyers in golf developments are willing to tolerate the golf course in order to be part of such a community's overall lifestyle. ''Golf is part of a package of amenities they're seeking; the main thing about the golf for some buyers is the prestige factor,'' Mr. Clark said. ''People don't go around saying, 'I live in a place that has a great bingo night.' Even if they don't play golf, they like to say, 'I live in a golf course home.'''

HEADLINE: McMansions, Bash-and-Builds, Bigfoots

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
AFTER her husband died, Barbara Wirkus decided it was time to sell the house in Union where they had lived for 38 years and raised four sons. She moved into bungalow, ''a lovely little home'' on a cul-de-sac in Kenilworth, a town the 72-year-old widow describes six years later as ''a town that time forgot.'' She planted a garden and made friends with her neighbors. 
 But soon her next-door neighbor added a porch and a family room to his house -- which sits on a 50-by-100-foot lot -- bringing the house eight feet closer and looming a story and a half above hers. Today, the neighbor's house is so close that the light from the motion detector shines into her house, Ms. Wirkus said, and ''cats or rabbits set it off 20 times a night.''
 Her experience is not unusual. You see them -- oversize houses -- in the more-established and densely populated communities like Cresskill, Short Hills and Westfield, where older, smaller houses once stood, and they now dwarf the Cape Cods, low ranches and even the elegant, turn-of-the-century homes. 
 Indeed, the number of oversize houses from 3,000 to 10,000 square feet with entrances like Tara, windows like European cathedrals and garages like small municipal lots has increased so drastically in the last decade that many local governments from Bergen County to Cape May County -- where the character of neighborhoods is threatened -- find themselves struggling to establish new zoning ordinances or rewriting existing ones in an effort to restrict the size of the new structures. 
 These sprawling new homes have as many names as there are styles, from ''trophy homes'' to ''monster homes'' and ''McMansions,'' ''starter castles'' to ''plywood palaces.'' In North Jersey, detractors call them ''bash and builds'' and ''bigfoots.'' But whatever the name, they present neighbors with a sudden expanse of towering wall to look at, blocking sunlight, altering the streetscape and even changing the character of the neighborhood.
 ''What people may be objecting to is the fact these homes are so out of sync with the traditional style and character of their towns,'' said Tim Dillingham, executive director of the American Littoral Society, an environmental group. ''I think people recognize that a sense of place is very important and that at some level the negative reaction to these teardowns and out-of-scale houses is a reaction to that sense of place being destroyed.'' 
 In 2002, a report sponsored by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, ''Taming the Teardown Trend,'' said that demolitions were approaching ''epidemic proportions'' in historic neighborhoods, and that 100 communities in 20 states had experienced significant numbers of teardowns.
 Adrian Scott Fine, director of the northeast office of the National Trust in Philadelphia and an author of the report, said there had been no statistical follow-up, but that through discussions with communities, he thought teardowns had gone beyond the 100 communities.
 ''If anything, it's gotten much more exacerbated,'' Mr. Fine said. ''The demand for the big house seems to be alive and well. The real estate market seems to be able to move these houses fairly well.''
 In New Jersey alone, between 1998 and 2003 the number of demolition permits issued by municipalities rose to 5,006 from 2,967, according to the state Department of Community Affairs. And while many of these involved replacing older housing in cities like Camden, Newark, and Paterson, planners said a sizable number could be linked to the construction of larger homes.
 Under current land-use law, municipalities cannot stop a homeowner or builder from tearing down a house. Nor, from an aesthetic point of view, can they dictate what a house can look like. But they do have the right to regulate size. 
 In a major victory for municipalities over builders, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that the town of Fair Haven, in Monmouth County, had the right to put a cap on the floor area of a single-family house regardless of lot size. 
 ''What Fair Haven did was it upheld an ordinance which limited in absolute terms the size of a house in terms of square feet,'' said a Jeffrey Zenn, the lawyer for the Tenafly Planning Board.
 Tenafly, which had 115 teardowns over five years, is reworking its zoning ordinance, but it is having a problem defining exactly what a McMansion is. 
 ''A McMansion means different things to different people,'' Mr. Zenn said. "My definition of a McMansion is not your definition. You may say the ugly house with all kinds of turrets is a McMansion. I can say it's just in bad taste."

McGreevey Took Aim
 Former Gov. James E. McGreevey came up with a plan to inhibit the growth of oversize houses when he reached for the word McMansions in his 2003 State of the State address and attacked them as contributing to ''mindless sprawl.'' 
 But Mr. McGreevey's proposal for a 1 percent tax on new houses selling for more than $1 million died with his political career last year, and acting Gov. Richard J. Codey -- a sponsor of fast-track legislation in the Senate aimed at speeding the approval process for developers -- has shown no inclination to tilt at McMansions.
 To be sure, opinions vary wildly on the appropriateness of larger and larger houses -- the most obvious statement homeowners can make about their station in life and their bank balance.
 John Barba, president of Barba Builders, a third-generation homebuilder based in Chatham and former president of the New Jersey Builders Associaton, said he was not against regulations limiting the size of new houses as long as they were fair. ''The town should not be in the business of preventing improvements to residential real estate,'' Mr. Barba said. 
 The growth of oversize houses -- very often teardowns -- is a relatively recent phenomenon, a little more than 10 years old, said Thomas Wright, executive vice president of the Regional Plan Association, with many of them having attached three- and four- car garages facing the street.
 One such garage in Princeton, Mr. Wright commented, was so large it came to be known as ''the Taj Garage.''
 ''Communities have always been renewing themselves since Colonial times,'' he said, ''but this new wave of massive residential structures represents a real shift.''
 Robert E. Lang, an urban affairs specialist who is director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech, said that although some people are critical of newer, oversize houses because of the amount of energy they require, they are part of a trend in American construction.
 ''This is an extension of a constant redefinition of the good life,'' Dr. Lang said. ''In the 1950's it was a station wagon and meatloaf. The good life today might mean you have a master bedroom the size your parents' ranch house.''
 Livio Mancino, a former mayor of Kenilworth, is upset with the proliferation of oversize houses -- particularly since two of them are rising behind his house on a 100-by-100-foot lot where a ranch house stood.
 Unlike other houses in the area that have 30-foot setbacks, the subdivided property behind Mr. Mancino will have a 15-foot setback that he says will obscure the sight lines of a busy intersection that children use on the way to St. Theresa's, a nearby elementary school.
 ''The houses make it a hazard for the children,'' he said. ''And aesthetically, they're an eyesore.
 The 70-year old Mr. Mancino -- who as mayor once put up signs urging the placement of traffic lights and even laid down in the street to make his point -- said he was about to dig in his heels once again. ''I'm erecting a sign on my property telling people what's going up,'' he said.

Will Values Rise or Fall?
 Conventional wisdom usually dictates that most houses appreciate in value after nearby homes are renovated. But in these cases, James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, is not so sure.
 ''It may go down, because if you're living next to a McMansion and it's towering over you, your house becomes less valuable,'' Dr. Hughes said. ''But it may become more valuable if the house you have becomes a target for McMansion. It's a potential site for rebuilding.''
 On the other hand, rising home prices are no friend of first-time buyers. Jeffrey Tittel, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, contended that the boom in teardowns and oversize houses was keeping buyers out of the market and middle-class families out of some towns that were once within their financial reach.
 ''It squeezes the middle class and even the upper middle class,'' Mr. Tittel said. ''A family of four making $150,000 a year can't afford a million-and-a-half-dollar home.''
 Of course, not everyone is as critical of the larger homes as Mr. Tittel is.
 In Saddle River, a house going up with turrets, at least three large chimneys, cupolas, arched windows and a slate roof seems to fill most of the two-acre plot on which it sits. The back of the house is only a short distance from Hillsdale, which two years ago passed an ordinance curtailing the growth of such large houses. 
 ''We saw some homes we thought were a bit large for the size of the lot in Hillsdale but thankfully not as bad as in other towns,'' said Dennis S. Deutsch, Hillsdale's mayor. 
 The house does not bother Tom Beatini, its closest neighbor in Hillsdale, although he did have one reservation. ''We're on a well,'' Mr. Beatini said, ''and we're wondering if they're going to put an underground sprinkler system in for what little lawn they have and how the amount of water will affect the water in the neighborhood.''
 Another neighbor, John M. Kolvek, said, ''I haven't spoken to anyone, but it's fine with me.'' His son, Chris, called it a monstrosity but added: ''I don't know if anyone's upset here. We're more astounded.''
 Defenders say the larger houses are only symbols of the desire for bigger living spaces that took root in the boom years in the 1990's. A study issued in 2002 by the National Association of Home Builders found that the size of the American house had grown while the size of the plot on which it sat had shrunk.
 In 1987, the average house was 1,905 square feet; by 2002, the average size was 2,320 square feet. Yet the average lot size decreased from 17,600 square feet in 1987 to 16,400 in 2002 and, according to Michael Carliner, an economist with the association, it went down to 15,788 in 2003. 
 ''I think it's a change in culture and fashion,'' Mr. Carliner said. ''People are willing to accept a small lot for more house.''
 Joanne Harkins, director of land use planning for the New Jersey Builders Association, said: ''You have a lot of houses that were built sometimes 100 years ago and even 50 years ago, and these houses were for a different era and generations. People want different houses now. The look and the heating and plumbing are obsolete, windows not double-paned.'' 
 Today, Ms. Harkins said, developers build what the towns will allow. 
 In many towns -- particularly those close to New York, where developable land is scarce -- the property has become more valuable than the house itself, leading builders to tear them down and build larger ones.

Brisk Activity in Westfield
 During a recent drive through Westfield, a prosperous middle-class town in Union County, James Foerst, a councilman who is chairman of the Code Review and Town Property Committee, said he bought his house because he liked the fact that it was built in 1914 and had character. But many houses like his, he said, are being torn down by developers and replaced by larger ones.
 From 1998 through 2003, according to the state Department of Community Affairs, Westfield issued 77 demolition permits -- 38 in 2003 alone. Driving along Coolidge Street, Mr. Foerst noted that within the last two years, seven houses had been replaced by far larger ones. 
 ''It's very common for a builder to pay $500,000 to knock a house down and put up a $1.3 million house, which when you look at it doesn't look like what you thought anyone would spend a million dollars on,'' Mr. Foerst said. 
 To Susan Burrows Farber, deputy executive director of external affairs for New Jersey Future, the figures tell a different story.
 Ms. Farber said teardowns as a tool of development can help keep a community vital, especially when dilapidated buildings near transit lines in downtown areas are demolished and rebuilt.
 ''The issue becomes a concern when what was demolished is being replaced with a structure inconsistent with the character of the community,'' she said. ''We would argue that is not smart growth.''
 Jennifer Evans-Cowley, a planner and assistant professor at the Austin E. Knowlton School of Architecture at Ohio State University, said municipalities began regulating oversize houses about five years ago. 
 ''Some are putting limits on the floor-area ratio,'' Dr. Evans-Cowley said, ''some are putting limits on maximum lot coverage, and some are putting in height limitations.''. 
 As she put it: ''When you have one or two oversize houses, it's no big deal. But when you begin to have more, then people feel there is a need to find out what's going on and it's up to the community to investigate.'' 
 In Millburn, where there have been 84 teardowns in the last six years, mainly in the Short Hills area, the town introduced an ordinance in January limiting the size of teardowns, only to run into a hailstorm of criticism from builders, architects and others at several public hearings. Some homeowners expressed concern that their property would lose value if the expansion possibilities were limited. 
 A subcommittee of the planning board has reworked the ordinance, simplifying the language. (One criticism at public hearings was that it was too complicated, according to the subcommittee chairman, Michael Gorman.) After another public meeting this month, Mr. Gorman said he hoped the council would be able to act.
 ''What we're trying to do essentially is two things,'' Mr. Gorman said. ''We're trying to control the size of house being built and control the lot where they can be built.''
 He added: ''The balance we're trying to attain is to create changes to our ordinance that would still have people think about Millburn as a place to come where they can build the home of their dreams. And we want to balance that with a respect for the privacy of existing residents..''
 Planners in Princeton Borough have also been fine-tuning an ordinance introduced last spring after holding several neighborhood meetings, said Lee Solow, the region's planning director. 
 ''We're starting the process up again with different neighborhoods and we're going to go back to the planning board with a verbal report,'' Mr. Solow said.
 Upper Saddle River is reconsidering an ordinance after residents rejected an earlier one in a nonbinding referendum last November aimed at limiting new homes to less than 7,000 square feet. 
 Westfield has appropriated $50,000 to study the types of housing in town before drafting an ordinance aimed at setting standards, Mr. Foerst said.
 And Cresskill passed an ordinance several years ago limiting the footprint of a house to 20 percent of the lot, Mayor Ben Romeo said. 
 ''It took two years to hammer out the ordinance,'' Mayor Romeo said, ''and it is still a work in progress.
 ''We went to the building department and got all the builders' names and called them to a meeting to tell us what they need by way of size to make a profit,'' Mayor Romeo added. ''Told them, 'Tell us what you need, not what you want. You want 30-foot lot coverage but that's not going to happen.' Invariably, everyone worked with us.''
 In the face of more and more ordinances limiting the size of houses, Ms. Harkins of the New Jersey Builders Association said that such measures could drive away home buyers and builders wanting to do business in those towns.

Builders May 'Look Elsewhere'
 ''They would look elsewhere,'' she said. ''They probably would not invest significantly in those municipalities.'' 
 Dr. Lang of Virginia Tech carried that thought further. ''If you have houses built in the 1970's when 2,000 square feet was a lot of room and you set that against the modern standard which is 3,000 feet and larger, and then you frustrate the market's development, you may not be that upscale a town forever,'' Dr. Lang said. ''You're also pushing people into new construction somewhere else rather than infill housing.''
 For his part, Ron Emrich, executive director of Preservation New Jersey, dismissed such reasoning and said people needed a sense of place that oversize houses could not give.
 ''As big and ostentatious as these houses tend to be, they also tend to look the same,'' Mr. Emrich said. ''The McMansion in Closter is going to look much like the one in Colt's Neck. I think people are tired of that. People want a place that's different and unique where they can say they are from, someplace rather than just anyplace.''

HEADLINE: He's a Light To the World's Poor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LASER

DATELINE: BLOOMFIELD 

 BODY:
ONE-THIRD of the world's population has no access to electricity but Phil LaRocco is working on that problem, one watt at a time. 
 From a small office here, Mr. LaRocco and the nonprofit company he directs, E+Co., put together money from foundations, governments and investors, and lend it to entrepreneurs in Africa, Asia and Latin America. These local businesses then deliver solar power and other forms of clean energy to the poorest of the poor. 
 ''Energy is the key to alleviating poverty,'' Mr. LaRocco said bluntly during a recent conversation. ''Without energy to improve your quality of life, to make an income -- and the fact that you spend your time going out to collect wood and water -- you're trapped in a vicious cycle. It's a no-brainer. With energy, many things are possible. Without energy, very little is possible.'' 
 Specifically: without energy, people in developing countries can't study at night or sew. And without clean energy, they can't cook indoors without polluting the air. ''You don't want to be burning sticks in the house while your 8-month-old infant is sucking in the fumes,'' Mr. LaRocco said.
 Since its creation in 1994, E+Co. has sponsored 120 businesses in 35 countries. These companies now deliver energy to nearly two million people. 
 Mr. LaRocco could supply the energy needs of a small nation all by himself. A compact man with short gray hair and a close-trimmed gray beard, he is (let's get this out of the way) a dynamo. He speaks knowledgeably and enthusiastically about subjects as diverse as carbon dioxide offsets, the Civil War and wood stoves, and admits that he enjoys teaching children to spray Reddi-wip into their mouths. A gap between his front teeth shows when he laughs, which he does often.
 And his work makes a difference to people in poverty. Dana Younger, a renewable-energy adviser at the World Bank, described an E+Co. business in Honduras that sells solar photovoltaic panels to the rural poor: ''The systems provide relatively small amounts of electricity, four to six hours a day, generally enough to power a radio or a black-and-white television or a fan. A tailor can run a small sewing machine, or have enough lighting to work at night, and to displace a kerosene lantern or candles. This product has had a very direct impact on the lives of a large number of people.''
 Those who have financed E+Co. include the MacArthur Foundation, Nike, the Body Shop, Ted Turner's United Nations Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development. In the future, Mr. LaRocco wants to shift from grant money toward loans from private investors. 
 How does he answer investors who ask why they should accept a lower rate of return than they could get elsewhere? ''If you have a choice between investing at 10 percent in a company that causes cancer and 9 percent in a company that cures cancer, which would you choose?''
 Colleagues say he always says exactly what he thinks. ''There were some meetings on clean energy in New York, following the Rio Earth Summit,'' said Mr. Younger, referring to the 1992 summit. ''These U.N. meetings are often couched in obscure, bureaucratic language, and Phil just punctured all that with some very telling examples. He made people sit up and notice that, if anything, these problems are getting bigger, not smaller, and the current approaches are not sufficient to solve the problem.''
 Mr. LaRocco explained why he is the way he is: ''I was a blue-collar kid in Brooklyn. My father was a U.P.S. driver. Part of that background is saying what you see.''
 Eric Usher, a clean-energy specialist with the United Nations Environmental Program, admires Mr. LaRocco's ability to bridge cultural gaps. ''He's very effective at connecting with people, from high officials at the World Bank to the Zambian Women's Union,'' Mr. Usher said. ''These are people who are very far from Brooklyn, but he's able to bring them around and motivate them. When he leaves the room, people say, 'O.K., this is on the edge of what we would normally consider, but let's give it a try.'''
 Christine Eibs Singer, who has worked closely with Mr. LaRocco for 20 years, says he has an insatiable appetite for information. ''The International Energy Association recently put out the World Energy Outlook, a 1,200-page book of statistics and forecasts,'' Ms. Singer said. ''Phil devoured it in a weekend.''
 Mr. LaRocco insists that the future of energy lies with the small entrepreneur. ''For close to 50 years, the whole development community has operated from the top down, with big organizations as the prime movers,'' he said. ''To be fair, an awful lot of homes, millions and millions of homes, have electricity from the centralized approach. But it's reached its limit. While it reaches a vast number of people, it has failed to reach an amazingly large number of people.'' 
 And large power projects -- oil or natural gas or large hydroelectric dams -- come with harsh consequences for the environment and for the people who live near them. ''Dams often require relocations,'' Mr. LaRocco said. ''And if you burn coal or wood indoors, the air becomes disgusting, causing respiratory illnesses.''
 According to Mr. Younger, traditional financiers would never lend to most of the businesses that E+Co. supports. ''Basically, the companies are viewed as very bad credit risks,'' he said. 
 Even so, with a self-described bean counter in charge, E+Co. has recouped the great majority of its loans. ''We've been very rigorous,'' Mr. LaRocco said. ''We're confident that we can offer investors returns of 3 to 5 percent. We in turn lend that to local entrepreneurs at 8 to 10 percent. The difference is so we can cover the roughly 11 percent that don't repay their loans.''
 A big question remains, though: Can E+Co.'s small-enterprise approach really supply energy to the two billion people who don't have it -- or even make a dent?
 Mr. LaRocco's short answer is that he doesn't expect E+Co. to create the necessary businesses directly. ''The hope is that governments will start doing this on their own. We're trying to create that point in the lever where suddenly everybody says, 'Yeah, this is the way to go.''' 
 Mr. LaRocco attended St. Francis College in Brooklyn at night while working as a bank teller. Before forming E+Co., he worked at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for 20 years, starting out as a parking lot auditor in Newark and ending up, 12 jobs later, as the director of world trade and economic development. When he left in 1990, lured away by ''an entrepreneurial itch,'' he had a staff of 550 and an annual budget of roughly $750 million, and was responsible for the World Trade Center. 
 ''The biggest change was going from a big office and a big staff to one, two, three people,'' he said. ''We started out with just a fax machine.''
 E+Co. has a staff of 22 worldwide: in Costa Rica, Bolivia, Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, the Netherlands -- and Bloomfield, N.J., which Mr. LaRocco calls ''the clean-energy capital of the developing world.''
 After having finished 10 marathons, he reported that his knees still work, but added, ''My hip we won't discuss.'' He lives in nearby Glen Ridge with his wife, Patricia, an accountant, and their teenage daughter. 
 The World Energy Outlook (that tome he polished off in a weekend) forecasts that $7 trillion will be spent supplying the growing energy needs of the developing world between now and 2030 -- and that 85 percent of that amount will be spent on fossil fuels. 
 ''The question isn't one of money,'' Mr. LaRocco said. ''We're going to spend it one way or another. I want to bend that $7 trillion so it's spent in a sustainable manner. If you want people to not invest in a coal plant, you have to give them a viable alternative.''

HEADLINE: Forrester's Bookkeeping Is Short on Spending Cuts

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson. 
Iver Peterson reports from New Jersey for The New York Times.

 BODY:
In 15th-century Italy, double-entry bookkeeping was invented, and that system of balancing income and expenses has provided the iron logic of money management for businesses and governments ever since. 
 Or almost ever since. 
 Lately, we have been encountering political leaders and aspirants to leadership who have found it expedient to practice a kind of single-entry political bookkeeping --where there is a lot of debate about the income side, paid for by, ugh, taxes, but an echoing silence about the expense side, which pays for many vital public services and public-payroll jobs, jobs, jobs.
 In the debate over taxes, the spending side of the ledger seems to have all but disappeared. And stranger still, the people who have made it disappear tend to be Republicans, the people who used to be known as the bookkeeping class in this country, but who have lately discovered that you can score points by cutting taxes without worrying very much about the other side of the ledger. 
 In 1993, a Republican unknown running as an underdog against an incumbent Democratic governor of New Jersey was getting little traction until, fairly late in the campaign, she made a breathtakingly simple promise: if elected, she would cut state income taxes by 10 percent for three consecutive years.
 The woman with the promise and a kiss, Christie Whitman -- helped by Jim Florio's unpopularity -- won on this pledge, and her simple promise to cut taxes now and figure out how to balance the books later became a kind of mantra for Republicans.
 John Rowland of Connecticut -- who these days is passing his time at a minimum-security facility in Pennsylvania -- actually called himself ''a Whitman Republican'' in his winning gubernatorial campaign.
 Now we have a Republican administration in Washington that has also focused on cutting the income side of the ledger without worrying too much about the expense side.
 And here at home, the front-runner for the Republican nomination for governor, Doug Forrester, has updated Mrs. Whitman career-making promise. Only he promises to cut property taxes with a state-paid offset on each municipal tax bill -- by 10 percent a year for three years.
 Mrs. Whitman was lucky and caught the dot-com wave of economic growth to pay for part of her budget cut, and the rest she borrowed. President Bush is still waiting for his wave, so he is borrowing heavily to cover his deficit. 
 The specifics in Mr. Forrester's proposed cuts become vague when it comes to achieving the offsetting savings. He will impose purchasing efficiencies, he said, and cut waste, corruption and patronage. 
 This is a shaky promise -- the state has presumably been cutting waste for decades now, and ridding it of corruption is a Sisyphean task of limited likelihood -- so Mr. Forrester would have to do some fancy bookkeeping to make the income and the outgo sides of the ledger balance, as the state Constitution requires, under his tax-cut promise.
 And as Joseph L. Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, said, ''At some point you've got to look at expenses.''
 Let's take a look at both sides of the ledger under the Forrester plan to cut taxes.
 New Jerseyans pay about $17 billion a year in local property taxes. Take $3.6 billion out for commercial and industrial property, which Mr. Forrester has not promised to cut, and, say, a hundred million in taxes on second homes that are also off the pledge, and we are left with $13.3 billion in residential property taxes.
 Even assuming that amount stays level -- and it will not -- Mr. Forrester promises to have the state pick up the tab for $1.33 billion the first years, $2.66 billion the second year, and $3.99 billion the third year and for every year thereafter for each homeowner's property tax bill. 
 And, he says, it will be done without touching the single greatest taxpayer expense, the public payroll.
 ''We are not laying off rank-and-file state workers -- absolutely not,'' said Heather Grizzle, Mr. Forrester's policy director. ''They are not the problem. We're talking about the political patronage employees that give the hard-working state employees a bad name.''
 Mr. Forrester got a terrific boost in this pledge from the Democrats last week when Devon Brown, acting Gov. Richard J. Codey's corrections commissioner, helpfully testified that he had been forced to hire 14 patronage appointees. But even if every political hack were somehow winkled out of the public payroll, Governor Forrester (let's just presume for a moment) would start each year with a huge built-in deficit, even assuming the recurring deficits that have so bedeviled the State House recently do not recur.
 Brigid Harrison, associate professor of political science at Montclair State University, says Mr. Forrester's promise is tailored to the primary, not to a general election.
 ''I think these are the promises of someone who is fighting in a Republican primary,'' Professor Harrison said. ''This appeals to conservatives within the Republican party that he needs to worry about right now.'' 
 The waste and fraud that Mr. Forrester says he will root out, and the efficiencies he, as a successful businessman, will impose, would already be there if it were that easy, Ms. Harrison said. 
 ''The reality is that you can't reduce someone's taxes 30 percent and not cut spending.''
 Not if you want to balance the books.

HEADLINE: My Fake Retirement

BYLINE: By WARREN ST. JOHN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
AN implicit promise of American-style capitalism is that after years of toil and with a little luck, sometime in your late 60's or early 70's you will be able to put on a pair of jean shorts and some Velcro sneakers, buy a condo in a Florida retirement community and spend the rest of your natural life sitting by a pool, with ready access to golf and bingo.
 But for Rodney Rothman, a former head writer for ''Late Show With David Letterman,'' 40 years was too long to wait. Burned out after years of writing jokes (well, a few years anyway) and unemployed after the situation comedy he was working on was canceled, Mr. Rothman decided to hop off the workaday hamster wheel of life in Manhattan and Los Angeles and give retirement in Florida a try -- at the age of 28. 
 Through a roommate agency he found a room in the condominium of a widow with two cats and three birds at Century Village, an 8,500-resident retirement community in Boca Raton. ''I wanted to see if the hard work I was doing was going to lead to anyplace I wanted to be,'' said Mr. Rothman, who is now 31. ''And I figured: I'm Jewish. I'm going to end up there anyway.'' 
 Few people younger than 35 undertake any activity these days without first contemplating its potential value as intellectual property, and that is especially the case for a comedy writer with an agent, a manager and a host of contacts in the TV world. 
 From an intellectual property point of view, Mr. Rothman's six-month sojourn at Century Village may go down as one of the most productive retirements in history. He has turned his account of life there into a book called ''Early Bird'' (Simon & Schuster) and a television pilot under development with NBC Universal; the book was published this week, and Mr. Rothman will find out this month whether NBC is going to pick up the TV show. 
 He is quick to acknowledge the commercial value of what he calls his ''stupid little idea,'' but he said he hung around Century Village for so long simply because retired life, he learned, was pretty chill. ''It's not like I can lie and say I don't know what you can do with ideas,'' Mr. Rothman said on Tuesday as he poked at a Greek salad at an outdoor restaurant in the Silver Lake section of Los Angeles. ''But when you work in a business like mine, people are judging you all the time. There was something very attractive to me about going to a world full of grandmothers and grandfathers who weren't going to judge me.''
 Mr. Rothman described his writing motif as cowardly gonzo.
 ''I go gonzo to, like, the safest places on earth,'' he said.
 The last time Mr. Rothman attempted his cowardly gonzo shtick, things did not go so well. In 2000 he began showing up for work at a failing Internet company that did not employ him, and no one noticed. He wrote about this 17-day adventure as a phony employee in an article in The New Yorker titled ''My Fake Job,'' but ran into trouble when it was learned that he had not received a free massage at the office, as he claimed in the article, and that his mother had worked at the company before he decided to sneak in. 
 The magazine issued an apology, and Mr. Rothman's name began to show up on lists of disgraced journalists, never mind that with a career in joke writing he had never considered himself a journalist in the first place.
 Of the fabrication Mr. Rothman said, ''It was stupid, and I regret it.''
 That episode raises the question, How much of ''Early Bird'' is true? 
 Mr. Rothman insists it is all real, though he said that certain names had been changed, and that some characters had died since his reporting, making his accounts of his time with them essentially unverifiable. Mindful of the New Yorker controversy, Mr. Rothman said he had hired an independent fact checker for the book; GQ magazine checked an excerpt from it without incident.
 Toni Gleeson, an administrator at Century Village, confirmed that Mr. Rothman had spent months there with residents. Amy Ballinger, a 95-year-old foul-mouthed comedian Mr. Rothman writes about in the book, said his portrayal of their time together was accurate. Asked if she found Mr. Rothman's book funny, Ms. Ballinger said, ''It could have been funnier.''
 Mr. Rothman suggested his book was best appreciated not as straight nonfiction but as personal essays that employ comic hyperbole in the style of David Sedaris.
 ''I'm not a journalist,'' he said. ''I think my track record shows that.''
 AS whimsical, Plimptonesque participatory journalism gags go, Mr. Rothman's brief retirement is an effective one, providing plenty of punch line opportunities for a former late-night comedy writer. 
 But the real appeal of his book is the insight the relatively young author gains into the world of America's elderly, one he knows he will someday join in earnest -- if he is lucky. It's a place where dinner is eaten at 5 p.m. (when he would normally be having a late lunch, Mr. Rothman writes); where the softball teams play with two home plates, positioned side by side, to prevent collisions between catcher and runner; and where ambulances continually ghost by, reminding residents of their mortality.
 Retirement communities, Mr. Rothman is surprised to learn, are slow-motion versions of high school, where cliques dominate the social landscape, leaving many feeling excluded and lonely. Mr. Rothman's elderly roommate, for example, who is on antidepressants to combat the misery of losing her husband two years before, is spurned by women who hang out together at the pool because they find her ''weird.'' 
 Mr. Rothman described himself as a joker from an early age. Even his birth was a kind of punch line. He was the second born of twins, but until he appeared, feet first, his parents were expecting only one child. ''No one knew I was coming,'' he said. ''I was late and I came out the wrong way. That's followed me through life.'' 
 Mr. Rothman grew up in Queens, then Scarsdale, and began pursuing a career in comedy as a teenager. At 16, he said, inspired by an arrest of Todd Bridges, a star of ''Diff'rent Strokes,'' he came up with a joke he thought was so funny that it deserved a national audience. (''Todd Bridges was arrested today,'' the joke went. ''Gary Coleman's reaction to the news was, 'Whatchoo talkin' 'bout?''') 
 Such was his faith in the line that the young Mr. Rothman and his friends took a train to Manhattan and hung out in the lobby of Rockefeller Center, hoping to find someone who would put the joke on the Weekend Update segment of ''Saturday Night Live.'' Instead, he said, a security guard told them to get lost. 
 MR. ROTHMAN went to Middlebury College in Vermont, where, he said, a dearth of funny people ''helped me to develop a false sense of confidence that has carried me far.''
 In college Mr. Rothman got his chance to submit jokes to ''Saturday Night Live.'' Through a friend of a friend, he learned that Norm Macdonald, then the host of Weekend Update, would pay $50 for jokes faxed in by freelance writers if he used them on the air. After many failed attempts, Mr. Rothman was at a fraternity party when he watched Mr. Macdonald close his segment with a joke Mr. Rothman had written about Jodie Foster, then starring in ''Nell,'' and Tom Hanks, who that year (1994) starred in ''Forrest Gump.'' The actors, the joke went, had both received Oscar nominations in the category of Best Retard. 
 ''Everything went into slow motion,'' Mr. Rothman said, recalling the moment. ''I remember jumping in the air and making a noise I could never recreate.''
 Right after college he got a 13-week contract as a junior writer at ''Late Show With David Letterman.'' 
 ''It's awfully hard to be funny when you know that every bad joke you write can get you fired,'' he said.
 Nevertheless he managed to hang on to his job. He wrote jokes for Viewer Mail, and for a while he wrote remote segments, filmed bits in which Mr. Letterman knocks on doors in the suburbs or harasses customers at the drive-through of a Taco Bell. Improbably, at 24, he was promoted to head writer.
 That job lasted two stressful years, Mr. Rothman said. Then he struck out on his own. He wrote the ''My Fake Job'' article for The New Yorker, tried his hand at sitcom writing, working with the director Richard Linklater on a pilot and with Judd Apatow, an executive producer of ''Freaks and Geeks,'' on the Fox show ''Undeclared.'' When that show was canceled, he said, ''that was kind of like the end.'' 
 ''I was floundering,'' he said.
 For a book of essays he had sold to Simon & Schuster, Mr. Rothman decided to write about buying a retirement condo in Florida. He headed south to stay with his grandparents at a retirement community in Delray Beach, and there, Mr. Rothman said, he had an epiphany. His grandmother was making him a sandwich, he said, and the TV was on in the background. 
 ''I felt safe,'' he said.
 When he did not land a television writing job in Los Angeles, he said, he decided to head for the safety of the retired life. 
 For six months his life began to resemble a long version of one of those remote segments he had once written for ''Late Show.'' He hung out at the pool with retired women, played golf, softball and bingo, and even summoned the help of a New York advertising executive to help gin up interest in a shuffleboard tournament. (To promote shuffleboard, the executive tells him, he needs to ''take tennis out at the knees.'') 
 Mr. Rothman turned those experiences into set pieces for his book, which became exclusively about his time among the retired, and they figure into his television pilot, which stars Timm Sharp as a young man who goes to Florida to sell his dead grandfather's retirement condominium, and decides instead to move in.
 Mr. Rothman said he had hoped to find wisdom at Century Village, perhaps through an elder sage, as happens in the best seller ''Tuesdays With Morrie,'' by Mitch Albom. It did not quite work out that way.
 ''I wanted to find a Morrie, first of all because I could've used the advice, and second because, if you find Morrie, your book is going to sell five million copies,'' Mr. Rothman said. ''I realized the guy who wrote that book only spent one day a week with Morrie. If he'd spent more time with Morrie he'd realize that by Wednesday Morrie would've run out of things to say, and by Friday you'd want to strangle the guy.''

HEADLINE: That Russian Bargain Basement May Be Overrun

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
INVESTORS in Russia have generally done quite well this year, despite a broad sell-off in many emerging markets elsewhere around the world. 
 But those investors shouldn't celebrate yet. A major reason that Russian stocks and bonds have performed so well lately is that they did so badly last year, when rising interest rates and fears of Kremlin intervention in the economy prompted many international investors to sell their holdings. Now, Russia looks relatively cheap, and some foreigners have stepped back in from the sidelines. Local players have helped drive the market recovery, too. 
 Still, many equity investors, including Arjun Divecha, manager of the GMO Emerging Markets fund from Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo, remain decidedly cautious about Russia. Mr. Divecha says he has concerns about the country, ''not because of the political climate,'' but because of stock valuations, macroeconomic problems and stock and earnings momentum. 
 Stock valuations have been buoyed by Russia's oil riches, he said, but ''won't be so anymore if oil prices go down.'' And while the economy has boomed since Vladimir V. Putin became president in 2000, growing 7.1 percent in 2004 alone, Mr. Divecha said that such growth rates would not be likely to last very long in any country. ''Expectations are built in, as they are in Russia, that the economy will grow at least 7 percent a year,'' he warned. ''They are likely to disappoint.''
 Perhaps most ominously, momentum in stock prices has been undercut by the Kremlin-supported campaign against Yukos, the oil company, and its founder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. The government seized and then sold Yukos's largest oil field late last year, rocking investor confidence and calling into question the solidity of property rights. Mr. Khodorkovsky has been jailed since October 2003, facing accusations of tax evasion, fraud and embezzlement. A verdict in his criminal case is due on May 16.
 Despite those problems, Russia has been relatively immune from the declines that have hit other emerging markets. Spurred by interest-rate increases in the United States and a sell-off in the American bond market, global investors dumped what they saw as riskier assets -- and many emerging markets were hit hard. 
 But because the Russian stock market has already had a sell-off, its current market valuations are relatively attractive, some investors say. After hitting a record high of more than 780 in April 2004, Russia's benchmark RTS index slid more than 22 percent and ended the year barely higher, up 0.3 percent, at 605.66. This year, Russia has been playing catch-up. The RTS is up 9.2 percent, versus a gain of 1.1 percent for the MSCI Emerging Markets index. 
 Russia's equity market remains ''extremely cheap on a cash-flow basis,'' noted James Fenkner, principal at Red Star Asset Management, a hedge fund investing in Russia. 
 Christopher Weafer, chief strategist at Alfa Bank, concurred with that view, saying: ''Earnings are starting to turn, but the reason Russia is cheap is risk. Shifting politics can easily change economic dynamics.''
 Investors now make more distinctions among emerging markets, said Rudolph Riad-Younes, who runs the Julius Baer International Equity fund. ''More people are willing to accept many emerging markets are different than they were 10 or 20 years ago -- especially with valuations very stretched in the developed world.''
 Russia's macroeconomic position has improved markedly since its debt default in 1998. Amid high oil prices, the federal budget has a net surplus of 687 billion rubles -- almost $24.7 billion -- equivalent to more than 4 percent of gross domestic product. As of April 22, Russia's foreign-exchange reserves were $141.3 billion. The world's second-largest oil producer, after Saudi Arabia, Russia may repay its estimated $100 billion in foreign debt by 2007, Andrei N. Illarionov, an aide to Mr. Putin, said last month.
 That has created a golden backdrop for careful fixed-income investors, said Mohamed El-Erian, a former director of the International Monetary Fund and a portfolio manager overseeing international emerging-market debt at Pimco.
 Mr. El-Erian invests in Russian sovereign debt like the 30-year bond but avoids corporate bonds in the country. ''There are two Russias when you look at the bond market,'' he said. ''Sovereigns have done well, and will continue to do well,'' returning 10 percent, on average, in the last 12 months. ''That's pretty good,'' he added, ''given that almost everything else has sold off.'' 
 Mr. El-Erian said he did not hold any Russian corporate bonds. ''The rule of law is not applied uniformly, and large companies are often built up around an 'oligarch,' or other business personality,'' he said. 
 Minority shareholders' rights are fragile, he said. ''The minute you go from sovereign to corporate,'' he explained, ''you assume a lot more risk which is not priced in.'' 
 The Yukos affair has seriously strained ties between Russia's business elite and the Kremlin, which has portrayed Yukos as a corporate tax cheat. Once Russia's largest private oil company, Yukos is now half its former size and pumps about 600,000 barrels a day, its largest field having been renationalized. It is still paying off a $28 billion back tax bill levied by the government, which has reserved the right to use such tactics against other companies. 
 ''Many other companies have also apparently experienced increased harassment, often from the tax administration under the guise of exposing and collecting unpaid taxes from previous years,'' the World Bank said in a report written in March and released in April. 
 The government recently levied an unexpected claim for $1 billion in back taxes against BP's joint venture in Russia, TNK-BP.
 ''No one wants a repeat of the Yukos case,'' Igor I. Shuvalov, an aide to Mr. Putin, told an American Chamber of Commerce conference here in March. ''We are aware that it tarnishes the country's image. But the same measures will be applied to all taxpayers in the future.'' 
 Mr. Putin has tried to smooth worries that the state will intervene at will in the economy -- promising a three-year statute of limitations on investigations of controversial 1990's privatizations. Foreign direct investment is improving, although it is still low. It shot up to a record $9.4 billion in 2004 from $6.8 billion in 2003 -- but that is just two-thirds the foreign direct investment in the Czech Republic.
 One possible stimulus for the markets involves Gazprom, the natural gas company. United States investors cannot hold its local shares directly; they have been limited to more expensive American depository receipts. But German Gref, the economic development and trade minister, has said the scrapping of limits on foreigners owning Gazprom shares ''will happen this year.'' 
 Gazprom's tiny weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets index could rise significantly once that limit has ended. That poses a quandary for investors like Julie Pfeffer, portfolio manager at DuPont Capital Management. She said the potential for Gazprom to become a major component in the index would probably require her to buy Gazprom -- albeit reluctantly. 
 ''I've always been very unhappy with management there, and if you look at the money they're making -- and wasting -- on expenses and capital expense write-offs, I can't in good conscience buy it,'' she said. ''I've been happy up until now that it's been a minor component of the index. If it gets a good weight I'll have to buy some, and I don't want any.''

HEADLINE: Meena Seshamani, Craig Mullaney

 BODY:
Dr. Meena Seshamani and Capt. Craig Michael Mullaney were married yesterday at the Madison Hotel in Morristown, N.J. The Rev. S. Matthew Glover, a Roman Catholic priest, officiated. A Hindu Vedic ceremony was performed on Friday at Birchwood Manor in Whippany, N.J., by Sri Ramanath Gananaskandan. 
 The bride, 27, will keep her name. She is completing her medical degree at the University of Pennsylvania. She is to begin a residency in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center in Baltimore in July. She graduated magna cum laude from Brown and received a doctorate in health economics from Oxford under a Marshall scholarship. She is a daughter of Dr. Rama Seshamani and Mani Seshamani of Warren, N.J. The bride's father works in Tarrytown, N.Y., as a vice president in the environmental group of Hitachi America. Her mother is an executive director of drug regulatory affairs at Novartis Pharmaceuticals in East Hanover, N.J. 
 The bridegroom, 26, is an Army assistant operations officer with the Old Guard, the ceremonial escort to the president, based at Fort Myer in Arlington, Va. He served as an infantry rifle platoon leader in Afghanistan in 2003 and 2004. Captain Mullaney graduated from the Military Academy at West Point and received a master's degree in economic and social history at Oxford, where he was a Rhodes scholar. He is a son of Ellen Mullaney of West Warwick, R.I. His mother is a registered nurse at Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, R.I. 
 Dr. Seshamani and Captain Mullaney first met at Lincoln College at Oxford in October 2000. She was in the second year of her doctoral program, and he had just arrived.
 ''Craig was looking up and down the hallway and seemed a bit lost,'' she said. She asked if he needed help. He ended up joining her and her friends for lunch.
 As they talked, she recalled, she was impressed with his ''sincerity and ambition.'' He remembered her ''honesty and warmth.''
 Whenever they saw each other on campus over the next weeks, they continued talking. 
 ''I realized that we had this uncanny and rare ability to discuss important issues that form the core of our identities,'' she said, including religion, independence and traditions. 
 In February 2001, after returning from Christmas break, he invited her to join him on a trip to Paris with a busload of other graduate students. It was the first salvo of what he called his ''wooing offensive.'' 
 After that weekend he became more explicit about his feelings for her. That led, he said, to ''some sort of interview.''
 ''It was harder than my interview for the Rhodes scholarship,'' Captain Mullaney said. In addition to questions about families, it covered the role of war in foreign policy and the cultural gap between the military and civilians.
 Dr. Seshamani later explained that she needed to know more. She had ''grown up in suburban New Jersey in a fairly conservative environment that did not condone parties or dating,'' she said. ''I couldn't make the same assumptions about his viewpoints as I could from people who had the kinds of jobs and backgrounds I am more familiar with.''
 But he survived the grilling, and they began dating and immersing themselves in each other's cultures. 
 ''She read many of my books about the military and West Point, which undercut the stereotypes she had about soldiers,'' Captain Mullaney said. ''I was insatiably curious about her Indian culture. I learned to speak basic Hindi and cook Indian food and enrolled in an Indian history course. I took my sister on a three-week trip there.''
 Dr. Seshamani had given little thought to marriage before dating Captain Mullaney, she said, believing it would constrain her professionally. When she did, she said, she assumed her husband ''would be an Indian professional, not an Irish Catholic infantry officer.'' But he gave her a new perspective. 
 She said, ''We found our ability to support and challenge each other only grew with time.''

HEADLINE: The Economic Unit Called Supermom

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
IF you want to know how much the average food worker in the nation earns -- $8.31 an hour -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics has the answer. A hedge fund manager's salary can be inferred by the Jaguar in his driveway. But how to calculate the value on the 10 hours clocked last week at an elementary school book fair by the mom in the fetching cardigan?
 Every successful school in America has at least one: that mother who appears, Zelig-like, at every imaginable school event; running registration at grandparents' day; doling out peanut butter sandwiches during the class trip; manning the ring toss at the spring fair. 
 She combed your daughter's hair on picture day last fall, and steered her away from a Junie B. Jones book as she stacked the school library shelves, and you never even knew it. And she baked a lasagna for the neighbor whose husband is in the hospital and spent a few hours carpooling to soccer games in between.
 It stands to reason that a culture that places high social value on earned income would try to place a market value on mother's work, especially those tasks that contribute to some bottom line: think of the school auction, which nets well over $100,000 in many upscale communities.
 Yet neither domestic nor volunteer work figure into the gross domestic product (plenty of women's organizations think it should), and economists can't even agree on how best to calculate what it is worth. 
 So how to value mom's benevolence and hard work? With a flat wage? By the market value of the product she produced? (An excellent idea for the mom who adds truffles to her neighbor's casserole.) How about some annual salary based on a roughly commensurate industry, like, say, social work? 
 One financial planning company, Edelman Financial Services, has in fact added up the annual salaries of workers among 17 occupations engaged in by a busy mother (pet care, housekeeping, etc.) and come up with an estimated $707,126 annual paycheck. While this calculation might gain Edelman some financial-planning business from a newly affirmed female clientele, it is not one embraced by most economists. 
 ''If you go for an hourly wage,'' said Heidi Hartmann, an economist founder and president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, ''then is the Ph.D.-educated women's casserole worth more than the mother with the high school diploma?''
 As for the product value model, she said, ''You could probably get the meal a mother brings to the neighbor pretty cheaply, so the meal is not as valuable as helping an older neighbor with her income tax, because financial planning is a more valuable service.''
 Of course, so much of mother's work is rewarded in only vaguely tangible ways: a nod of appreciation in the school newsletter, the twisted thrill of an empty dishwasher, a snuggle from a sated toddler.
 This is why many social scientists have explored the ''social capital'' gained by participating in these otherwise uncompensated activities. Social scientists argue, for example, that test scores go up in schools where parent volunteerism is highest, and that crime is reduced in communities with high civic participation.
 ''Social capital is usually defined as the networks and relationships we have, as well as the trust and sense of mutuality that arise from them,'' said Amy Caiazza, a study director working with Ms. Hartmann.
 Ms. Caiazza argued that that trust gives people ''a sense that our government works more or less on our behalf.''
 But just as art imitates life, caring sometimes can look more like capitalism. For example, within some schools there is fierce competition for the best ''jobs,'' often performed with the same tools (BlackBerries, spreadsheets and starchy e-mailed directives to subordinates) and precision that the mothers once employed in high-profile jobs. 
 A mother in a Manhattan private school describes a pecking order for volunteers, in which some mothers prove their mettle as class representatives or T-shirt sellers before graduating to highly coveted posts, like head of the school benefit committee.
 It may not be long before these mothers, who knew exactly how society assessed their contributions when they labored in the boardroom, may see their current work assigned a dollar value, too. 
 In 2003, the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducted its first-ever Time Use Survey, which examined the doings of 21,000 Americans over a 24-hour period. ''There were a number of economists who were interested in valuing nonmarket production,'' said Diane Herz, the survey's project manager. 
 Those activities were broken down into 458 activity codes, which may at some point be assigned monetary values. A group of scientists at the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that some domestic work be valued as specialization (plumbing, say), general (garden-variety housework) or opportunity cost (that is, the income that a woman in the same demographic cohort as her working-mom counterpart is missing out on). 
 What if you put that all together in Manhattan dollars, where a $500 weekly salary for a full-time baby sitter for two children is common? Add $80 every two weeks to pay for housekeeping, and, for the mother who has taken on the task of running the school benefit, $10,000, the lower end of the scale charged by Creative Event Planning, a party planning outfit in New York. Add $100 for an hourly plumbing fee (reduced somewhat under the belief that mom is not quite as skillful with the wrench as one New York company that fetches $150 an hour), and $350 that would be paid weekly to a chauffeur, and there is a pretty good living.
 Let's leave out the opportunity cost. That one is mitigated by two priceless words: Thanks, Mom.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Show Signs of Leveling

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
THE median sales price of a single family house in Westchester remained flat in the first three months of 2005, the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service reported last week. After reaching an all-time high of $686,000 in the third quarter of 2004, the median was $615,000 for the quarter that ended in March, the same as it was for the previous quarter. 
 While the quarterly median price was up from a year earlier, the rate of increase was smaller than the rises experienced throughout 2004. What that portends for the future is not clear, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the executive vice president of the Listing Service. It could represent a pause before prices begin to rise again. Or it could indicate that Westchester's seemingly unstoppable housing market has cooled off. 
 At the very least, the housing market ''may be starting to bend from its own weight,'' Mr. Mercurio speculated in the M.L.S.'s first-quarter report. ''Middle-range prices of $615,000 or higher may have begun to outrun the incomes of buyers, even after the deployment of equity in their current residence, and it may be time for prices to pause while incomes catch up.'' 
 The first-quarter median sale price of a single-family house was up by $45,000, or 8 percent, from the prior year. In 2004, the year-to-year quarterly increases ranged from 13 percent to 16 percent. Home prices tend to follow a statistical pattern throughout the year, Mr. Mercurio said, with prices highest in the second and third quarter reports. 
 For now, the deceleration means that sellers can no longer push prices on their homes and expect to sell them quickly, brokers said. ''An 8 percent increase is still healthy, but it's not 15 percent, and sellers can't be as aggressive as before,'' said Ted Holmes, the manager of Prudential Holmes & Kennedy's Armonk office.
 The sales figures compiled each quarter are based on closings; first-quarter closings tend to reflect sales agreements made late in 2004 and in early January of 2005, when the region's economy, as measured by job growth and unemployment rates, was stable and slowly expanding. In November and December, the Federal Reserve Board twice increased its discount rate by a quarter point, but those increases were not reflected in long-term mortgage rates.
 Meanwhile, during the first quarter the American economy slowed to its weakest pace in two years, the Commerce Department reported. The nation's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the United States, grew 3.1 percent, a somewhat slower pace than had been expected.
 The slowdown in the Westchester residential real estate market appears to have affected all price categories and did not signal stress in the high-end segment, as some analysts had speculated. ''To the contrary,'' the report said, ''the high-end market maintained its share of sales volume. Properties selling for $1 million or more accounted for 18 percent of first quarter sales in 2005 and 16 percent in 2004; the comparable figures for properties selling in the range of $750,000 to $999,000 were 18 percent and 16 percent respectively as well. The two-percentage-point difference represented ordinary inflationary bracket creep.''
 Prices rose more sharply in housing sectors other than single-family homes. The median price of a condominium rose by 13.3 percent in the first quarter of this year to $354,000, from $312,450 a year ago. Co-op prices were up by 16.6 percent, to $158,000 from $135,500. The strongest category of all was multifamily homes -- housing two to five families -- where the median sales price rose 24.1 percent to $540,000 from $435,000 for the first quarter of 2004.
 The increase in multifamily home prices reflected investor interest in such properties in urban areas like White Plains, Yonkers and Mount Vernon, said Chris Meyers, the chief operating officer of Houlihan/Lawrence, which has 29 offices in the county. ''With interest rates so low, investors are still able to maintain a cash flow even if rents are not as high as they once were,'' he said.
 The condo and co-op segments fared well because, in a market of ever-escalating prices, they have provided lower-cost alternatives, said George Kiaffas, an associate broker at Julia B. Fee in Scarsdale. ''They have provided first-time home buyers with an option,'' he said.
 While younger buyers tend to buy less expensive condos and co-ops, empty-nesters shedding a large home are often drawn to luxury units, said Nick Wolff, the owner of Century 21 Wolff, which has four offices in Westchester.
 Looking at the market as a whole, Mr. Meyers at Houlihan/Lawrence suggested that home sellers may not be calling the market tune as much as they had in the recent past. ''It's been such a strong sellers' market for so many years,'' Mr. Meyers said, ''but that was very difficult on buyers, who tended to chase after things. Now they're not jumping anymore.''
 Advising sellers now to price houses realistically, Mr. Meyers said: ''The idea is to draw multiple bids, and ultimately, that's what will bring the best price. If you price a property ahead of comparable houses, you may end up having to mark it down over time, and property that has markdowns creates a feeling of 'Let's wait and see,' among buyers. Sellers don't want to find themselves in that position.''
 Ellen Grollman of Prudential Holmes & Kennedy cited a colonial in Pleasantville for which she was the listing agent as an example of a property whose owners used an effective strategy. The five-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath house on almost an acre of land went on the market on Feb. 28 for $1.245 million, which was regarded as a not overly aggressive price. The owners received multiple bids and went to contract seven days later for more than the asking price. 
 In all, there were 1,998 closings in Westchester in the first quarter, 1 percent more than for the corresponding period in 2004. Dollar volume for all categories of sales was up 15.6 percent, to $1.173 billion.
 The inventory of homes on the market on March 31, 4,765, was 19 percent more than a year earlier and the highest since the end of the first quarter of 1999. But, the M.L.S. report said, the number was low compared with the levels of 8,000 to 10,000 units in the early to mid-1990's and was ''far below the quantities needed to relieve the demand-supply imbalance in our region.''
 Only time will show whether the single-digit increase in the median sales price of a single-family home for the first quarter represented a short-term slowdown or a longer-term market slowing. Mr. Kiaffas at Julia B. Fee believes it is the former. ''We're already seeing things pick up again,'' he said. ''The figures from the Multiple Listing Service reflect just a temporary pause. You'll see that in the next report.''
 Mr. Mercurio agreed that the 8 percent first quarter price increase may be just a statistical aberration. But he said, ''no matter how the market develops, it should be recalled that ordinary single-digit percentage price increases were not very long ago considered normal and healthy in this area.''

HEADLINE: 9/11 and the News Cycle

 BODY:

Five news events last week were reminders of the long shadow cast by the World Trade Center attacks.

GROUND ZERO

Back to the Drawing Board -- New York political leaders and the lead developer of the Freedom Tower, the main building to be built on the former World Trade Center site, said on Wednesday that the tower would be redesigned, in part to address concerns raised by the New York police about the building's security.

Behind the News -- The weak market for office space in lower Manhattan may be as big a threat to the project as security concerns. It hasn't helped that Goldman Sachs & Company recently stepped back from plans to build a $2 billion headquarters across the street, or that so far the only tenant in the rebuilt 7 World Trade Center is the developer. Still, officials say, whatever the redesigned Freedom Tower winds up looking like, it will definitely still be 1,776 feet tall.

SECURITY

Driver's Licenses -- Congressional aides said on Monday that the House and Senate were moving to impose stricter new national rules for issuing and renewing driver's licenses. States would have to verify that the applicant is in the country legally.

Behind the News -- A host of issues converge on one prosaic bit of bureaucracy, the driver's license. Any hint of a national identification card is anathema to civil libertarians, so homeland-security hawks turn to state-issued driver's licenses as a more palatable proxy. But critics of the ID card say they see a serious side effect (and perhaps an ulterior motive): freezing many immigrants, legal and illegal, out of the economy.

AL QAEDA

A Big Arrest -- Pakistani officials said on Wednesday that they had captured a Libyan man, Abu Faraj al-Libbi, who American and Pakistani officials said was the third-most-senior leader in Al Qaeda's terrorist network.

Behind the News -- The assertions about his rank in Al Qaeda raised some skepticism, since he was not on the F.B.I.'s most wanted list, unlike a man with a fairly similar name who is said to have helped bomb two American embassies in East Africa in 1998. But Pakistan, which is often criticized for failing to catch many Qaeda figures thought to be hiding there, had ample motive to pursue Mr. Libbi: he is suspected of directing two failed attempts to assassinate the country's president.

IRAQ

Bomb in Kurdish -- Region A suicide bomber blew himself up Wednesday at a police recruiting center in Erbil, killing at least 60 people and wounding at least 150 others, many of them prospective policemen. Ansar al-Sunna, a well-known terrorist group, claimed responsibility.

Behind the News -- The Shiite Arab and Kurdish blocs in Iraq have little in common except that for decades Saddam Hussein and his Sunni-Arab-dominated regime oppressed them both. But the Sunni boycott of the January elections left the Shiites and Kurds to share power in the new government that took office last month, so they are both now targets of mounting violence aimed at destabilizing the new government.

NEW YORK

Bombs in a Planter -- Two small bombs, apparently inexpertly made out of dummy grenades, black powder and matchlit fuses, went off early Thursday in a concrete planter on the sidewalk in front of an office building on Third Avenue in Manhattan.

Behind the News -- With no one injured and hardly any damage done, the event would once have barely merited a mention in the news. But that was before 9/11. Today, almost any explosion -- especially in New York, and even more especially outside the British Consulate on the day of Britain's general election -- takes on a more sinister cast and can rattle nerves and make headlines around the world.

HEADLINE: It's Not War, but It Can Be Hellish

BYLINE: By PETER EDIDIN

 BODY:
THE United States Army has increasingly been involved in missions, like peacekeeping, requiring it to police civilian societies. But controlling protesters or quelling a riot in a nation with which America is at peace requires different skills and (usually nonlethal) responses than war fighting. 
 To teach these skills, the Army recently created a Civil Disturbances Operations manual (www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-19-15.pdf), 256 pages long, covering everything from the roots of unrest, to crowd sociology, to the chemicals for dispersing rioters. Excerpts follow. PETER EDIDIN

General Causes for Civil Unrest -- In these modern times, demonstrations, civil unrest, public disorder and riots happen for a number of reasons. Some of these reasons are economic hardships, social injustices, ethnic differences (leading to oppression), objections to world organizations or certain governments, political grievances and terrorist acts.

Crowd Development -- Crowds are a gathering of a multitude of individuals and small groups that have temporarily assembled in the same place.

Gatherings -- The assembly process of a gathering refers to the movement of people from different locations to a common location within a given period. Gatherings are often assisted by yelling catchy slogans and cheers that everyone can easily pick up and join in on.

Impromptu Gatherings -- Impromptu gatherings usually develop informally and are mostly done by word of mouth. An example of an impromptu gathering would be a gathering at a secured food distribution point after receiving information that a large truck carrying much-needed supplies and food is about to arrive.

Organized Gatherings -- Recent examples of these well-organized groups are anarchists, antiglobalization groups and anti-free-enterprise groups. Groups representing extreme religious faiths and ethnic organizations have been common, too.

Crowd Building -- Crowds are not made of isolated individuals but of a minority of individuals and a majority of small groups.
 Groups and individuals in the crowd are not unanimous in their motivation.

Crowd Dispersal -- The routine dispersal may be specified in advance. It can also be included in the assembly instructions given by the organizers of an event.
 An emergency dispersal occurs when people evacuate an area in result of an unexpected crisis, such as a fire, explosion, bomb threat or terrorist act. 
 Coercion dispersal is caused by the use of force at some level. This is not necessarily the best way to force the dispersal of a crowd.

Crowd Dynamics -- Crowds provide individuals with a sense of anonymity ... giving a sense of invulnerability.
 Crowds provide individuals with the idea that their moral responsibilities have shifted from themselves ... to the crowd as a whole. 
 Emotional contagion is the most dramatic psychological factor of crowd dynamics. It provides the crowd with a temporary bond of psychological unity.

Crowd Types -- Casual crowds are identified as individuals or small groups with nothing in common to bind them together.
 Sighting crowds are similar to casual crowds with one additional element -- an event. People migrate as a crowd to sporting events, are attracted to fires and accidents and attend music concerts. 
 Agitated crowds are Individuals with strong emotional feelings within a crowd can quickly spread ..., causing changes in the overall demeanor of the crowd.

Riots -- Riots vary ... in both targets and players. A communal riot, for instance, deals with deep-seated ethnic, religious and language differences. Commodity riots involve an attack on property by acts of vandalism, looting and arson. The Democratic Convention in Chicago in 1968 reflects a riot that directly targeted police and authority in general. Celebration riots occur across the U.S. as a result of home team victories in sporting events, among other reasons.
 What is the overarching identity of the crowd? It may be possible to determine identities and goals from advance assembling instructions, leaflets distributed to bystanders, placards and banners, and chants and songs. 
 What are their traditional behaviors? What people do during protests is not universal. Social protest organizations and striking unions will carry placards and banners. Other groups will protest in a more quiet way, like the 5,000 women in Sarajevo whose standard Sunday behavior was to sit and block traffic. They were protesting the loss of male relatives in the Bosnian war. 
 What are the possible targets of violence? Riots, in particular, may focus on target facilities. In the 1992 Los Angeles riots, gun stores were major targets. In Somalia, throngs of people stormed food supply facilities. In Haiti, riots broke out over trash dumps where U.S. forces had discarded the remnants of meals.

HEADLINE: Amagansett Beach to Test Solar-Powered Garbage Can

BYLINE: By Peter C. Beller

 BODY:
A solar-powered garbage can that automatically compacts trash will be tested this summer at an Amagansett beach where conventional cans often overflow with trash from the large crowds.
 The BigBelly, which is made of galvanized steel, will be installed at Atlantic Avenue beach in June. 
The machine automatically senses when its 42-gallon receptacle is full and an electric motor, powered by solar panels, compacts the trash to as much as a 10th of its original volume, reducing the need for pickups.
 An indicator on the BigBelly's exterior turns red when the can must be emptied, and it can be equipped to send a message by cellphone or wireless Internet when full.
 Debra Foster, an East Hampton Town Board member who pushed the pilot program, said the machine would reduce the number of trips town employees make to collect trash, saving labor and gasoline. She said she thought the $4,875 machine would pay for itself in a year.
 ''It's environmentally sound and economically sound,'' she said. 
 New York City tested one of the devices in Manhattan in February and March, and 50 of the machines will be installed in Queens this summer, said Richard Kennelly, a vice president at the Seahorse Power Company of Westborough, Mass., which manufactures the BigBelly. Peter C. Beller

HEADLINE: Monitoring A Double Dose Of Reports

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
REMEMBER that week in April, when the report of a larger-than-expected trade deficit in February was followed by news of much-weaker-than-expected retail sales in March?
 Those two pieces of data turned investors' focus from fear of inflation to fear of slowing economic growth -- and sent stocks tumbling. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 4.6 percent in six trading days, to close just 12 points above 10,000. 
 Well, the March trade deficit and April retail sales will be reported this week. The trade deficit number, due Wednesday, is expected to grow to a record $61.7 billion, according to forecasts gathered by Bloomberg News, from $61 billion in February. Retail sales, due Thursday, are expected to climb 0.7 percent, after the disappointing 0.3 percent increase in March.
 David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International, says he thinks that retail sales will show a 1 percent climb because of a strong recovery in auto sales in April. Unfortunately for General Motors and Ford Motor -- whose bond ratings dropped to junk status last week -- all of that rebound was in sales by their competitors.
 The bounce in auto sales means that Mr. Resler is less concerned about a slowdown in consumer spending becoming a dangerous drag on economic growth. 
 But he is worried about the recent weakness in capital spending by businesses, another main driver of the economy. He said that as the first quarter ended, capital spending was slowing, falling below its average for the quarter. So capital spending needs to have a nice jump in the second quarter just to avoid being a drag on growth. 
 If the capital-spending soft patch does not disappear soon, he said, he will lower his growth estimates for this year and next.
 As of now, he is forecasting that the soft patch will be over by summer. He predicts 3.5 percent growth in the third quarter and 3.7 percent growth in the fourth, after a sluggish 2.7 percent this quarter. 
 The strong jobs report for April, reported on Friday, makes him significantly more confident about his outlook, he said.

DATA WATCH -- The University of Michigan report on consumer confidence is due on Friday the 13th.
 This preliminary reading for May is expected to show a confidence level of 88, up slightly from 87.7 in April.

HEADLINE: High-End Hospitality at Bargain Prices

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
THE hotel was a jewel box, the room a gem. Impeccable Art Deco furniture, gleaming chrome lamps, flat-screen television, a marble bathroom tiled in glittering turquoise and copper -- at the Hotel Lord Byron in Rome or the Hotel de Sers in Paris, such accouterments would easily justify rates of more than $450 a night. Yet this was an executive double at the Hotel Rialto in Warsaw, for just $120, at $1.32 to the euro. It is just one of the properties that now offer the height of chic at distinctively low prices. 
 The demand for these options is growing as young consumers who crave design-oriented hotels at a less-than-exclusive price take a bigger share of the hospitality market. The dollar's fall in value has added to the trend as Americans traveling abroad search for cheaper alternatives to the Park Hyatt Tokyo or the Metropolitan in London. 
 At the Rialto, which merges authentic 1930's decor with high technology like keys that guests simply wave in front of their doors, the state of the local economy is the reason the price is low. Providing a high level of service and amenities simply costs less in Warsaw than in New York, London or Paris. 
 The same goes for other cities that have sprouted bumper crops of inexpensive, trendy hotels. Even though the Canadian dollar is at its strongest level in a decade, the Hotel Nelligan, Hotel le St.-Paul, Hotel Gault and Hotel Place d'Armes in Montreal still offer immaculately designed rooms for under $200 a night. In Glasgow, design-savvy rooms can be had for similarly low prices -- as little as $107, at $1.95 to the pound, at the Brunswick downtown -- even though the dollar has lost about a quarter of its value against the pound during the past five years.
 ''They're quite hip, they want the trendy hotels,'' said Cathy Owen, sales and marketing manager at Langs Hotel in Glasgow, of visitors to the city. ''But it's quite a young group of people who come to Glasgow, so they're not like the businessmen who can afford the hotels in London.''
 When Langs opened in 2000, Ms. Owen said, the aim was to keep prices low through high volume. ''Boutique at that time was kind of characterized by being kind of dark and luxurious,'' she said. ''We wanted style, and we wanted design, but we have 100 bedrooms, so we could take the room rate down.''
 Because Glasgow may not be at the top of tourists' lists of places to visit, she added, the hotel itself had to become the destination. ''A lot of people come not just to come to Glasgow, but to Langs, because we offer a lot of packages,'' including romantic weekends and pajama parties, she said. Other Glasgow hotels, like the ArtHouse, have become as popular for their bars and restaurants as for their rooms.
 Even in the priciest cities, however, cheap chic options are beginning to proliferate. One way such hotels have kept rates down is by locating outside the center of town, like the K West in London and Claska in Tokyo.
 Claska's location, in the outlying Meguro area, a couple of miles southwest of central Tokyo, does make it harder to attract high-end customers, wrote H. Patrick Okada, the general manager, in an e-mailed response to questions. ''But there are many people related to the fashion industry that live in or close to the Meguro area,'' he added. ''In that sense, Meguro was a good location to capture that market, not only for accommodation-seeking guests but also for those wishing to enjoy other services,'' like the hotel's restaurant, bookstore and dog-grooming salon.
 Claska also attracts budget-conscious consumers by offering rooms of many different sizes for different rates. Its smallest room, at 183 square feet, goes for $101, at 104 yen to the dollar, while the biggest costs eight times as much. The Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm has used the same idea, with rooms ranked from ''small,'' for $185 and up, at 6.92 Swedish kronor to the dollar, to ''XX-Large,'' for $1,086.
 This strategy will soon be taken to the extreme by two ventures in Britain, where room size will finish a very, very distant second to location. One of them, easyHotel, part of the entrepreneurial empire of Stelios Haji-Ioannou, plans to rent rooms for as little as $9.75 a night at its first location, in the South Kensington neighborhood of London. 
 The hotel, which is scheduled to open in July, had many inspirations, said James Rothnie, director of corporate affairs for easyGroup. One was the Japanese capsule-hotel, an institution a little like a morgue for the living, often found at train stations and frequented by businessmen who have worked too late at the office.
 ''To begin with, yes, we were inspired by capsule hotels,'' Mr. Rothnie said. ''But then we reckoned a Western clientele would want to be able to stand up in their own room, and have en suite facilities.''
 Many basic functions, including check-in and checkout, will be automated, as at the Formule 1 chain of roadside hostels, which is based in France. Surfaces in rooms will be smooth and rounded to make cleaning easier. A staff member may serve as ''the manager, the receptionist and the chambermaid all in one,'' Mr. Rothnie said.
 EasyHotel also plans to use demand-based pricing, a hallmark of many of Mr. Haji-Ioannou's companies, to reduce vacancies. The fewer people want to stay at a given time, the lower the price will be. ''Real estate costs in city centers are very high,'' Mr. Rothnie explained. ''If we can get more rooms in the same square footage, and we can maximize occupancy through pricing, then we can generate more revenue than another, similar square-footage hotel.''
 Mr. Haji-Ioannou's brands, like easyJet and easyInternetcafe, have tended to attract a young clientele. But Mr. Rothnie said easyHotel was intended for anyone willing to trade space for price. Yotel, a potential competitor soon to be launched by Simon Woodroffe, another serial entrepreneur, is explicitly aiming at the cheap-chic crowd.
 ''It's affordable luxury,'' said Gerard Greene, chief executive of Yotel. ''We're trying to offer people who might stay at a three-or four-star hotel a well-designed product at a much lower price. We're also competing with inexpensive hotels by trying to offer a much sexier product.''
 To offer a deluxe experience in a small space, Yotel has employed designers who worked on British Airways' first-class capsules and the new, double-decker Airbus A380. Rooms will offer a flat-screen television, wireless broadband, a monsoon shower, leather trim around beds and luxury sheets, towels and toiletries. Windows will look out onto the hotel's interior.
 All this will come in a package ranging from 65 to 110 square feet in size, although each floor will also have a concierge area and bar, Mr. Greene said. ''It enables us to get into locations that other people can't, and to get into tight city centers and airport terminals,'' he said. ''We want to be in the thick of it.'' Yotel plans three locations in London for early 2006, with rooms priced at about $156 for a full night or $78 for four hours.
 The combination of affordable luxury, interesting design and a central location may be a winning formula. Travelers are showing ''more of an interest in luxury products than ever before,'' said Cathy A. Pelaez, chief operating officer of Liberty Travel, an agency with over 200 locations in the Eastern United States ''But of course they want luxury at the right price,'' she said of her company's clients. 
 The thing they would pay extra for, she continued, was location, ''because when you have location, you can save yourself money with transportation.'' The final ingredient was design. ''People like a little more customization in the hotels that they stay at, and some uniqueness.''
 Big-name hoteliers like Andre Balazs are beginning to get into the act. Rooms at his new hotel, QT, just off Times Square start at $125 for single-occupancy booked well in advance. Established hotel chains have also entered the arena, most recently with the opening of the first of InterContinental Hotel Group's Indigo properties, in Atlanta. The goal of the Indigo brand is to offer a hip, frequently changing design at prices often under $100. 
 The backing of an enormous corporation is something many cheap chic hotels have to do without, though. Claska's funky design was lucky to attract attention in the press, which Mr. Okada credited for raising the proportion of foreign visitors from 10 percent last year to 16 percent so far this year. Ms. Owen said Langs depends on its Web site, travel agents and travelers themselves to do its advertising. ''Because we're an independent hotel, to get a presence overseas would be far too expensive for us,'' she said. ''So we rely a lot on word of mouth or recommendation of people in the city who are aware of us.''
 Current trends augur in favor of Langs and properties like it. For the foreseeable future, at least, it will only become easier for travelers to find the cheap chic hotel of their dreams.

HEADLINE: Peru's Catholics Brace for Fissures in Their Church

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru 

 BODY:
This is the country where a radical, left-leaning ''theology of liberation'' first emerged 35 years ago. But it is also the place where, four years ago, a member of the Roman Catholic Church's profoundly conservative Opus Dei movement was for the first time elevated to cardinal.
 Now, with the ascension of Pope Benedict XVI, the longstanding divide between conservatives, emboldened by the choice of a kindred spirit, and liberal clergy here and throughout Latin America could intensify. If Peru's recent past is any measure, such a competition, even if the two sides are not evenly matched, is certain to be fierce.
 Today, the priest who coined the term ''liberation theology,'' the Rev. Gustavo Gutierrez, spends much of his time teaching in the United States, in what some of his admirers describe as a kind of exile. The bishop who was elevated to cardinal, Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne, now archbishop of Lima, has accused fellow bishops of a smear campaign of forged letters to undermine him. 
 How the tensions between those camps play out could affect not only issues of theology, but also how the church addresses related matters like the centralization of authority, the role of lay people, the decline in priestly vocations and the mounting challenge of evangelical Protestant groups in a region where nearly half the world's 1.1 billion Catholics live.
 ''The church is struggling to find ways to broaden its space and make itself present beyond the Mass, beyond ceremony and ritual,'' said Catalina Romero, a political scientist specializing in religion who teaches at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. ''Everyone agrees that space needs to be occupied. What they cannot agree on is how it should be done.''
 With the new pope, the upper hand rests with conservative forces like Opus Dei, or Work of God, which preaches strict obedience to established church doctrine among its nearly 100,000 clergy and lay members worldwide. Not all theological conservatives belong to Opus Dei, of course, and liberation theology is only one of the doctrines it criticizes.
 Opponents say Opus Dei's close ties with governing elites and the military in Peru and elsewhere have left the church hierarchy on the wrong side of issues of poverty and human rights, and vulnerable to the Protestant sects that have made deep inroads throughout the region.
 The divisions are so fierce that Cardinal Cipriani, 61, has accused his rivals of forging letters that link him to political corruption and to accusations of immorality against fellow clergy.
 A press spokesman, Alfredo Castillo, said the cardinal would be too busy to spare time for an immediate interview.
 But in an interview last July with John L. Allen Jr. of The National Catholic Reporter, the cardinal said he was ''completely convinced'' that ''there are bishops involved'' in a smear attempt. The matter has ended up in court.
 ''I would have preferred another course, that of an internal investigation,'' Msgr. Luis Bambaren, a former president of the National Conference of Peruvian Bishops and a patron of Father Gutierrez, said in an interview.
 ''This has done us great damage as a church,'' added Monsignor Bambaren, who was himself summoned to testify before prosecutors and cleared. 
 The accusations and investigation, which continues, underline the intensity of the feelings surrounding Cardinal Cipriani.
 His role in Peru's violent past has recently drawn a stern rebuke. A Truth Commission appointed to look into human rights abuses during the campaign against Maoist Shining Path insurgents in the 1980's and 1990's concluded that he had done little to protect vulnerable parishioners. It also sharply criticized him for associating so closely with the military and President Alberto K. Fujimori, who was deposed in 2000 after a decade of increasingly authoritarian and corrupt rule.
 In the Ayacucho region where he served as a bishop for a decade until the late 1990's, the report concluded, he ''did nothing to improve the human rights situation.''
 Rafael Rey, a member of Congress who belongs to the Opus Dei movement and is a friend and former student of Cardinal Cipriani's, said the commission's report was ''unjust, inaccurate and politically biased.'' He said the cardinal correctly believed ''that the proper role of the church as an institution is to cultivate souls and strengthen the dignity of the human person, not to try to solve all the problems of the world.''
 Sofia Macher, a member of the commission and a former secretary general of the National Human Rights Coordinator, said in an interview here: ''Cipriani's main relationship was with the political and military power structure, not the citizenry. He consistently downplayed the seriousness of the abuses and even refused to see relatives of the dead and disappeared.'' 
 In contrast, progressive priests and bishops, many associated with liberation theology, criticized abuses by both rebels and government forces and helped peasants file complaints about killings and disappearances. The cardinal's critics say the commission's criticisms are consistent with their view of Opus Dei as elitist and remote from the concerns of the poor.
 The Rev. Joaquin Diez, a Spanish-born priest and an Opus Dei member who is a professor of theology and a newspaper columnist here, said: ''We do not believe in class struggle. Only a ruling class that has a social vision can lead countries like this out of poverty.''
 Opus Dei, founded in 1928 by a Spanish priest, Josemaria Escriva de Balaguer, was originally regarded as a fringe, cultlike movement because some members, even among lay people, live together in single-sex centers, hand their paychecks over to an administrator, pledge celibacy and flagellate themselves.
 Still, during the quarter-century papacy of John Paul II, Opus Dei rose in status with promotions like Cardinal Cipriani's and the beatification of Father Escriva in 2002.
 In contrast, advocates of liberation theology, which preaches what has come to be known as a ''preferential option for the poor,'' were steadily weeded from the church hierarchy, a process that some fear Pope Benedict may continue.
 Liberation theology, too, advocates greater involvement by the church in the daily routines of the faithful, but with a more active -- some say activist -- role at the side of the poor and the oppressed as they seek to fight inequality and overturn unjust political, social and economic structures.
 To guardians of the faith in Rome, liberation theology smacked of Marxism. While a few priests did join guerrillas or accept posts in revolutionary governments, like that of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, most priests affiliated with the movement operated within the rules of the church, through what they called ''ecclesiastical base communities,'' many of which are still functioning.
 Advocates of liberation theology acknowledge that they are now in the minority here and are trying to avoid further conflict. But they also emphasize that they have not abandoned their beliefs or their mission.
 ''The church is not an army; it's a community with various tendencies and points of view,'' said Cecilia Tovar, a member of the board of the Instituto Bartolome de las Casas, a religious training center set up by Father Gutierrez. ''We hear a lot that liberation theology no longer exists. But we are still here, the base communities are still active and we are still working.''
 ''They have been attacking us ever since John Paul II died, but that is just proof that we still worry them,'' Ms. Tovar said.
 The rise of Opus Dei is also a challenge to some groups within the church not directly associated with liberation theology.
 Education, for instance, is a domain in which the Jesuit order has excelled for centuries. But Opus Dei operates a provincial university with a branch here and elite high schools that are seen as fertile recruiting grounds for conservative clergy and lay workers. As bishop in Ayacucho, Cardinal Cipriani earlier ordered Jesuits withdrawn from teaching posts at some universities there.
 Beyond differences of theology, there are strong opinions about the personal style of Cardinal Cipriani, a former engineer for an American mining company and a former basketball player and coach. 
 ''He's tough and demanding, but also agile and intelligent,'' said Mr. Rey, who played on one of the teams. 
 But some subordinates, who asked that their names not be used, described Cardinal Cipriani as abrasive and headstrong. Since the Vatican named him archbishop of Lima in 1999 and then cardinal two years later, analysts in academia and the press have detected what they describe as signs of less than unanimous enthusiasm among both lay people and clergy.
 Traditionally, to mention one much-cited example, the cardinal of Lima, as the archbishop of this nation of 27 million, serves as president of the Bishop's Conference, which has more than 50 members. One of Cardinal Cipriani's predecessors, Cardinal Juan Landazuri Ricketts, for instance, was repeatedly elected by his peers to that post during three decades. Thus far, however, that honor has eluded Cardinal Cipriani, who serves as one of two vice presidents.
 Not long after his transfer to Lima, the first spurious letters written in his name were sent to Rome, charging Cardinal Landazuri Ricketts and an auxiliary bishop with immorality. Cardinal Cipriani's supporters suggest that the documents were intended to discredit him and force his removal.
 A more recent set of letters said to be from the cardinal and the papal nuncio here thanked Mr. Fujimori's intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, for a donation of $120,000 and asked that incriminating videotapes be destroyed. 
 When it became clear that the letters were not genuine, government prosecutors began their investigation. ''This was an evil, reprehensible act from both the moral and legal point of view, and the government has an obligation to continue until it determines who those responsible are,'' Mr. Rey said.
 Also around the time of Cardinal Cipriani's return to Lima, Father Gutierrez, the founder of liberation theology who had been criticized both by the Vatican and by the future Pope Benedict himself, abandoned his role as a diocesan priest and joined the Dominican order. 
 Father Gutierrez's supporters said he had long been considering such a move. But the effect of his action was to remove him from the immediate supervision of whoever became cardinal and give him a degree of protection from being silenced.
 Now 76, he has been spending more time out of Peru. He teaches at Notre Dame in the United States and lectures frequently at European universities, where his role as the primary theoretician of liberation theology gives him enormous prestige.
 ''It's an exaggeration to say that he is exiled,'' contended Monsignor Bambaren, Father Gutierrez's friend. ''He just wants to maintain a low profile.''
 But Father Diez, the Opus Dei member, said, ''He knew that conditions here were not going to be very favorable to him.'' 


CORRECTION-DATE: May 15, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about Opus Dei, the conservative Roman Catholic movement, referred incorrectly to the 2002 ceremony that elevated the religious status of the movement's founder, Josemaria Escriva de Balaguer, a Spanish priest. It was canonization, or the declaration of sainthood -- not beatification, a step that leads to sainthood. (Father Escriva was beatified in 1992.)

HEADLINE: Cable's New Pitch: Reach Out and Touch Someone

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
LIKE most people, Jay Fields took his phone service for granted. He paid more than $100 a month -- no questions asked -- to Verizon Communications for a local and long-distance plan and a host of services like call forwarding and caller ID.
 But when he saw advertisements for a newfangled Internet-based phone service that his local cable provider, Cablevision, was offering, he had no bones about switching five months ago. His says his new connection sounds just as good as his old phone, yet he pays just $34.95 for unlimited local and long-distance calling, as well as call waiting and a half-dozen other services. 
 ''The No.1 reason was the price,'' said Mr. Fields, 34, a financial industry broker who lives in St. James, N.Y. ''And it's so simple to use -- you go online and you can manage the whole thing from one place.''
 Voice over Internet protocol, or VoIP, is no longer the sole province of start-ups like Vonage. With their familiar names, full-fledged service teams and discounted packages, established cable providers like Cablevision and Time Warner Cable are taking digital phones to the masses.
 Their inroads have meant big changes in a telephone industry long dominated by the giant local Bell companies. Tied to their millions of miles of copper phone lines, the Bells are loath to get into the digital phone market for fear of cannibalizing their core product. Instead, they are trying to hang on to customers by packaging their traditional phone lines with low-cost broadband connections, cellular service and video programming from satellite television providers. 
 But they are also quietly developing their own Internet-based phone services. Verizon, for instance, sells a service called VoiceWing, and SBC Communications is likely to market AT&T's CallVantage service after the two companies merge, which is likely in the coming months.
 They will have stiff competition from cable providers. By the end of the first quarter, Cablevision had signed up 364,000 subscribers for its digital phone service, and is adding about 1,000 new customers a day. Time Warner Cable had 372,000 customers. Comcast and Cox Communications both have more than 1.2 million traditional phone subscribers and both are now introducing digital phone service. 
 At their current rate, the cable companies may soon eclipse the market leader, Vonage, which has 600,000 subscribers. Based in Edison, N.J., the company has done more than any other to popularize digital phone service, but it lacks the marketing firepower or full range of products to keep the cable industry at bay.
 ''Brand has everything to do with it: long-term stability, willingness to stand by the product, quality of product,'' Steve Kirkeby, a telecommunications analyst at J.D. Power & Associates, said of cable companies.
 For now, the market is big enough for both Vonage and the cable companies to thrive. Nationwide, there are roughly 180 million wire-line phones and another 173 million cellphones. Yet even the most optimistic forecasters expect only 27 million digital phone subscribers by 2009, just 15 percent of the fixed-phone-line market.
 In many ways, growth in the service is capped. That is because only about 30 percent of American homes have the broadband connection that Internet phones require. Some consumers also fret about the quality of the voice calls, sometimes with good reason. Consumers who use operators that do not control the connection to their homes are at greater risk of having their calls interrupted.
 ''For the first year or so, we had problems with people not hearing us, or voices would sound scratchy,'' said Sowmya Parthasarathy, who has been a Vonage subscriber for nearly two years and ''used to spend hours on the phone'' with the company's operators. ''But they really seem to have fixed the problems.''
 Most cable operators, however, control that last mile to consumers' homes, and say their customers have fewer such disruptions. They are also selling back-up battery packs to be used during power failures and starting to allow consumers to dial emergency services.
 And they are trumpeting their prices, which are lower than traditional phone lines partly because digital services, at least for now, are exempt from some taxes levied on ordinary phone lines.
 Lower prices, though significant, are not the only draw. In addition to services like unlimited calls in the United States and Canada, Mr. Fields receives free voice mail, call waiting, caller ID and three-way calling. He also checks his voice messages at work by logging onto a dedicated Web site, and, when calling directory assistance, he reaches an operator, not a computer-generated voice.
 ''I like new gadgets, but I'm the guy who doesn't read the manual,'' he said. ''If I was having problems, I would cancel it.''
 WHILE digital service is still in its infancy, industry executives are already plotting the next steps. Many expect digital phones to be integrated with televisions so that, for instance, consumers can monitor their calls on screen.
 Others see the future in wireless handsets that allow consumers to use cellular networks when they are outdoors and to piggyback on wireless Internet connections at home. Calls would be relayed to antennas attached to broadband modems, then sent just like Internet-based phone calls. That would let consumers save their wireless minutes.
 ''Consumers should have the ability to use the same cellphone with their broadband network when they are at home,'' said Jeff Hallock, vice president for consumer product marketing at Sprint, which provides cable companies with the infrastructure to offer Internet-based phone services and sells digital phone service to business customers (but not retail ones). ''A customer does not need to know whether it is an Internet service or not. They just need to know that when they are at home, it runs at home.''
 For now, companies are spending more time teaching consumers about the basics of digital phone service. In a survey conducted by SunRocket, a phone provider based in Vienna, Va., 85 percent of the more than 2,200 consumers polled said they had heard of Internet phone service. Yet only half of those surveyed knew that Internet-based phone calls could be made with a standard telephone and a regular phone number, or that calls did not have to be routed through a computer.
 ''We have to retune our message,'' said Jeffrey Citron, the founder and chief executive of Vonage. ''In the early days, our people were pushing the technology. Now they want to do it in a more simplistic fashion.''
 To reassure consumers, many cable companies send workers to install adapters. AT&T has developed a do-it-yourself guide for its CallVantage service. Most companies now have 24-hour call centers.
 If Mr. Fields is any indication, the message seems to be getting through. ''I wish I would have saved this kind of money earlier,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bored No More: History's End Scares Europe

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
THE Europeans watched collectively last month as the Airbus A380, the giant plane they see in competition with the United States, did something it hadn't done yet. It took off.
 Unfortunately, Europe as a whole these days sometimes seems perilously close to crashing. Or at least in a state of collective perplexity about its role in the world, its identity, its future. 
 The most striking sign of that: the possibility that the French, despite their historical role as the chief inspirers of the European dream, might vote against the proposed Constitution for the enlarged 25-member union in a referendum at the end of May. France's president, Jacques Chirac, has warned that a ''non'' would mean not that Europe crashes but that ''it stops'' -- for lack of its Constitution, painstakingly negotiated for four years.
 Why this continued, perhaps growing, resistance to the idea of a unified Europe? A recent scene sums up the situation. A few days ago, Mr. Chirac went on French TV to answer questions on the Constitution posed by a group of 18- to 30-year-olds. 
 There are two solutions, he said. One ''would lead to a Europe swept along by an ultraliberal current, which would be an Anglo-Saxon and Atlanticist Europe,'' he said. ''That's not what we would wish.'' What Europe needs instead, he said, is ''to be organized and strong so as to impose its humanism, its values.'' In other words, to have clear rules to guide its further movement ahead.
 The response of the young people was strong and persistent skepticism, and, perhaps more important, pessimism. ''I have the impression,'' one of them said, ''that a little something is being hidden in this text, and that is that the text follows a liberal logic.'' By ''liberal'' the young person did not mean American-style liberalism, a la Edward M. Kennedy. He meant liberal in the European sense of an unregulated free-market economy of cheap labor competition that will cause Europe to jettison its social protections. The implication was that ''liberalism'' is what the bureaucrats in Brussels, the European Union's capital, want, and what the citizens of the individual nations like France must protect themselves against.
 Yet the resistance runs deeper than that, and is more perplexing because Mr. Chirac has a point: Europe is more peaceful, prosperous, healthy and secure than ever in its history. Nevertheless, the French are crabby. The British, a majority of whom in recent polls also opposed the European Constitution, just voted to keep Tony Blair as prime minister after an idea-free campaign dominated by the issue of his credibility, or lack of it. A recent poll of Germans showed only 28 percent expecting life to be ''very good'' in the next 5 to 10 years and 40 percent saying they are unhappy.
 ''We look at the future as an opportunity,'' said Jeffrey Gedmin, an American conservative who is director of the Aspen Institute branch in Germany. ''They look at it as a risk.''
 Perhaps an explanation for the current European spiritual condition was provided in that famous 1992 essay by Francis Fukuyama, who argued that history has ended. His idea was that the last great ideological struggle ended with the fall of Soviet Communism and the triumph of the liberal democratic idea, and that there could be no more advanced idea.
 That is a cause for rejoicing. But as Mr. Fukuyama wrote, there was also something dispiriting about a post-historical world in which the Big Question no longer revolves around freedom but over how much New Zealand butter a nation could import.
 ''It is obvious by now that the European Union has become the framework for the disappearance of centuries of belligerence, and that's a fact,'' Michael Naumann, publisher of the German weekly Die Zeit, said. ''But it has become so totally accepted that we won't go at each other's throats any more that people get bored.''
 In this sense, the European Union, which will include 27 countries and more than 500 million people by 2007, was made to be boring. Europeans have had more than their share of history -- two world wars, dictatorships, German divisions, Soviet occupations -- and there is no great appetite here for more of it. 
 '''The rockets' red glare, bombs bursting in air,' sounds pretty good to an American,'' Mr. Gedmin said. ''We say it at baseball games. But Germans don't want to hear about bombs bursting in air. They had that at Dresden.''
 So it is natural that the Europeans would focus on narrow matters of economic interest. ''The dearth of ideas is the really true part of Fukuyama,'' Pierre Hassner, a French political philosopher, said recently. ''In this sense, history really is finished.''
 But he and others disagree about the end-of-history argument; or, at least, they feel Europe doesn't represent the end of history Mr. Fukuyama had in mind. Even if he felt bored by New Zealand butter, his end of history was essentially a happy situation.
 Europeans aren't happy. They are anxious, threatened not just by the Brussels bureaucracy but by immigration, economic stagnation and unemployment. ''It's a nightmare of the end of history,'' said Alexander Adler, a commentator at Le Figaro, the French daily. ''I don't think that Fukuyama thought it would lead to a foundering of historical optimism.''
 Mr. Hassner added to this idea: ''The mood is not one of satisfaction or boredom but one of threat.'' 
 ''In this sense,'' he said, ''it's not the end of history but the beginning of a world that one doesn't understand. It's this feeling of having a big wind carrying us forward but we don't know where we are going.''

HEADLINE: A Sense Of Where He Is

BYLINE: By MARGARET FARLEY STEELE

 BODY:
IF you want to know which country is the leading exporter of wheat or where slash-and-burn cultivation is most common, ask 12-year-old Liam McCarthy, the state's geography champion.
 The Darien seventh grader, winner of the recent Connecticut Geography Bee, will represent the state at the National Geography Bee in Washington on May 24 and 25.
 The contest will pit Liam against 54 other students from the fourth to eighth grades. The grand prize: a $25,000 college scholarship from the National Geographic Society. 
 Liam, an honor student at the public Middlesex Middle School, earned the right to compete nationally after beating 100 other competitors on April 1 at a statewide bee sponsored by the society. Liam, who is just over 5 feet tall, remains unfazed by the task ahead. ''It's fun,'' he said.
 Working every afternoon with Barbara Ivey, a librarian at his school, they divide the world into quadrants and study each in depth -- rivers, bays, mountains, imports and exports, natural resources, current events and more. ''There's economic geography, cultural geography, political geography,'' Mrs. Ivey said. ''It's not just physical geography.'' They planned study Australia, New Zealand and tectonic plates in the coming days, she said. 
 Besides reviewing questions from previous bees to accustom Liam to the phraseology, they play geography quiz games, and she encourages him to watch ''Jeopardy!'' and the BBC News. Mrs. Ivey is passionate about geography herself. She has volunteered with the bee at Middlesex since 1991. 
 ''Liam is a good listener,'' Mrs. Ivey said -- if he doesn't immediately know the answer to a question, he analyzes the clues. 
 Consider the winning question in the Connecticut bee: The Pribilof Islands, named for the Russian explorer and navigator who discovered fur-seal rookeries there, are located in which sea? Although Liam had not heard of the Russian explorer, within the 30-second time limit he was able to pinpoint the location to somewhere around Alaska and arrive at the answer: the Bering Sea.
 Liam has always enjoyed making maps. He reads atlases and almanacs in bed. He likes strategic video games and historical fiction, always reading with an eye for a new place or landmark. ''Then I look it up,'' he said. He earned the right to compete in Connecticut after finishing first in his school's bee and excelling on a strenuous written test, questions from which appear at the beginning of this article. (The answers: the United States and tropical rain forests.) 
 ''We're very proud, understandably,'' said his father, Kevin McCarthy. ''Where he gets all this knowledge from beats me.'' After winning the state prize, which included $100 and the expense-paid trip to the nation's capital, his father recalled that Liam said triumphantly: ''Usually it's the sports people who get in the paper. For once it's the academics that pay off.''

HEADLINE: FILIBUSTER FIGHT NEARS SHOWDOWN

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting for this article

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7 

 BODY:
With the Senate clock ticking toward a momentous procedural clash over judicial nominees, lawmakers and advocates on each side are readying a final push to win over the few uncommitted lawmakers and frame the fight to their best political advantage.
 Beginning Monday, when both Republicans and Democrats will mark the four-year anniversary of President Bush's initial round of nominations, the parties and their allies will follow a day-by-day schedule of demonstrations, legislative maneuvers and other public events in anticipation of an imminent floor showdown.
 With the climax nearing, the tone of the debate is escalating. A radio address taped by three Christian conservative leaders for broadcast Monday called the judiciary ''the last playground of the liberal left.'' In the address, James C. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, described the fight as the tipping point of the Bush presidency. ''Nothing good took place last November, only the potential for something good,'' Dr. Dobson said. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, used the party's Saturday radio address to hit back at conservatives who are urging that the filibuster be prohibited, accusing them of ''trying to undermine the age-old checks and balances that the founding fathers placed at the center of the Constitution and the Republic.''
 The heightened level of activity is being driven by signs from Republican senators and senior aides that Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, will soon take aim at the Senate's signature parliamentary weapon by forcing a vote to eliminate Democratic filibusters against Mr. Bush's choices for the federal bench.
 While they are focused on the prospect of an immediate confrontation, Democrats and Republicans are also working to turn the judicial fight to their advantage in the longer-term political struggle.
 Senators and political analysts say the confrontation will inevitably spill into the 2006 midterm elections, especially in what portends to be a no-holds-barred battle for Senate seats, and beyond. The parties are honing competing messages that they will try to drive home over the coming months should Republicans prevail in thwarting the filibusters.
 Seizing on Democratic threats to slow the majority agenda in the Senate, Republicans intend to paint Democrats as uncompromising obstacles to popular legislation. The message is simple, they say -- no highway money, no energy bill, no tax relief.
 ''My own judgment is that this operates in our favor,'' said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. ''It would just cement their reputation as obstructionists.''
 He and other Republicans say they are convinced that Democrats will confront a backlash if they are seen as throwing a tantrum that kills legislation that could benefit a struggling economy. 
 ''People are concerned about employment, jobs and those things that affect them in their daily lives,'' said Bob Stevenson, a spokesman for Dr. Frist. ''An internal fight over Senate rules is not something that tends to stir much discussion around the water cooler.''
 Democrats, however, believe they have the upper political hand as demonstrated in consistent public opinion polls that find strong public support for the filibuster. They say the public gets the idea that Republicans are threatening to destroy the unique nature of the Senate.
 ''They understand that Republicans are changing the rules in the middle of the game,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate. ''They understand that Republicans are diminishing the power of the Senate and the constitutional system of checks and balances.''
 He and his fellow Democrats offer the drive against the filibuster as Exhibit No. 1 in arguing their broader case that the majority party is being led by those far out of the mainstream, is arrogant and abusive of its control of Congress and the White House.
 ''The more this small group of extremists calls the shots, the better chance Democrats have of regaining the Senate in 2006,'' Mr. Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said earlier this week.
 The issue has already surfaced in what is shaping up to be a hotly contested Senate race in Pennsylvania, where Senator Rick Santorum, a chief Republican advocate of eliminating judicial filibusters, differs with his opponent, Robert P. Casey Jr., the Democratic state treasurer, over the tactic. But it could also be potent in races in states like Nebraska, North Dakota and Florida, which are now represented by Democrats but were won by Mr. Bush. 
 Depending on how the fight plays out, it could ultimately figure into the presidential prospects of Dr. Frist and other Senate Republicans, not to mention the aspirations of Senate Democrats like Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Evan Bayh of Indiana. 
 Representative Tom DeLay, the House majority leader who is backing Senate Republicans in their anti-filibuster push, said he doubted that Democrats would summon the nerve to retaliate after suffering losses in the last two elections. ''I don't think they can afford politically to do it,'' he said this week.
 Democrats have softened their earlier tone on paralyzing the Senate, saying they intend to push their own initiatives. And they say a snarled Senate has much less public resonance than does a government-wide shutdown like the one in 1995 that backfired on Newt Gingrich, the House speaker, and Congressional Republicans.
 ''We are not going to shut down the Senate; we are not shutting down the government,'' Mr. Durbin said. ''Newt Gingrich retired that trophy.''
 He did say that Democrats intended to apply the rules of the Senate to try to force Republicans into uncomfortable stands on issues such as the minimum wage and health care. And Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, told a high school civics class on Friday in Las Vegas that Mr. Bush ''will rue the day he let this happen.'' 
 Charlie Cook, a veteran nonpartisan analyst of Congressional races, said he believed that Democrats could benefit initially from the showdown if the public interpreted the Republican move as a power grab. But voters could eventually side with Republicans if they succeed in making Democrats seem petulant and obstinate.
 ''In the end, I think both sides could end up looking bad,'' Mr. Cook said.
 The timing of the confrontation is as uncertain as the ultimate political outcome. Senators and aides to the majority leader say he could act as early as next week, though the Senate is scheduled to consider an emergency spending measure it would like to send to the president and a highway bill that lawmakers would like to advance to negotiations with the House.
 But a move before the end of May seems almost assured. Within the next few days, five judges opposed by Democrats could be awaiting floor action, though it is unclear which of them might be brought forward to set off the showdown.
 The imminent approach of a confrontation that has been building for years is raising the anxiety levels of those involved in the fight while prompting an intense flurry of activity and lobbying appeals. 
 ''Senate Showdown Near on Ending Filibusters of President Bush's Judicial Nominees!'' screamed the headline on an ''action alert'' distributed in recent days by the National Right to Life Committee. ''Outcome too close to call -- take action now!''
 Events will accelerate Monday, with Republicans using the occasion to emphasize how two prominent appeals court candidates nominated by Mr. Bush four years ago were stalled. One, Miguel Estrada, withdrew while the other, Priscilla R. Owen, is among those still awaiting a vote.
 Democrats will, in contrast, emphasize eight of the initial candidates who were confirmed. They have prepared a memorandum critical of opinions issued by those judges since then, finding fault with their views on environmental, criminal and labor law.
 ''All the more reason, therefore, for Democrats to closely protect 200 years of constitutional interpretation and Senate history by preserving the right to filibuster extremist judicial nominees,'' said a draft of the memorandum circulated among Senate Democrats.

THE PRESIDENTIAL RECORDINGS: LYNDON B. JOHNSON
The Kennedy Assassination
and the Transfer of Power,
November 1963-January 1964.
Edited by Max Holland,
Robert David Johnson,
David Shreve and Kent B. Germany.
General editors: Philip Zelikow, Ernest May and Timothy Naftali.
Three volumes. 2,505 pp.
W. W. Norton & Company. $175.
 FEW presidents have had a greater impact on American life than Lyndon B. Johnson. Assuming office in the tragic circumstances of the Kennedy assassination, Johnson presided over the legislative fulfillment of the civil rights revolution, a change in immigration policy that dramatically altered the population's racial and ethnic makeup, and the creation of programs like Medicare and Medicaid that permanently reshaped Americans' relationship to the federal government. He also plunged the United States into the ground war in Vietnam, sparking a generational rebellion that tore the society apart. 
 Today, another Texan occupies the White House, some of whose actions Johnson might find familiar. Like him, George W. Bush has dispatched tens of thousands of American troops to war in the hope of remaking a faraway country. But in many ways, the modern political world would be unrecognizable to Johnson. Then, as now, powerful Southerners controlled the key committees of Congress. But in the 1960's, the South was still solidly Democratic and liberalism was at high tide. Both presidents had close ties to Texas oil companies. But Johnson resisted their incessant demands for government largess. 
 Lyndon Johnson has always defied simple characterization. He grew up in one of the poorest parts of the United States, the central Texas hill country, and entered politics as the Texas director of the National Youth Administration, one of the agencies created by Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930's. He always retained the New Deal conviction that the government had an obligation to assist less fortunate members of society. 
 But Johnson acquired a fortune and rose to political prominence by establishing close ties with Texas business interests and cultivating powerful conservatives like the Georgia senator Richard Russell, the leader of the Southern bloc in Congress, who helped Johnson become Senate majority leader in 1955. A man of enormous energy (one of his biographers, Robert Dallek, calls him a ''human dynamo''), Johnson struck many contemporaries as aggressive, vain and power-hungry. Yet he was beset by deep insecurities and as vice president felt thoroughly humiliated by John F. Kennedy, who marginalized him to the point of irrelevance.
 Those fascinated by Johnson's career, as well as by how American politics has and has not changed in the past half-century, will welcome ''The Presidential Recordings,'' a colossal project begun by the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia to publish transcripts of all accessible recordings of the conversations of American presidents -- from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Richard Nixon. The fact that presidents tape-recorded many of their discussions came to light in 1973, when Alexander Butterfield mentioned it during the Watergate hearings, setting in motion a chain of events that sealed Nixon's doom. 
 Johnson's recordings, although dwarfed by Nixon's, include about 9,500 conversations, nearly all of them on the telephone. These three volumes, weighing in at 2,500 pages, cover the period from Nov. 22, 1963, the day Johnson became president, to the end of January 1964. At this rate the full project will require dozens of volumes and tens of thousands of pages. Only obsessive eavesdroppers and historians are likely to wade through this material, or listen to thousands of hours of recordings on accompanying DVD's. Why not just put it all online?
 During the past decade, a cottage industry has developed in books based on taped presidential conversations. Several edited collections have appeared, and numerous works of history have made use of the recordings. Some of these books contained errors of transcription. In its accuracy and completeness, ''The Presidential Recordings'' represents a major step forward. But it also reveals the problems inherent in this genre of historical evidence. To make the transcripts readable, the editors have inserted punctuation, turning rambling, ungrammatical remarks into coherent, complete sentences. They make no attempt to convey Johnson's Texas accent, which he turned on and off depending on the listener. In print, Johnson speaks the king's English -- with one notable exception. In a few instances, the transcripts have the president saying ''Nigra.'' (Michael Beschloss, in an earlier edited volume of Johnson tapes, chose, inaccurately, to use the less offensive ''Negro'' in these cases.) 
 Over all, these volumes offer a tantalizing glimpse into the inner workings of the presidency and Johnson's style of governing. They provide strong evidence of the range of issues that come before a president. Like George W. Bush, Johnson had to act simultaneously as commander in chief in a time of war, domestic policy maker and leader of a political party in a time of stark division. The subjects of the 25 recorded calls on Jan. 25, 1964, for example, include patronage appointments, welfare programs, tax cuts, civil rights, the 1964 election, the building of compact cars in the United States and crises in Panama and Cyprus. 
 In some ways, Johnson's preoccupations as revealed on these tapes seem remarkably up-to-date. Johnson, like his successors, was obsessed with stopping leaks to the press. The State Department ''leaks everything they got,'' Johnson complained to his assistant Ralph Dungan. ''I've got about as much confidence in them as I have in a Soviet spy.'' Johnson, like Bush, devoted much effort to shaping the news and cultivating journalists (although Johnson actually read several newspapers every morning). He made numerous phone calls to reporters and editors, basking in their praise and dishing out flattery (''You got the best magazine in the business,'' he told David Lawrence of U.S. News & World Report). Then, as now, the news media allowed themselves to be cultivated. Johnson succeeded in getting journalists to tone down critical editorials and reporting. He even agreed to have the Justice Department grant antitrust clearance for a Houston bank merger after John Jones, a newspaper publisher and chairman of one of the banks, pledged in writing to support his election.
 When Johnson entered the White House, Kennedy's legislative initiatives, including his tax cut and civil rights bills, were stalled, blocked by a coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats. Johnson took as his first task getting these measures enacted. But fearful of being compared unfavorably with his martyred predecessor, he determined to place his own stamp on the presidency: ''I don't want . . . every time they want to see what Johnson's program is, to go look and see what Kennedy said.''
 Bush has emulated Johnson in making the White House the primary center of power in Washington and imposing his will on Congress. These volumes reveal how Johnson prevailed in battles with Congress over foreign aid and tax cuts during his first weeks in office. They offer vivid examples of the famed ''Johnson treatment'' -- how he cajoled, flattered, threatened and maneuvered to bend others to his will. He knew how to appeal to principle, politics and self-interest. He counted noses and knew the details of legislation. He also told people on different parts of the political spectrum what they wanted to hear. 
 Johnson worked behind the scenes with Harry Byrd of Virginia, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to get the tax bill to the Senate floor. Byrd agreed to dislodge it from his committee if Johnson kept his 1965 budget under $100 billion. A frenzied search for programs to cut ensued, even as Johnson allocated new funds to begin the war on poverty. 
 JOHNSON rallied business support by emphasizing his spending cuts and insisting that antipoverty spending would not encourage long-term dependency. To Walker Stone, a prominent conservative editor, he observed: ''I'm going to try to teach these Nigras that don't know anything how to work for themselves, instead of just breeding. I'm going to try to teach these Mexicans [that] can't talk English to learn it, so they can work for themselves.'' 
 At the same time, Johnson assured liberals that he was on their side. ''Don't you get alarmed about all this crap about economy,'' he told the labor leader Walter Reuther. ''What I'm doing is taking from the haves and giving to have-nots.'' All this has reinforced Johnson's reputation as a slick maneuverer who lacked fixed principles. 
 One example of genuine idealism that does come through in these volumes is Johnson's commitment to civil rights. When he took office, nobody expected that he would identify himself with the black movement more passionately than any previous president. But from his first days in office he urged black leaders, labor officials and businessmen to lobby Congress for passage of the stalled civil rights bill. He asked Robert Anderson, a member of Eisenhower's cabinet, to work on Republicans: ''You're either the party of Lincoln or you ain't. . . . By God, put up or shut up!'' 
 Determined to receive credit for his efforts from black voters, Johnson became furious when Jet magazine criticized him for not allowing himself to be photographed with black leaders. On Dec. 23, 1963, Johnson called Roy Wilkins of the N.A.A.C.P. at 10:30 p.m., insisting, ''I had my picture made with every damn one of them.'' And he added, ''If you've ever had a friend in this place, you've got him now.'' Five minutes later, he urged Whitney Young, head of the Urban League, to pressure Jet's publisher to change the magazine's tone, which Young proceeded to do. At 11 p.m. the president met with Gerri Whittington, a black woman who worked in the White House office pool, and hired her as a personal secretary. The next day, Whittington joined the group that traveled to Johnson's Texas ranch for the Christmas holiday. On New Year's Eve, he brought her to a party at the University of Texas faculty club, a rigidly segregated facility. He made a point of entering the building arm in arm with her. 
 Despite the insights these volumes yield into Johnson's modus operandi, they do not significantly alter our understanding of the man or his presidency. It is noteworthy, indeed, how much the tapes leave out. Because Johnson and his wife spoke in person, these recordings contain virtually nothing from Lady Bird Johnson, whose role in presidential decision making has been re-examined and emphasized by recent scholarship. 
 The tapes display Johnson's colorful language -- he refers to Congressman Otto Passman, who was blocking foreign aid legislation, as a ''cave man,'' a ''goddamned Cajun from the hills of Louisiana.'' But perhaps because Johnson knew he was being recorded, his legendary earthiness is missing. About the most off-color taped comment came in a call to the Arkansas senator John McClellan about plans to appoint the black journalist Carl Rowan to head the United States Information Agency. ''I'd expect you [to oppose him],'' Johnson remarked. ''I didn't want you to . . . send him home one day without his peter.'' 
 ''These audiotapes,'' Philip Zelikow, the former director of the Miller Center, has declared, ''will do for the study of government what the discovery of Pompeii did for the study of Rome.'' In fact, the conversations constitute only one piece of a vast historical record, and they reveal less about policy formation than traditional sources like staff memorandums, records of meetings, letters and memoirs. Most striking, these volumes include almost no mention of the conflict that defines Johnson in historical memory -- Vietnam -- even though he held his first high-level meeting on the subject two days after the assassination. In December 1963, Senator Mike Mansfield wrote a memo advocating a political solution based on neutrality for Southeast Asia. By January, holdovers from the Kennedy administration like the cabinet members Robert McNamara and Dean Rusk were advocating a sharp escalation of the American presence. None of this is reflected in Johnson's phone conversations. 
 Like the current president, Johnson came to the White House with little experience in foreign relations, and listened primarily to those who already agreed with him. He relied heavily on the advice of his mentor Richard Russell, a staunch anti-Communist who saw every local situation as a cold war issue. Johnson, moreover, feared that withdrawal from Vietnam would hand his political opponents a potent weapon. ''Do you want that to be another China?'' he asked one caller, alluding to how Republicans had used the ''loss of China'' in the 1952 presidential campaign against the Democrats. 
 In the end, Johnson tried to run the country the way he had controlled the Senate -- by building coalitions and dealing favors to individuals. But as president he faced an America beset by deep social fissures and irreconcilable policy differences. By 1968, all his political skills, cajolery and cozying up to the press could not save his career. Perhaps the greatest limitation of the presidential tapes is that they give so myopic a picture of politics and government. Almost by definition the participants in these conversations are government officials, business figures, labor leaders and heads of organizations -- what C. Wright Mills famously called America's ''power elite.'' Grass-roots civil rights activists, antipoverty crusaders and critics of America's role in Vietnam go unrepresented. The problem, of course, lies not with the transcripts themselves but with the insular world presidents inhabit. In fact, these conversations may be the least revealing way of understanding the currents that tore apart American politics and society and with them the presidency of Lyndon Johnson.

HEADLINE: Racial Politics of 2001; Unhealed Wounds in 2005

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Nick's Lobster sits near the end of Flatbush Avenue, where southeast Brooklyn just begins to smell of the sea. Ten miles from Lower Manhattan, it overlooks serene waters opposite a gently rolling golf course, far removed from City Hall.
 But what happened in this remote pocket on a balmy afternoon in October 2001 touched off a political clash that profoundly altered that year's mayoral contest, bitterly dividing Democrats over race and campaign tactics and ultimately helping propel Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire Republican, to victory.
 Those divisions -- pitting minority political leaders against one another and against their white counterparts -- linger to this day, and are once again shaping a mayoral race as Mr. Bloomberg seeks re-election. 
 Around the table that day at Nick's were supporters of the Democratic mayoral candidate Mark Green, who was then engaged in a primary runoff against Fernando Ferrer. Looking for a way to spur white voters to the polls, the group discussed capitalizing on distaste for the Rev. Al Sharpton, a crucial black supporter of Mr. Ferrer. 
 The result was seen and heard days later in predominantly white Brooklyn neighborhoods: a demeaning cartoon of Mr. Sharpton and automated telephone calls suggesting that a Ferrer victory would give Mr. Sharpton power in City Hall.
 The fliers and phone calls that had their genesis that day at Nick's became flash points in a bitterly divisive mayoral race, stoking hostilities between the Ferrer and Green camps that proved so intense that the wounds did not heal by Election Day. Mr. Bloomberg, then a novice politician, played up those divisions in his own advertising and campaign literature and narrowly defeated the winner of the Democratic runoff, Mr. Green.
 In the weeks before the general election, frantic efforts to heal those divisions failed. There was the public spectacle of Mr. Green, in formal wear, traipsing to Mr. Ferrer's NoHo headquarters to bridge the divide. There was a surreal night at the Four Seasons Hotel where, over several hours of room service and phone calls, Harvey Weinstein, the movie mogul, made a last-ditch effort to enlist Bill Clinton to broker peace between Mr. Green, Mr. Sharpton, Mr. Ferrer and his chief adviser, Roberto Ramirez.
 But in between, amid contested election results and charges and countercharges of racism and dirty tricks, lies a cautionary tale about the benefits and perils of ethnic politics in New York, a tale that was largely overlooked at the time, when the city was still consumed with Sept. 11. And now, the ghosts of 2001 are haunting both Mr. Green as he contemplates a run for state attorney general and Mr. Ferrer as he embarks on his third try for mayor. 
 It is a sign of how toxic those forces were that neither man would comment for this article, and that the vast majority of their associates and former campaign operatives who agreed to be interviewed did so only on the condition of anonymity.
 Mr. Green, who had a solid reputation as a champion of minority interests, has been tarred in some quarters as a racist, although people who were involved in the campaign say he knew nothing about the fliers. His 2001 campaign remains under investigation by both the Brooklyn district attorney's office and the Campaign Finance Board for payments connected to the anti-Sharpton drive.
 As for Mr. Ferrer, many Democrats still vow to withhold their support from him, grumbling that he and Mr. Ramirez, then the Bronx Democratic Party chairman, motivated by lingering anger over the episode, handed Mr. Bloomberg the election by failing to support Mr. Green once he became the nominee.
 The campaign had been testy and tinged by race from the start. Mr. Ferrer's Democratic opponents attacked him as divisive for his message about helping the ''other New York.'' Mr. Ferrer to this day maintains that he has always spoken in purely economic terms, but his opponents claimed it was a coded message aimed at minority voters.
 The meeting at Nick's occurred against the backdrop of Mr. Green's precarious status at that point in the race: Having spent most of the campaign as the presumed front-runner, he began losing his white liberal base after agreeing to Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan to extend his mayoral term after 9/11. On the Upper West Side of Manhattan and in brownstone Brooklyn, Mr. Green's supporters, among the most liberal and staunch Democratic voters in the city, were defecting from him in large numbers as the primary runoff against Mr. Ferrer neared.
 Former Green workers say the campaign felt compelled to act, and they embarked on a two-pronged effort aimed at whites. One was pointed toward liberals and involved contrasting Mr. Green's record with Mr. Ferrer's on litmus test issues like abortion, gay rights and the death penalty.
 The other prong was pointed toward more centrist whites outside Manhattan. Many of them supported either of the two Queens Democrats, Alan G. Hevesi and Peter F. Vallone, in the primary, and Green strategists feared they would simply stay at home during the runoff election. That effort eventually came to involve Mr. Sharpton.
 On Oct. 4, a young campaign operative, Fran Miller, who was charged with overseeing get-out-the-vote efforts in Brooklyn, helped organize the lunch meeting at Nick's with dozens of elected officials representing south Brooklyn. Recollections of the event differ among participants, but some of the officials argued that the only way to get their constituents to the polls was to use Mr. Ferrer's connection to Mr. Sharpton. Someone suggested circulating a cartoon from The New York Post that depicted Mr. Ferrer kissing the swollen posterior of Mr. Sharpton.
 Mr. Green, who did not attend the lunch meeting, had taken pains throughout the campaign to avoid invoking Mr. Sharpton, and some from the campaign objected. Ms. Miller, though, said that she later went ahead with the idea, with the blessing of Richard Schrader, the campaign manager and other senior staff members. The fliers that were later distributed, she said, were captioned, ''A vote for Ferrer is a vote for Sharpton.'' Mr. Schrader denied any knowledge of the tactic or involvement with it.
 The day before the Oct. 11 runoff, the fliers appeared in south Brooklyn in white but not minority neighborhoods. Mr. Green won the runoff the next night by a slim margin. But the next day, he began to be questioned about the fliers, which he denied any knowledge of but denounced as despicable, and he promised to discipline anyone responsible. 
 A day after that, officials at the Board of Elections said that some 200,000 ballots were counted more than once, throwing the election results into question. Although by the end of the day, that estimate had shrunk, and it seemed unlikely to have affected the outcome, Mr. Ferrer and his supporters threatened to withdraw his concession and imply that the Green campaign had been involved in voter fraud. Mr. Sharpton threatened to sue.
 A week later, after several unsuccessful overtures from Mr. Green to smooth over relations, Mr. Ferrer invited Mr. Green to his campaign headquarters to make his case for an endorsement. In what one Green associate called a civil and calm exchange, Mr. Ferrer complained about the fliers. Mr. Green said that he would investigate and, at Mr. Ferrer's request, issued a statement that he would never allow anyone involved in the matter to work in a Green administration.
 But at a second meeting with Ferrer advisers later that night, with Mr. Green in white tie on his way back from a dinner, things became more heated, according to people in both camps, as the men argued over the use of the fliers, while Mr. Green complained that the Ferrer campaign had been trying to use race to its advantage all along.
 The next morning, Mr. Green returned to meet with about 60 of Mr. Ferrer's supporters. After answering questions about the fliers, Mr. Green told the group that he did not need the Ferrer contingent to win, but that he needed it to govern. A Green associate said that what he meant by that statement was that he wanted a long-term relationship rather than just a temporary alliance, but many of Mr. Ferrer' supporters took it as an example of what they saw as Mr. Green's arrogance, especially when dealing with minority groups.
 That day, at a news conference billed as a show of unity, Mr. Ferrer endorsed Mr. Green. Mr. Ramirez left the event, saying that Mr. Green had not earned his endorsement yet. The next day, Mr. Ferrer made his lone campaign appearance with Mr. Green and later recorded radio spots and automated telephone calls.
 Things remained relatively calm until Nov. 2, four days before the general election, when an article in The Daily News detailed the meeting at Nick's. Mr. Ferrer, furious, threatened to boycott a fund-raising dinner planned for that night, again on the theme of unity. Mr. Green and Mr. Ferrer spoke several times that day, with Mr. Ferrer demanding that two of Mr. Green's aides, John Kest and Ralph Perfetto, be fired. Both men had attended the meeting at Nick's, but Mr. Perfetto said they had objected to the use of the fliers. Mr. Green refused to fire them.
 After the weekend, Mr. Weinstein gathered Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Ramirez at the Four Seasons to try to broker a peace and stave off a Republican victory. Although accounts of the evening vary, at some point those in the Ferrer camp agreed that if Mr. Green would dismiss the aides and if Bill Clinton came to the hotel, they would sign on to Mr. Green's campaign. Mr. Weinstein worked to bring Mr. Clinton in, but the 11th-hour negotiations fell apart.
 Mr. Ramirez, known for his ability to deliver the Bronx in elections, sat out the election the next day, unwilling, an associate said, to help a candidate who he felt had failed to adequately respond to reports about the campaign's involvement in the anti-Sharpton drive.
 Mr. Bloomberg narrowly won, but his most decisive margin, 60 percent to 38 percent, came from white voters, who made up more than half of those who voted. His first public act as mayor was a breakfast with Mr. Ferrer, which some Democrats took as a sign that Mr. Ferrer had played a role in the victory.
 Ms. Miller, who helped organize the meeting at Nick's, remains unapologetic for the fliers themselves, although she said that she could see how they played into racial stereotyping and that she wished the controversy had led to an open discussion about race relations.
 ''A Democrat should be mayor of this city; it's Democratic three to one,'' Ms. Miller said. ''But they can't get their act together, the Democratic Party, and deal with some of these underlying issues that are going to continue to come back. Because in the Democratic Party, they don't know how to deal with issues of race.''

HEADLINE: Bush Tells Putin Not to Interfere With Democracy in Former Soviet Republics

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: MAASTRICHT, the Netherlands, May 7 

 BODY:
President Bush used the 60th anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat to warn President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Saturday that ''no good purpose is served by stirring up fears and exploiting old rivalries'' in the former Soviet republics on his borders.
 ''All the nations that border Russia will benefit from the spread of democratic values, and so will Russia itself,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech in Riga, Latvia, in the Small Guild House, a neo-gothic meeting hall in the capital's Old City. ''Stable, prosperous democracies are good neighbors, trading in freedom and posing no threat to anyone.'' 
 The president pointedly said, ''The United States has free and peaceful nations to the north and south of us'' and ''we do not consider ourselves to be encircled.''
 Mr. Bush then flew to the Netherlands for a brief overnight stay before a meeting and dinner with Mr. Putin at the Russian presidential dacha outside Moscow on Sunday, which is taking on the appearance of a showdown as Mr. Bush has spoken repeatedly of the pain that Baltic nations like Latvia endured under the Soviet occupation after World War II. Mr. Bush is in Europe to mark the anniversary of Hitler's defeat; he will join Mr. Putin for celebrations in Red Square on Monday.
 In his speech on Saturday, Mr. Bush seemed certain to irritate Mr. Putin further when he warned him as he had in February about retreating on democracy. ''All free and successful countries have some common characteristics -- freedom of worship, freedom of the press, economic liberty, the rule of law and the limitation of power through checks and balances,'' Mr. Bush said.
 In the last year the United States has grown concerned over Mr. Putin's prosecution of business leaders, his increasing control over the press and his involvement in the affairs of Georgia and other neighbors. 
 Mr. Putin has not reacted positively to such criticism from Mr. Bush in the past, and this week he told the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' that Mr. Bush had little business lecturing him about democracy when the 2000 presidential election in the United States was decided by the Supreme Court.
 In a joint news conference with Baltic leaders in Riga earlier on Saturday, Mr. Bush put more pressure on Mr. Putin by calling for ''free and open and fair'' elections in Belarus, the last dictatorship in Europe, whose president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, is backed by Mr. Putin. Mr. Bush also did not dispute the premise of a question from a reporter implying that the United States was behind revolutionary change in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. 
 ''The idea of countries helping others become free, I hope that would be viewed as not revolutionary, but rational foreign policy, as decent foreign policy, as humane foreign policy,'' Mr. Bush said.
 Mr. Bush, who is on the second day of a five-day trip to Latvia, the Netherlands, Russia and Georgia, is trying to ensure that his attendance at the celebration on Monday does not endorse the Soviet repression and rise of totalitarianism that followed.
 So he leveled his harshest criticism against Russia for acts after World War II, and seemed to lean as much toward a denunciation of postwar Soviet acts as celebratory words for the Nazi defeat. 
 ''As we mark a victory of six decades ago, we are mindful of a paradox,'' he said. ''For much of Germany, defeat led to freedom. For much of Eastern and Central Europe, victory brought the iron rule of another empire. V-E Day marked the end of fascism, but not the end of oppression.'' 
 The Russians have been angered by Mr. Bush's trip to Latvia and his scheduled visit to Georgia on Monday and Tuesday, and have accused the United States of meddling in the affairs of their former republics, now independent nations with contentious relationships with Moscow.
 Mr. Bush on Saturday seemed likely to anger the Russians even more, because he repeatedly used the word ''occupation'' to describe the Russian acts in the Baltics -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- after World War II. The Russians have furiously responded that they were invited in.
 The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a nonaggression pact in August 1939, just weeks before Germany's invasion of Poland precipitated World War II. Soviet troops joined German forces in occupying Poland, and the next year the Soviet Union also entered Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia and incorporated them into the Soviet Union as republics. After the Soviet Union joined the war on the side of the Allies in 1941, German forces overran the three Baltic countries and occupied them, with local support, until Soviet troops retook them near the end of the war.
 Mr. Bush added at the news conference, ''My hope is that we're now able to move beyond that phase of history into a phase that is embracing democracy and free societies.''
 But in his speech, Mr. Bush acknowledged that the United States and Britain shared some blame for the annexation of the Baltics, noting that the 1945 Yalta agreement, in which Europe was carved up by Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin, was in an ''unjust tradition'' of earlier treaties like the Munich and Molotov-Ribbentrop pacts. He added that ''once again, when powerful governments negotiated, the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable'' and that the ''captivity of millions in Central and Eastern Europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history.'' 
 Mr. Bush sought to tie democratic change in Eastern Europe to the changes he seeks in the Middle East. ''Freedom is the only reliable path to peace,'' he said. ''If the Middle East continues to simmer in anger and hopelessness, caught in a cycle of repression and radicalism, it will produce terrorism of even greater audacity and destructive power.'' He added that ''we will not repeat the mistakes of other generations appeasing or excusing tyranny, and sacrificing freedom in the vain pursuit of stability.''
 Mr. Bush also had stern words for his hosts, the Latvians, telling them they had to respect the rights of the country's ethnic Russian minority, which has objected bitterly to laws requiring the use of the Latvian language in most activities and discrimination in general.

HEADLINE: If the I.R.S. Gets Less, Does Charity Get More?

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
SINCE he became president, George W. Bush has made charity an important part of his political platform. Time and again, he has suggested that charitable groups, especially those with religious affiliations, could take over social services traditionally offered by the government. 
 This view captured the essence of compassionate conservatism: individuals should choose how much money to redistribute to their fellow citizens, instead of relying on the government to decide for them. 
 Just read this passage from the ''Citizen's Guide'' to President Bush's first budget proposal: ''Federal tax policy must spark an outpouring of private philanthropy in America, spurring billions more annually in charitable giving to neighborhood-serving groups, both sacred and secular.'' 
 Twice in his first term, President Bush signed huge tax cuts for individuals, putting cash in their pockets so they could make that choice. Yet the response was far from an outpouring of generosity.
 One way to look at the effects of Mr. Bush's policies is to check the Internal Revenue Service's statistics on charitable deductions. As long as the relationship between deductions and donations stays constant, these figures should give a good idea of what happened in the last few years. 
 From 2000 through 2003, the last year for which statistics are available, there was no clear trend in the number or value of deductions claimed. 
 What is interesting is who gave, and how much. There was a major shift only among the people with the least to give -- those earning $15,000 or less. The share of donors in this group rose to 3.7 percent, from 2.7 percent.
 Over all, the highest earners -- those with incomes exceeding $200,000 -- were the most likely to give, or at least to give an amount worth reporting on a tax return. About 90 percent took deductions for charity in all four years.
 The size of their gifts plunged, though, from an average of $22,406 in 2000 to $18,011 in 2003. The change came in proportion to their average incomes, which also sank as investment returns dwindled. Yet in the I.R.S.'s other main income bands, where average income remained pretty much constant, the size of the average contribution rose distinctly -- and nowhere more so than among the lowest earners.
 So, were these people actually becoming more generous? Maybe, but maybe not. Let's say most middle- and low-income people tended to give the same amount every year. Next, let's go back to those bands. Even though the average income in each band didn't waver much, the people counted in each band could have changed. If incomes were falling in general, some of them would slip into lower bands in the I.R.S.'s data. So the contributions reported in every band would rise, except at the top -- which is exactly what happened.
 It's not the only possible explanation, but it can't be ruled out.
 What the figures do prove is another, more disturbing fact about people's giving: as a class, high earners give more than low earners, but among those who actually donate money, the high earners are stingier.
 In total, low earners gave 1 percent of their income to charity in 2003, while the high earners gave 3.1 percent. Looking only at those who actually gave, however, the figures tell a different story. Low-income donors managed to part with a whopping 26 percent of their incomes, while high earners gave 3.4 percent. 
 The high earners had to pay more in tax. But even in after-tax terms -- assuming that the highest earners paid half their incomes to the government, while the lowest paid virtually nothing -- those low earners were still three times as generous. 
 Some low earners may consider their donations too small to be worth reporting. Yet for the high earners, the tax deduction offers much more of an incentive to give. So why didn't they give more?
 Economists usually take the view that people with more money give each dollar a lower intrinsic value than do people with less. In other words, wresting a dollar from a poor person causes more pain. But perhaps that's not true. Perhaps one reason rich people have more dollars is simply that they like dollars -- or the things dollars can buy -- more than everyone else.
 If that's true, it doesn't fit well with President Bush's tax policy. He gave the biggest breaks to the highest earners. Maybe they're not as compassionate as he'd hoped.

HEADLINE: Big Online Brokers in Talks About Possible Takeovers

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN; Riva D. Atlas contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
A takeover skirmish among three of the nation's largest online stock brokerages erupted over the weekend, potentially leading to a significant reorganization of the industry that is expected to have an impact on individual investors.
 E*Trade Financial made an unsolicited bid to buy Ameritrade Holdings on Friday for more than $5.5 billion in a letter to its board, according to executives involved in the talks.
 Ameritrade, meanwhile, has been holding secret negotiations to buy TD Waterhouse, the executives said.
 The boards, managements and advisers of all three companies spent the weekend plotting their next moves. Competitors like Charles Schwab also spent telephone time discussing where they might fit in, executives said. 
 Representatives for E*Trade, which is based in New York, and Ameritrade, which is based in Omaha, declined to comment. A spokesman for TD Waterhouse, which is based in New York, could not be reached for comment.
 In a recent research report, Michael Hecht, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, noted that the management of E*Trade ''believes that the discount brokerage industry is ripe for consolidation and hopes to participate.''
 ''To the extent weak equity markets put pressure on the group's economics, consolidation becomes more likely,'' Mr. Hecht added. 
 Consolidation among the online brokerage firms, now seen by executives as a necessary step in a struggle for survival, is expected to reach down to investors and the prices they pay to trade stocks. 
 The showdown illustrates just how much pressure the online brokerage firms are under as the stock market and trading volumes continue to be weak, never returning to the heights of day trading in the late 1990's. 
 The traditional Wall Street firms, considered dinosaurs only several years ago compared with the upstarts, have remained resilient as many investors have preferred the hand-holding of brokers rather than the anonymity of mouse-clicks. 
 For the last several years, with so many online brokers trying to steal business from one another and their more traditional bricks-and-mortar rivals, the commission fees that investors pay have fallen sharply, both online and off. 
 Online brokerage firms offer deals now for investors to pay as little as $8.95 a trade and some offer 20 or more commission-free trades as an incentive to sign up with the services.
 Analysts suggest that the steep decline in commission fees will likely flatten or even rise as the online brokerages merge.
 TD Waterhouse is owned by the Toronto-Dominion Bank, which has held unsuccessful talks about selling TD Waterhouse to both E*Trade Financial and Charles Schwab, which is based in San Francisco. More recently Schwab and Waterhouse have been adversaries. In March, Schwab sued TD Waterhouse, saying that a Waterhouse ad campaign had falsely labeled Schwab a high-priced firm with inferior service. Waterhouse stood by its ads.
 Speculation of a deal between E*Trade and Ameritrade took hold Friday after E*Trade canceled meetings with investors in Europe and scaled back a stock buyback program, according to Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners who follows both companies.
 Though he downplayed the possibility of a quick deal, Mr. Repetto said, ''Consolidation makes a lot of sense.''
 Investors seemed to agree as the rumors were enough to lift the stock prices of both companies. 
 Ameritrade's shares, which are down more than 20 percent so far this year, rose 57 cents Friday, to $11.31, while E*Trade, whose stock is also down more than 20 percent, rose 93 cents, to $11.93.
 Of the two companies, E*Trade has been somewhat buffered from the slump in stock trading because it has a bank that sells mortgages among other products -- although that business, too, could suffer as interest rates rise.
 E*Trade also owns a stock market-making business that could process trades for Ameritrade's customers, were the two businesses to combine, said Charlotte Chamberlain, an analyst at the broker Jefferies & Company.
 A merger between E*Trade and Ameritrade would place more pressure on Charles Schwab. The company, long an industry giant, has shaken up its management and cut commissions several times over the last few months in an effort to regain ground lost in recent years to smaller, more nimble competitors like E*Trade and Ameritrade.

PERSON: Fei Xiaotong

HEADLINE: Fei Xiaotong, 94, a Pioneer In Chinese Anthropology

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Fei Xiaotong, one of China's pre-eminent social scientists, who survived Mao's Cultural Revolution to claim a place of honor in Chinese society, died April 24 in Beijing. He was 94.
 His death was reported by the official New China News Agency. 
 Fei Xiaotong -- or Fei Hsiao-t'ung in the old spelling -- helped lay the foundation for sociological and anthropological research in China, through his pioneering studies of village life and ethnic minorities. He was best known to American colleagues and students for his book ''Peasant Life in China: A Field Study of Country Life in the Yangtze Valley.'' First published in 1939, its English translation remains available in a reprint edition from AMS Press Inc.
 ''Peasant Life,'' along with ''Earthbound China: A Study of Rural Economy in Yunnan'' and another book of which he was a co-author, ''From the Soil: The Foundations of Chinese Society,'' became cornerstones of modern sociology and anthropology. 
 Mr. Fei's life was shadowed by personal tragedy in years of political upheaval in China.
 He was born in Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province, in eastern China and began his higher education at Yenching University in Beijing, planning to study medicine. But deciding that China's problems were social and political rather than medical, he turned to sociology. 
 After graduation in 1933, he continued his studies at Tsinghua University in Beijing and later at the University of London. There, he studied under the anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski and received a Ph.D. before returning to China in 1938.
 Circumventing the Japanese occupation of China's north and eastern coastal areas, he became a professor of social anthropology at National Yunnan University in Kunming, an enclave in southwestern China for many academics during the war. 
 It was during Mr. Fei's early fieldwork before setting off for London that his bride and fellow anthropology researcher, Wang Tongwei, was drowned in a mountain stream. In Kunming, he met his second wife, Meng Yin. 
 After becoming a professor, he undertook studies of communities in the Kunming hinterland, in Yunnan Province. His reputation having reached the United States, he was invited by the State Department to visit in 1943-44, and he lectured and did research at Harvard and the University of Chicago.
 Back in China, he wrote prodigiously and rose to scholarly eminence. He had also become active in the Democratic League, a political group seeking a democratic alternative to the governing Nationalists. In 1946, after a Nationalist crackdown at his university on protesters against the civil war, he and several other league members took refuge in the American Consulate in Kunming. He went to Britain again and, based at the London School of Economics, studied village life in Britain.
 With the victory of Mao's Communists, Mr. Fei entered a twilight zone in which he juggled academics and politics for survival. He received appointments to government agencies and repeatedly ran afoul of the official line but ultimately had his fame to protect him.
 He was denounced as a ''rightist deviationist'' in 1957 during the ''Hundred Flowers'' campaign, forbidden to teach and stripped of important posts. In the early 60's some of these were restored, but the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966 dealt another blow. His papers were destroyed and he was sent to the countryside as a farm laborer, returning to Beijing only in 1972.
 In the late 1970's, Mr. Fei was politically rehabilitated. 
 He is survived by a daughter from his second marriage, Fei Zhonghui.

HEADLINE: Facing the City, Potential Targets Rely on a Patchwork of Security

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: KEARNY, N.J., May 7 

 BODY:
It is the deadliest target in a swath of industrial northern New Jersey that terrorism experts call the most dangerous two miles in America: a chemical plant that processes chlorine gas, so close to Manhattan that the Empire State Building seems to rise up behind its storage tanks.
 According to federal Environmental Protection Agency records, the plant poses a potentially lethal threat to 12 million people who live within a 14-mile radius.
 Yet on a recent Friday afternoon, it remained loosely guarded and accessible. Dozens of trucks and cars drove by within 100 feet of the tanks. A reporter and photographer drove back and forth for five minutes, snapping photos with a camera the size of a large sidearm, then left without being approached. 
 That chemical plant is just one of dozens of vulnerable sites between Newark Liberty International Airport and Port Elizabeth, which extends two miles to the east. A Congressional study in 2000 by a former Coast Guard commander deemed it the nation's most enticing environment for terrorists, providing a convenient way to cripple the economy by disrupting major portions of the country's rail lines, oil storage tanks and refineries, pipelines, air traffic, communications networks and highway system. 
 Since 9/11, those concerns have only been magnified. Law enforcement officials have warned of the need to prepare for an assault on one of the four major chemical plants in the area or an attempt to ship nuclear or biological weapons through its two port complexes.
 Trying to safeguard more than 100 potential terrorist targets in two miles surrounded by residential communities, industrial areas and commuter corridors has proved a daunting challenge. Federal, state and local officials have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to install gates, roadblocks and security cameras and to provide additional patrols, surveillance and intelligence operations. 
 But even those in charge of the effort say the job is incomplete, bogged down by obstacles that are a microcosm of the nation's struggle against potential terrorist threats.
 After distributing tens of billions to state and local governments since 9/11, the federal Department of Homeland Security cut New Jersey's financing this year to about $60 million from $99 million last year. Many security experts have complained that the formula -- which provides Montana with three times as much money per capita as New Jersey -- is guided more by politics than by the likelihood of an attack.
 Meanwhile, security at Newark Airport, while more rigorous and time-consuming for passengers, has been marred by embarrassing breakdowns, as screeners have repeatedly failed to prevent federal officials from sneaking weapons and fake bombs onto planes.
 The time and expense of screening shipping containers has slowed attempts to tighten security at Port Newark and Port Elizabeth, where customs officials say their radiation screening devices are ineffective and need replacement. 
 The private companies that own 80 percent of the most dangerous targets have given varying degrees of cooperation, officials said, and the chemical industry has effectively blocked attempts in Washington to mandate stricter regulations.
 As a result, many of the most crucial security tasks are left to local police departments, some of which say they are too understaffed and poorly equipped to mount a proper counterterrorism effort.
 ''They tell us to patrol, do this, do that, but don't give us the money or equipment,'' said Sgt. Michael Cinardo of the Kearny Police Department, one of several law enforcement agencies responsible for patrolling around the chlorine plant. 
 He said the department requires patrol officers to stop by the plant at least five times each shift.
 Security against terrorism is a particularly sensitive issue in New Jersey. More than 700 people killed on 9/11 lived there. And, in October 2001, the first major bioterrorism attack on United States soil was launched from a New Jersey post office when a series of anthrax-laced letters were mailed to members of Congress and the news media. The State Health Department's muddled response came to symbolize the nation's need to prepare itself to face new threats. 
 Since then, New Jersey officials have spent more than $350 million in state tax money on counterterrorism, building an apparatus that is run by seasoned law enforcement experts and is generally well regarded.
 New Jersey's Homeland Security Department, established in 2002, has helped to train, coordinate and increase staffing at local law enforcement and emergency medical agencies; assembled a 1,000-person task force to focus on urban areas; and purchased boats, decontamination suits, radio systems and a computerized intelligence network so federal agents and the New Jersey State Police can share information with all 566 municipalities.
 In the most dangerous two miles, they have erected concrete barriers outside hospitals and office buildings and put fences along elevated highways that pass chemical plants. The State Police patrol the skies, highways and coastal waters, and federal officials have used various surveillance techniques. On the New Jersey Turnpike, troopers try to check any vehicle that stops for as little as five minutes.
 But given the sheer number of vulnerable sites -- three major oil and natural gas pipelines, heavily traveled rail lines and more than a dozen chemical plants -- many security experts acknowledge that the response is inadequate. 
 In the months after 9/11, government officials routinely refused to discuss the most mundane aspects of security, saying that they did not want to offer inside information to potential enemies. Now, said Sidney J. Caspersen, the director of the state's Office of Counterterrorism, there is more risk in remaining silent.
 ''The terrorists already know what's out here,'' Mr. Caspersen said. ''They have been found with blueprints of our buildings, and a lot of the information is available over the Internet or at a public library. The only question is whether we will find a way to protect these targets before they find a way to attack them.''
 The answer to that question will depend largely on the ability to operate with limited money and a tangle of bureaucracies. 
 In several instances, counterterrorism money sent to the state has been used for questionable purposes: the city of Newark spent $300,000 on two air-conditioned garbage trucks, and New Jersey Transit has proposed using $36 million in security money to overhaul the Hoboken Ferry terminal. Even groups like Taxpayers for Common Sense say that places like New Jersey, Houston and Long Beach, Calif., deserve more federal dollars. 
 As for the ports, the federal Homeland Security Department's inspector general's office recently criticized the agency for directing much of its $517 million in port security money to relatively low-risk sites in places like Kentucky and Tennessee, and not giving enough to busy, vulnerable facilities like Port Newark. Although the Port of New York and New Jersey recently received an additional $42 million for counterterrorism efforts, Port Newark lacks the up-to-date equipment now used to search cargo at ports like Hong Kong.
 ''We put more resources into securing the average large bank in Manhattan than we do for the entire security of Port Newark,'' said Stephen Flynn, a former Coast Guard commander who is now a security analyst for the Council on Foreign Relations and who conducted the study that first identified this part of North Jersey as the nation's most terror-prone two miles. ''That's just irresponsible.''
 Some New Jersey officials have hoped that the newly appointed secretary of homeland security, Michael Chertoff, will be sympathetic to the state's situation because he is a native of Elizabeth. But when he visited New Jersey during a terror drill last month, Mr. Chertoff was noncommital about restoring cuts.
 ''Frankly, it's not a matter of spending a great lot of money,'' he said. ''It's a matter of taking resources we have and having a plan in place so we use them effectively.''
 New Jersey officials say that the cuts will force them to reduce surveillance of possible targets, cancel training sessions for first responders and counterterrorism experts, and forestall the purchase of equipment to detect chemical, nuclear or biological agents. The state has said it will also have to scale back plans to fortify storage facilities and rail lines near the Pulaski Skyway, an area known as ''chemical alley.''
 Even if New Jersey were to receive more money, however, its counterterrorism effort would still face other difficulties.
 At Newark Airport, which handles 32 million passengers a year, the federal government and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have spent tens of millions of dollars on high-tech baggage screening equipment, more guards and other security improvements. But Transportation Security Administration employees failed to detect weapons or fake bombs in about a quarter of the 81 tests conducted between last June and September. In December, when a machine detected a simulated explosive, baggage screeners lost track of it and it was loaded onto a flight to Holland.
 Meanwhile, even less has been done to secure the nation's greatest vulnerability to terror attacks, its 15,000 chemical plants, 123 of which pose a threat to at least 1 million people, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. A spokeswoman for the Chemistry Council, an industry group representing 150 of the nation's largest chemical plants, said its members had already invested $2 billion in improved security and were working with Congress to establish federal safety guidelines.
 ''We want to work with the Department of Homeland Security and Congress to make these plants safer in a way that works for everyone,'' Kate McGloon, the spokeswoman, said.
 Michelle Petrovich, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said agency officials had visited more than half the nation's 300 most dangerous plants and urged the companies to enhance perimeter security and switch to less hazardous chemicals and processes. As a result, Ms. Petrovich said, she believes North Jersey is ''one of the safer areas because it has received the most attention in terms of protective measures.'' 
 But Richard A. Falkenrath, a former deputy homeland security adviser to the White House, said that effort has done little to make the public safer. ''Saying that you're doing something doesn't mean you're actually making a difference,'' said Mr. Falkenrath, who recently testified before Congress, urging tighter regulation of the chemical industry.
 Since 2001, at least two major efforts to bolster chemical plant security have been stalled, in part by industry lobbyists.
 The latest proposal to tighten security at chemical plants, which appears to be gaining support in Congress, would establish safety guidelines. But Senator Jon S. Corzine said that it is only a half measure because it would not mandate that plants in densely populated areas stop using highly dangerous chemicals like chlorine gas and switch to more benign alternatives, like sodium hypochlorite. The plants use such chemicals to make antiseptics for water purification plants.
 For those who live in the shadow of these plants, there is little expectation that the federal government will mount a more vigorous security response. 
 Carolyn M. Chapluske of Kearny, who has lived in North Jersey all her life, said, ''People pay taxes and deserve to be protected. But they probably won't. It's just the way things work.''


CORRECTION-DATE: May 13, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Monday about lapses in security at dozens of potential terror targets in New Jersey that are close to Manhattan gave an incorrect attribution for a statement that the federal Department of Homeland Security is encouraging operators of chemical plants to use safer substances and processes. It was made by Kate McGloon, a spokeswoman for the Chemistry Council, not by Michelle Petrovich, a spokeswoman for the department.

HEADLINE: The Final Insult

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Hell hath no fury like a scammer foiled. The card shark caught marking the deck, the auto dealer caught resetting a used car's odometer, is rarely contrite. On the contrary, they're usually angry, and they lash out at their intended marks, crying hypocrisy.
 And so it is with those who would privatize Social Security. They didn't get away with scare tactics, or claims to offer something for nothing. Now they're accusing their opponents of coddling the rich and not caring about the poor. 
 Well, why not? It's no more outrageous than other arguments they've tried. Remember the claim that Social Security is bad for black people?
 Before I take on this final insult to our intelligence, let me deal with a fundamental misconception: the idea that President Bush's plan would somehow protect future Social Security benefits.
 If the plan really would do that, it would be worth discussing. It's possible -- not certain, but possible -- that 40 or 50 years from now Social Security won't have enough money coming in to pay full benefits. (If the economy grows as fast over the next 50 years as it did over the past half-century, Social Security will do just fine.) So there's a case for making small sacrifices now to avoid bigger sacrifices later. 
 But Mr. Bush isn't calling for small sacrifices now. Instead, he's calling for zero sacrifice now, but big benefit cuts decades from now -- which is exactly what he says will happen if we do nothing. Let me repeat that: to avert the danger of future cuts in benefits, Mr. Bush wants us to commit now to, um, future cuts in benefits. 
 This accomplishes nothing, except, possibly, to ensure that benefit cuts take place even if they aren't necessary.
 Now, about the image of Mr. Bush as friend to the poor: keep your eye on the changing definitions of ''middle income'' and ''wealthy.''
 In last fall's debates, Mr. Bush asserted that ''most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans.'' Since most of the cuts went to the top 10 percent of the population and more than a third went to people making more than $200,000 a year, Mr. Bush's definition of middle income apparently reaches pretty high.
 But defenders of Mr. Bush's Social Security plan now portray benefit cuts for anyone making more than $20,000 a year, cuts that will have their biggest percentage impact on the retirement income of people making about $60,000 a year, as cuts for the wealthy. 
 These are people who denounced you as a class warrior if you wanted to tax Paris Hilton's inheritance. Now they say that they're brave populists, because they want to cut the income of retired office managers.
 Let's consider the Bush tax cuts and the Bush benefit cuts as a package. Who gains? Who loses?
 Suppose you're a full-time Wal-Mart employee, earning $17,000 a year. You probably didn't get any tax cut. But Mr. Bush says, generously, that he won't cut your Social Security benefits.
 Suppose you're earning $60,000 a year. On average, Mr. Bush cut taxes for workers like you by about $1,000 per year. But by 2045 the Bush Social Security plan would cut benefits for workers like you by about $6,500 per year. Not a very good deal.
 Suppose, finally, that you're making $1 million a year. You received a tax cut worth about $50,000 per year. By 2045 the Bush plan would reduce benefits for people like you by about $9,400 per year. We have a winner!
 I'm not being unfair. In fact, I've weighted the scales heavily in Mr. Bush's favor, because the tax cuts will cost much more than the benefit cuts would save. Repealing Mr. Bush's tax cuts would yield enough revenue to call off his proposed benefit cuts, and still leave $8 trillion in change.
 The point is that the privatizers consider four years of policies that relentlessly favored the wealthy a fait accompli, not subject to reconsideration. Now that tax cuts have busted the budget, they want us to accept large cuts in Social Security benefits as inevitable. But they demand that we praise Mr. Bush's sense of social justice, because he proposes bigger benefit cuts for the middle class than for the poor.
 Sorry, but no. Mr. Bush likes to play dress-up, but his Robin Hood costume just doesn't fit.

HEADLINE: No New Refineries in 29 Years, But Project Tries to Find a Way

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
About 100 miles southwest of Phoenix, in a remote patch off Interstate 8, Glenn McGinnis is seeking to do something that has not been done for 29 years in the United States. He is trying to build an oil refinery. 
 Part of his job is to persuade local officials and residents to allow a 150,000-barrel-a-day refinery in their backyard -- no small task. Another is to find investors ready to risk $2.5 billion in a volatile industry. So far, the effort has consumed six years and $30 million, with precious little to show for it. 
 Oil industry analysts and trade organizations like the American Petroleum Institute say they know of no one else doing the same thing. 
 Even so, Mr. McGinnis -- an industry veteran who joined Arizona Clean Fuels last year as chief executive to give the project more heft against long odds -- cleared a significant hurdle recently when Arizona awarded him a crucial emissions permit. Still ahead are countless rounds of negotiations with local, state and federal agencies to secure dozens more permits. 
 Meanwhile, the 1,400-acre site picked for the refinery, an old citrus grove near the Mexican border, remains empty, a sign of why the United States is now grappling with an acute shortage of plants that can refine the more than 20 million of barrels of crude oil that the country consumes every day. 
 The last refinery to be completed in the United States was in 1976, and Mr. McGinnis knows all too well that community and political opposition squashed earlier projects. His proposed refinery in Arizona has already been forced away from its original site near Phoenix, in 2003, after the state considered expanding the city's clean-air limits.
 But times may be changing, said Mr. McGinnis, an oil business veteran of 33 years who has run refineries in the United States and Aruba.
 ''The moon and the stars have aligned for us,'' he said, speaking on his cellphone between discussing crude oil supplies with Mexico's state oil company. ''We're halfway through, and we still have a lot of work.''
 Long considered the ugly duckling of the oil industry, the refining business is now in the spotlight as Americans complain about sticker shock at the gasoline pumps and higher energy prices over all. 
 President Bush has taken notice. Last month, Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, visiting the president at his Texas ranch on April 25, chided him with the message that his country could send more oil, but the United States would not have the ability to refine it. Soon afterward, Mr. Bush offered to provide closed military bases for new refineries. 
 Over the last quarter-century, the number of refineries in the United States dropped to 149, less than half the number in 1981. Because companies have upgraded and expanded their aging operations, refining capacity during that time period shrank only 10 percent from its peak of 18.6 million barrels a day. At the same time, gasoline consumption has risen by 45 percent.
 But in the last two years, the refining business has experienced a revival of sorts, leading some refiners to predict they have entered an age of higher margins and better returns. Not everyone agrees, but for the first time in a long time the industry is more confident about itself. Even with better economics, however, it is still tough to build a refinery from scratch. Mr. McGinnis says he is not afraid of the challenge. He and his staff work in a small office in Phoenix, mostly consumed these days with securing permits and looking for financial backing.
 The next step is to complete an environmental impact statement for the federal Bureau of Land Management. That will include an assessment of the refinery's impact on underground water sources and endangered species, as well as its effect on any Native American burial grounds. 
 After that, the project needs to get the site's zoning changed by Yuma County from agricultural to heavy industrial; Arizona's preservation office needs to be convinced that the refinery does not trample on any ancient historic site or trail; and finally, the project must apply for a presidential permit, which is issued by the State Department, to allow the crossing of a 200-mile pipeline into Mexico.
 The business of turning crude oil into gasoline, jet fuel or heating oil has rarely been a lucrative proposition. It has dismal profit margins compared with its more glamorous cousin, exploration. It is highly cyclical and fairly unpredictable, because demand for gasoline swings sharply by season. And because of low oil prices over the past decades, refiners have been forced into cutthroat competition that has driven many of the smaller refiners out of business.
 More refining capacity will almost certainly be needed. Gasoline demand is forecast to rise 39 percent by 2025, to 12.9 million barrels a day, up from today's 9.3 million barrels, according to a long-term outlook by the Energy Information Administration. By then, gasoline alone will account for nearly half the crude oil consumed in the United States. 
 By contrast, domestic refining capacity is expected to grow only by 0.8 percent from 2005 to 2007, slightly less than the 0.9 percent increase registered between 1998 and 2004, according to Jacques Rousseau, an oil analyst with the investment banker Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.
 Jay Saunders, who follows oil companies for Deutsche Bank, said that the increase in refining margins would lead to increased capacity. ''The industry is definitely going to overbuild,'' he said, ''they have in the past and they will in the future.''
 Others caution that the industry should be wary of recreating a glut of capacity that would cause profit margins to sink again. ''Refining has been a cyclical business for a long time,'' said Bill Hauschildt, the vice president for global refining with ChevronTexaco. ''In the past few years, there's been much more discipline in the market for not overbuilding capacity.'' 
 Part of the issue, according to refiners, is that substantial investments were made over the last decade to lower carbon emissions and meet low-sulfur fuels regulations. The American Petroleum Institute estimates the industry invested $47 billion on such investments. More investments will be needed through 2007 to clean up gasoline and diesel.
 ''This is going to cost you money and the only thing you will get is cleaner air and less emissions -- which are good -- but no new capacity,'' said Edward H. Murphy, the industry group's general downstream sector manager.
 ''What refiners need are clear guidance on what's permissible and what is not if they want to expand,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''So far, that has not been very clear.''
 To make up for the domestic shortfall, gasoline imports from Europe and South America have been rising in recent years. Gasoline imports now account for nearly 10 percent of domestic consumption and have exceeded a million barrels a day on average throughout April.
 But even as the United States grows more reliant on foreign gasoline, it will face mounting competition from other buyers where demand is similarly growing, like China and India. ''More competition means imports might become more expensive,'' said Joanne Shore, an analyst with the government's Energy Information Administration.
 For Bob Slaughter, the president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, the industry's main trade group, ''The question now is to keep the growth in imports at a reasonable level.'' He expects additional capacity will come from expansion of existing projects and not from the construction of new refineries like the one in Arizona. 
 Even if all goes to plan and investors are found, Mr. McGinnis's envisioned refinery will not be ready before late 2009.
 The prospect of a new employer, 3,000 construction jobs and 600 permanent posts has done a lot to outweigh concerns over the project, said John Nussbaumer, the mayor of Wellton, a city of 1,900 people about 20 miles from the refinery site. 
 ''Of course I am concerned about the effects on the environment,'' he said. ''Would I rather see it somewhere else? Yes. Would I oppose it at this time? No. It's been too long since a new refinery was built in the United States. Anything we can do to reduce our dependency on the Middle East is a good thing.''

HEADLINE: Venture Capital Streams Into Internet Phone Company

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
Vonage, the Internet telephone company, is expected to announce formally today that it has raised $200 million in new private investments, one of the largest single rounds of venture capital financing in the last decade. 
 The size of the deal underscores the confidence of the lead investors, including several major Silicon Valley venture capital firms, that Vonage, a privately held company, can continue to thrive as an Internet telephone provider even as regional Bell companies and cable providers enter the business.
 The investment comes as Internet telephony, a service that allows consumers and businesses to place calls using high-speed Internet connections, is beginning to take hold. Vonage, the leader in the field, has 650,000 subscribers and adds about 15,000 subscribers a week. 
 Paul Kedrosky, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies the venture capital industry, said the Vonage investors probably had extraordinarily high expectations to be putting that much money into the company.
 ''It's hugely optimistic,'' Mr. Kedrosky said. He added that the size of the deal meant that any initial public stock offering for Vonage would have to raise at least $3 billion to justify the latest round of financing.
 The investors, however, disagree with that analysis. Sandy Miller, a partner in 3i, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that invested more than $10 million in this round, said no public offering was planned and that the size of the deal was justified, given Vonage's success. 
 He said he was undeterred by the efforts of cable companies and traditional telephone companies to move into the Internet telephone market.
 ''We know there are going to be all the name brands,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Vonage is the exception that will be an independent company in this space.''
 Joining 3i in the investing round are Bain Capital, the lead investor; New Enterprise Associates; Meritech Capital Partners; and Institutional Venture Partners. All those firms have been previous investors in Vonage, which has raised $408 million to date, including the most recent $200 million and a financing round of $105 million last August. 
 John S. Rego, the chief financial officer of Vonage, which is based in Edison, N.J., said the money would be used primarily for marketing. Mr. Rego said the money would be sufficient to get the company to profitability in 2006.
 This latest round is tied for the seventh-largest single round of private equity financing since 1995, Mr. Kedrosky said. It is the third-largest round of financing over all and the largest in a telecommunications venture since the Internet bubble burst in 2000. 
 Vonage has nearly twice the number of Internet telephone subscribers as its nearest competitors, Cablevision and Time Warner Cable. But the cable companies and traditional telephone companies, like Verizon, are expected to capitalize on their brand names, industry analysts said.
 One factor in Vonage's favor is that the Bell companies, including Qwest and Verizon, have begun to allow consumers to buy high-speed Internet service without paying for telephone service. Consumers who buy this stand-alone Internet access can use Vonage or some other company for Internet phone service.

HEADLINE: After Winning One Campaign, Blair Is Facing Another Against Him, in His Own Party

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, May 8 

 BODY:
It's not unusual in politics for an election victor to enjoy a honeymoon, however brief. But three days after a national vote in Britain that gave him a historic third term, Prime Minister Tony Blair confronted a widening debate about his tenure in office. 
 Almost unanimously, Sunday newspapers devoted their front pages to articles chronicling disputes over when he would fulfill his pledge to stand down before the next election in favor of the chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown. 
 On television, the Sunday talk shows were filled with processions of Mr. Blair's foes in the Labor Party explaining why he should go soon -- and his allies demanding that he stay on for at least three years. 
 Underlying the complaints was an unmistakable sense that Mr. Blair -- America's closest ally in the Iraq war -- is starting his third term facing a steeper-than-expected uphill struggle with foreign policy challenges in Iraq, Europe and elsewhere even as the economic underpinnings of his first two terms start to fray.
 ''Anyone on the streets knows we were not elected because Tony Blair was popular this time around,'' said Robin Cook, a former foreign secretary who quit over the Iraq war and who has emerged as a leading voice against Mr. Blair. 
 The Labor Party secured victory on Thursday with a 66-seat majority in the 646-seat Parliament, less than half the majorities of more than 160 that it had in its first eight years in office. But even though Mr. Blair was the first Labor leader to win a third successive term, opponents like Mr. Cook insist that the election was won despite him, not because of him. 
 ''The question Tony Blair should be reflecting on this weekend is, having achieved this, having secured his place in the history of the Labor Party and the history of Britain, whether now might be a better time to let a new leader in who could then achieve the unity we need if we are going to go forward,'' Mr. Cook told the BBC.
 What was surprising was the vehemence and breadth of the assault on Mr. Blair so soon after his victory. 
 ''The idea that people suddenly want to have his head on a plate within hours of winning this historic third term of office and consigning the Tories to a terrible result and a third successive defeat, the idea that would be welcome by the public, I just think is fantasy,'' said Peter Hain, a Blair cabinet minister.
 Before the voting, Mr. Blair, 52, said the election would be his last. But he also said he would serve a full third term. One of his spokesmen said Sunday that there was ''no change'' in that position. 
 The issue that has emerged since Mr. Blair's re-election is whether the Labor Party is so riven by doubt after hearing voters' complaints about him that party rebels will now be able to undermine his tenure. 
 ''I don't think prime ministers can go on if a very substantial part of their own party thinks that it would be decent of them to resign,'' another former minister, Frank Dobson, told the ITV channel.
 Many of the dissident voices, like Mr. Dobson's, belong to supporters of Mr. Brown, the chancellor, who was inseparable from Mr. Blair during the election campaign and was widely credited with protecting him from a more ambiguous margin of victory. The public feuding on Sunday suggested that the appearance of harmony between Mr. Blair and Mr. Brown could be short-lived. 
 Mr. Blair is scheduled to assume the presidency of the European Union this year. Britain's relationship with Europe will be a crucial test for him if Britons vote in a referendum in 2006 about the new European constitution. That debate may offer a clue to an early departure by Mr. Blair. 
 Some of Mr. Blair's most loyal lieutenants sought to belittle the dissident campaign against him and urged Labor legislators to fall in line.
 David Blunkett, rehabilitated as a government minister after resigning in a scandal late last year, insisted that Mr. Blair would serve a traditional full term. ''I think he will stay until the appropriate moment for the election of a new leader and the run-into the general election in four or five years' time,'' he said.

HEADLINE: When It Comes to Replacing Oil Imports, Nuclear Is No Easy Option, Experts Say

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
President Bush has proposed reducing oil imports by increasing the use of nuclear power, which he said in a recent speech was ''one of the most promising sources of energy.'' 
 There is a problem, though: reactors make electricity, not oil. And oil does not make much electricity. 
 Nuclear reactors produce about 20 percent of the electricity used in the United States and about 8 percent of the total energy consumed. Oil accounts for 41 percent of energy consumption. 
 Could a few dozen more reactors, in addition to the 103 running now, cut into oil's share of the energy market?
 ''Indirectly, but very indirectly,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a nonprofit group that studies the economics of oil. People who think nuclear power is a way to reduce oil imports are ''confusing several issues,'' he said.
 Peter A. Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, added, ''No one knowledgeable about energy policy would link nuclear power and gasoline prices.'' 
 In the puzzle of energy consumption and production, however, experts point to three intersections of oil and nuclear power that would offer opportunities to cut demand for oil, pushing down its price and strategic significance. But all are limited, clumsy, expensive or dependent on new technologies whose success is not guaranteed, the experts say.
 The first option is to replace the oil used to make electricity with new nuclear reactors. But most of the oil in the electric sector has already been replaced, by coal. 
 According to the Energy Department, last year the electric utilities used about 207 million barrels of oil, or less than 600,000 barrels a day. (Total American consumption of oil is about 20.5 million barrels a day.) 
 Even the 600,000-barrel figure is higher than what nuclear reactors could replace, because some of that oil is used in generators that run only a few hundred hours a year. Reactors must run continuously, so they could not replace the oil-fired plants that are used only intermittently.
 The electric system consumes another fuel that nuclear power could replace: natural gas. Last year, American utilities burned just under 5.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, out of total consumption of 22.3 trillion cubic feet.
 ''You can get a scenario where nuclear would free the gas to go to other things,'' replacing oil and gasoline, said Thomas Capps, the chairman of Dominion, one of several electric companies that have expressed interest in building new nuclear reactors. ''You can run cars on natural gas,'' he said. 
 The technology for that is available, but not many people use it. According to the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, a lobbying group, about 130,000 such vehicles are on American roads today, out of more than 200 million. After decades of promoting natural gas, federal and state governments have made some headway in persuading commercial fleets to switch. But they have essentially given up on selling natural gas to ordinary consumers, who have been unwilling to convert their vehicles to use it.
 There is also little economic incentive behind using natural gas. Mr. Goldstein noted that the current wholesale price of gas, about $7 per million B.T.U. (the standard unit by which gas is sold), is the equivalent of $42 per barrel for oil. But oil now sells for about $50 a barrel, which means the price difference is not enough to induce a switch.
 Gas must also be pressurized for a car to hold enough to travel more than a few miles; pressurizing it and distributing it to service stations would add expense.
 But there is another way that nuclear reactors could influence the oil supply, one that bypasses electricity completely. Nuclear engineers are working on designs and materials for a new class of reactors -- which could be ready in about 20 years -- whose main product would be heat.
 The Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls, which is owned by the Department of Energy, is working on ways to take very hot steam from a nuclear reactor, then run a small electric current through it to separate the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. If that can be done more cheaply than the current method of producing hydrogen, which uses natural gas, the hydrogen could be used at refineries to make components of gasoline.
 Gasoline is made of molecules with a certain ratio of carbon to hydrogen. Part of each barrel of oil consists of molecules with too much carbon to be useful in gasoline; instead, those molecules are used only in low-value products like asphalt and tar.
 The technology exists for refineries to break up those molecules and add hydrogen, until the hydrogen-carbon ratio is suitable for making gasoline or diesel. 
 David Lifschultz, chief executive of Genoil, a company that makes systems for using hydrogen at refineries, says the oil supply being exhausted first is light oil, which has many components that can be used in gasoline. Heavy oil, with components high in carbon, is far more abundant and often sells at a discount of $20 or $25 a barrel, he said.
 Available technology could convert 16 million barrels a day of heavy oil, about a sixth of the world supply, into gasoline components, Mr. Lifschultz said, driving down the price of light oil.
 J. Stephen Herring, a consulting engineer at the Idaho lab, explained two other ways for reactors to make motor fuel.
 Canada has vast reserves of shale oil, now being converted to ingredients of motor fuel by using natural gas. The gas is used to heat the shale to make its oil flow more easily, and hydrogen, also obtained from the natural gas, is incorporated into the oil to make it suitable for use in gasoline. But a nuclear reactor could do those jobs, delivering both hydrogen and steam for cooking the oil out of the rock, Mr. Herring said.
 Another strategy, he said, would be to break down coal, shale oil or other hydrogen fuels into a gas comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide. At high pressure, these materials could form molecules suitable for making gasoline or diesel. A reactor could provide the energy required.
 But using a reactor to make the ingredients of gasoline is many years away; the new reactors being considered by utilities are similar to the ones running now. The experts say that only after several of those have been built and have run for a few years is a private company likely to try something more adventurous. 
 Mr. Herring did not fault that strategy. ''If I were responsible for spending the billion dollars,'' he said, ''I'd be conservative, too.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Resist Bait on Social Security

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; David E. Rosenbaum contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
Having now outlined the two biggest components of his approach to Social Security -- cutting benefits from promised levels for most workers and establishing investment accounts -- President Bush is trying to turn the focus to another aspect of the debate: where are the Democrats?
 The White House and its allies are increasingly prodding, imploring, mocking, daring and threatening Democrats in the hopes of forcing them to put on the table their ideas for dealing with the retirement system's projected long-term problems.
 But the ideas alone are not what Mr. Bush really needs, though if he is to attract Democrats to the fold he will have to incorporate some of their proposals into any legislation that might emerge. Rather, what he needs most is the political cover for his party that Democrats would provide by expressing support for the benefit cuts, tax increases or other painful changes widely seen as necessary to assure Social Security's solvency as the population ages. 
 So far, Democratic leaders in Congress have refused to play along, and there is little indication that they will change their minds. Their political reasoning is that Mr. Bush's approach is sinking of its own accord, and that there is no reason to jump in the quicksand with him. 
 Their substantive rationale encompasses opposition to the way Mr. Bush's plan would impose cuts in scheduled benefits for middle-class workers. But at its heart is their position that there can be no engagement with Mr. Bush until he drops his insistence on creating investment accounts within Social Security, a feature that Democrats say would undermine the program's role as a guaranteed source of financial security in old age even as it requires a big increase in government borrowing.
 ''Remove privatization and the adjacent ideas, and we will sit down at the table and discuss it,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
 The refusal of the Democrats to play on Mr. Bush's terms has led the White House, which signaled for months that it wanted to lower the political temperature surrounding Social Security, to strike an increasingly aggressive tone. 
 An e-mail release from the Republican National Committee on Friday contained the headline ''Democrat Forecast on Social Security: Severe Obstruction, No Ideas.'' In his speeches, Mr. Bush often suggests that anyone judged by voters to have blocked action on the issue will pay a price. Voters will ask, he said on Thursday, ''How come you're allowing partisan politics to prevent good people from coming together to solve the problem?''
 A senior administration official who insisted that he not be named, citing the sensitivity of negotiations between the White House and Congress, said that in the White House's view, the lesson of last year's presidential race was that ''you have to be for something and not just against something.''
 But the idea that you cannot beat something with nothing may be one of the biggest myths in Washington, said Guy Molyneux, a Democratic pollster who has been working with opponents of Mr. Bush's approach to Social Security.
 Mr. Molyneux cited Republicans' success in blocking President Bill Clinton's health care initiative in the early 1990's. ''The key question is, are you in a climate where the public is demanding action on Topic X?'' he said. ''If you can convince the public that a particular solution is bad enough, they'll settle for the status quo. The president's plan gives us plenty of room to make that case.''
 For now, many Democrats say they sense little urgency about the issue, and even some moderate Democrats who have worked regularly across party lines say it is hard to find much enthusiasm to act this year, as Mr. Bush has demanded.
 ''Right now, everyone gets their full check, their full benefits, their full cost-of-living adjustment, but right now there are 40 million people who don't have health insurance,'' said former Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a Democrat who supported Mr. Bush on several big issues in his first term and who is generally supportive of the kind of sliding-scale benefit cuts that Mr. Bush has proposed for Social Security. ''It's a problem that's here today versus a problem that's not coming until 2041. Let's not spend all our political capital right now on a problem that's not going to occur for 30 years.''
 There is another good reason for Democrats to keep the focus on Mr. Bush's approach. To the degree that they acknowledge there is a problem that needs to be addressed -- and some Democrats say Social Security's problems are not so big or immediate that changes must be made now -- they would have little choice but to back some benefit reductions of their own, plus an array of tax increases that would no doubt induce something between heartburn and cardiac arrest in the electorate. 
 Few Democrats have forgotten that Republicans regained control of Congress in 1994 in part by running aggressively against the tax increases, primarily on upper-income people, that Democrats adopted in 1993 to help reduce the budget deficit.
 So they have by and large kept their distance from proposals like the one developed by Peter A. Diamond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Peter R. Orszag of the Brookings Institution, two liberal economists.
 Their plan would gradually raise the payroll tax rate to 15.4 percent in 2078 from the current 12.4 percent, and impose additional taxes on people whose income exceeds the maximum amount subject to the payroll tax, currently $90,000. They also propose benefit reductions that would be smaller for most workers than under the Bush approach. 
 Another plan that has gotten attention from Democrats, developed by Robert M. Ball, a former Social Security commissioner, would gradually increase the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax. Among other provisions, it would also block the full repeal of the federal estate tax, scheduled for 2010. It would dedicate to Social Security the proceeds from taxing individual estates worth $3.5 million or more.
 Pressed recently to name just one measure he could support to help make Social Security solvent, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, said: ''I'll tell you one way. The tax cuts we've given to people making a million dollars or more a year would do it.''
 Mr. Orszag said polls suggested that most Americans were open to some forms of tax increases when presented with tradeoffs between higher taxes and lower Social Security benefits.
 ''The fundamental choice comes down to the mix between revenue and benefit changes,'' Mr. Orszag said. ''We need to have that debate.''

HEADLINE: Reviving Ground Zero

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 The harpoons tossed at Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in ''Manhattan's Mayor Ahab'' (editorial, May 2) miss the mark. 
 The mayor and his staff have been integrally involved in pushing the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site forward as fast as responsibly possible. Great progress has been made. The PATH station, memorial and cultural facilities are all moving forward on schedule, as are all the projects the mayor outlined in 2002 for improving Lower Manhattan and ensuring its future as the financial capital of the world.
 Rebuilding downtown has been an incredibly complex undertaking, and there has been no more important challenge than security. That is why the New York Police Department has been working closely for over a year with all the various agencies to ensure that the new design of the Freedom Tower includes the necessary security precautions. 
 At the same time, Mayor Bloomberg is moving full steam ahead with his five-borough economic development strategy. On the day your editorial appeared, we reached agreement with the City Council on the rezoning of the Brooklyn waterfront, showing that the mayor is hard at work on projects across the city.

HEADLINE: Love of Learning: What Happened?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman (''Tuning In to Jon Stewart, and Britney Schmidt,'' column, May 6) identifies a critical problem in our public education system: its failure to inspire a love of learning and to teach the lifelong learning skills necessary to successful careers and to a successful United States economy.
 This is evident even in our prestigious universities, in which too many bright students pursue higher education as a matter of memorizing and figuring out ''what the professor wants'' rather than daring to think critically on their own.
 The tragedy of the No Child Left Behind law is not only that it leaves so many children behind on its own terms, but also that it will ultimately leave our economy and national well-being behind. 
 True education cannot be had on the cheap. If we are to inspire imagination, our leaders are going to need much more of their own.

HEADLINE: Investors Force Out German Market's Top Leaders

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Heather Timmons contributed reporting from London for this article.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 9 

 BODY:
Foreign hedge funds brought down two of Germany's most visible business figures on Monday, as the chief executive and the supervisory board chairman of Deutsche Borse resigned in the face of unrelenting opposition from funds that own company shares.
 The investors had taken aim at the company's leaders after its chief executive, Werner G. Seifert, announced a $2.5 billion takeover bid for the London Stock Exchange in December. A barrage of protests from Deutsche Borse shareholders forced Mr. Seifert to withdraw the offer in March. 
 But the shareholders, led by a handful of British and American funds, were not mollified. They planned to press for the ouster of the Deutsche Borse chairman, Rolf E. Breuer, at the company's annual meeting on May 25, which would have cleared the way to dismissing Mr. Seifert. 
 Instead, their sudden resignations, submitted at a special board meeting here, reverberated through German industry, where the role of hedge funds and private equity investors has recently come under heightened scrutiny. A report prepared for the governing Social Democratic Party has harshly criticized foreign private equity investors, and the party's chairman, in a tabloid interview, described them as ''locusts'' that plundered German companies.
 Still, such a corporate revolt as the one on Monday is almost unheard-of in the clubby confines of German industry, where chief executives sit on each other's boards and shareholders usually do little more than rubber-stamp management decisions.
 ''Shareholder meetings have been silent for a long time in Germany,'' said Boris Boehm, a fund manager at Nordinvest in Hamburg. ''They've started becoming louder. Hedge funds, because of their huge pipeline of cash, can put their money where their mouths are.''
 Officials at two outspoken hedge funds hailed the departures as a victory for the interests of shareholders.
 ''It's a good day for German corporate governance,'' said David Slager, a fund manager at Atticus Capital, which owns about 5 percent of Deutsche Borse's shares and had pushed for a shake-up.
 TCI Fund Management, which holds an 8 percent stake and led the charge against Mr. Breuer and Mr. Seifert, said in a statement from London that it looked forward ''to a serious dialogue with the board regarding the appointment of a new chief executive, chairman and supervisory board directors.''
 Mr. Breuer, a former chairman of Deutsche Bank, will remain on the board long enough to line up a successor to Mr. Seifert, who will leave immediately. Three other German bankers who have board seats will also step down, setting the stage for the hedge funds to put their own representatives on the board.
 To other German companies nervous about the growing power of these funds, Deutsche Borse seems like a chilling example. The company, which runs the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is solidly profitable and has the largest market capitalization of any stock exchange operator in Europe.
 Under Mr. Seifert's management, it built up a powerful franchise in futures and derivatives trading. It seemed a natural candidate to lead a consolidation of Europe's stock trading industry, and indeed Mr. Seifert, 55, made a failed first pass at the London exchange five years ago.
 Mr. Seifert, a brusque, hard-driving former management consultant at McKinsey & Company, never gave up his ambitions to take over the London market, according to people who know him. Few analysts were surprised when he made a fresh overture to the exchange last year.
 What Mr. Seifert did not expect was the fierce opposition from his own shareholders, some of them hedge funds that accumulated positions in Deutsche Borse not long before the bid was announced. They complained that he was offering too much for a venerable but less valuable company in an attempt to prevent a rival, the pan-European exchange Euronext, from winning control of the London market.
 ''We said all along that consolidation was fine, when it was a merger of equals,'' Mr. Slager said from London. ''We're against competitive-bid auctions.''
 TCI and other shareholders bombarded Deutsche Borse with letters and faxes, lodged objections with regulators and assailed Mr. Seifert in the press. They called for the deal to be put to a vote -- a demand the company rebuffed, saying it was not required under German law.
 Mr. Seifert's unapologetic personal style did not help his case. At a news conference in February to defend the deal, he said, ''My job is to be chief communicator, not to be nice all the time.''
 A month later, though, he yielded to the demands of the hedge funds, withdrawing the offer for the London exchange and pledging to give shareholders a ''distribution of funds'' worth 1.5 billion euros ($1.92 billion) through an increased dividend and a share buyback program.
 By then, it may have been too late. Mr. Seifert encountered further opposition when he met with investors to discuss the buyback and Deutsche Borse's first-quarter earnings, people at the company said.
 After he and Mr. Breuer sounded out shareholders around that time, company officials said, they concluded that the dissenting investors probably had enough votes to force out the board.
 Under German law, shareholders can oust a supervisory board if 50 percent of them present at an annual meeting vote in favor of doing so. German investors now own only 7 percent of Deutsche Borse's shares, which gave Mr. Seifert a weak foundation of support.
 ''He did everything he could to please the hedge funds,'' a Deutsche Borse spokesman, Frank Hartmann, said. ''But he made it quite clear he does not want to work for a supervisory board chairman governed by hedge funds.''
 Deutsche Borse faces an uncertain future without its chief executive. It seems highly unlikely to renew its offer for the London Stock Exchange; indeed, the market was buzzing with rumors on Monday that the London exchange might now consider making a play for its Frankfurt rival.
 The shake-up is likely to ratchet up the debate over foreign investment in Germany. The country's main financial regulator, BaFin, is investigating whether the Deutsche Borse shareholders cooperated improperly to damage the interests of a publicly traded company.
 The economics minister of the German state of Hesse, Alois Rhiel, praised Mr. Seifert and pointedly called on Deutsche Borse shareholders to provide ''clarity'' about the company's strategic direction.

HEADLINE: Fitness Without Frills (No Men Allowed)

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY. 
Jane E. Brody can be reached at personalhealth@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
With the surgeon general urging Americans to do at least 30 minutes a day of moderately vigorous exercise to improve their health, and with some 60 percent of adults doing little or none, a program attractive enough to prompt millions of otherwise sedentary women to get out and ''just do it'' certainly seems worthy of praise.
 Considering the rapid growth of Curves, a privately owned no-frills fitness company that claims more than 8,000 franchises here and abroad, the concept is a winner. There is now one Curves outlet for every two McDonald's in this country, and in LaCrosse, Wis., where two researchers recently studied what the program's participants can expect to achieve, the ratio is reversed: two Curves for every one McD's.
 Curves outlets are spartan, nothing like high-end fitness salons that can be off-putting to the less-than-fit and too costly to the economically stretched. There are no mirrors, showers or locker rooms. And no men. The organization does not seem to attract highly competitive fitness buffs who may intimidate an out-of-shape woman in her 50's or 60's. 
 Three or more times a week, millions of women visit Curves outlets and work out for about half an hour. They spend 30 seconds on each of 12 strength-building resistance machines interspersed by 30 seconds of aerobic activity (stationary jogging, marching or walking) to keep heart rates high.
 Two complete circuits, done to musical tapes that signal each station change, take 25 minutes, plus 5 minutes to cool down and stretch. It's a time interval that many find they can comfortably fit into their lives. And there is a strong social component at most centers, with friends and acquaintances chatting about subjects from recipes to politics.
 Once a month, the participants have the option to be weighed and measured, and nutritional guidance is available for those who want it. But no data have been published yet on just what the women accomplish over time, or how many stick with the program long enough to become significantly slimmer or fitter.
 A 14-week Curves-sponsored study at Baylor University in Waco, Tex., suggests that those who stick with the exercise program and follow a balanced reduced-calorie diet can lose weight and maintain the loss. The results may not be typical, since study subjects are often more motivated than the average participant to stick with the program. Still, for women previously sedentary or minimally active, any progress toward fitness is significant whether or not they lose much, if any, weight.

How Well Does It Work?
 The Wisconsin study was commissioned by the American Council on Exercise, a group known as ACE that certifies exercise professionals and acts as an unofficial consumer advocate. The researchers, Dr. John Porcari, a professor of exercise and sports science at the University of Wisconsin at LaCrosse, and Kristin Greany, a registered dietitian and an adjunct professor at the university, recruited 15 healthy women ages 26 to 55 from two local Curves outlets.
 Before going through the Curves circuit, the women were tested on a treadmill to assess their base line levels of aerobic endurance. Then they were fitted with heart monitors and metabolic analyzers to measure heart rate, oxygen consumption and calories burned in the workout.
 The researchers found that the total 30-minute workout burned an average of 184 calories, a surprise to many participants who thought they were expending perhaps 500 calories, Dr. Porcari said in an interview. At the actual rate of caloric burn, without any change in diet it would take 19 workouts to lose one pound.
 Based on the three-times-a-week workout alone, then, ''it is impossible to lose up to 60 pounds in a year, as has been claimed,'' Dr. Porcari said. ''The women who do lose a lot of weight may be making other lifestyle changes as well.''
 Indeed, Ms. Greany said, ''in informal conversations, I learned that many Curves participants felt motivated to do something about their diets, and those who did lost a considerable amount of weight.''
 Marlys Ostrand, 70, who joined a Curves in Scandia, Minn., three years ago with a group of friends, said that in her two years in the group, she got stronger and lost 15 pounds ''I guess because I watched my diet a little more carefully.'' Although she had to drop out of the program because of a hip injury, she has maintained the weight loss.
 As for fitness improvement, the Wisconsin study rated Curves ''a moderate-intensity workout, similar to walking four miles an hour for 30 minutes on a flat treadmill.'' Unlike brisk walking, the Curves program works various parts of the body -- arms, shoulders, torso and legs. It ''is likely to be more of a total-body exercise,'' the researchers reported in the current ACE Fitness Matters.
 Ms. Greany said that if women did the workout three times a week, they could expect to increase strength, cardiovascular fitness and, if they did the stretching, flexibility as well.
 ''The results overall were very positive,'' Dr. Porcari told the ACE journal. ''People get their heart rates up into the training zone and they get the benefits of strength training, too, which you don't get from walking.''
 Susan Levy, 62, of Brooklyn, a longtime exercise walker and a former runner, joined Curves about 15 months ago in an awful winter when ice and snow kept her from too many of her daily walks around the park.
 ''I felt I needed something more,'' she said. And she said she got it: ''a congenial, pleasant workout with women of all ages, sizes, shapes, fatnesses, levels of fitness and a real ethnic mix.'' As someone who is not competitive -- ''I'm not trying to get better or faster at it'' -- and who's not the type to join a regular gym, Mrs. Levy said, ''It's fine for me, and I sort of like it.''
 She said she could continue to participate in Curves workouts even on vacations by getting passes from her local franchise to use elsewhere.

A Commercial Endeavor
 Curves, like other commercial endeavors, has its critics. The company, based in Waco, has a strong spiritual component, though this is not necessarily foisted on participants. 
 Like other companies, Curves, founded and owned by Gary Heavin, has developed some branded products, including workout shoes and vitamin supplements. 
 Ms. Greany said that ''because Curves offers a strong social component and is so accessible, adherence is probably a little better than you'd find in other fitness programs.'' She noted: ''The social component is good in moderation, though occasionally the women get distracted by conversation and don't work out as hard as they should. But if it keeps them coming back, it may be worth it.''
 Over all, she said, ''Curves is niche-filling for women who haven't done any physical activity and probably are unlikely to do any on their own.''
 The program has a joining fee ($150, sometimes reduced or waived during promotions) and a variable monthly fee ($29 to $69 is a typical range), in line with fees at many Y's, which are far better equipped. 
 Some employers and insurers offset the cost for participants, though there is a general belief in the industry that people who pay for fitness programs out of their own pockets are more likely to stick with them.
