HEADLINE: 2 Views of Buildings Around Grand Central: Special or Just Old

BYLINE: DAVID W. DUNLAP


HIGHLIGHT: Building Blocks: Two new position papers from organizations with opposing interests offer disparate answers to the question of whether any more buildings in east Midtown merit official landmark status. 

 BODY:
It is possible to look at the 80- and 90-year-old towers around Grand Central Terminal as buildings that give east Midtown the desirable luster of civic history. It is equally possible to look at them as the buildings that give east Midtown the deathly shroud of commercial obsolescence. (As the photos above are meant to show, it is also possible to see the buildings in either light.)
The Bloomberg administration is advancing an ambitious rezoning proposal for east Midtown (PDF) that would increase allowable building density and encourage developers to assemble large sites for enormous new office towers. To earn greater density, developers would pay for improvements to the pedestrian network. In some cases, they could build even denser buildings if their designs made what the City Planning Department called "a significant contribution to the skyline." 
But not if there are landmarks in the middle of the development sites.
So the question of whether any more buildings in east Midtown merit official landmark status - besides those that are already designated - is more than a preservation issue. It could affect the city's economy.
Two position papers released Wednesday answered the question quite differently.
In "Icons, Placeholders and Leftovers: Midtown East Report" (PDF), the Real Estate Board of New York and its allies in the Midtown21C coalition concluded, "The critical landmarks have been designated." They rejected every building identified by preservation groups as being worthy of landmark consideration.
"Landmarking runs the risk of slowing or stopping the fission process of continuous transformation that has created Midtown East," said the report, which was prepared by the consultants George E. Thomas and Susan Nigra Snyder of Philadelphia and Joel S. Weinstein, an engineer in New York.
"Any disruption in the process runs the risk of stalling or stopping development - and curtailing one of the great sources of real estate and wage taxes that pay the city's regional bills," the report said.
Besides that, the report said, a landmark designation can threaten the very building it is intended to protect, since masonry towers built before World War II suffer from the "inherent vice" of materials that have reached the end of their life spans or were assembled with insufficient safeguards against moisture, weathering and wear.
"Inherent vice threatens the integrity of a building," the report said, "and has the potential to destroy the economic basis of its use."
At the same time, in the other position paper, "East Midtown: A Bold Vision for the Future" (PDF), the Municipal Art Society of New York said that in the area to be rezoned, only 32 of 587 buildings were now landmarks, and that 17 other buildings were prime candidates for landmark status.
"Today's businesses want talent," the art society said in its report, "and increasingly, talent gravitates toward neighborhoods that are real places - with walkable streets, unique architecture, great restaurants and other opportunities for socializing and amusement."
"Older office buildings provide affordable, flexible space and close proximity to other businesses," the report continued, later adding: "The number and mix of business types are important for the economic health of the neighborhood. Yet the city's plan - with its emphasis on the need for large, column-free Class A floor-plates - contradicts these facts."
An east Midtown task force created by Community Boards 4, 5 and 6 is to meet Thursday to receive an update from the planning agency on the status of the rezoning proposal.
Six buildings on the Municipal Art Society's list have also been identified as landmark candidates by both the New York Landmarks Conservancy and the Historic Districts Council.
The Real Estate Board report dismissed each of them. For its analysis of the Yale Club, 50 Vanderbilt Avenue, the report borrowed the words of Christopher Gray, in The New York Times, who likened the building to a filing cabinet.
The design of the Pershing Square Building, 125 Park Avenue, "was old-fashioned even before it was finished," the report said. About 250 Park Avenue, also known as the Postum Building, it said, "This is the last of the uninspired group of World War I vintage buildings that missed the coming poetry of height."
Three towers on "Hotel Alley" were also disparaged in the report. It said the New York Marriott East Side, 525 Lexington Avenue, had experienced "a cascade of facade repairs affecting the unity and integrity of the exterior"; that the Lexington, 511 Lexington Avenue, suffered from extensive weather damage and inflexible floor layouts; and that the InterContinental New York Barclay, 111 East 48th Street, was "the most conservative of the hotels" along Lexington Avenue.
Official landmarks in the area already include the train terminal itself; the former New York Central Building to the north; St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, the Racquet Club, Lever House and the Seagram Building on Park Avenue; and the Chrysler Building, the Chanin Building and the former Socony-Mobil Building, at East 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue.

HEADLINE: How Much Does Race Still Matter?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: It depends on whom &#8212; and how &#8212; you ask. 

 BODY:
Earlier this month, I wrote about research by social scientists at Brown and the University of Michigan who reported that despite the fact that President Obama won a higher percentage of the white vote than any Democratic presidential nominee since 1976, racial resentment had increased during Obama's first term.
Over the past three weeks, a number of experts in race relations have brought contrary findings to my attention.

Seth K. Goldman and Diana Mutz of the University of Pennsylvania find that the Obama 2008 campaign, in and of itself, had a strong, positive impact on racial attitudes. The two have co-written a book, "The Obama Effect: How the 2008 Campaign Changed White Racial Attitudes," which will be released later this year by the Russell Sage Foundation. 
In October 2012, Goldman published a closely related paper in Public Opinion Quarterly arguing "that the Obama campaign produced a significant and substantive decline in white racial prejudice." Goldman compared the relatively sharp decline in prejudice during the last six months of the 2008 Obama campaign with the much slower reduction in prejudice over the previous 20 years, as measured by public opinion data from the American National Election Studies, the General Social Survey and the National Annenberg Election Study. 
Goldman points out that "the 'Obama Effect' was dramatic, reducing racial prejudice by a rate between 5 and 14 times faster than the secular [long-term] trend of decline in prejudice over the previous two decades." He provided Fig.1:
Standardized Change in White Racial Prejudice per 6-Month Period
Historically (1990-2008) and during the 2008 Campaign (July 2008-January 2009)
To measure levels of prejudice, Goldman used questions from the three surveys, asking whites to rate
whites and blacks on three scales, ranging from hardworking to lazy, intelligent to unintelligent, and trustworthy to untrustworthy.
The higher the score, the higher the level of prejudice.
The enormous television exposure of the public to Obama, both on news shows and in campaign commercials, was crucial to the decline in racial prejudice during the 2008 campaign, according to Goldman:
Throughout the campaign, innumerable images of Obama and his family contradicted negative racial stereotypes and changed the balance of black exemplars in mass media in a positive direction, thus causing reductions in prejudice among political television viewers.
It did not matter, Goldman found, whether stories about the Obama campaign appeared on conservative or liberal television shows; both Republican and Democratic commercials featuring Obama had a prejudice-diminishing effect: 
even exposure to conservative programs that criticized Obama's politics reduced prejudice because these programs nonetheless portrayed him as countering negative racial stereotypes.
Fig. 2 shows a sharp decline in prejudice among whites living in the 25 most contested states where the airwaves were saturated with political ads, compared with the much more modest changes in states that were not contested and thus not heavily advertised in:
Change in White Racial Prejudice in the Top and Bottom 25 States in Television Advertising Spending by the Obama Campaign.
Goldman reports that 
racial prejudice declined to a greater extent among McCain supporters, Republicans, and conservatives" than among Obama supporters, Democrats, and liberals "because exposure to a counter-stereotypical black exemplar should be most informative and surprising for those with more negative preexisting images of blacks. On the other hand, counter-stereotypical black exemplars should not provide much new information for those with already low levels of prejudice.
A separate study by the political scientists Susan Welch, of Penn State, and the late Lee Sigelman, of George Washington University, "The 'Obama Effect' and White Racial Attitudes," used data from the A.N.E.S. survey to measure racial prejudice and found a steady decline in prejudice beginning in 1992, when poll questions on the topic were first asked: 
Obama's emergence as an important figure in American politics, his candidacy, and his election did seem to accelerate that trend (as well as reflect it). Thus, Obama's pursuit of and election to the nation's highest office can be seen as one of those historical events - such as World War II, the civil rights movement, and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 - that move mass public opinion in a more egalitarian direction.
Welch and Sigelman write that 
on one hand, the Obama campaign enhanced the salience of race in general. On the other, his own characteristics in particular - his obvious intelligence, discipline, and interpersonal appeal - were made salient topics for media and public discussion.
They also note that
Obama is the type of black political leader who has been historically most popular among whites - one who was not part of the civil rights movement, who accommodates rather than confronts, and who maintains close personal and political ties to whites.
Welch and Sigelman find the strongest shifts in a positive direction to be among the youngest and oldest voters. The youngest voters, they argue, have fewer "deeply ingrained negative racial stereotypes" than older voters and their "views of African Americans in general were open to being shaped by the first 'new' national political leader that they encountered."
Welch and Sigelman suggest two possible factors to explain the diminution of bias among the oldest and historically most prejudiced voters. First, 
because Obama so clearly defied the racial stereotypes that had prevailed when older whites were growing up, he directly challenged their prejudices and caused many of them to rethink their image of blacks in general.
Second, 
Mortality is selective on education and cognitive functioning as well as on health. Thus, it may be selective on intolerance, directly or indirectly, because tolerance is related to education and cognitive functioning. If that were so, the older generation would become more tolerant as the number of its members shrinks. 
Fig. 3 gives five age cohorts of whites and their increasingly positive views of black Americans from 1992 to 2008 - the youngest, those who came of voting age during the presidencies of either Bill Clinton or George W. Bush, and the oldest, who first voted before the civil rights movement gained momentum and who had attained the age of at least 73 by 2008. Before the Obama campaign, older voters revealed more racial bias than other age groups. Those differences disappeared altogether by 2008 in terms of evaluating the work ethic of blacks and whites:
The findings of Goldman and Mutz, taken together with those of Welch and Sigelman, stand in contrast to the two studies I reported on Feb. 6. Michael Tesler of Brown and David Sears of U.C.L.A. (whose work I discussed) found that "racial resentment" became a stronger predictor of voters' negative assessments of the Democratic Party and of their likelihood of switching parties after Obama became the nominee than had been true in previous years. "Indeed," Tesler and Sears wrote, 
the effect of these attitudes on both general election vote preference in 2008 and presidential approval in April 2009 were considerably greater than they had been at any other time in the preceding decades.
I called Tesler up to ask him to ask him how his findings jibed with Goldman's demonstration of declining prejudice. He said that Goldman's work found that "the effects were very small." Tesler remains convinced that since Obama emerged as the Democratic nominee in the summer of 2008, "all racial measures are increasing in importance" and that divisions between blacks and whites are increasing. He does not hold back. "Obama," he told me, "has had a negative effect on racial polarization." 
As I noted on Feb. 6, Josh Pasek of the University of Michigan, Jon A. Krosnick of Stanford, and Trevor Tompson, the director of the Associated Press-National Opinion Research Center, have also produced research finding that from 2008 to 2012 there was a substantial increase in "explicit anti-black attitudes."
The difference between these conclusions and those of Goldman and Welch may rest upon the differently phrased survey questions on which they base their conclusions.
Goldman tallied survey responses to a battery of six questions from the A.N.E.S., G.S.S., and N.A.E.S. asking whites to rate both whites and blacks "on dimensions ranging from hardworking to lazy, intelligent to unintelligent, and trustworthy to untrustworthy."
Tesler, as I mentioned earlier, used a scale 
constructed from how strongly respondents agreed or disagreed with the following assertions: 1) Irish, Italian, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors. 2) Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class. 3) Over the past few years, blacks have gotten less than they deserve. 4) It's really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites.
The Tesler approach, which is deployed by a number of other scholars, has produced a contentious, and often bitter, dispute between warring camps within academia. 
The leading critics of the Tesler approach are Edward Carmines, a political scientist at the University of Indiana, and Paul Sniderman, a highly respected political scientist at Stanford. Together with Beth Easter, a doctoral candidate at Indiana University, they contend in a 2011 article, "On the Meaning, Measurement, and Implications of Racial Resentment" that "rather than being a measure of racism, racial resentment measures primarily racial policy attitudes." They make the case that Tesler is not measuring racism, but is instead essentially "asking respondents whether blacks need, require, or are entitled to help and assistance." 
If that is the case, Carmines and his colleagues argue, the questions used by Tesler are not just tapping into attitudes toward African-Americans, but are eliciting race-blind conservative support for self-reliance over dependence on government.
Obama's 2008 and 2012 victories lend weight to the optimistic assessments of Goldman and his collaborators. Tesler and Pasek to the contrary, there appears to be a far greater consensus, not only among political scientists but among strategists, candidates and the electorate at large, that race prejudice is in decline. 
Welch and Sigelman write:
Americans' racial attitudes have been driven by both demographic changes and specific events and trends. In most cases, these events and trends have moved opinions rather gradually in a more positive direction, but in some arenas, the shift has been minimal or even retrograde.
They go on to add that 
the gradual growth of the black middle class, the increase in the number of elected black officials at all levels of government, the growing presence of African Americans in prominent positions in business and the arts, and the rise in the political and economic prominence of members of other ethnic groups along with women of various races and ethnicities all have presumably propelled and reinforced the growth of more favorable attitudes toward African Americans. 
Are the Tesler and Goldman findings irreconcilable? Both are based on changing responses to different sets of poll questions. Race prejudice can and does decline, as documented by Goldman and Welch, while the salience of racial issues can increase, as shown by Tesler and Sears. Obama's candidacy inevitably brought race to the forefront, and the intense media focus on Obama and his family as "positive exemplars" forced many Americans to re-evaluate negative stereotypes.
The gains in 2008 were not irreversible, however. Goldman's more recent research shows that with the cessation of Obama's prominence in campaign advertisements, the end of the presidential election news cycle, and with the lowered profile of Michelle Obama and their two daughters, by the 2010 midterms, prejudice had shifted back to pre-2008 levels. 
As readers will recall, Republicans not only wrested back control of the House in 2010, but elected majorities in 54 state legislative chambers, the highest number since 1952, and won key gubernatorial contests in pivotal states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida.
While prejudice continues its decline at varying rates of speed, the more pressing question becomes: what will happen as Americans of all races adjust to the fact that Hispanics have displaced African-Americans as the nation's dominant minority, and now outnumber blacks 50.5 million to 37.7 million?
The United States faces the ascendance of racial and ethnic minorities when the political response to rising levels of debt is forcing adoption of austerity policies at every level of government. One dominant issue in the coming years will be the competition between urban blacks, Hispanics and whites over increasingly scarce government resources. These conflicts will concern not only attitudes but fundamentals: who gets medical care and who does not; which children go to quality schools and which do not; who has food security and who does not. 
Domestic racial and ethnic conflict, in turn, could well be subordinated to transnational turmoil as America's pre-eminence declines and as global competition for markets, for food, for energy, for high-tech professionals, for arable land and for sanctuaries from climate change intensify. 
How salient is race? I would say the ability of the United States to go from legal segregation a half century ago to the election of a black president suggests there is enormous elasticity in the American political system, and that the country has the capacity to deal with what it now faces, both inside and outside its borders.

HEADLINE: Is Answering Your Customers' Questions the Best Marketing Strategy?

BYLINE: YOU'RE THE BOSS EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Why don&#8217;t more businesses do what worked for Marcus Sheridan? 

 BODY:
In a small-business conversation we've just published, Marcus Sheridan talks about how the recession and its aftermath almost destroyed his pool business. By early 2009, orders had fallen at River Pools and Spas, a 20-employee installer of in-ground, fiberglass pools in Virginia and Maryland, from an average of six a month to barely two. That winter, four customers who had planned to install pools costing more than $50,000 each demanded their deposits back. For three weeks running, the company overdrew its bank account. 
But Mr. Sheridan managed to turn things around by taking an unconventional approach to marketing. He started putting information on his Web site that most pool builders - most business owners, in fact - are reluctant to divulge. He started talking about price. He acknowledged that some people had problems with fiberglass pools and that they were not for everyone. He published a list of the best pool builders in his area - and did not include his company on the list.
Please read the conversation to see how things worked out - and then tell us if you think this kind of approach might work for your business.

HEADLINE: A Fresh Look at China's Long March on Energy and Emissions

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A fresh look at China&#8217;s energy mix sees some progress on carbon dioxide, but a long path ahead. 

 BODY:
 March 5, 6:41 p.m. | The second "target" below has been updated. See addendum for original language. | 
The Rhodium Group consulting firm has released a "report card" on China's energy trends and policies that describes the country's intensifying efforts to increase the proportion of renewable sources like wind and hydroelectric dams and boost the efficiency of coal use (essentially the metric called "greenhouse gas intensity" by President George W. Bush). The blunting upward trajectory in the graph above reflects progress, but a long path ahead.
The report is directly related to yesterday's post laying out the view of the country's leadership, as articulated by climate strategist Zou Ji, on the need to balance China's response to global warming with its need to sustain economic advancement. The author of the report card, Trevor Houser, a former senior State Department adviser on international energy issues, told me he sees reasonable alignment between China's goals for the economy and emissions: 
Zou Ji mentions the challenges an industrializing economy faces in reducing emissions. Yet investment and industrial production are running out of steam as an engine of Chinese economic growth. The economic rebalancing Beijing is trying to engineer is capable by itself of achieving the country's energy-intensity and carbon-intensity reducing goals.
Here are the main points from his report: 
China's 12th Five Year Plan includes a bevy of energy targets Beijing hopes to achieve between 2011 and 2015. Late last week the country's National Bureau of Statistics released full-year energy supply and demand data for 2012, providing an early indicator on how China is doing two years into the plan. We've combed through the numbers, done the math, and offer a report card on Beijing's progress to date in achieving its big three energy ambitions.
 Target 1: Reduce the Energy-Intensity of the Economy by 16%: A slow-down in overall economic growth and, more importantly, a slow-down in energy-intensive industrial production, took its toll on energy demand in China in 2012. Coal and power consumption grew by only 2.5% and 5.5% respectively, down from 9.7% and 11.9% in 2011. That dragged overall energy demand growth down to 3.9% - the lowest level China's seen in more than a decade. While bad news for bulk commodity markets, it's good news for Chinese energy policymakers. Energy-intensity fell twice as fast in 2012 as in 2011, putting the country back on track to meet the 2015 target.
 Target 2: Increase Non-Fossil Energy to 11.4% of Total Supply [UPDATED]: Though overall power demand growth fell in 2012, the share of Chinese electricity generated from renewables increased from 15.7% to 19.4% thanks to a recovery in hydro and increased wind generation. Renewable and nuclear power combined accounted for 94% of all electricity generation growth in China in 2012. And preliminary estimates suggest the share of total energy supply from non-fossil sources increase from 8% to 8.5-9%. That's a significant improvement over 2011 when nuclear and renewables' share of energy consumption fell, but the gains of 2012 will be hard to repeat this year.
 Target 3: Cut the Carbon-Intensity of GDP by 17%: Slower energy demand growth combined with increased non-fossil energy supply curbed Chinese emissions growth in 2012. We estimate CO2 emissions rose by 3.2%, down from 9.3% year-on-year growth in 2011. That means the carbon-intensity of the Chinese economy declined by 4.3% - a welcome improvement over 2011 when it remained unchanged. But the carbon-intensity of Chinese GDP will need to fall even faster - by 4.6% a year between now and 2015 - to meet Beijing's 12th Five Year Plan commitment.
Read the rest here.
 March 5, 6:41 p.m. | Postscript | 
 After consulting with the China Energy Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Rhodium Group authors adjusted the second target listed above. For the record, here's the original language:
Target 2: Increase Non-Fossil Energy to 11.4% of Total Supply: Though overall power demand growth fell in 2012, the share of Chinese electricity generated from renewables increased from 15.7% to 19.4% thanks to a recovery in hydro and increased wind generation. Renewable and nuclear power combined accounted for 94% of all electricity generation growth in China in 2012. And preliminary estimates suggest the share of total energy supply from non-fossil sources increase from 8% to 9.9%. That puts Beijing in striking range of achieving its 11.4% target by 2015, though the big gains in 2012 will be tough to replicate this year.

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times and a look at the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times 

        
President Obama's trip to the Newport News shipyard in Virginia on Tuesday was intended to draw attention to the automatic budget cuts beginning Friday, which officials say would have a far bigger financial impact at home than abroad, Michael D. Shear and Thom Shanker report. Mr. Obama warned that private companies doing contract work for the military could begin to shed jobs amid an overall loss of economy activity.
 

        
The cuts will only accelerate what are already considered unusually severe cutbacks by the federal government, the nation's largest consumer and investor, Binyamin Appelbaum reports.

        
Federal immigration officials have arranged for hundreds of detainees to receive a supervised release in another highly unusual effort to save money as the so-called sequester cuts loom in Washington, Kirk Semple writes. Republicans called it a political gambit by the Obama administration that jeopardizes public safety and undermines negotiations over comprehensive immigration reform.

        
The Senate confirmed Chuck Hagel as defense secretary on Tuesday, approving him by the smallest margin for a defense secretary since the position was created, Jeremy W. Peters reports. Mr. Hagel's confirmation, along with the bipartisan support for Jack J. Lew to become Treasury secretary, suggests that the Republican blockade against the administration's second-term nominees is beginning to ease.
 Happenings in Washington 

        
President Obama will deliver remarks at the unveiling of a Rosa Parks statue at the Capitol.

        
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will speak with Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York and to the National Association of Attorneys General about reducing gun violence. Later, he and his wife, Jill Biden, will host a Black History Month reception at the Naval Observatory.

HEADLINE: The S.E.C. Nominee's Charm Campaign

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Mary Jo White, the S.E.C. nominee, is trying to quell concerns about potential conflicts of interest. | The Deal Professor examines risks of a financial transactions tax. | The head of JPMorgan Chase vowed to address the bank&#8217;s practice with Internet-based payday lenders. | Sheila C. Bair laments income inequality in an Op-Ed essay. 

 BODY:
Mary Jo White, President Obama's nominee to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, is trying to quell concerns about potential conflicts of interest as she approaches her Senate confirmation hearing. Facing questions about her lack of regulatory experience and her work defending Wall Street clients, Ms. White recently scheduled meetings with members of the Senate Banking Committee and answered a 20-page boilerplate questionnaire, DealBook's Ben Protess reports.
"As a government official, I believe I have an established track record and the reputation of being tough, but fair," Ms. White, who had a reputation as a tenacious prosecutor before going into private practice, said in the document. Her responses shed "new light on her list of Wall Street clients, including little-known work performed for HSBC's former chief executive," Mr. Protess writes. The document also "describes her ties to New York Democratic causes and laurels she earned both as a defense lawyer and federal prosecutor."
 Ms. White also vowed "as far as can be foreseen" never to return to her law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton. She had already agreed to recuse herself for one year from most matters involving former clients. 
While Ms. White's nomination is expected to receive Senate approval, some Democrats harbor reservations. They note that Ms. White's husband, John W. White, is co-chairman of the corporate governance practice at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, representing clients that the S.E.C. regulates. They also fear Ms. White's recusals may harm her ability to run the agency, Mr. Protess writes. In a meeting on Tuesday, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, pushed Ms. White to explain "whether her previous employment or her spouse's current employment could cause her to recuse herself from key business facing the S.E.C.," his spokesman said in a statement.
RISKS WITH A WALL STREET TAX | The proposal to levy a small tax on financial transactions appears, on the surface, to be a win for everyone involved. But recent history would suggest otherwise, Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. New York State has had such a tax for decades, although it has changed over the years and is now simply returned to traders immediately after being collected. Mr. Davidoff writes that a study of New York State's tax over the decades by Anna Pomeranets and Daniel G. Weaver "found that it increased the cost of capital for investors and reduced trading volume. Most important, they found the tax actually increased trading volatility by as much as 10 percent. Increasing volatility is exactly what advocates of the tax don't want."
In addition, Mr. Davidoff says, a tax on financial transactions raises the issue that traders may move elsewhere. "In 1984, Sweden adopted a financial transaction tax. Some 30 percent to 50 percent of the country's trading volume then shifted to Britain."
DIMON VOWS TO ADDRESS PRACTICES ON PAYDAY LOANS | 
JPMorgan Chase is among the big banks that allow Internet-based payday lenders to withdraw payments automatically from borrowers' accounts, even when customers want the withdrawals to stop, as The New York Times reported over the weekend. On Tuesday, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, addressed those concerns, calling the practice "terrible." He said at the bank's investor day that JPMorgan was examining the issue and would make changes, Jessica-Silver-Greenberg reports in The New York Times.
Mr. Dimon gave a shout-out to Ms. Silver-Greenberg, thanking her for bringing the issue to his attention, according to Heidi N. Moore, an editor at The Guardian. In the original article, Ms. Silver-Greenberg reported that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were examining banks' roles in the online loans.
ON THE AGENDA | Anheuser-Busch InBev and the Fortress Investment Group report earnings before the market opens. Groupon and J.C. Penney announce results on Wednesday evening. Ben S. Bernanke gives a report on monetary policy to the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. The Senate Agriculture Committee conducts a hearing about oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at 2:30 p.m. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, speaks in Munich at 12:30 p.m. On CNBC at 9 a.m. is James Woolery, co-head of JPMorgan's North American mergers and acquisitions business, who is headed to Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.
 BAIR ON INCOME INEQUALITY | Sheila C. Bair, the former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has an Op-Ed essay in The New York Times in which she laments growing income inequality in the United States. She lays the blame, in part, on the government.
"I am a capitalist and a lifelong Republican," Ms. Bair says. "I believe that, in a meritocracy, some level of income inequality is both inevitable and desirable, as encouragement to those who contribute most to our economic prosperity. But I fear that government actions, not merit, have fueled these extremes in income distribution through taxpayer bailouts, central-bank-engineered financial asset bubbles and unjustified tax breaks that favor the rich." As a possible remedy, she writes, "Republicans should put fundamental tax reform on the table and make it our priority to end preferential treatment of investment income, which lets managers of hedge funds pay half the tax rate of managers of shoe stores."

HEADLINE: Blaming the Victim

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The G.O.P. thinks it&#8217;s always up to the other side to make nice. 

 BODY:
The Senate Republicans who manufactured a crisis over the nomination of Chuck Hagel as Secretary of Defense are now saying that it is up to the newly confirmed Mr. Hagel to mend fences with Congress.
As Senator Kelly Ayotte, a member of the armed services committee, explained: "Traditionally, it's been a strong measure to have your secretary of defense have overwhelming bipartisan support, and he does not have that. So he's going to have to work extra hard to work with us on the committee."
Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the leaders of the attack on Mr. Hagel over fictional propositions (like he doesn't support Israel, which of course he does) said Mr. Hagel has to "up his game" and "prove to Congress that he's capable of doing his job." 
If that sounds ridiculous, that's because it is. The Senate confirmed Hagel on Tuesday afternoon, 58-41, suggesting a majority thinks he's capable of doing his job.
But that's the Republican way. It's always up to the other side to make nice, usually by doing exactly what the G.O.P. wants.
After President Obama defeated Mitt Romney in the 2012 elections, Congressional leaders called on Mr. Obama to "show leadership" on fiscal and economic issues. What they meant was that he should drop the policies he espoused during the campaign - mixing revenue increases with careful spending reductions - and join Republicans in a frenzy of cost-cutting.
When House Speaker John Boehner double-crossed Mr. Obama in those talks and came up with Plan B (raising taxes only for the 18 people who make more than $1 million), which his own caucus rejected, Mr. Boehner blamed the president. "What we've offered meets the definition of a balanced approach, but the president is not there yet," Mr. Boehner said last December.
Now that Washington and state governments are facing sharp cuts to all kinds of programs - including aid to the poorest Americans and important military programs - due to the sequestration process that Mr. Obama wants to stop, the Republicans are ... blaming Mr. Obama.
Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana led a chorus of complaint from the National Governors Association after a meeting with the president on Monday. He said Mr. Obama was trying to "scare" Americans about looming spending cuts (which, by the way, are pretty scary). ""I think the president needs to show leadership," Jindal told reporters outside the White House.
The problem is that the president has shown leadership. He has put forward a compromise plan - which the Republicans won't accept. This is not an "everyone is to blame situation." The Republicans in Congress are the ones who are refusing to budge on their no-taxes position, creating the current stalemate.
A new poll by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal shows that Americans trust Democrats more than Republicans on pretty much any issue you care to name: Medicare; health care; gun violence; Social Security; energy; immigration; taxes and the economy. The Republican Party's image is at a new low - it's out of touch, too extreme and resistant to change.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths POLAYES, MADELEINE F.

 BODY:
POLAYES--Madeleine F.,longtime Upper West Side community leader and activist, died at her home on February 25. A woman of exceptional capability, her life was dedicated to improving the lives of others. Madeleine, a teacher and guidance counselor, ran an experimental program for autistic children (1953-1954), and worked with Kings County Hospital to create a program to integrate them into the mainstream school system. From 1955-1963 she ran the Madeleine School on the Upper West Side, and from 1963-1992 was a teacher and guidance counselor in the public school system. 
In 1975, she transferred to P.S. 7, located in a Brooklyn neighborhood afflicted with high crime rates and drug abuse. Madeleine took a majority of the worst cases of child abuse to court, where she rarely lost, and thereby safeguarded the lives of many children. She retired in 1992. Nor were her activities and achievements confined to education. Madeleine was equally successful as an affordable housing developer and manager. From 1958-l965, she served on the Mayor's Committee on Urban Renewal. In 1960, she founded the Stryckers' Bay Neighborhood Council, and organized the Stryckers' Bay Housing Corporation, the developer of a Mitchell-Lama cooperative that opened in 1965. In 1969, she built Turin House, a moderate-income cooperative. In 1981, when a proposal for a massive development of the Penn Yards was announced, Madeleine organized the Coalition Against Lincoln West (CALW), which successfully defeated the plan for high-rise towers facing the Hudson River from 59th to 72nd Streets. CALW later expanded its scope of interest and became the Coalition for a Liveable West Side, which researches and studies many of the issues challenging the area, among them, overdevelopment, the environment, and traffic and pedestrian safety. In 1986, with development accelerating, she commissioned a Columbia University Urban Studies program to research the need for a master plan for development of the Upper West Side Based on the findings, Community Board 7 asked the City Planning Commission to request proposals for such a plan, but the CPC did not act. Madeleine served as president of the Federation of West Side Block Associations, and as a director and president of the Broadway Malls Association, which beautifies the malls with trees and flowers, many funded by neighborhood businesses. Madeleine Polayes was born on September 3, 1926. She earned a B.A. at the University of Connecticut, an M.A. at Columbia University, and a Ph.D. at Bank Street College. She was predeceased by her husband, Sillik Polayes, an attorney and activist. She is survived by her daughter, Debbie P. Christensen (Alan) and granddaughters Rebecca and Janet, and her son, Jonathan (Joan) and grandsons Jason and Justin. The funeral service will be held at the Riverside Chapel, 76 Street and Amsterdam Avenue, at 9:30 Friday morning. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Crohn's Disease Foundation, 380 Park Avenue South, NY 10016, or the Coalition for a Livable West Side, P.O. Box 230078 NY 10023.

HEADLINE: Stéphane Hessel, 95, Author and Activist

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER and MAÏA de la BAUME

 BODY:
Stéphane Hessel, a hero of the French Resistance who, more than 60 years later as a nonagenarian, marshaled the same defiant spirit in a manifesto that inspired social protesters in Europe and the United States and became an international publishing phenomenon, died on Tuesday in Paris. He was 95.
His death was confirmed by his son Antoine, a cardiologist. 
Mr. Hessel's life had many notable chapters, including a childhood peopled by European intellectuals, an escape from a German concentration camp, and stints as a diplomat at the United Nations and elsewhere.
But he was not widely known until October 2010, when he published ''Indignez-Vous!'' -- a 4,000-word pamphlet that urged young people to revive the flame of resistance to injustice that burned in himself and others during World War II, this time in peaceful rebellion against what he termed the dictatorial forces of international capitalism, and to reassert the ideal that the privileged class must help the less fortunate rise.
In particular, Mr. Hessel's diatribe took aim at France's treatment of illegal immigrants, the influence on the news media by the rich, the shrinking social safety net and, especially, Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.
The book, 29 pages (only 14 of text), held together by two staples and released by a two-person publishing house out of an attic office, had an original print run of 8,000. But it struck a chord with young people distressed by the policies of the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy.
It became a popular stocking-stuffer gift at Christmas from left-leaning parents to their children, and it was taken up as a rallying cry by protesters across Europe responding to the economic crisis. Young Spanish activists called themselves ''indignados.''
Translated into more than a dozen languages, it sold more than three million copies in Europe in less than a year; in July 2011, translated into English, it was published in the United States as ''Time for Outrage!'' and became a hand-around for participants in the Occupy Wall Street movement.
''When something outrages you, as Nazism did me, that is when you become a militant, strong and engaged,'' he wrote. ''You join the movement of history, and the great current of history continues to flow only thanks to each and every one of us.''
In addition to fame, ''Indignez-Vous!'' brought significant criticism to Mr. Hessel -- from those who felt his screed was merely indignant and not in any way prescriptive and especially from those who disagreed with his views on Israel and the Palestinians. Mr. Hessel, whose father was Jewish but whose mother was not, said in interviews that he was a lover and defender of Israel, but he was still accused of anti-Semitism.
Stéphane Hessel was born in Berlin in 1917. His father, Franz, a German writer and translator, had lived for many years in Paris, where he met and befriended Henri-Pierre Roché, an artist and writer, and Helen Grund, a German art student, who would become his wife and Stéphane's mother. When the boy was still a toddler, the family returned to Paris, where Helen took up with Roché, and a three-way love affair ensued, becoming the basis for Roché's 1953 novel, ''Jules et Jim,'' later adapted by François Truffaut into the well-known film.
The Parisian society the family joined included the poet André Breton, the sculptor Alexander Calder, and the photographer Man Ray. The artist Marcel Duchamp taught the young Stéphane to play chess. As a teenager, he met Jean-Paul Sartre.
''Sartre came into my life when I was 17, at the time his first novels were published,'' he said in a 2012 interview for the English-language Israeli Web site Haaretz. ''His message was very clear: 'You must devote your responsibility, you become a human being only when you feel your responsibility.' ''
In 1941, after France fell to the Nazis and the year his father died, Mr. Hessel escaped to London, where he met Charles de Gaulle, eventually joining the resistance movement. In March 1944, he returned to Paris on a mission to contact underground activists, but was captured and tortured by means now known as waterboarding, surviving, he said, by giving out false information.
He was subsequently sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp, where he escaped hanging by exchanging identities with a French soldier who had died of typhoid fever. Sent to a different camp, he managed to escape and return to Paris, which had by then been liberated.
After the war, Mr. Hessel became a diplomat, working as an official for the newly formed United Nations, where he participated in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948. He later held diplomatic posts in Algeria and Vietnam.
Mr. Hessel is survived by his wife, Christiane Hessel-Chabry, and three children from an earlier marriage.
Mr. Hessel wrote or contributed to several other books, including a 1997 autobiography, ''Danse Avec le Siècle'' (''Dance With the Century''). He was a defender of the European Union, and he befriended French politicians of the left, including the current president, François Hollande. Mr. Hollande described Mr. Hessel on Tuesday as ''a great figure whose exceptional life was dedicated to defending human dignity.''

HEADLINE: In South Bronx, Legal Aid And Shoulders to Lean On

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
A sprawling, sunny room beckons invitingly with black couches and bright accent pillows for relaxing, bookshelves with novels to borrow for an hour or a week, a pair of children's tables, outlets for recharging cellphones and free coffee.
This is the newest hub for justice in the South Bronx: a public defenders' office that looks more like a living room than a legal quarter of last resort. 
The Bronx Defenders opened its reception center with a ribbon-cutting on Wednesday attended by about 100 people, including the Bronx borough president, judges, and clients on the ground floor of an affordable-housing complex at 360 East 161st Street, near Melrose Avenue, several blocks from the Bronx criminal and civil courthouses.
The center, in the Melrose neighborhood, is part of a $2.6 million expansion by the Bronx Defenders from a single building to what it calls a three-building Justice Campus to accommodate its growing caseload.
''You can get comfortable here and talk about your problems,'' said Rahysha Ortega, 20, who settled on a couch with a book to wait to discuss a dispute with her landlord. Her 3-month-old son slept beside her.
Robin G. Steinberg, the executive director, said the new office reflected the growth of the operation as well as its focus on ''holistic defense,'' which seeks to help people not only with the criminal charges they face but also with other aspects of their lives, like fighting eviction and securing welfare benefits. ''It's really important for advocates in the criminal justice system to understand the context in which our clients survive,'' she said.
The Bronx Defenders, which started in 1997 with a staff of eight, has grown to 190 lawyers and advocates in 10 specialties, from immigration law to parent advocacy. It handles 28,000 criminal cases a year -- up from 12,500 in 2011 -- and an additional 2,000 family and civil court cases. It is one of several nonprofit organizations in the city that provide free legal help for those who cannot afford a lawyer.
With an annual budget of $19 million, the Bronx Defenders is supported by government money, foundation grants and private gifts. Since 2010, it has also received more than $500,000 from the Justice Department to teach its holistic defense model to public defenders in other cities, including Baltimore, Charlotte, N.C., and Berkeley, Calif.
Byran Davis, 49, an unemployed baker, said he had passed the center at first because he mistook it for a day care center or a public library. Once there, he sat back on a couch to wait for someone to help him renew his $200 monthly food stamp benefits -- renewal is a service offered to people even if they are not being represented in court. ''It looks nice,'' Mr. Davis said with a smile. ''And it's quiet -- there's no shouting and screaming.''
Down the hall, there was a mock-trial courtroom where two lawyers were preparing a case with a defendant. There were also offices for meetings and one for teleconferencing with clients being held on Rikers Island.
When Ms. Steinberg spied a familiar face coming through the door, she ran over and gave the woman a hug. ''What's going on?'' Ms. Steinberg asked, and then corrected herself: ''Well, something's always going on.''
The woman, Diane Nelson, found the Bronx Defenders more than a decade ago after being charged with attempted arson. She said she had tried to set a fire in her apartment because her landlord had refused to make repairs. After serving 3 ½ years in prison in upstate New York, Ms. Nelson returned to the Bronx, and to her defenders. They have been helping her ever since to qualify for benefits, find jobs and housing, and sort out her complicated life.
Ms. Nelson's social worker acted as a birthing coach for her fourth baby. Her housing advocate tutored her in math when she took community college classes. And when Ms. Nelson tried a culinary class, she baked birthday cakes for the staff.
''I can't find anyplace better,'' said Ms. Nelson, 36, with an approving glance around the new center. ''When my kids come here now, they'll have some place to sit down.''

HEADLINE: As Castro Era Drifts to Close, A New Face Steps In at No. 2

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE and VICTORIA BURNETT; Damien Cave reported from Mexico City, and Victoria Burnett from Havana. Alain Delaquérière contributed research from New York.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- He may have just taken on the toughest job in Cuba. Rivals at home will try to take him down. Enemies abroad will discredit him. Almost anyone with an interest in Cuba -- including American spies and Cuban intelligence officers -- will dig through his public and private lives, rummaging for secrets or clues about his plans.
All the while, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, 52, the top contender to succeed the Castros after more than half a century of their rule, will need to display the authority of a future president while acting as if he does not want the job, maintaining the submissiveness and loyalty that the Castros require.
''It's going to be a challenge,'' said Brian Latell, a former C.I.A. agent who monitored Fidel Castro's speeches for years and continues to track Raúl Castro as an outside analyst. ''The record of the Cuban revolution is littered with the names of people who were thought to be No. 3 or 2 and all of them fell by the wayside, going back to Che Guevara.'' 
Though a stranger to many Cubans, Mr. Díaz-Canel suddenly became the chosen one when he was promoted to first vice president on Sunday as Raúl Castro, 81, announced he would retire after his current five-year term ended in 2018.
Mr. Díaz-Canel replaced José Ramón Machado Ventura, 82, and became one of the youngest members of Cuba's political hierarchy. His elevation raised the curtain on an epic drama that had been envisioned dozens of times over the decades. Leader after leader has been mentioned as the next president of Cuba but now, with the Castro era drifting to a close, all the attention is focused on Mr. Díaz-Canel, who has been thrust into what experts describe as the most scrutinized leadership role in the country since Fidel Castro took power in 1959.
Several high-placed young guns who had been auditioning for the job have been banished from government since Fidel Castro fell ill and retired in 2006. Some were accused of corruption, others of disloyalty in the form of vulgar jokes (surreptitiously recorded) about Fidel Castro's health and Raúl Castro's political capabilities.
One of those sent packing off in an earlier purge -- the Cuban expression is ''plan pajama'' -- is an old boss of Mr. Díaz-Canel's from their days at the Union of Communist Youth: Roberto Robaina, a brilliant mathematician and former foreign minister who can now be found painting or hanging out at his Havana restaurant, Chaplin's Cafe.
But unlike others floated as possible future leaders, Mr. Díaz-Canel has managed to be officially anointed as the successor. No one else can claim that distinction, not even Che, Fidel Castro's right-hand man during the revolution. And though much about Mr. Díaz-Canel remains a mystery, what is known suggests that Rául Castro made the selection. Mr. Díaz-Canel, though clearly an avowed loyalist, has little in common with Fidel Castro, in personality or outlook. He seems instead a younger, more casual version of Raúl.
Like Raúl, he is known for being funny and warm in small groups, and more demure when speaking to crowds. An engineer, he also shares with Raúl a hefty respect for competence over ideology, and an antipathy to showy appearances. While Fidel Castro took power riding a tank into Havana, Mr. Díaz-Canel is well known within Communist Party circles for riding his bike to work when he served as the top official in the province of Villa Clara. He was born there in a lush central region of sweet-smelling mills and pristine coastal keys on April 20, 1960. His father worked for a brewery and his mother was a primary school teacher, according to someone close to the family who did not want to be identified talking about the private life of a government official.
The insider said that Mr. Díaz-Canel was a keen chess player as a child and an avid reader. He is on Facebook, looking casual in a photograph with relatives, but online there are few examples of his published commentary.
He appears to have maintained a down-to-earth approach throughout his career. After graduating from the Central University of Las Villas in 1982, he served in the military for a few years, then slowly moved up the Communist Party ranks. While others behaved like bureaucrats, he had a touch of the mod, wearing his blondish hair long and listening to rock 'n' roll.
''He used to be very popular among women, perceived as handsome, tall, 'cool,' '' said Domingo Amuchastegui, a former Cuban official living outside Cuba, who briefly met Mr. Díaz-Canel early in their careers. ''Even my daughter -- who now lives in Ireland -- remembers him as superpopular among young people in the '80s.''
Little is known about his personal life now; a woman named Lis Cuesta who works for Paradiso, a government agency that promotes cultural tourism, said that she was his wife, closing the door of their two-story home in western Havana without offering more. Neighbors said he lived a simple life and played baseball in a park nearby. A family insider said he has two children from an earlier marriage.
His reputation for pragmatism and competence, the traits that won him favor with Raúl Castro, began to emerge more recently. As a senior official in Villa Clara and then in Holguin, he worked closely with military leaders as they built hotels and brought in foreign investment. Analysts and former officials say he is a manager, not an innovator.
''It confirms the gradualism of Raúl's approach,'' said Geoff Thale, program director for the Washington Office on Latin America, referring to the modest but notable steps that Raúl Castro has taken to open up the Cuban economy. ''I don't think there's any evidence that he is someone looking to bring rapid or dramatic change to Cuba's political or economic system.''
Mr. Díaz-Canel appears to be someone who can win people to his side, as Raúl Castro has done in pushing through halting efforts at reform. And like Raúl Castro, Mr. Díaz-Canel is used to institutional resistance.
He overcame opposition to his appointments in Holguin, then became minister of higher education in 2009. The academic elite in Cuba initially scorned him for lacking a Ph.D. But according to several accounts, he impressed them by doing less dictating than listening. ''He was always asking questions,'' said a former researcher at the University of Holguin, who fled Cuba a few months ago. ''He always wanted to know what was going on.''
Raúl Castro has mostly praised him for his hard work, and his ''ideological firmness'' -- more than enough to attract the ire of anti-Castro Cuban-Americans who have already criticized him for being a Castro protégé. American officials have expressed skepticism, noting that the top-down selection of a new leader does not amount to democracy.
Mr. Díaz-Canel may in fact find himself on a lonely perch if he manages to seize the top job. He will be surrounded by pent-up demands for more significant change, but without the heft attributed to the Castros and the revolutionaries who fought with them. ''He will have to watch his back,'' Mr. Latell said. He will also have to improve or reinvent a Communist system built on moral rather than financial incentives, pushing thousands to flee every year for more freedom and opportunity.
''It is about redesigning the entire system, from top to bottom, saving those positive achievements, including full sovereignty, while throwing away the disastrous economic apparatus of the state, the institutional centralism and all forms of intolerance, rigidity, and the abuse of power,'' Mr. Amuchastegui said. ''It means reaching a form of political pluralism that is more effective and representative.''
Mr. Díaz-Canel has a chance to shape his own image. Of about a dozen people questioned on the streets of Havana about the new heir apparent, only half could name him. ''He's a new generation -- that's enough for me,'' said Alberto, a security guard in his 40s who declined to give his full name because discussing the Cuban leadership is sensitive.
And yet, there are hints Mr. Díaz-Canel has been preparing for his role. In a speech last February to educators from around the world at the Karl Marx Theater in Havana, he talked about the need to ''undergo transformation'' and highlighted a maxim from Cuba's most famous thinker, José Martí. Discussing the future, Mr. Díaz-Canel reached for a quote from 1894: ''Seeing afterwards is worthless. Foreseeing is what really counts ... and being ready.''

HEADLINE: Still Raging Loudly, Headbanging Included

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
Conor Oberst half-apologized for the ''very pessimistic'' and ''very sarcastic'' songs of his band Desaparecidos when they performed at Webster Hall on Tuesday night. But he knew that sarcasm, pessimism and rage are the essence of Desaparecidos' songs, which proudly and knowingly join the tradition of punky protest music. 
Between albums with Bright Eyes, Mr. Oberst's main songwriting outlet since the 1990s, Desaparecidos appeared in 2002 with their only album, ''Read Music/Speak Spanish.'' It was a loud, raw-voiced yet thoroughly melodic tirade against materialism and corporate exploitation, against a culture with wealth as its only aspiration:
''I'm overflowing with ambition but I got to keep in mind/The bottom line is the dollar sign,'' Mr. Oberst blurted in a song called ''$$$$.''
After a decade of economic crisis, stagnation and increasing income inequality those songs haven't gone out of date. The sound of the album, infusing the unkempt urgency of the Clash with the muscle of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, clearly influenced 21st-century indie-rockers like Titus Andronicus and Gaslight Anthem.
''Read Music/Speak Spanish'' was also apparently memorable for listeners. At Webster Hall a good part of the audience sang along on the album's songs.
Desaparecidos (The Disappeared) have regrouped sporadically since 2010 -- often to perform for a cause -- and released a handful of newer, more directly topical songs, like ''MariKKKopa,'' about mistreatment of immigrants in Arizona and elsewhere, and ''The Left Is Right,'' an echo of Occupy Wall Street: ''If one must die to save the 99/Maybe it's justified.'' On Tuesday, in a set lasting just over an hour, Desaparecidos played the entire album and all their newer songs, along with one from the Clash and one from an opening act, Joyce Manor, who joined Desaparecidos onstage to share ''Constant Headache.''
Desaparecidos have been, like all of Mr. Oberst's projects, both heartfelt and openly self-conscious, questioning any self-righteousness and admitting the singer's own place in a consumer market. At Webster Hall Mr. Oberst joked about offering a 20 percent discount on one song, and introduced another -- ''Backsell,'' about the state of the recording business -- by dedicating it to his business staff. He also turned serious, dedicating ''Anonymous'' -- a barreling tribute to the hacker group and WikiLeaks -- to Pfc. Bradley Manning, who is awaiting trial for supplying material to WikiLeaks.
Mr. Oberst is not, after many years as a bandleader, a guileless punk novice. He shouted his way through the songs and interspersed his between-song banter with four-letter words, because that's what punk as a genre requires. Band members did as much headbanging as they could. (The audience did its part too, churning and moshing and crowd surfing.)
Yet the songs, even with the instruments cranked up, weren't simplistic. They had tidy lead-guitar hooks and built-in dynamic surges. But for Desaparecidos professionalism only stoked the passion in the songs. This pose came across as honest.

HEADLINE: EADS Profit Soars 19 Percent for 2012

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
PARIS -- European Aeronautic Defense & Space, the parent company of Airbus, reported on Wednesday a 19 percent increase in net profit for 2012, propelled by sales of commercial jets and helicopters, while its military business continued to struggle as budget pressures squeezed U.S. and European defense spending.
EADS, which is based in Toulouse, France, said earnings for the full year climbed to &#x20ac;1.2 billion, or $1.56 billion, from just over &#x20ac;1 billion in 2011, on a 15 percent rise in revenue, to &#x20ac;56.5 billion. The company proposed an increase to its 2012 dividend to 60 euro cents per share from 45 cents in 2011. 
Almost all of the group's revenue gains came from double-digit growth in sales of civilian aircraft, while military orders stalled. Airbus, which increased its commercial jet sales 19 percent, represented 68 percent of group revenue, little changed from a year earlier.
The persistent weakness of the group's military business comes as EADS is steeped in a fundamental review of its business strategy. A proposed merger with BAE Systems of Britain failed last year amid political divisions among Germany, France and Britain.
Much of the logic behind the merger project was based on the expectation that a combination with BAE Systems, a major contractor to the U.S. government, the world's biggest spender on military equipment, would help to bring greater balance between commercial and military activities.
At a briefing in Berlin, Thomas Enders, the chief executive, said EADS expected to share the outlines of its new strategy around the middle of the year. But he hinted strongly that the group was no longer wedded to its previous target of generating at least 40 percent of its revenue from its military business by 2020.
Given the current budget constraints facing Western governments, Mr. Enders said, ''it's probably not such a bad thing to have rather less exposure to the defense market.'' He said that EADS's main U.S. rival, Boeing, which derives 40 percent to 50 percent of its revenue from military sales, was growing increasingly reliant on its civilian aircraft business as well.
''Right now, I am quite happy with the imbalance we have,'' Mr. Enders said. ''We are under less pressure than other, pure defense companies.''
EADS began a restructuring last year of its Cassidian unit, which groups most of its military activities, including Eurofighter, the EADS-led consortium that builds the Typhoon fighter jet. Operating profit at the unit, which announced 850 job cuts last year, plunged 57 percent to &#x20ac;142 million, in large part because of nearly &#x20ac;200 million in charges linked to the restructuring.
Analysts warned that the outlook for EADS's military business was likely to get worse before it got better. ''There is clearly the risk of more of this to come as France and Germany have only just begun the process of addressing their defense budgets,'' Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst with Agency Partners in London, wrote in a note to clients.
Mr. Enders emphasized that EADS would remain a ''major player'' in the military sectors, but said the group was taking a close look at which aspects of its activities -- besides fighter aircraft includes missiles, surveillance and cybersecurity systems -- were likely to be most profitable in future years.
''Our defense business is not negligible,'' Mr. Enders said. ''We will focus on those areas where we have a comparative advantage and where we know we can make money.''
EADS predicted that its commercial aircraft business would continue to have steady growth this year and said it did not expect any major disruption to global air traffic as a result of the economic slowdown and lingering sovereign debt crisis in Europe. It expects Airbus to sell about 700 new jets this year, down from 914 planes in 2012. Aircraft deliveries are expected to increase slightly to 600-610 jets, from 588 last year, after the company stepped up production of its popular single-aisle A320 planes in October to 42 planes a month from 38 planes.
While the group's net cash position increased slightly last year to &#x20ac;12.3 billion from &#x20ac;11.7 billion at the end of 2011, analysts warned that the ramp-up of the development of Airbus's A350 XWB wide-body jet was likely to draw down those cash reserves over the next year. EADS said the production schedule for the A350, which has a late-2014 target for entry into service, remained ''challenging'' and cautioned that unforeseen delays could lead to fresh provisions to compensate airline customers.
Airbus this month abandoned a plan to use a lightweight, high-power lithium-ion battery on board the A350 amid continued uncertainty regarding an investigation into what caused similar batteries installed on Boeing's rival 787 Dreamliner to ignite or emit smoke. Airbus said it would adapt its design to use a conventional nickel-cadmium battery instead in order to avoid any possible delays linked to the safety certification of the technology by aviation regulators.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong's Predicament Is How to Spend All That Money

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- As the United States prepares for mandatory budget cuts on Friday, Hong Kong is grappling with a very different problem: spending money as fast as it sluices into government coffers.
John Tsang, the financial secretary of Hong Kong, the semiautonomous Chinese territory, presented on Wednesday a budget that calls for a long list of one-time subsidies, particularly for the poor and aging. He also said the government would waive business registration fees and reduce the profits tax, particularly for small businesses.
The stimulus measures come after heavy criticism in Hong Kong that the government consistently produces large budget surpluses even during periods of weak economic growth, including the last year. The Hong Kong economy grew only 1.4 percent last year, well below its average of 4.5 percent over the last decade. 
Hong Kong consistently runs budget surpluses mainly because it has low social spending and no military. By comparison, the federal government in the United States dedicates roughly half its spending to assisting the aging -- through Social Security, Medicare and the nursing home portion of Medicaid -- and directs another quarter of spending to the military.
The Hong Kong government is now sharply increasing social spending in percentage terms but from such a low base that spending still falls short of revenue. After years of accumulated surpluses, the city is sitting on cash accumulated from previous surpluses equal to 23 months' total spending.
Some of the heaviest criticism of previous budgets has come from advocates speaking on behalf of what are known locally as the ''multiple have-nots.'' These are low-income residents, often young, who have not been on the waiting list long enough to qualify for public rental housing, so they do not qualify for a two-month rent waiver that Mr. Tsang announced on Wednesday.
They are not older citizens, so they do not qualify for the extra month of old-age allowance payments that Mr. Tsang also announced, nor are they destitute enough to qualify for the extra month of welfare payment that was announced. And they live in shared apartments where they may not benefit directly from the government's $230 subsidy in the coming fiscal year for each residential electricity bill.
To help them, Mr. Tsang announced that the government would give an extra $1.9 billion to the government-controlled Community Care Fund, which does social work like rent assistance.
''I have every confidence that we will be able to assist more people in need, particularly that group of people who used to complain that they were being left out from the budget relief measures -- the so-called multiple have-nots,'' Carrie Lam, the territory's chief secretary, said Wednesday.
Marcellus Wong, a senior adviser in the Hong Kong office of PricewaterhouseCoopers, a global professional services firm, noted that Mr. Tsang's figures showed that government expenditures have risen twice as fast as economic output over the last 15 years, and expenditures are creeping above one-fifth of output. ''The government needs to closely monitor this benchmark,'' he said.
The Hong Kong government uses conservative budget forecasts, consistently predicting small deficits that turn into large surpluses. The government predicted a year ago that it would run a deficit of $449 million for the fiscal year through the end of March, but its most recent estimate is that it will now run a surplus of $8.3 billion instead, and Mr. Wong predicted that the final figure would be a surplus of more than $9 billion.
For the coming fiscal year, Mr. Tsang again predicted a deficit of $628 million.
Social spending has stayed low until now partly because Hong Kong has a single-payer government health care system with low pay for doctors and nurses by American standards, and with supplemental charges and waiting lists for expensive medical procedures. But recurrent social spending is on track to rise 33 percent in the coming year, mainly because the government is introducing a monthly payment of $282 to all low-income residents 65 and older.
Hong Kong has also begun gradually building a mandatory retirement savings system based on bank-managed mutual funds. But many of the current older citizens retired before it was started and do not benefit. Many current workers have had extremely low returns on their savings because of annual fees of 2 percent of assets or more.
Families have tended to look after aging members, further limiting social spending for the government.
In western Hong Kong island, an area with a large population of older residents, four elderly people on the street each said in interviews on Wednesday that they did not expect much money from the government because they lived with their children, who supported them.
A fifth resident, Wu Jinyao, a retired construction worker who is recovering from oral cancer, did complain that the government was too frugal in only promising an extra month's payment of disability allowances in the coming fiscal year starting on April 1. He said he had high medicine and transportation costs to go to a distant government hospital for continued chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
''I have been to the various government agencies and they tell me to come back when I am down to my last 500 Hong Kong dollars,'' or about $64, he said. ''What system is this?''

HEADLINE: Interest Rises in Islamic Bonds

BYLINE: By SARA HAMDAN

 BODY:
DUBAI -- Islamic bonds, or sukuk, have long been popular with investors in the Middle East. Now they are being discovered in Europe and the United States. When the Dubai government issued a $500 million, 10-year sovereign Islamic bond, last month, 38 percent of it was snapped up by Western investors, according to research by Standard & Poor's.
''European problems helped fuel demand for alternative products like sukuk in emerging markets, which is why we're seeing a strong wave of interest coming in from Western investors lately,'' said Mohammed Dawood, managing director of debt capital markets for HSBC's Islamic banking division. 
As economies in European and other advanced countries struggle, a growing pool of investors is considering alternative investments in emerging markets. Sukuk are possible vehicles for investing in Gulf Arab countries and some Asian countries.
Islamic principles forbid paying interest, so Islamic bonds are designed to provide investors with profits through other mechanisms like capital gains. Sukuk rules also forbid investing in activities that involve gambling, alcohol, or pork-related industries.
The sukuk market has improved but it still has its problems. The market is thin compared to gigantic western bond markets. Also the standardization of the religious compliance aspects of these securities needs work, analysts say.
''The Gulf's Islamic bond market still needs more depth with private sector issuers and a wider spread of maturities at the sovereign level to support a domestic yield curve,'' said Khalid Howladar, an Islamic finance analyst at Moody's Investors Service.
Malaysia is the dominant sukuk market, handling 74 percent of the $135 billion Islamic bond issuance in 2012. Still, last year saw more sukuk being issued than conventional bonds in Gulf Cooperation Council countries eager for a larger share of the market.
While Malaysia continues to dominate the sukuk market with 74 percent to new issues last year, 2012 also saw sukuk outpacing conventional bonds in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. They are eager for a larger share of the $135 billion Islamic bond market.
New sukuk from the Middle East and North Africa came to $26.3 billion in 2012, a 34.4 percent jump from the year before, driven by heightened activity in Saudi Arabia, according to research from Kuwait Finance House.
Saudi Arabia alone accounted for $10.5 billion of these instruments -- nearly three times the amount the year before. This included the kingdom's first sovereign sukuk last May, worth 15 billion Saudi Riyals, or about $4 billion.
Large issues by the Dubai government and some of the biggest Saudi companies in the last two months have led analysts to predict that this year could be the busiest for the Gulf region's Islamic bond market since the financial markets crisis in 2008.
HSBC expects Gulf sukuk volumes to hit a record of $35 billion this year, up 33 percent from 2012, in line with the Kuwait Finance House research projecting a 30 percent increase in sukuk issuance worldwide.
The low interest rate environment and global investors' preference for bond markets explains the booming sukuk market, said Paul-Henri Pruvost, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor's.
''The developing global Islamic asset management industry is also creating further demand for sukuk,'' he added.
Opportunistic countries are taking advantage of investor demand to raise cheap money. Qatar, which likes to enhance the financial power of its natural gas exports with debt, made a $4 billion sale last year. State borrowing accounted for an estimated $115 billion in 2012, about 85 percent of all Islamic bonds.
''What drives sovereign issuances is the same as any business -- if they see an opportunity to get a good amount of money from the market at an attractive rate, they will turn to the market to raise funds,'' said Ahsan Ali, global head of Standard Chartered Bank's Islamic banking division, based in Dubai.
''Corporate entities will begin to access the market, as well,'' he added.
Analysts say that the Dubai government's cost of borrowing, judging by its January sukuk yielding about 3.9 percent, has fallen 40 percent from last year.
The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, is now preparing a $1 billion issue -- its first since October 2012 when it raised $2 billion through the market.
With a low interest rate environment favoring borrowers, analysts say they expect several countries to tap the Islamic bonds market for the first time, as a new avenue of financing for large-scale infrastructure projects, including airports and roads.
These new issuers could include Egypt, Kuwait, Oman and Tunisia, Mr. Dawood, of HSBC, and other analysts said.
''We're seeing that there's a big push to develop capital markets in this part of the world, to increase the investor pool and encourage more issuers,'' said Mr. Dawood. ''Places like Kuwait and Oman opening up the sukuk market contributes to that development.
Saudi Arabia, which was a major issuer of Islamic bonds last year, ''is poised to become one of the largest Islamic markets in the world,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Environmentalists and Anti-Whalers: 'Pirates,' or Protectors?

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: An American judge has ruled the Sea Shepherd anti-whaling group are &#8220;pirates,&#8221; with environmentalism driven by &#8220;private ends.&#8221; 

 BODY:
BEIJING - The battle between Japan's "whale researchers" and anti-whaling groups has long been a furious one, often fought, precariously, between vessels heaving in icy seas. 
But who here is the protector, who the pirate? 
This week a federal judge in the United States ruled that Sea Shepherd, the anti-whaling group, was a "pirate," in a suit brought by the whale researchers, the Institute of Cetacean Research in Japan. (The institute, set up in 1987, a year after an international moratorium on whaling took effect to protect fast-dwindling species, says it is a "whale research program" but environmentalists say it is involved in commercial whaling and its Web site says it engages in "whaling.") 
Rendezvous wrote about the politics - and economics - of whaling earlier this month.
"You don't need a peg leg or an eye patch" to be a pirate, ruled Chief Judge Alex Kozinski of the 9th Circuit, in an opinion dated Feb. 25 in Seattle. (The 9th Circuit is an appeals court that is one level below the Supreme Court, the highest court in the nation.) 
"When you ram ships; hurl glass containers of acid; drag metal-reinforced ropes in the water to damage propellers and rudders; launch smoke bombs and flares with hooks; and point high-powered lasers at other ships, you are, without a doubt, a pirate, no matter how high-minded you believe your purpose to be," the judge ruled, finding in favor of the Institute, which he described as "Japanese researchers who hunt whales in the Southern Ocean."
The judge defined a pirate as someone involved in acts of violence on the high seas and, importantly, driven by "private" ends. 
Here's how the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea defines piracy, as cited by the judge: "illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship ... and directed ... on the high seas, against another ship ... or against persons or property on board such ship."
The argument is of course more complicated than that (legal judgments usually are) but it does seem to raise the following important question: can environmentalists, who are working to protect their surroundings, be considered to be motivated merely by "private" ends? Or is it a larger, "public" ends that drive them? 
The judge said in his ruling the issue had not been much studied. "Belgian courts, perhaps the only ones to have previously considered the issue, have held that environmental activism qualifies as a private end," he wrote.
Unsurprisingly, the verdict is roiling environmentalists, with Sea Shepherd's founder, Paul Watson, saying: "They are entitled to their opinion, but the Australian Federal Court ."
 What do you think? Can environmentalists fighting to protect our natural surroundings be considered pirates driven by private ends? Are Sea Shepherd's tactics too extreme? As our environment degrades, might one day the degraders be the ones who find themselves branded "pirates" drive by "private ends"?

HEADLINE: Bernanke's Credibility on 'Too Big to Fail'

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The Fed chairman has acknowledged that big banks get implicit subsidies, but the market correctly sees through his insistence that those banks will not be bailed out, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
In testimony to the Senate Banking Committee this week, Ben Bernanke made a clear statement acknowledging that very large American banks receive implicit subsidies because the market believes they are too big to fail. This was one of the most forthright public statements on this topic by a top Fed official, and Mr. Bernanke should be congratulated for being honest and direct on this important point.
Unfortunately, when it came to discussing how to bring down this subsidy - and addressing the problem of "too big to fail" financial institutions - Mr. Bernanke's answers were disappointing. 
Mr. Bernanke was pressed hard on these topics by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat - you can watch a clip of their exchange. The concerns that Senator Warren expressed are shared by some across the aisle - including Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, who said at the hearing, "There is growing bipartisan concern across the whole political spectrum about the fact - I believe it's a fact - that 'too big to fail' is alive and well."
At the hearing, Mr. Bernanke readily conceded that there is a "too big to fail" subsidy, in the form of cheaper funds than big banks would otherwise receive, because market participants think the government provides some downside protection, i.e., implicit insurance that limits losses. Even after the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, the extent of implicit creditor protection remains high. 
Senator Warren cited a recent study by the staff at the International Monetary Fund, and Mr. Bernanke did not push back on the findings by those researchers. I recommend that you read the paper by Kenichi Ueda of the I.M.F. and Beatrice Weder di Mauro, a leading European academic. (I was previously director of the Research Department at the I.M.F., but I left that job in 2008 and had nothing to do with this paper.) Senator Warren also cited a Bloomberg View editorial on the issue, and a follow-up editorial; these put the subsidies around $83 billion. (The work by Bloomberg, for which I am also a commentator, has attracted some controversy. For an assessment I recommend a piece by Yves Smith and one by my M.I.T. colleague John E. Parsons; see also the latest in the Bloomberg View series, published Wednesday.)
There is a growing chorus of Wall Street "deniers," claiming that big banks do not actually receive any funding advantage. This is a bizarre and indefensible position.
The G.A.O. is expected to report in detail on banking subsidies soon - we should thank Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, and Senator Vitter for pushing them in this direction. (Senator Brown has been working long and hard on too-big-to-fail issues for years; now he is starting to get serious traction.) In the meantime, I also recommend "Too-Systemic-To-Fail: What Option Markets Imply About Sector-Wide Government Guarantees," by Bryan Kelly, Hanno Lustig, and Stijn van Nieuwerburgh. Or if that is too technical, you could read one of Andrew G. Haldane's brilliant speeches, like "The $100 Billion Question." Mr. Haldane is a senior official at the Bank of England who speaks and writes with great clarity about both the scale of subsidies for global megabanks - and the distortion and damage this does to the rest of the economy.
And everyone on Wall Street must engage with "The Bankers' New Clothes" by Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig. See Chapter 9 on the issue of bank subsidies (which are received by all banks, but to a greater degree when banks and bank holding companies are larger).
Unfortunately, Mr. Bernanke seems to be in denial about whether the problem of "too big to fail" is receding. This is about probabilities, and the market expectation is everything.
Mr. Bernanke's view, as stated in the hearing, is that the market is wrong - there will be no bailouts. Market participants understand all too well that Mr. Bernanke's promises are probably not time-consistent - meaning that he can say what he wants now, but in the next systemic financial crisis he would feel compelled by his legal mandate to provide an effective backstop to asset values and to many institutions.
For example, Mr. Bernanke cited the new liquidation powers granted under Dodd-Frank, which apply to bank holding companies. But the orderly resolution of any very large and complex cross-border financial institution is not really possible.
I am fully aware that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Bank of England are trying to cooperate on this issue. This is a valiant effort but not one likely to succeed. In any big crisis, it is every national interest for itself.
The problems associated with cross-border failure would become more straightforward if the United States authorities would use their powers under the "living wills" provision of Title I in Dodd-Frank to force big financial institutions to become simpler - and to provide much higher levels of capital by country of operation. There is no indication that we are moving in this direction. In fact, William C. Dudley - president of the New York Fed - last year gave a speech in which even he suggested that the living wills process has not yet proved effective (or, in my view, even meaningful).
And Mr. Dudley recently sent the opposite signal to the market from what Mr. Bernanke was trying to convey on Tuesday. In a speech on Feb. 1, he floated the idea that we should consider:
"...to expand the range of financial intermediation activity that is directly backstopped by the central bank's lender of last resort function. This expanded range could be defined either in terms of access by the types of firms that are systemically important in market-based finance, or by types of activity or assets."
To be fair, Mr. Dudley also asked if we should allow as much risk in our financial system as our current arrangements permit. And he did emphasize that if insurance is provided, it should be paid for (good luck getting Wall Street to pay a fair premium for any government backstop).
The broader philosophy at the New York Fed has long been that, in the event of a crisis, it is important to "foam the runway." The expression is a favorite of Timothy F. Geithner, former head of the New York Fed, and it was one of his guiding principles when he became Treasury secretary - with the implication that the authorities should do everything possible to cushion the blow for banking executives, shareholders, and creditors in the event of a systemic crisis (see Neil Barofsky's book, "Bailout," for context and details).
But such instincts long predate Mr. Geithner; the New York Fed has been in the bailout business for 100 years. You can trace its origins (and the Federal Reserve System) to the crisis of 1907.
Benjamin Strong arranged private bailouts on behalf of J.P. Morgan (the man) during the 1907 crisis. Mr. Strong went on to become the first president of the New York Fed and the dominant personality in the Federal Reserve System until his death in 1928.
And the modern Fed can do a great deal to help banks and their creditors at times of stress, including quantitative easing, which pushes up asset prices and therefore helps all balance sheets.
Market participants are wise not to take Mr. Bernanke at face value. And Senators Brown, Warren and Vitter are right to press Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues on these issues. Why should large banks get free insurance and implicit encouragement to become larger, take more risk and blow themselves up? The true downside costs to the economy of a financial crisis are far in excess of $80 billion. Most reasonable estimates are that we lost, in a tangible sense, at least one year's worth of gross domestic product.
The Federal Reserve should establish a transparent set of benchmarks, published regularly, that measure the funding subsidies received by very large financial institutions. This would help drive out the nonsense put forward by Wall Street deniers.
The Fed staff has done something like this before in regard to federal subsidies to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - in a 2003 paper that calculated the financing advantage to be around 40 basis points, and in a 2004 speech by Alan Greenspan, then the Fed chairman.
Mr. Bernanke is promising that market perceptions will change and that the subsidies will fall. It hasn't happened so far, nearly three years after Dodd-Frank. He should be held accountable, in public, for what happens to megabank subsidies going forward.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times, plus a look at what&#8217;s happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times 

        
As the Supreme Court heard arguments in a challenge to the Voting Rights Act on Wednesday, some conservative justices appeared skeptical about whether a part of the law targeting discrimination practices in nine states should stand. Adam Liptak writes that the justices' sharp questioning indicated that the provision might be in danger, especially after Congress did not act on the court's earlier recommendation to update the formula for determining which states should be subject to that part of the act.
 

        
With $85 billion in federal spending cuts set to start kicking in on Friday, some Republicans and Democrats are seeing the silver lining of the so-called sequester. Jonathan Weisman explains that Democrats are happy to cut Pentagon spending and postpone dealing with entitlement programs, while President Obama sees an opportunity to focus on gun control and immigration. Republicans are pleased just to see the government shrinking.

        
Anticipating bad news once the sequester reductions hit, President Obama and his aides have been trying to brace Americans for cutbacks and make sure that Republicans get the blame for them, Michael D. Shear reports.

        
The House is poised to pass the Senate's version of a bill to reauthorize and expand the Violence Against Women Act on Thursday, after Republican leaders bowed to pressure from within their party, Jonathan Weisman writes. The House is expected to reject its own version before considering the Senate legislation, which would broaden the domestic-violence law to address same-sex and tribal jurisdiction issues.

        
Jacob J. Lew is set to be sworn in as the 76th secretary of the Treasury after the Senate confirmed his nomination on Wednesday. Jeremy W. Peters writes that the 71-to-26 vote was notable in that it "meant that for the moment at least, the Senate returned to its traditional role of affording the president deference in selecting his cabinet."

        
On a campaign for tougher gun laws, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York met Wednesday with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader; and a few Republican moderates. But Jackie Calmes and Jeremy W. Peters write that Mr. Bloomberg did not attend a Senate hearing where he would have seen the lawmakers' resistance to stricter laws.

        
Michelle Obama kicked off the third year of her "Let's Move" healthy eating campaign on Wednesday, starting a three-city tour in Mississippi, where obesity rates are the highest in the nation, with the food celebrity Rachael Ray, Jennifer Steinhauer reports. On Thursday, the first lady will make stops in Chicago and Missouri.
 Happenings in Washington 

        
Economic reports expected Thursday include revised fourth-quarter gross domestic product and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed by weekly mortgage rates at 10 a.m.

        
At 9 a.m., a House Ways and Means subcommittee will hold a hearing on the proposed waiver of work requirements in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.

        
At 9:30 a.m., Pfc. Bradley Manning is expected to take the stand at his hearing at Fort Meade, Md.

        
At 10 a.m., the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee will hold its second hearing on the Federal Housing Administration's financial condition and program challenges.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Risks and Opportunities

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Speaking at the SuperReturn conference in Berlin, big investors like Henry R. Kravis and J. Christopher Flowers offered differing views about the region, as Europe&#8217;s economies struggle. 

 BODY:
BERLIN - Is Europe a risk or an opportunity?
As its economies struggle, private equity managers offer differing views about the region.
Speaking at the SuperReturn conference in Berlin, Henry R. Kravis, co-founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, said Europe was an attractive market, particularly the Continent's southern countries, which have been hit by high unemployment and meager growth. 
"I like Spain, they are doing a number of right things," Mr. Kravis told a somewhat empty conference room early on Thursday morning after many private equity managers had attended late-night dinners the previous evening. "In Europe, there clearly are opportunities. I may be in the minority."
Other private equity giants, including David M. Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group, are also scouting for opportunities from Italy to Ireland despite concerns that the Continent may fall back into recession.
Lionel Assant, European head of private equity at the Blackstone Group, liked Spain because of its close ties to fast-growing Latin American markets and efforts to revamp its local labor market.
Not every manager is so bullish, however.
J. Christopher Flowers, whose private equity firm bought an insurance broker from the struggling Belgian bank KBC for 240 million euros ($315 million) in 2011, said the future of the euro zone remained a major risk.
Europe's recovery prospects were hurt again this week after Italian national elections on Monday failed to provide a definitive winner. The political impasse prompted significant losses in the Continent's stock markets as investors fretted about the future of one of Europe's largest economies.
For Mr. Flowers, there are still some potential investment opportunities, including the pending forced sale of bank branches in Britain from the nationalized Royal Bank of Scotland. The United States, however, still remains his preferred region in which to invest.
"If a major economy like Spain defaults, we would prefer to be in Germany," Mr. Flowers said. "If I had to pick one region, I would pick the U.S."
An earlier version of this article contained an incorrect conversion of 240 million euros. It is the equivalent of $315 million, not $310.

HEADLINE: In Heinz Case, an Opaque Bet in London

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Regulators are focusing on a complex derivative bet on H.J. Heinz that was routed through London. | The dissolution of Dewey &#038; LeBoeuf became official on Wednesday. | Europe has reached a tentative deal to limit bankers&#8217; bonuses. | J.C. Penney&#8217;s poor fourth-quarter results underscored the challenges facing William A. Ackman. 

 BODY:
Regulators looking into suspicious trading ahead of the $23 billion takeover of H.J. Heinz are focusing on a complex derivative bet routed through London, DealBook's Ben Protess and Susanne Craig report. The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining a product known as a contract-for-difference, which allows investors to bet on changes in stock prices without owning the shares, two people briefed on the matter said. The development comes after the F.B.I. said it had opened a criminal inquiry.
 The expanding investigation "illustrates the growing challenges facing American regulators," Mr. Protess and Ms. Craig write. "Charged with policing the American exchanges, authorities increasingly find themselves having to hunt through a dizzyingly complex global marketplace." As the government cracks down on insider trading, investors are seeking subtler ways to take advantage of confidential information. The derivative product in question is not regulated in the United States but is popular in Britain, where authorities also opened an inquiry into the Heinz trades, according to one of the people briefed on the matter. The inquiry began when regulators noticed an unusual spike in trading volume in Heinz options a day before the deal was announced. 
Complicating the job for regulators, the suspicious options trades were routed through a Goldman Sachs account in Zurich that masked information about the trader. "While the identity remains a secret, the account holder is a Goldman private wealth management client, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak on the record. Goldman executives in Zurich know the identity of the person, but laws prohibit those executives from sharing the name with American regulators and even Goldman executives outside of Switzerland."
DEWEY IS OFFICIALLY DISSOLVED | The once-venerable law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf effectively ceased to exist when it filed for bankruptcy nine months ago. But its dissolution became official when a federal bankruptcy judge on Wednesday confirmed a plan to unwind the firm and pay back creditors, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports. Dewey's lead bankruptcy lawyer, Al Togut, said the process had moved more swiftly and less contentiously than previous law firm liquidations. "I want to congratulate all the professionals," Judge Martin Glenn said at the end of a three-hour hearing.
The liquidation plan describes how the estate will compensate creditors, whose claims total about $550 million. "At the heart of the proposal is an innovative arrangement under which about 450 former Dewey partners agreed to return a portion of their pay, raising about $72 million for creditors," Mr. Lattman writes. "By accepting the deal, former Dewey partners insulate themselves from future lawsuits connected to the firm's demise." Still, a criminal investigation into possible financial misconduct at Dewey is in progress.
EUROPE MOVES TO LIMIT BONUSES | The European Parliament reached a tentative deal on Wednesday evening to limit bankers' bonuses at twice the value of their fixed pay, moving to impose the toughest limits on pay since the financial crisis. The deal, which still must be endorsed formally by governments and lawmakers, caps 18 months of negotiating and sets the stage for the implementation of the so-called Basel III rules on capital. It is "a major victory for the European Parliament negotiators, who insisted on pay curbs as their price for passing Basel, and a sign of London's relative isolation on some financial services issues," The Financial Times writes. Britain had opposed some of the limits.
"I find it difficult to imagine that we would now scrap this compromise," Michel Barnier, the European Union's financial services chief, said, according to Bloomberg News. Under the terms of the deal, a one-to-one ratio of salary to bonus can increase to two-to-one with shareholder approval. "While bonuses worth more than twice fixed pay would be banned, special treatment would be given to loss-absorbing securities such as shares and debt that can be written down during a crisis, according to E.U. officials. That would apply if that part of the bonus is deferred for at least five years, they said," Bloomberg News writes.
ON THE AGENDA | Barnes & Noble, Best Buy and Sears report earnings before the market opens. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, appears on Fox Business Network at 5 p.m. James E. Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy, is on Bloomberg TV at 4 p.m. A revised estimate of gross domestic product for the fourth quarter is out at 8:30 a.m.
ACKMAN'S RETAIL WOES | J.C. Penney's disappointing fourth-quarter results underscored the challenges facing the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman, who is wagering on the retailer's turnaround. "It's hard to call J.C. Penney's latest quarterly report anything but breathtakingly bad," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced writes. "The retailer lost $552 million for the quarter, which at $1.95 a share on an adjusted basis far exceeded the 17-cent loss that analysts had been expecting. Same-store sales tumbled nearly 32 percent from the period a year earlier. Shares in the company were down nearly 9 percent in after-hours trading."
The chief executive of J.C. Penney, Ronald B. Johnson, who was recruited from Apple, pointed to the changes he had made and asked investors for patience. "One might wonder whether Mr. Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management owns a 17.8 percent stake in J.C. Penney, can wait that long. That said, a person familiar with his thinking said Mr. Ackman believed that the quarter had cleaned up the retailer's legacy issues, including old and unattractive inventory and cutting out roughly hundreds of millions of dollars in costs."

HEADLINE: Group Seeks Out and Helps Homeless Veterans

BYLINE: PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN


HIGHLIGHT: The mission of the Vet Hunters Project is to track down homeless veterans and offer aid. 

 BODY:
Combat zones exist in many different places. For Joe Leal, the founder of the Vet Hunters Project, an all-volunteer group of veterans who have made it their mission to track down homeless comrades, the battlefield is a lone soldier living in his truck in the wake of a home foreclosure, or a veteran living in a dark, deafening homeless encampment secreted under a freeway.
"You know the expression 'never leave the fallen behind'?" Mr. Leal said one recent afternoon, barreling down the highway in his typical style after spending the morning on the phone calming a distraught vet. "Homelessness is the equivalent of leaving a buddy on the battlefield. They're heroes in the shadows." 
The group, which takes an aggressive "911 attitude" to homelessness, fans out to America's forgotten places - bridge underpasses, dry river beds, bus stop shelters, even the concrete pads of subdivision houses that were never built. Started in 2010, the "vetwork," as Mr. Leal likes to call it, now has 20 chapters around the country, with 113 active volunteers in California alone, who subsidize the work out of their own pockets. In an article Thursday, I write about the project's work to with homeless female veterans, who are going without housing at higher rates than male veterans. 
Among the ranks of the project's volunteers are military families with spare housing and deployed soldiers who make their empty homes available to homeless vets while they are away.
 Mr. Leal, who is something of a human Eveready battery, started the project in memory of his friend Master Sgt. Kelly Bolor, who was killed in action in Iraq in 2003. He and Mr. Leal served together in Iraq, where Sgt. Bolor, who was of Hawaiian descent, "would pull out his ukulele and sing to us when we were down," Mr. Leal recalled.
Mr. Leal has had his own brush with homelessness, living in shelters with his family as a child - often separated due to restrictions on children - and then in public housing in Ontario, outside Los Angeles. "I watched my father do his best to make sure everything was O.K.," Mr. Leal said of David Jimenez, the stepfather who raised him. Mr. Jimenez was killed by a hit-and-run driver when Mr. Leal was 25 years old.
Mr. Leal orchestrates much of the project out of the 115th Combat Service Support Battalion in South El Monte, where he is a reservist. "Soldiers won't tell you their problems," Master Sgt. Barry Marshall observed of the challenges of reaching homeless veterans. "It's suck it up and drive on." 
Although the project encourages homeless veterans to seek help with the Department of Veterans Affairs, it can act on a moment's notice, Mr. Leal said, because he and his cohorts have established relationships with city and county agencies serving the homeless as well as community organizations. 
When the husband of one of their clients, Monica Figueroa, returned from multiple deployments, including Afghanistan and two tours in Iraq, the couple wound up homeless, living with their son amid oil and solvents in an auto-body shop owned by his family. They called Mr. Leal, who found them an apartment through Inland Temporary Homes, a community organization in San Bernardino that provides temporary housing and support services for homeless families.
First Sgt. Steve Kreider, now a reserve adviser stationed at the Middletown, Conn., Reserve Center, was one the project's first volunteers. He participated in a cross-country bike ride in 2011 that was a fact-finding mission and an effort to raise public awareness. "That really opened up our eyes," Sergeant Kreider said. "You think this only happens in New York or Los Angeles. But when you get to Kansas and see a homeless vet, you realize 'holy moly,' this is a bigger problem. It's a travesty."
The project helps out with official homeless counts, including one for the state of Connecticut and another for greater Los Angeles. In a count in Connecticut last February, accomplished with the help of 70 cadet volunteers from the Coast Guard Academy in New London, the group located 25 homeless veterans. "They often won't have a photo I.D.," Sergeant Kreider observes. "But if you ask them for their DD214, their honorable discharge order, 90 percent of the time they'll have it. It's a matter of pride." 
Thus far, the project is financed by the volunteers themselves, operating on a budget of some $50,000. Mr. Leal has about 2,000 volunteers and counting, enlisting even nonveterans living in homeless encampments in the cause. The group will sometimes intervene with car payments, traffic tickets, medication and other aspects of daily life that can sometimes become tipping points into homelessness.
"We don't accept defeat, ma'am," he explained after a characteristically long day in the field. "That's not an option."

HEADLINE: Blood in the Carolina Hills

BYLINE: JEAN HUETS


HIGHLIGHT: Violence erupts among North Carolina&#8217;s pro-Union rebels. 

 BODY:
In much of the South, the issue of the Civil War was not slavery or the legalities of whether a state had the right to secede. For many white Southerners, the issue was: Which is my true country, the United States or the Confederate States? In many places, loyalty to the Confederacy was the rule. But in Yadkin County, N.C., fierce conviction gripped both sides of the question, culminating in a February 1863 gun battle that traumatized the county for generations.
Yadkin County lies at the western end of the "Quaker Belt," a clump of counties in the Piedmont region of North Carolina. An intricate web of kinship and economic interdependence knits together the region's family farms, many of which were first tilled by frontiersmen and veterans of the Continental Army. In the Civil War, thousands of their descendants remained loyal to the Union they helped to found. 
While Yadkin County Unionists were not usually avowedly pacifist or abolitionist, a strong Quaker and Moravian presence ran through the region. On family-run farms, as opposed to Tidewater plantations, slavery was unwanted and, for many, immoral. Most Unionists were content with neutrality, however, until conscription laws decreed that able-bodied men who held fewer than 20 slaves (later, 15) must fight for secession. 
Jesse Dobbins, a Yadkin County miller and passionate Unionist, wrote, "I think the Union men had the same cause to rebel against the so-called Confederacy as our fore fathers had to rebell against the british government." Dobbins himself rebelled by refusing conscription. His fellow "skulkers" and "shirkers" - deserters and draft resisters - "layed out" in the woods or in the barns and sheds of friends and kin to avoid arrest by militia or Home Guard troops. 
Indeed, Yadkin County's many families with entrenched Union loyalties gave it a reputation for being one of the safest places in the state for avoiding conscription. Still, "bushwhackers" who lived on the land by robbing, murdering and burning barns and homes made people more likely to cooperate with fugitive-hunting militiamen and members of the Home Guard. North Carolinians bled richly for the Confederacy, too, and many despised dissenters as traitors. The two sides simmered uneasily along, resentment mounting on each side, until Feb. 12, 1863, when Confederate and Unionist loyalties collided violently at the Bond Schoolhouse, near Yadkin's Deep Creek Friends meeting house. 
The day dawned gray and chill, but by midmorning, the sun dispelled the clouds and coaxed forth a springlike breeze, melting a frosting of snow into rust-red mud. Inside the log schoolhouse were not children, but Dobbins, who had recently been conscripted, along with about 13 other conscripts and one deserter. A "Col. Ham," probably a nephew of the Willard brothers in the schoolhouse, gave an account of what transpired that morning.
Lulled, perhaps, by the warmth and sweetness of the day, and too confident of their safety, the men had neglected to set a picket. As they listened to a fellow conscript reading news of the war, about 15 militiamen quietly approached the schoolhouse. A "passer-by" had informed the militia where the conscripts they'd been hunting were holed up. 
The militiamen placed the muzzles of their guns to the chinking between the logs and fired. "Solomon Hinshaw fell near the hearth with a bullet wound through his heart and died instantly without a groan, with a morsel of victual in his mouth," Col. Ham wrote. 
No one else was hit, and when one of the militiamen, James West, appeared in the doorway and demanded surrender, the men were ready for him. "One conscript answered, I will surrender you d__ you, and leveled his gun, but just as he pulled the trigger, West pushed the gun up the contents almost cutting a joist in two over the door."
West defended himself in vain. Another conscript fired, and "James West sank upon the stone door step a lifeless, and headless form, almost all of his head being shot off." 
The redundant description of West's head is not merely gory sensationalism. On their way to capture the conscripts, West's men had stopped to rest and water their horses at the home of the Vestals, a family of "old-time Quakers." West boasted that "he was going out there and take ever D___ one of them prisoners. Mrs. Vestal answered, 'Yes, and thee will get thee head shot off thy shoulders too.'" Ham comments, "Whether or not the spirit of prophecy was upon Mrs. Vestal, we leave to the conjecture of the reader." 
Col. Ham's emphasis on Mrs. Vestal's prophecy and the manner of West's demise may have been an allusion to the Heroes of America, a powerful, secretive Unionist organization that originated in the area. When inducted into the Heroes, a man bound himself to loyalty and secrecy "under no less penalty than to have my head shot through." 
The Heroes of America undermined the Confederacy primarily by encouraging and aiding draft resisters and deserters. An "underground railroad," operated in cooperation with abolitionists, led deserters and conscripts to safety in Tennessee and Kentucky, where many enlisted with the Union. The organization's badge, a red string attached to a coat lapel or a home's threshold or window, gave the Heroes the nickname the Red Strings. The device was adopted from the biblical Book of Joshua, in which a woman in Jericho concealed from capture two Israelites on a reconnaissance mission, then helped them escape by lowering them down the city wall on a red rope. They promised that on their return as conquerors, she and her family would be protected by a "scarlet thread" she was to fasten to her window. 
The Heroes of America concealed their identities and operations through signs and countersigns, oaths and passwords modeled on those of Freemasonry, which continues to flourish in the area. Their secrecy endured past the war; in Yadkin County many pulled a veil of silence over painful memories and loyalties that fractured families and friends. The Bond Schoolhouse affair, as local historians gently call it, was particularly off limits. Even today, bits and pieces of the affair are just surfacing from family archives. 
In all, two conscripts and two militiamen were killed at the Bond Schoolhouse, and one on each side was wounded. Although Dobbins was indicted for firing the shot that killed West, a granddaughter of another of the men, Solomon Hinshaw, later claimed that "the Willard boys [brothers William, Benjamin, Leander, and possibly Milton] did most of the shooting," with Benjamin rumored to have killed West. The Willards escaped the schoolhouse, but three were captured months later as part of another group fleeing the state. 
It proved harder to keep the Willards jailed than to keep a beagle in a pen. When the brothers were in custody at nearby Camp Vance, three Yadkin deputies appealed to the local commander to take custody of them: "Our jail is entirely unsafe, to say nothing of the danger of their being rescued by their friends as heretofore." Despite precautions, Unionist and local loyalties prevailed, and the brothers escaped - and, after being recaptured, escaped again. The final time they broke jail, literally one day ahead of the hangman, a sister had smuggled in an auger and chisel despite a "rigid examination" by the jailer. 
One Willard brother didn't share the luck of his kin. In 1864 Milton Willard, who ended up enlisting in the Confederate Army, deserted and joined 60 to 100 other men, including two members of the Vestal family, heading for Federal lines to enlist in the Union Army or stay neutral until the end of the war. An encounter with a Confederate detachment scattered the group. Willard was captured and sent to Petersburg. He escaped and "was making fair headway toward home" when he was recaptured. 
From prison, Milton Willard wrote to his wife, "This is the last Sabbath I am ever to see on this earth, but I hope I am going where Sabbath will never end and I hope you and my dear children may meet me never more to part." He was executed by firing squad a few days later.
Sgt. Horace Eddleman of the 38th North Carolina Infantry later wrote to Willard's sister Claresy, "I was mighty sorry to see him shot for he looked mighty cut down. But he said that he was prepared to die." Eddleman promised to "put a board to his head," to "go with you to him," and to help her in any way he could, "though you are a stranger to me." He closed his letter, "Times is hard here and they are shooting lots of men. I hope that this unmerciful war will soon stop." 
Jesse Dobbins, his brother William and three other conscripts evaded capture and travelled 500 winter-icy miles to Kentucky, helped on their way, as Dobbins recalled, by "a friend that had been a pilot" - that is, an Underground Railroad guide - "for the Union men all the time since the war begun." About 20 months in, William died of an illness that, Jesse believed, was brought on by the privations of their winter journey. 
Jesse Dobbins returned home after the war with an honorable discharge from the United States Army. The Union military authority in North Carolina ordered all charges dropped against the Bond Schoolhouse men, and Dobbins resumed farming and milling. As a founder of the Yadkin County Republican Party, he was spectacularly successful: unique in the South, Yadkin County has voted Republican in every presidential election since North Carolina re-entered the Union. 
A folk hero in the minds of some, a murderous traitor in the eyes of others, Jesse Dobbins lived out the rest of his days as a Friend, but had no regrets about his three-year military service. He wrote, "I was willing to join the United States army for the purpose of fighting for the Liberty of my Dear country that is more preshus than gold. The rebs say that I am a traitor to my country. Why tis this, because I am for a majority a ruling and for keeping the power in the people."

HEADLINE: Bonus Rules May Just Reinforce Existing Pay Practices, Rather Than Overhaul

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The proposed bonus rules in Europe regulation may not prove the sweeping overhaul that bankers are lamenting. After all, existing regulations and the tough profit environment have already forced financial firms to rethink their pay packages. 

 BODY:
European lawmakers have stirred up the ire of the financial industry by proposing rules that would limit banker bonuses. But the regulations, assuming they are passed, may not prove the sweeping overhaul that bankers are lamenting. 
For one, existing regulations have already forced financial firms in the United States and Europe to rethink their pay packages. And big banks, struggling to bolster profits and share prices, have been trying to keep a lid on compensations levels since the financial crisis. 
On the surface, the proposed rules seem drastic. 
Late Wednesday, the European Parliament and European Commission struck a provisional agreement to limit bonuses to 100 percent of bankers' salaries. Financial firms would be able to hand out payments that amount to double the salaries, with the approval of a majority of shareholders. If bonuses exceed salaries, then a quarter of that additional payout must be deferred for at least five years.
By doing so, lawmakers are hoping to curtail the type of risky behavior that led to the financial crisis. And given the high level of government support that these institutions have received, the argument goes, these countries should have a bigger say in corporate governance that could help prevent another disaster from happening again.
It's prompted an outcry in Europe, and particularly the London financial district, known as the City. European bankers decry that the onerous rules will prompt top talent to flee to less restrictive regions like Hong Kong and New York City. 
XXXQUOTE
Others indicate they will simply find some ways around the rules. Top banking executives are said to already be discussing sharp rises in base pay, which would go a long way toward circumventing the new rules.
"It will drive up fixed salaries to compensate," one British financial services executive told the BBC. "Businesses that do not need to be inside the European Union will leave. And when banks invest in future divisions, it will be outside the E.U."
It's a tactic that institutions have used before when lawmakers have pushed for changes in the ways banks dole out compensation. In the aftermath of the crisis, several big banks tried to quell the political outrage by tempering their annual bonuses, quietly adding to base pay at the same time. 
The recent move by European Union officials only further solidifies the changed world of banker pay, rather than shaking up compensation practices. And regulators, with increased powers to oversee bank compensation, may be anticipating modest efforts to skirt the new rules.
Big financial firms once had a lot of leeway over how much they compensated their employees, but - on paper, at least - that changed considerably after the financial crisis of 2008. With the industry reeling, the Group of 20, a collection of finance ministers and central bankers, set up a framework for regulating pay.
One of the key principles that the G20 agreed to is tying bankers' pay to the amount of risk they take when doing trades. That can involve making sure that banks have employment agreements in place that allow banks to "claw back" pay if trades don't work out.
Bankers are typically rewarded compensation for one year's performance, but then they receive the cash or shares that make up that sum in a staggered fashion over several years. In theory, that gives banks the ability to cancel that pay if trades don't meet pre-set targets. This approach doesn't necessarily target the overall level of pay, however.
Raising base salaries could run straight into regulatory guidelines that demand pay be link to the financial performance of trades. By promising to pay an employee a large sum upfront, the bank would essentially loosen the link between compensation and risk. Connecting the two is the main principle at the heart of regulators' new approach to pay. If traders makes a bad bet, it would be harder for bosses to punish them through their paycheck.
In addition, banks may themselves decide that it's not in their interests to commit to giving employees large upfront salaries. The financial industry has traditionally used bonuses to incentivize hard work throughout the year. Simply increasing the base pay of a banker may lessen the power of that motivational tool.
At the same time, banks, especially in Europe, don't exactly have deep pockets to dole out large salaries or bonuses. Many of the region's banks have reported staggering losses in recent quarters. On Thursday, the Royal Bank of Scotland announced a $9 billion loss for the year. 
In the current environment, European banks, especially in Britain, have been under pressure to rein in pay, especially in the face of their legal woes. R.B.S. and Barclays have both recouped past pay from executives to help cover fines related to rate-rigging cases.
Nationalist appeals to preserve countries' financial services industries may not hold much sway, at least for the moment. Legislators are showing a willingness to pursue moves that could prompt financial institutions to move more of their operations to jurisdictions outside of European Union control, like the United States and Asia. Britain, which has zealously protected its reputation as a global financial capital, has professed precisely this worry.
It's also not clear that banks will lose their best employees to rival, as some executives have argued. Othmar Karas, an Austrian lawmaker who helped spearhead the new initiative, has described the current plan as encompassing any banking operations that reside within the European Union.
In the end, the rules may just help codify what's already happening. Since the crisis, big banks - in the face of new regulation and waning profits - have retooled their compensation practices. The European Union's latest bonus rules will make it hard for banks to go back to their old ways, if the boom times return.

HEADLINE: The Bloody Occupation of Northern Alabama

BYLINE: TAYLOR M. POLITES


HIGHLIGHT: Pro-Union sentiment, and pro-Southern guerrilla warfare, was surprisingly strong along the Tennessee River. 

 BODY:
On Jan. 16, 1863, Dr. Thomas Fearn died of pneumonia at his home in the northern Alabama city of Huntsville. Fearn had studied medicine in London, Paris and Philadelphia, and was the first doctor to treat malaria patients with quinine. He was also a businessman and slaveholder. He had served at the February 1861 Constitutional Convention and in the first Confederate Congress in Montgomery, Ala. 
Fearn's illness was reportedly of long duration, having begun when he was imprisoned for supporting guerrilla activity after the Third Division of the Union's Army of the Ohio had swept into the area the previous spring. 
The Union invasion had proceeded much more smoothly than anyone, including the commanding general, Ormsby Mitchel, had expected. Without firing a shot, he had taken everything north of the Tennessee River from Florence in the west to Bridgeport in the east, including the important east-to-west Memphis and Charleston Railroad. 
But an easy invasion gave way to a difficult, often bloody occupation. The arriving Union forces had expected to find a strongly pro-Union population in northern Alabama; instead, Mitchel found a region deeply divided among Unionist and Confederate, slave and free, black and white. 
The hill counties south of the Tennessee River were notoriously Unionist, populated with yeoman farmers with no interest in struggles to preserve slavery. In the counties along the Tennessee River, however, yeoman farmers mixed with large slaveholders in the river bottoms and fertile plains that were ideal for cotton planting. Unionists and secessionists in northern Alabama were neighbors, business partners and kin. Geography and custom tied the region economically to Tennessee to the north. 
Rather than siding with the fire-breathers of the Black Belt, farther to the south, northern Alabamians had initially tried to walk a tightrope, hoping to coordinate action with other seceding states rather than recklessly secede alone. The famed fire-breather William Lowndes Yancey threateningly referred to these cooperationist northern Alabamians as "enemies of the State." 
The arrival of Mitchel's army in Huntsville in the early morning hours of April 11, 1862, drew differing reactions from local residents. Former Secretary of War Leroy Pope Walker, who had ordered the firing on Fort Sumter, fled his home. But a lawyer who lived nearby, George Lane, nailed his American flag to a pole over his house, where it remained until the occupation ended five months later.
The Confederate matron Mary Chadick arrived at General Mitchel's headquarters by 7 on the morning of the invasion at the head of a group of women. They demanded that captured Confederate wounded be released to their care. Mitchel complied. Nevertheless, the next day she recorded in her diary: "Truly our town is full of the enemy. There is a sentinel at every corner. Everybody keeps the front door locked, and I make it a point to answer the bell myself, not permitting children or servants to open it. They have been searching the houses today for arms ... Servants are giving information of all the arms and soldiers who have been concealed."
While Chadick and Fearn were staunchly Confederate, the former Alabama senator and Huntsville native Jeremiah Clemens, a cousin of Mark Twain and a novelist in his own right, exemplified the shifting loyalties of many in the region. Clemens had a history of political waffling: during his senatorial career, he opposed the Compromise of 1850 before he was for it. Representing Alabama's Madison County at the state secession convention, he opposed secession before flipping again, explaining that with a majority already in favor of secession, he would patriotically throw in his lot with the state. In recognition of his stature, he was made a major general. When Mitchel and the Union Army arrived, however, he abandoned the Confederacy and became, once again, a full-throated Unionist.
Clemens offered to travel to Washington with the former presidential candidate John Bell of Tennessee to assist in peace negotiations. The offer was politely declined. He worked to organize a burgeoning Unionist movement in North Alabama for much of the war. His friend and fellow Unionist George Lane was named a federal judge for Alabama by President Lincoln and worked closely with General Mitchel. (Lane's "tattooed and faded flag" of the United States came down when the Union army left, and Lane moved his family to Louisville, Ky.)
Many shared the feelings of Clemens and Lane. Close to 3,000 white men from northern Alabama served with the Union Army during the Civil War. Bands of Union men fought their way out of the hill counties to sign up. Soldiers conscripted into the Confederate Army from northern Alabama also deserted in large numbers, estimated as high as 10,000 from a total force of about 90,000. 
The enslaved people of northern Alabama had a clear interest in helping the Union hold the 400-mile front. They often provided information, including evidence against Dr. Fearn. The enslaved kept watch on the rivers and crossed mountains to provide information about Confederate movements. Mitchel insisted that the informers be protected rather than returned to their erstwhile owners, writing, "The negroes are our only friends, and in two instances I owe my own safety to their faithfulness." Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton agreed.
It is probably no surprise that Mary Chadick's servants ran away, leaving her and her seven children to keep house on their own. Long before the Emancipation Proclamation, enslaved African-Americans from the area flocked to the Union Army. Many went to Nashville to work on fortifications, including the massive Fort Negley. When recruitment of black troops began, the able-bodied volunteered to fight. Recruiters scoured the region. Some 3,000 African-American men from Alabama became Union soldiers. They guarded bridges and entrenchments, built fortifications and saw active duty. When the army of the Confederate general John Bell Hood was on the march to Nashville in late 1864, the 14th United States Colored Infantry repelled them at Decatur, Ala., on the Tennessee River, forcing them to search for a crossing downriver.
But this was only half the story - pro-Confederate sentiment abounded, and bushwhacker attacks grew, and were met with escalating reprisals. Mitchel found it difficult enough to maintain order in his widely spread command, and the guerrilla attacks exacerbated a volatile situation. He begged for more troops, particularly cavalry. He wired to Washington that "armed citizens fire into the trains, cut the telegraph wires, attack the guards of bridges, cut off and destroy my couriers, while guerrilla bands of cavalry attack whenever there is the slightest chance of success." No reinforcements were forthcoming. 
Through 1862, guerrilla fighters in Paint Rock, Ala. under Lemuel Mead continually harassed Union troops from the Third Ohio under Col. John Beatty. The forces suffered nine casualties from a sniper attack, and Beatty threatened to burn a house and hang a man for each of his soldiers killed. He then set the town ablaze and took three civilian prisoners. He reported that Mitchel was pleased with his action. 
About the same time, Confederate soldiers attacked units of the Union's Eighth Brigade at Athens, west of Huntsville. The surprise attack generated a disorderly Union retreat by train that was made more chaotic by a sabotaged railroad bridge, presumably the work of locals. Athens was shortly retaken, and Col. Basil Turchin, either explicitly or by carelessness, allowed his troops to loot and pillage the town, with at least one rape reported. The event became known notoriously throughout the South as the Sack of Athens. Turchin was court-martialed and convicted, but ultimately promoted. 
Confederate cavalry was constantly probing for weakness in the Union lines. Generals Nathan Bedford Forrest, Phillip Roddey and Huntsville-born John Hunt Morgan operated across the region. In August 1862, the bushwhacker Frank Gurley attacked an escort guarding the sick Gen. Robert L. McCook. The escort abandoned McCook in his ambulance, where he was shot and killed. The Union soldiers were incensed, and set fire to farmhouses in the vicinity. 
Clemens depicted northern Alabama in his 1865 novel Tobias Wilson: "Neighbor was arrayed against neighbor, and to the evils of open violence were added private assassinations and midnight burnings. No man knew whom to trust, and gloomy suspicions even of his friends settled upon every man's heart." 
After the first occupation ended in late August 1862 when the Union retreated, it was Union raiders' turn to crisscross northern Alabama. During the most famous raid, Col. Abel Streight and his troopers crossed the hill country of Alabama in spring 1863, aiming for the critical foundries of Rome, Ga. Over two weeks, he and Forrest danced around each other. Streight was undone by the 15-year-old Alabamian Emma Sansom. She led Forrest to a river ford, allowing him to cut off and capture Streight before he reached Georgia.
By 1864, dueling armies and a divided populace had devastated northern Alabama. The provost marshal's office in Scottsboro was crowded with Southerners eager to take the oath of loyalty, enabling them to get food relief, transact business and travel. One Madison County woman defended her decision to take the oath in a letter to her sister: "The people of South Ala., as any other place, where they have laws to protect them, and plenty to eat, and wear ... are not competent to judge of what is right and propper." 
Slowly, the war's end brought a semblance of peace. Mary Chadick's daughter Susan Elizabeth married Union Capt. Samuel W. Fordyce. Jere Clemens returned from exile in Philadelphia, but died before he could play a meaningful role in reconciliation. The war was over, but the devastation remained. The tumultuous process of reconstruction began in a region still divided.

HEADLINE: Breaking Down the Budget Mess

BYLINE: STEVEN RATTNER


HIGHLIGHT: Do our political leaders have the courage to compromise and agree on a long-term balanced approach that ends budget making by crisis? 

 BODY:
To hear Republicans spin it, the sequester due to take effect Monday is no big deal - a seemingly tiny 2.3 percent reduction in federal spending. Jack Welch, the former head of General Electric, argues that any C.E.O. who can't cut 2.3 percent from his company's expenses should be fired.
But the budget mess is far more complicated than that pat contention implies. For one thing, these new spending cuts would come on top of $1.7 trillion of spending reductions already set to take effect over a decade. 
For another, the spending reductions mandated by the sequester legislation are confined to a group of programs representing less than half of the budget, as shown in chart 1.
Even within this select group, all programs are not alike. Medicare is slated to be trimmed by only 2 percent, while a 7.9 percent reduction will be imposed on the military. Nondefense discretionary spending - everything from education aid to research grants - will be reduced by 5.3 percent.
And chart 1 does not depict another important feature of the sequester: the lack of flexibility that the administration has in imposing these cuts, even within these three areas. Under the budget legislation, in agencies and programs that are not exempt, the cuts must occur indiscriminately, across the board.
Finally, the legislation requires that the cuts take effect immediately, rather than being phased in over a number of years, as would be appropriate in such a weak economy. Achieving this year's cuts would be particularly challenging, because only seven months remain in the government's fiscal year.
So with apologies to Mr. Welch, sequestration doesn't give President Obama the flexibility to do what every other C.E.O. is able to do when cutting costs becomes a necessity.
(In fairness, I concede that these cuts are based on projected higher levels of spending, not today's levels of spending. But inflation still exists, however low, so the cuts will reduce the actual level of services that the government can deliver.)
And while I recognize that Senate Republicans have floated the idea of giving Mr. Obama discretion over how to implement the cuts, I believe the President is right to reject the idea, partly because trying to cram these reductions into the seven months remaining in this fiscal year is bad policy and partly because any replacement for the sequester should include a component of revenues.
So far, conservatives have ruled out any additional new revenue, pointing to the $650 billion tax increase voted at the end of the year. Now it's time to focus on spending, they say.
But that ignores the budget activity of the preceding two years - which was mostly about cutting nondefense discretionary spending. So disdaining new revenue means that spending reductions would end up as the overwhelming contributor to our budget deficit reduction effort, as shown in chart 2.
If sequestration remains in place, we will have taken $3.5 trillion out of the projected budget deficits of the coming decade. Less than 20 percent of that will have come from last year's tax increase.
That most of the burden of deficit reduction will fall on only a portion of the government is extraordinarily worrisome. As the chart below shows, nondefense discretionary spending - which includes those key investment areas like education and infrastructure - constitutes only 14 percent of the federal budget but is being asked to bear 44 percent of the cuts. All told, the three rounds of cuts will reduce expenditures on these important items by 16 percent - a lot more than the phony 2.3 percent number that the Republicans tout.
Similarly, the Defense Department, which also represents 14 percent of the budget, will bear 38 percent of the cuts. Meanwhile, entitlements - Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security - face only a 4 percent reduction, even though they total nearly half of all federal spending.
No one can enjoy the prospect of making fundamental changes in these key social welfare programs. But at the same time, constructing a $3.5 trillion package of deficit reduction - still less than the roughly $4 trillion needed even to keep our debt ratio at its current elevated level - that so disproportionately inflicts its pain is policy making at its worst.
Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are cornerstone programs - but so are these innocuous-sounding "nondefense discretionary" programs. They represent our investment in our future. In the early 1950s, government devoted about 1.2 percent of gross domestic product to infrastructure; by 2010, that amount had fallen to just 0.2 percent. Meanwhile, federal spending on research and development dropped from a high of nearly 2 percent in 1964 to 0.9 percent in 2009. 
We need a balanced approach in which everything is on the table, including more revenues and entitlements. For example, Mr. Obama has proposed limiting the tax savings on deductions to 28 percent. The Republicans say they want to reform the tax code so the Obama proposal sounds like a good place to start.
On the other hand, the Obama administration also should acknowledge that Medicare is in serious need of reform. A typical American at retirement age today will have paid an average of $122,000 of premiums into the system and will receive $387,000 of benefits (after adjustment for inflation!).
That math doesn't work. We shouldn't turn Medicare into a voucher program - as some Republicans, like Paul Ryan, have urged - but we can and should consider ideas such as raising Medicare drug rebates to Medicaid levels, means-testing benefits and increasing co-pays to ensure that recipients don't use more Medicare services than necessary.
And of course we should consider structural reforms to our health care system, such as tilting the compensation of doctors toward results, rather than quantity of services rendered.
All the blather about whose idea the sequester was or whether more golf would help the process is just a sideshow. The core question is whether our political leaders have the courage to compromise their absolutist positions and agree on a long-term balanced approach that ends budget making by crisis and removes the dark cloud of uncertainty that hovers over our economy.

HEADLINE: Americans Support Breast-Feeding, as Long as It's 'Free'

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: The real costs of breast milk can be measured in economic terms, and right now, individual families are the ones who bear them. 

 BODY:
Breast-feeding mothers still need support.
Much of the narrative around breast-feeding of late about the "backlash." In one segment of society, breast-feeding is seen as nearly ubiquitous - so ubiquitous that to do anything else, no matter the reason, is to court disapproval and even condemnation. When you read an article on the necessity of defending that choice (like those from Marie C. Baca, writing here and Chris Kornelis, writing for The Atlantic), you might think that only the "fearless formula feeder" needs support, while the triumphant nursing mother, saluted by the phrase "breast is best," revels in the security of a job well done.
You would be wrong. And creating an artificial sense of division between those mothers based on how they feed their babies distracts us from the real problem: how little we do to support either mother. In some cases, it's that lack of support that creates the distinction. 
With the United States ranked last in breast-feeding support by Save the Children in its State of the World's Mothers report for 2012; with nearly 40 percent of women not eligible for maternity leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act; and with every individual woman responsible for cobbling together a structure that will allow her to care for her infant while still putting a roof over the baby's head, new mothers need all the support they can get, and they aren't getting much. Breast-feeding mothers, or mothers who hope to breast-feed, need to be present for their infant (or their breast pump) in ways that make that lack of support even more challenging. A pat on the back from your doctor and the approbation of the mothers down the block may be nice, but that and a MetroCard will get you a subway ride to work and not much else.
As I've written here before, breast-feeding isn't free. It takes time to nurse a baby, and anyone with a job that pays by the hour knows in a deeply personal way that time is money. Pumping mothers who have to ask for special dispensation to pump at work are often perceived as costing their employers in lost time. Women who breast-feed for six months or more experience a decline in income with long-reaching effects. Breast milk has costs that can be measured in economic terms, and individual families are the ones that bear them.
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation recently surveyed 1,300 Americans about their attitudes toward breast-feeding. The questions were couched in positive terms (as befits an organizationworking to build a movement supporting breast-feeding), and the responses were overwhelmingly positive as well.
62 percent of respondents strongly agreed that "all women should be encouraged to breast-feed because of the health benefits for babies and society" (and an additional 25 percent agreed).
61 percent strongly agreed that "whether or not a woman breast-feeds should not be dictated by the quality of health care she receives or her work situation" (and an additional 21 percent agreed).
61 percent strongly agreed that "everyone can play a role in making it easier for mothers who want to breast-feed" (and another 24 percent agreed).
Respondents were also asked what might make it easier for women in this country to breast-feed their children. Among the things that a majority thought would be "very helpful": clean, private spaces in public places where women can go to breast-feed their children. Pamphlets. Discussions. Workplaces that support breast-feeding mothers by offering space to pump and a place to store breast milk.
Things got a little iffy when those same enthusiastic supporters of breast-feeding were asked if "government policies that support breast-feeding" would be helpful: only 41 percent said "very." And then there's the question that wasn't asked: if 72 percent of you agree or strongly agree that "all babies should be breast-fed exclusively for a minimum of six months as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics," then wouldn't it be "very helpful" if the mothers of those babies could all take at least some paid time off to do just that?
Who thinks many of those respondents would have put their money where their mouth is, even in responding to a survey?
It's time to ask. We don't, as a society, put our money on breast-feeding. We recommend it, but we don't pay for it. Women who go back to work quickly after having a baby are less likely to breast-feed, and many women in the United States have no choice but to return to work as soon as they're able. Only 11 percentof all private-industry workers have access to paid family leave. Among state and local government employees, the number is slightly higher - 16 percent. Federal workers don't get any, though all employees may be able to use accrued sick leave. Hotel chains, box stores, casual dining - those may be where the jobs are, but most aren't where you'll find a maternity-leave benefit for hourly workers. We'd all have to pay another nickel for that giant roll of paper towels, motel room or chimichanga.
Of course, you can breast-feed a baby exclusively and still go back to work the minute you're back on your feet. You can do it if you're a C.E.O. who installs a nursery next to her office, and you can do it if you're a line worker in an assembly plant with enough breaks to pump for an infant eating every two hours, or maybe have a relative willing to bring the baby by to actually nurse. Granted, you might be working heavy equipment on a minimum of sleep, but that's a small price to pay to further our national credo: we're all in this alone.
In a Your Money column, Tara Siegel Bernard wrote about the many benefits to families, babies, employers and society from paid maternal-leave policies: lower infant mortality rates, lower illness and hospitalization rates for infants who are more likely to be breast-fed, benefits to women's health, and economic gains from reducing health-care costs and women's overall time out of the work force. Yet the United States is the only advanced economy without some form of paid leave.
Paid leave wouldn't automatically lead to breast-feeding for all, nor should it. The argument for supporting the opportunity to breast-feed among all women, rather than making breast milk a luxury good, isn't one over whether "breast is best." It's an argument about how we do, and don't, support families, and about whether we as a society will ever accept that every one of us benefits when our children are given every opportunity to thrive.

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley's Simkowitz Is Promoted

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: Morgan Stanley has named Dan Simkowitz co-head of global capital markets, according to an internal memo recently sent to employees. 

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley has named Dan Simkowitz as the firm's co-head of global capital markets, according to an internal memo recently sent to firm employees. 
Mr. Simkowitz, chairman of global capital markets, will run the department with the current head, Raj Dhanda.
The move is a promotion for Mr. Simkowitz, who had been rumored to be a contender to become the firm's chief financial officer. Morgan Stanley's current chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, is seen as a leading contender for deputy secretary at the United States Treasury Department. 
Morgan Stanley's move to name a co-head of the department has led to speculation that the firm may have other plans for Mr. Dhanda. However, a number of people at the firm played down that suggestion, saying Mr. Simkowitz brings strong client skills to the job, which complement Mr. Dhanda's managerial strengths. 
Mr. Simkowitz is a well-known figure on Wall Street. He played a crucial role in the 2010 public offering of General Motors. During the financial crisis, he advised the Treasury Department on how best to deal with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage giants. Mr. Simkowitz was also heavily involved in the public offering of Facebook, which has drawn criticism from investors who say it was overpriced. Morgan Stanley, which led that offering, has stood by its actions.
Capital markets is a bright spot at Morgan Stanley. In 2012, Morgan Stanley was the top global underwriter of public offerings, according to data provider Thomson Reuters. So far this year it is running fifth.

HEADLINE: Magazine Cover Draws Claims of Racism

BYLINE: TANZINA VEGA


HIGHLIGHT: A Bloomberg Businessweek magazine cover published this week about the housing rebound in the United States &#8212; featuring cartoonish minorities holding fistfuls of money &#8212; has drawn intense criticism from readers and critics of the news media. 

 BODY:
A Bloomberg Businessweek magazine cover published Feb. 25 about the housing rebound in the United States - featuring cartoonish minorities holding fistfuls of money - has drawn intense criticism from readers and media critics, some of whom have described the cover as racist. 
"Our cover illustration last week got strong reactions, which we regret," Josh Tyrangiel, the magazine's editor, said in a statement on Thursday. "Our intention was not to incite or offend. If we had to do it over again we'd do it differently."
But his statement came too late to head off pointed criticism online. Some posts on Twitter called it a "non-apology," and by Thursday afternoon, a handful of people had signed an online petition urging the company to pull the cover. (A new issue, however, is already on newsstands.)
Matthew Yglesias, a business correspondent at Slate, prompted much of the online commentary after questioning the cover in a post on the Web site Thursday morning. While praising the publication for being "a genuinely great magazine that does an amazing job of making business and economics news accessible and interesting," he said Bloomberg Businessweek "ought to be ashamed" for its cover choice.

Ryan Chittum, at the Columbia Journalism Review, said the cover was "clearly a mistake" because of "its cast of black and Hispanic caricatures with exaggerated features reminiscent of early 20th-century race cartoons." What made it even more offensive, Mr. Chittum wrote, "is the fact that race has been a key backdrop to the subprime crisis."
In a statement, Andres Guzman, the illustrator who created the cover, said, "The assignment was an illustration about housing. I simply drew the family like that because those are the kind of families I know. I am Latino and grew up around plenty of mixed families." According to Mr. Guzman's Tumblr page, he was born in Lima, Peru and lives in Minneapolis.
In an interview, Hugo Balta, the president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, said the cover "continues to speak to the insensitivity of how minorities, and in this case Latinos, are being portrayed in media."
"I think it oversimplifies an issue that obviously has tremendous financial impact to the country, and it also puts a face to a community that is too often vulnerable to those types of attacks," Mr. Balta said. "If we go with the old saying that a picture is worth a thousands words, the message in this picture is that it's the minority's fault."
Mr. Balta said he planned to contact Bloomberg Businessweek to discuss the issue.
Gregory Lee Jr., the president of the National Association of Black Journalists, said in a statement, "The image that was published by Bloomberg Businessweek is just a microcosm of a bigger problem in the magazine industry - the lack of diversity."
"The last presidential election demonstrated that our nation's demographics are changing rapidly and it is essential that media companies should make the appropriate changes to welcome diversity in their newsrooms, specifically in managerial positions," Mr. Lee said.
