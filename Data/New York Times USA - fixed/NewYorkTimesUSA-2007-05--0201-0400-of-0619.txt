HEADLINE: Shareholders Give Ex-Chief The Blame For Ford Woes

BYLINE: By RITA K. FARRELL

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., May 10 

 BODY:
A group of Ford Motor shareholders took turns blaming the company's executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., at the annual meeting Thursday, criticizing every decision he made as the former chief executive except one. That was his decision last September to hire a Boeing executive, Alan R. Mulally, as his successor. 
 Mr. Mulally, 61, a boyish-looking aeronautical engineer who worked for Boeing for 37 years and rose to become its senior vice president, was widely credited with rescuing its commercial airline division from its economic troubles after the events of 9/11.
 ''Alan knows what it's like to have your back to the wall, and fight your way out with a well-conceived plan and great execution,'' Mr. Ford has said.
 Now Ford has its back to the wall, with a $12.7 billion loss in 2006, seven consecutive quarterly losses and a shrinking market share.
 Mr. Mulally, alternating between empathy with shareholder concerns and optimism for the company's ''Way Forward'' recovery plan, urged the 79 shareholders who gathered for the meeting at the Hotel du Pont to have patience, and promised results ''in the months and the years ahead.''
 ''We are moving quickly and making real progress,'' he said. ''But it's going to take time to turn things around.''
 The automaker, based in Detroit, has borrowed $23.5 billion to help finance accelerated product development and a reduction in operating costs that includes closing 16 plants and eliminating 44,000 jobs by 2012. 
 A provision of the loan, which is secured by assets that include the company's trademark blue oval logo, effectively bars Ford from paying dividends until 2013, according to a spokeswoman, Becky Sanch. 
 Shareholders voting by proxy re-elected the 12 current board members with 95.9 percent of the votes cast. All seven shareholder proposals failed, including those calling for a reduction in greenhouse gases, performance-based compensation for executives and health care as a fiduciary duty.
 But support increased for a proposal to extinguish the Ford family's 40 percent voting control through their supervoting shares by recapitalizing all outstanding stock to one vote per share. The proposal won 27.4 percent of the vote this year, up from 22.9 percent in 2006.
 After the meeting, Mr. Mulally told reporters that as a global company, Ford was ''absolutely supporting free trade,'' notwithstanding the increasing market share in North America of its rival Toyota. 
 He also acknowledged that there would be industry consolidation because of market overcapacity. 
 When asked if there had been talk of a merger at Ford, Ms. Sanch said, ''There has been a lot of speculation. But it's nothing we're interested in. We're focused on turning around our business, not on any type of merger or acquisition.''
 She said she knew of no contact from a potential buyer.

HEADLINE: Rate in Europe Held Steady; Currency Rise Stirs Concern

BYLINE: By G. THOMAS SIMS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 10 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank on Thursday signaled that it would lift borrowing costs as early as June to prevent a robust European economy from stoking inflation, even as the surging euro begins to crimp corporate profits and slow exports.
 The bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said policy makers had left interest rates unchanged at 3.75 percent, but suggested that rates could be increased in June, which would be the eighth increase since 2005.
Also Thursday, the Bank of England lifted its benchmark lending rate to 5.5 percent, a fourth increase since August, in an effort to tame the British economy. 
 In a hint of concern about the euro's rapid rise, Mr. Trichet also tried to talk up the dollar, underlining fears that an excessive rise in the euro could pose an economic risk.
 Companies including the carmaker BMW and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury-goods conglomerate, are beginning to warn that the strong euro, which has surged near its highest levels against the dollar and the yen, is starting to weigh on business.
 European officials have been fairly relaxed about the euro's upward trend, which is driven by high interest rates and economic stability but makes exports more costly. 
 On Tuesday, finance ministers urged Nicolas Sarkozy, the president-elect of France, to stop calling on the central bank to weaken the euro in order to help French companies.
 The relative political calm is in contrast to previous periods of euro strength, when European economies were not nearly as healthy as now. Signs of a solid economic recovery mean that exporters can more easily absorb the competitive disadvantage of a stronger euro.
 Other factors have helped cushion the impact of the euro's strength on European business: foreign markets remain strong; corporate overhauls have increased competitiveness; and the rises in energy bills have been limited because many companies pay for oil in weak dollars.
 But at multinational companies that do substantial business in Japan and the United States, profits are declining and exports waning, and executives at such companies are starting to put pressure on the European Central Bank. Bernard Arnault, chief executive of LVMH, said Thursday that he wanted the bank to be ''more attentive to the strength of the euro and French growth.''
 Criticism from executives could increase if the euro moves closer to $1.40, and the central bank raises rates. The euro slipped to $1.3486 after the meeting Thursday, down from $1.3680 two weeks ago. In New York, it edged up to $1.3508.
 In a sign that the central bank does not want to see an excessive rise in the euro, Mr. Trichet noted at a news conference in Dublin on Thursday ''that the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and U.S. authorities have confirmed that a strong dollar was in the interest of the United States. '' He abandoned his usual practice of not commenting on currencies.
 The euro's strength is beginning to force some companies to make hard choices. The auto parts maker Bosch, which sells many of its products in Detroit, announced recently that the strong euro would keep a lid on revenue growth. Business so far this year has been ''restrained.''
 To counteract that, Bosch is investing in lower-cost regions abroad. It is also considering layoffs of some of its high-wage German employees.
 And BMW warns that the dollar's ''continuing weakness'' against the euro is partly to blame for a 34 percent decline in its first-quarter profit. 
 Europeans have regarded the dollar's decline as inevitable because the United States is highly indebted and consumer savings low. This has given European companies a lot of time to prepare for the stronger euro as they hedge their currency risks.

HEADLINE: Blair Choreographs End to a Stewardship Dogged by Iraq

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, May 10 

 BODY:
He announced the end with much the same flourish as, 10 years ago, he initiated a decade in power that became known as his era. By turns pensive, boastful and humble, Tony Blair made a final pitch to his followers on Thursday to accept that, whatever else, he did what he thought was right.
 Traveling in presidential style by executive jet and motorcade to his northern constituency, Mr. Blair announced after months of speculation that he would give up the post of prime minister on June 27. The date will bookmark a decade in which he sacrificed his popularity to the war in Iraq and struggled at home to improve schools, policing and hospitals.
Yet he and his allies seemed to suggest Thursday that for all the missteps, he changed something in his nation's debate and its mood, and, with it, Britain's place in the world. ''This is a country today that for all its faults, for all the myriad of unresolved problems and fresh challenges, is comfortable in the 21st century -- at home in its own skin, able not just to be proud of its past but confident of its future,'' he said. 
 As the site for his announcement, Mr. Blair chose a packed meeting room in the Labor Party club in the village of Trimdon, part of his Sedgefield parliamentary constituency in the northeast -- the symbolic font of his political legitimacy where he was first elected as a lawmaker in 1983.
 And just as when he rose to power in 1997, buoyed by a landslide election victory that ended Labor's 18 years in opposition, with evangelical zeal he asked his followers to believe in him. ''Hand on heart, I did what I thought was right,'' he said. ''I may have been wrong. That's your call. But believe one thing: I did what I thought was right for our country.'' 
 ''This is the greatest nation on earth,'' he concluded. ''It has been an honor to serve it. I give my thanks to you, the British people, for the times I have succeeded, and my apologies to you for the times I have fallen short.''
 The announcement was the start of a choreographed farewell that the Conservative leader, David Cameron, has mocked as ''the government of the living dead.'' 
 Between now and his departure, Mr. Blair plans to attend European Union and international summit meetings. According to British news media reports, he has also scheduled trips to France, Africa and the United States, and will seek to press laws through Parliament before handing power over to a successor -- almost certainly Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer. ''He's a showman,'' a columnist, Jonathan Freedland, said in a blog. ''And every showman loves a big finish.''
 Mr. Blair struck more statesmanlike tones. ''Today I announce my decision to stand down from the leadership of the Labor Party,'' he said.
 ''The party will now select a new leader. On the 27th of June I will tender my resignation from the post of prime minister to the queen. I have been prime minister of this country for just over 10 years. In this job, in the world today, I think that is long enough for me, but more especially for the country.''
 His wife, Cherie Booth, the source of much controversy during the Blair era, was in the audience as he spoke, and he paid tribute to her. He did not directly endorse Mr. Brown as his successor, but he lauded a government run by both men. ''There is only one government since 1945 that can say all of the following: more jobs, fewer unemployed, better health and education results, lower crime and economic growth in every quarter,'' he said. ''This one.'' 
 But his convictions led Mr. Blair to order British troops into action in Africa, the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq. He supported Israel's war against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon last year. He made no secret of his belief in military power, as he once put it, to reorder the world. 
 Yet soon after taking office in 1997, he declared: ''Mine is the first generation able to contemplate the possibility that we may live our entire lives without going to war or sending our children to war. That is a prize beyond value.''
 On Thursday he dwelled at length on a hallmark of his leadership -- his readiness to take unpopular decisions out of conviction, as he did in Iraq, striking an alliance with President Bush that brought him opprobrium and mistrust at home
 ''Doubt, hesitation, reflection, consideration and reconsideration -- these are all the good companions of proper decision-making,'' he said. ''But the ultimate obligation is to decide.'' In so doing, on a variety of issues besides Iraq, his allies said, Mr. Blair remade the country. ''The country isn't perfect, but, boy, it has made progress,'' said Alan Milburn, a former Labor minister.
 Mr. Blair spoke, too, of perhaps the most decisive moment of his decade in office -- his response to the terrorist attacks in the United States and the subsequent actions he took as an ally of the United States that sent his ratings plummeting and embroiled his country in unpopular warfare.
 ''Removing Saddam and his sons from power, as with removing the Taliban, was over with relative ease,'' he said. ''But the blowback since, from global terrorism and those elements that support it, has been fierce and unrelenting and costly. For many, it simply isn't and can't be worth it.
 ''For me, I think we must see it through,'' he continued. ''They, the terrorists, who threaten us here and round the world, will never give up if we give up. It is a test of will and of belief. And we can't fail it.'' 
 Mr. Blair did not mention his initial argument for joining the Iraq campaign -- Saddam Hussein's supposed possession of unconventional weapons that were never found -- preferring to focus on his rectitude rather than the deep mistrust inspired by his rationale for the war. Neither did he explain the link between Sept. 11 and the Iraq war -- a link many Britons disputed. 
 ''The word Iraq is carved on his political tombstone,'' said George Galloway, a maverick lawmaker from the minority Respect party.
 Coincidentally, while Mr. Blair was speaking, the Bank of England announced a quarter-percentage-point increase in the basic interest rate to its highest in six years, 5.5 percent -- an increase intended to curb inflation that has cast a shadow over Labor's economic record. 
 The choreography of Mr. Blair's farewell suggested that he did not want his departure to evoke humiliating comparisons to Margaret Thatcher's ouster by her own party in 1990. When he announced last year that he would step down, he was widely seen as being under overwhelming pressure to quit from supporters of Mr. Brown. 
 ''Tony Blair has been the most successful leader ever in our 100-year history,'' said Peter Hain, the Northern Ireland minister. ''Britain is a much fairer, much more tolerant, more democratic place than it was 10 years ago.'' He said this week's installation of a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland was ''an inescapable achievement.''
 The opposition Conservatives assailed both his record on public services and his credibility. ''There has been so much spin in that, the word of government is less believed than at any other time,'' said William Hague, the Conservative foreign affairs spokesman. ''We will be glad to see the back of him.''

HEADLINE: Romney Works to Put Skeptics' Doubts to Rest

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: AMES, Iowa, May 10 

 BODY:
Bart Pals, a county chairman for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, had been given talking points to use when he introduced the former Massachusetts governor at an event in northern Iowa on Wednesday.
 But Mr. Pals chose to depart from the script to assert that Mr. Romney's shift in recent years against abortion was not a ''flip-flop'' but the result of a ''thoughtful moral process.'' He also told the crowd in Clear Lake that he was not turned off by Mr. Romney's Mormonism.
''My concern is that he has a moral compass,'' said Mr. Pals, 48, ''and his moral compass is pointing in the same direction as mine.''
 Mr. Pals's conclusion may have been encouraging to Mr. Romney. But the fact that he felt compelled to defend Mr. Romney when it comes to abortion and religion only underscored the challenge Mr. Romney faces as he courts conservative voters in politically significant states like Iowa. 
 In national polls, Mr. Romney is still sometimes in single digits. But his more immediate problem, given his need to do well among Republican primary voters in the first contests early next year, may be the continued concerns of many conservative Christians about his religion -- some evangelicals view Mormonism as something akin to a cult -- and his relatively recent shift from supporter of abortion rights to opponent.
 Mr. Romney is also encountering questions about whether, as a governor with little foreign policy experience, he has sufficient national security credentials to reassure voters of his ability to be commander in chief at a time when the war in Iraq and the threat of terrorism are overriding issues. Even his signature achievement as governor, the creation of a health care program intended to cover nearly every resident in Massachusetts, has left some conservatives wondering about Mr. Romney's commitment to small government.
 Still, the increasingly unsettled state of the Republican field has given him his best chance yet to make progress. He received generally positive reviews in the first Republican debate last week. He has shown he can raise substantial sums of money to finance his bid. He has put together an experienced staff and has begun an effort to reach out to evangelicals in Iowa, South Carolina and other states where social conservatives are an influential voting bloc. And he has an opportunity to capitalize on the problems afflicting his main competitors, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and Senator John McCain of Arizona.
 ''There are times when you have updrafts, and there are times when there are downdrafts,'' Mr. Romney said in an interview. ''This is an updraft for me.''
 In particular, the renewed focus on Mr. Giuliani's longstanding support for abortion rights, combined with suspicions among some conservatives about Mr. McCain's ideological reliability, has given Mr. Romney an opening to convince them that he is their true champion in this election. 
 His crowds of several hundred on Wednesday in Iowa were among the largest he has had, and interviews with several social conservative leaders suggested he is making some inroads. But there were also indications that he still faces skepticism. 
 Tamara Scott, who heads the Iowa chapter of Concerned Women for America, a conservative Christian group, said the focus among many evangelicals seems to be moving beyond theological differences.
 ''When people come up and just want to discuss it with you, his flip-flopping is more what I hear,'' Ms. Scott said.
 Even among evangelicals who say they are at least willing to consider Mr. Romney, support in many cases appears to be shaky. Larry Gordon, senior pastor of Cornerstone World Outreach in Sioux City, said his initial instinct was to rule out Mr. Romney because of his faith. But after his son, who is also a pastor at the church, came away impressed by Mr. Romney after an event, he began to examine him more closely.
 ''If nobody better comes along, I'm going to vote for him,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''But I'm hoping somebody better comes along.''
 It is still not clear whether the problems that Mr. Romney, Mr. McCain and Mr. Giuliani face might tempt former Senator Fred D. Thompson or Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, into the race, or allow another of the declared Republican candidates a shot at the nomination. But for now, Mr. Romney is trying to take full advantage of a moment in which many Republicans seem willing to shop around.
 As evidence that his campaign is gaining strength, Mr. Romney and his aides cited a recent New Hampshire poll that showed him leading in the state, although rival campaigns have challenged the accuracy of the survey. They also pointed to a new poll in Michigan, another early state, where Mr. Romney grew up, which shows him leading there as well. 
 He made his first appearance last week on ''The Tonight Show'' with Jay Leno. Mr. Romney is also on the cover of the new Time magazine, scheduled to hit newsstands on Friday, and will be the subject of a feature on ''60 Minutes'' on Sunday. 
 He tweaked his stump speech this week in what appeared to be a fresh attempt to distinguish himself from Mr. McCain and Mr. Giuliani on social issues. In Iowa, Mr. Romney introduced to audiences the metaphor of a three-legged stool, reflecting what he described as core conservative Republican principles: ''strong military, strong economy, strong families.''
 ''In my view, you've got to talk about all three for the Republican stool to stand,'' he said. ''Two won't hold it up.''
 Beyond trying to gain an advantage on social issues, he is emphasizing that he would have a muscular approach to national security. He highlights his successful business career to make a case that he knows how to manage the economy. And he is taking a conservative stance on immigration, opposing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, an issue that could prove troublesome for Mr. McCain, who worked for such a route in the Senate last year.
 Mr. Romney mounted a new advertisement recently in Iowa, New Hampshire and on national cable networks that plays up his call to increase the size of the military. Another commercial that features him wielding his veto pen in Massachusetts continues to run nationally. Mr. McCain and Mr. Giuliani have not yet rolled out any commercials.
 In his continued courtship of evangelical voters, Mr. Romney's campaign is dispatching Mark DeMoss, an evangelical publicist whose clients include the Rev. Franklin Graham, the son of the Rev. Billy Graham, and Jay Sekulow, a prominent evangelical activist and lawyer, to meet with conservative Christian leaders in South Carolina, Iowa and elsewhere.
 Mr. DeMoss had his first meetings with evangelical pastors in Greenville, S.C., on Wednesday. The pastors appeared receptive and some were even enthusiastic, he said, but most continue to hold back from public support.
 ''The idea of an evangelical supporting a Mormon for president, it's a new idea,'' he said. ''This scenario has never presented itself before. And because of that, and because of the theological issues that some people have raised, I think a lot of evangelicals are just approaching this very cautiously.''
 Mr. Romney's basic strategy is to try to use strong showings in the early voting primary states, many of which have large numbers of conservative voters, to slingshot him to the front of the Republican field. 
 In a first step in that strategy, he and his aides are focusing on the straw poll here in August. It is a largely symbolic but potentially important contest that Mr. Giuliani has yet to decide whether to compete in.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Romney repeatedly called on audience members to attend the straw poll, which is ''in 97 days,'' adding with a wink, but ''who's counting?''

HEADLINE: State Closes Coal-Fired Plant That Failed to Limit Emissions

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: STONY POINT, N.Y., May 10 

 BODY:
Four years ago, a company that owns two local power plants settled a lawsuit with New York State by agreeing to install $100 million worth of pollution control technology at one of them, its coal-fired plant here, or shut it down. 
 At the time, the company, Mirant New York, said it would move forward with the upgrades at its Lovett plant. But on Thursday, state officials announced a different outcome. In a news conference here, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said the state was forcing the plant to close after Mirant failed to reduce emissions with new technology.
One unit of the plant closed on Monday, while the other will close in one year, as stipulated by a 2003 consent decree.
 The emissions from the 350-megawatt Lovett plant are linked to acid rain and smog. At the time of the settlement, state environmental officials said the emissions from Lovett alone, which looms over the west bank of the Hudson River, represented a quarter of the sulfur dioxide and almost a third of the nitrogen oxide released by electric generators in seven counties in the Hudson Valley. 
 The state also announced on Thursday that it had won a concession from Mirant, the area's largest taxpayer, that should assuage residents of this town as well as the neighboring town of Haverstraw, where the company has its Bowline plant, an oil-powered generating station. 
 Area residents are reeling from a settlement last year with Mirant in which Rockland County and several taxing entities agreed to pay the company $275 million to make up for tax overcharges dating back more than a decade. 
 The settlement has led to an increase in local taxes for several municipalities. To meet the terms of the settlement, the North Rockland school district, which is now on an austerity budget, recently issued a 30-year bond to raise $220 million for a tax refund. 
 State officials, realizing that the closing of Lovett could result in new tax headaches for the area, won a commitment from Mirant not to challenge its tax assessment for the Bowline plant for the next two years. The company also pledged $1 million for energy conservation projects in northern Rockland County.
 ''This is a win for the environment and also a win for the taxpayers,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''We're going to reduce pollution, and with this agreement we're also going to protect the taxpayers of Stony Point and Haverstraw.''
 A spokesman for Mirant New York, Louis F. Friscoe, said in a phone interview that the company had decided not to upgrade the Lovett plant. ''Because of the vintage of the facility and the cost of the new technology, we just thought the economics weren't there,'' he said.
 But the Atlanta-based Mirant Corporation, which owns two dozen plants nationwide and recently emerged from bankruptcy, is exploring the possibility of building new natural-gas-fired plants on the sites of Lovett and Bowline, Mr. Friscoe said. Natural gas burns cleaner than coal or oil.
 In a statement, Mirant's chairman and chief executive officer, Edward R. Muller, cited state estimates that the Hudson Valley would need increased electrical generation by 2011. He said that Mirant would ''work with the state to insure that the new generation is built there to serve New York consumers.''

HEADLINE: Facebook to Offer Free Classified Ads Online

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 10 

 BODY:
Facebook, the social networking Web site, is adding free classified ad listings, putting it into competition with dozens of established companies like Craigslist and many newspapers. 
 Facebook, which has 22 million active users, more than half of them in high school or college, hopes that the new feature will offer yet another reason for users to return to its site regularly, instead of going elsewhere to conduct their Internet business.
''We don't try to lock people up or take more of their time, but we try to provide them with easier ways to do the things they want to do on the Internet,'' said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, who noted that more than 60 percent of the site's active users log in each day. ''If we can provide people with efficient tools, they will use the site more.'' 
 Facebook, based in Palo Alto, Calif., is calling the new service Marketplace and plans to introduce it on Friday. It will allow users to create classified listings in four categories: housing; jobs; for sale, where users can list things like concert tickets and used bikes; and ''other,'' a catch-all that could include things like solicitations for rides home for the holidays. 
 Facebook users who create classifieds can choose to show them only to their designated friends on the service, or to anyone in one of their ''networks'' -- their high school, college, company or geographic region. They can choose to make the listings appear on their profile pages, and send them out on ''news feeds,'' the automatic updates that appear when users log in to the site. 
 Mr. Zuckerberg created Facebook as an undergraduate at Harvard in 2004. It is now the nation's sixth-most-visited Web site, according to the tracking firm ComScore. Its popularity is based partly on the privacy measures it offers. Only designated friends or people in users' networks can see their full profile pages, in contrast to the chaotic freedom on MySpace, the site owned by the News Corporation that is Facebook's main rival.
 The combination of social networking and classified advertising appears to be in vogue these days. MySpace, the largest social networking site, has offered classified advertising nearly since its introduction; Friendster, which has been surpassed by newer entrants to the market, also said this week that it was adding classifieds through a partnership with Olx.com. 
 ''The advantage of having classifieds linked to a social network is that you know something about the seller,'' said Charlene Li, an analyst at Forrester Research. ''You are less likely to buy a lemon from someone who is a friend of yours.''
 On Facebook, buyers will be able to see how they are connected to the seller -- the series of links between the friends they share. ''There are no anonymous listings, and we give you a very clear path to see how you can trust the other person you are conducting business with,'' Mr. Zuckerberg said.
 Although the Facebook Marketplace is free, it could eventually create some revenue for the company, which has reportedly shunned acquisition offers in the past from Yahoo. Mr. Zuckerberg said he planned to one day allow sellers to pay to more widely promote their listings on the site. He also noted that the service could create new opportunities to serve up related ads around certain kinds of listings. 
 Many established companies are likely to be paying attention to the new service. Most notably, Craigslist, which is based in San Francisco and offers classified ads for more than 300 cities that are largely free. Job sites like Monster.com and CareerBuilder, which have services aimed at college graduates, are also likely to take notice, as are dozens of other online classified ventures and car-trading sites.
 Traditional media like college newspapers, which rely to a varying degree on classified ads, may be threatened as well. ''If Facebook can provide a larger audience at a lower price than traditional media, people will shift their advertising dollars,'' said Daniel A. Jauernig, chief executive of Classified Ventures, a joint venture of five media companies including the Tribune Company and the Washington Post Company.

HEADLINE: Paint by the Numbers (When Your Canvas Is the Bathroom Wall)

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It is time to paint the bathroom again. Cracks are showing up on the door and the ceiling -- well, you don't want to know about the ceiling.
 But if we do the bathroom, then we really have to do the hall, which the boys seem to use to test how many indelible handprints they can creatively scatter around.
And so on.
 I used to think the only problem was coming up with the money to hire Marcelino (our fabulous painter) to do the job. But recently our neighbor Eliza, a fashionable European, was visiting and discussing how she had painted her living room with a specialty paint that contains no black pigment and just glowed. 
 What?
 I went over to check it out; indeed, a very pretty shade of yellow from the Donald Kaufman Color Collection. 
 ''They're much more luminous,'' Eliza said. ''They never veer to gray, no matter the light.''
 They also run $50 to $80 a gallon.
 Then my friend Nadya, whose son has allergies, told me how she had mixed her own low-fume paint, bought from Bioshield (www.bioshieldpaint.com). 
 ''You can dilute it depending on how you want it to look,'' she said. ''If the color's too rich, you keep diluting.'' 
 My head was spinning. When we were choosing paints, I could barely deal with the color wheel that showed umpteen shades of green. Still, I hate to be narrow-minded -- what was I missing?
 To start at the high end: for the well-heeled connoisseur, there are companies like Farrow & Ball, Fine Paints of Europe, Sydney Harbour and the Donald Kaufman Color Collection.
 ''Each color is treated according to its requirements,'' said Mr. Kaufman, who started mixing colors for architects and designers in California in the 1970s and now has a small collection available to the public (www.donaldkaufmancolor.com/kaufman.swf). ''Each color has individual characteristics.
 ''You can put a tenth or a thousandth of an ounce of a red into a white and you won't notice it except how it interacts with the light,'' he said.
 If that is a little too esoteric, here is something more concrete to grab onto: a typical paint product might contain two or three pigments; Mr. Kaufman might mix in 13 pigments or more to get a feel of a dyed silk fabric rather than a painted wall.
 ''We're not mass market, but we've never tried to be,'' he said. ''We've never advertised, but we've published a few books and we're word of mouth.''
 For a minimum of $10,000, he will create a custom job for you; he does about 20 to 50 a year.
 Of course, it is not unheard-of for customers or decorators to take a Donald Kaufman or Farrow & Ball color and ask their paint shop to color match it in a cheaper type of paint. It happens all the time, Mr. Kaufman figures, but while they may gain an approximate color, he said, they are losing the essence.
 O.K., time to move a bit more down to earth. Remember my friend Nadya, who mixed her own paint? She liked the company, but not the color.
 ''It was sort of golden mustard,'' she said. ''It didn't work.''
 So she went searching for low-fume paint, and found out that Benjamin Moore had just released paint on the West and East Coasts that contained far fewer volatile organic compounds than other paints. Volatile organic compounds are the chemicals that make paint smell so strongly and create smog. 
 The paint is called Benjamin Moore Aura and costs about $55 a gallon, but its selling point -- besides the low fumes -- is that it does not need a primer and has excellent coverage through a new technology called ColorLock. It will be rolling out across the country this year.
 Skip Pennucci, who has worked at my local paint store, Village Paint Supply in Larchmont, N.Y., for 21 years and knows just about everything there is to know about paint, said Aura ''is getting great reviews and it seems to be everything it says it is.''
 While customers' primary concerns are still about getting the right color and type of paint, worries about environmental impact are ''starting to be more on the radar,'' he said.
 Denise Larkin of Larchmont was in the store trying to find a green that would appear like camouflage to paint her sons' room.
 ''We're looking for something like a soldier's uniform,'' she said.
 Because it was for her children's room, she said she wanted paint with low emissions and Aura fit the bill.
 It is more expensive than other Benjamin Moore paints, which run $40 to $48 a gallon.
 Benjamin Moore is only sold in independent stores, which, Carl Minchew, a director for the paint's product development, says is one of its strengths.
 ''You can't buy it at Home Depot or Loews, but only at a local retailer who really understands the needs of each community,'' he said.
 But many, many people buy their paints at the home improvement stores. Home Depot, for example, sells primarily Behr, Glidden and Ralph Lauren paints.
 Behr generally sells for $22 a gallon, while Glidden can be under $10 a gallon, said Bruce Nelson, a merchandising vice president for Home Depot.
 In a March report, Consumer Reports did not test some of the reformulated paints like Benjamin Moore Aura, but it did give the highest mark in most categories to Behr.
 The tests included how well two coats of paint covered dark color, how it held up to abrasive cleaners, fade resistance and ability to stop mildew.
 So just go for the cheapest can of paint you can find?
 No, according to Debbie Zimmer, paint and color expert at the Rohm & Haas Paint Quality Institute, which is a branch of the paint ingredient manufacturer Rohm & Haas.
 ''Every paint manufacturer has various lines from economy grades to the top-of-line,'' she said. ''The top-of-the-line uses the higher-quality ingredients and additives,'' which will affect everything from how it preserves in the can, how it flows from the brush, how smoothly it goes on the wall and how well it holds up over time.
 So, she said, although her institute does not recommend specific brands, it does say consumers are generally well served in buying the premium line of a brand.
 Unfortunately, she said, because of the way paint cans are labeled, it is virtually impossible for the average consumer to be able to discern if it contains higher-quality ingredients.
 Figuring out what paint to use is only the beginning. Next is choosing the color. Let's see, do I want Winter White, Pale Oak, Seapearl, Dove Wing or White Dove? Natural Cream, Soft Chamois, Muslin, Clay Beige, White Sand or Ballet White?
 Or maybe the bathroom can wait another year.
 Update: Many of you wrote in response to my last column on how not to miss your flight suggesting an alternative to buying expensive bottles of water at the airport: bring empty water bottles and fill them at the water fountains after passing through security.

HEADLINE: Alfred D. Chandler Jr., a Business Historian, Dies at 88

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Alfred D. Chandler Jr., an economic historian who revolutionized the writing of business history, shunning the old debate about whether tycoons are good or bad, and instead arguing persuasively in almost two dozen books that it was the emergence of professional management that propelled modern capitalism, died on May 9 in Cambridge, Mass. He was 88.
 Jim Aisner, a spokesman for Harvard Business School, where Dr. Chandler had taught, announced the death. 
Fortune Magazine last year called Dr. Chandler ''America's pre-eminent business historian,'' saying that for a long-term perspective on the Fortune 500, the magazine's ranking of the biggest corporations, ''there's really only one person to ask.''
 Before Dr. Chandler, the bulk of business histories were morality plays that portrayed executives as heroic or damnable. He helped redirect the field toward dispassionate analysis of the anatomy of business. He emphasized the transformative power of technology as railroads and the telegraph spawned big business. These corporations needed what Mr. Chandler called ''a new subspecies of economic man -- the salaried manager.''
 The salaried manager represented a new concept: a manager could possess management expertise independent of the content of what he was managing. Unlike the traditional entrepreneur, he need have no stake in the company he managed. 
 Dr. Chandler developed this theme most famously in ''The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business'' (1977), which won the Pulitzer Prize for history and the Bancroft Prize. His thesis was that managers, functioning as a ''visible hand,'' had replaced the ''invisible hand'' of Adam Smith's free market in allocating resources.
 This new emphasis on organizational structure so transformed the field of business history that some call the period before Dr. Chandler's publications ''B.C.,'' meaning before Chandler. Glenn Porter wrote in 1992 in ''The Rise of Big Business, 1860-1920'': ''Virtually every work now written on the history of modern, large-scale enterprise must begin by placing itself within the Chandlerian analytical framework.'' 
 Dr. Chandler's work was distinguished by an intellectual rigor he gleaned from the sociologist Talcott Parsons, one of his professors at Harvard. Dr. Chandler rigorously compared earlier and later time frames to see what changed, and, more important, what caused the change. He likened the process to a controlled scientific experiment.
 His conclusions jolted conventional wisdom. For example, he said that America's industrial revolution did not start in New England mills, but with the beginning of large-scale mining of anthracite coal fields in Pennsylvania in the 1830s and 1840s. This new power source replaced water, wood and charcoal, facilitating the making of iron and metal products. 
 Alfred du Pont Chandler Jr. was born in Guyencourt, Del., on Sept. 15, 1918. Although he was not a blood relation of the du Ponts who founded the chemical company, his great-grandmother was raised by the du Ponts after her parents died of yellow fever.
 Alfred spent his first five years in Buenos Aires, where his father represented an American locomotive company. When he was 11, the family moved back to the United States and settled near Wilmington.
 Family lore has it that the boy announced his intention to become a historian by the time he was 7. He was inspired by Wilbur Fisk Gordy's book ''An Elementary History of the United States,'' a primer for sixth-graders his father gave him. He read it 19 times.
 At Phillips Exeter Academy, he won a prize for excellence in history. In 1940, he graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, where generations of his family had studied, beginning in the 18th century. During World War II, he served in the Navy, interpreting intelligence photos.
 He enrolled as a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to study Southern regional history. But he became captivated by sociology, and returned to Harvard to study with Mr. Parsons.
 He stumbled on his dissertation topic in old papers on the history of American railroads written by his great-grandfather, a founder of the financial-data company that became Standard & Poor's. The dissertation became a book, ''Henry Varnum Poor: Business Editor, Analyst and Reformer'' (1956).
 From 1950 to 1963, Dr. Chandler taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he helped edit the letters of Theodore Roosevelt and wrote ''Strategy and Structure,'' which used General Motors, DuPont, Exxon and Sears, Roebuck to develop his ideas on how companies employ organization structure to further strategy.
 Dr. Chandler taught at Johns Hopkins, where he edited the papers of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, then joined the faculty of Harvard Business School from which he retired in 1989. He was editor of the Harvard Studies in Business History.
 He was a visiting professor at Oxford and elsewhere, and president of the Economic History Association and the Business History Conference. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
 Dr. Chandler is survived by his wife, the former Fay Martin; his daughters, Alpine (Dougie) Chandler Bird, of Annapolis, Md., and Mary (Mimi) Chandler Watt, of Dina Powys, Wales; his son, Howard, of Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa.; his sisters Nina Murray, of Bedford, Mass., and Nantucket, and Sophie Consagra, of Manhattan; five grandchildren and two step-grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.

HEADLINE: The Millions Left Out

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The United States may be the richest country in the world, but there are many millions -- tens of millions -- who are not sharing in that prosperity.
 According to the most recent government figures, 37 million Americans are living below the official poverty threshold, which is $19,971 a year for a family of four. That's one out of every eight Americans, and many of them are children.
More than 90 million Americans, close to a third of the entire population, are struggling to make ends meet on incomes that are less that twice the official poverty line. In my book, they're poor. 
 We don't see poor people on television or in the advertising that surrounds us like a second atmosphere. We don't pay much attention to the millions of men and women who are changing bedpans, or flipping burgers for the minimum wage, or vacuuming the halls of office buildings at all hours of the night. But they're there, working hard and getting very little in return.
 The number of poor people in America has increased by five million over the past six years, and the gap between rich and poor has grown to historic proportions. The richest one percent of Americans got nearly 20 percent of the nation's income in 2005, while the poorest 20 percent could collectively garner only a measly 3.4 percent.
 A new report from a highly respected task force on poverty put together by the Center for American Progress tells us, ''It does not have to be this way.'' The task force has made several policy recommendations, and said that if all were adopted poverty in the U.S. could be cut in half over the next decade.
 The tremendous number of people in poverty is an enormous drag on the U.S. economy. And one of the biggest problems is the simple fact that so many jobs pay so little that even fulltime, year-round employment is not enough to raise a family out of poverty. One-fifth of the working men in America and 29 percent of working women are in such jobs.
 Peter Edelman, a Georgetown law professor who was a co-chairman of the task force, said, ''An astonishing number of people are working as hard as they possibly can but are still in poverty or have incomes that are not much above the poverty line.''
 So the starting point for lifting people out of poverty should be to see that men and women who are working are adequately compensated for their labor. The task force recommended that the federal minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour, be raised to half the average hourly wage in the U.S., which would bring it to $8.40.
 The earned-income tax credit, which has proved very successful in supplementing the earnings of low-wage working families, should be expanded to cover more workers, the task force said. It also recommended expanded coverage of the federal child care tax credit, which is currently $1,000 per child for up to three children.
 A crucial component to raising workers out of poverty would be an all-out effort to ensure that workers are allowed to form unions and bargain collectively. As the task force noted, ''Among workers in similar jobs, unionized workers have higher pay, higher rates of health coverage, and better benefits than do nonunionized workers.''
 In a recent interview about poverty, former Senator John Edwards told me: ''Organizing is so important. We have 50 million service economy jobs and we'll probably have 10 or 15 million more over the next decade. If those jobs are union jobs, they'll be middle-class families. If not, they're more likely to live in poverty. It's that strong.''
 The task force made several other recommendations, including proposals to ease access to higher education for poor youngsters, to help former prisoners find employment, to develop a more equitable unemployment compensation system, and to establish housing policies that would make it easier for poor people to move from neighborhoods of concentrated poverty to areas with better employment opportunities and higher-quality public services.
 Mr. Edelman, an adviser on social policy in the Clinton administration, stressed that there is no one answer to the problem of poverty, and that in addition to public policy initiatives, it's important to address the ''things people have to do within their own communities to take responsibility for themselves and for each other.''
 But he added, ''It is unacceptable for this country, which is so wealthy, to have this many people who are left out.''

HEADLINE: Asian Growth Offsets U.S. Slump To Prolong Industrial Metals Rally

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
''Every boom,'' it used to be said, ''has a copper roof.''
 The logic was that as industrial activity rose, the cost of industrial metals like copper would rise and rise, until their sheer high cost helped to crush the boom. 
The end of the current worldwide boom may or may not be growing near, but there is no doubt that strong world demand has done wonders for the prices of industrial metals.
 The charts accompanying this column show just how much the prices of six metals have risen since the end of 2000. 
 Two of them are precious metals, which have done very well. Silver has nearly tripled, and gold is up well over 100 percent during the period.
 But a metal does not have to glitter to have done better than gold. All four of the industrial metals have outperformed gold. Copper and zinc prices are not back to the peaks they reached last year, but they have climbed sharply in recent months. Lead and nickel prices have risen to their highest levels ever. All slipped a bit this week, but remain quite high.
 There are more than a few metals analysts who think prices are far too high. Bloomberg News this week reported that it had surveyed 12 Wall Street analysts and found the median forecast was that copper would fall 30 percent by the end of this year, and that nickel and lead would each lose half their value.
 Such declines are traditionally what one would expect in the face of a slowdown in the American economy, which has long been the most important one in the world. But even as the United States economy has slowed this year, some metals prices have risen rapidly.
 The nearby lead futures contract on the London Metals Exchange, for example, rose almost 60 percent in 2006, and gained another 20 percent this year. But that gain seems mild compared with that of nickel. It climbed more than 150 percent in 2006, and has added another 50 percent this year. Zinc more than doubled last year, and after weakening in early 2007 has come roaring back.
 Futures traders do seem to expect some declines, with contracts that expire next year showing lower prices than current quotes. But the declines are relatively small, ranging up to a 17 percent fall for nickel.
 Nickel is also the star of the group, having risen more than 600 percent since the end of 2000. The expected fall would barely dent that performance.
 If metals prices continue to rise, it may show that China, whose boom lives on, has replaced the United States as the marginal buyer of industrial commodities. And that could mean that it will take an economic downturn in Asia to end this boom. Perhaps the United States could suffer a slowdown that was barely noticed in the industrial metals market.

HEADLINE: At Commencement, a Call for Religious Literacy

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
And so, members of the graduating class of 2007, we've come almost to the end of this commencement ceremony and of these brief commencement remarks.
 We've told some predictable jokes about your imminent unemployment and your student loans. We've thanked your parents, praised your professors and stated the obvious about the world you are entering -- that it is full of dangers, full of opportunities, full of wonders, misery, love, beauty, surprises and violence.
It is also full of religion. 
 There is some question whether your education has prepared you for this latter reality, which is, of course, very much related to the former ones. 
 For a long time, quite a few people assumed that a major point of higher education was to put religion behind you. Eventually, it was also assumed, the world would do the same. Things haven't worked out that way. 
 Just what do college graduates know about religion? The data is sparse. But Stephen Prothero, chairman of the religion department at Boston University, has assembled a rather bleak picture from available polls as well as his own experience and that of other professors. 
 It is a huge scandal, Dr. Prothero writes in his recently published book, ''Religious Literacy'' (HarperSanFrancisco), that ''every year colleges provide bachelor's degrees to students who cannot name the first book of the Bible, who think that Jesus parted the Red Sea and Moses agonized in the Garden of Gethsemane, who know nothing about what Islam teaches about war and peace, and who cannot name one salient difference between Hinduism and Buddhism.''
 Admittedly, graduation day may not be the best moment to suggest a new reading assignment, but you might check out Dr. Prothero's book on religious literacy, which is subtitled, ''What Every American Needs to Know -- and Doesn't.'' You might even try the basic religious literacy quiz on Pages 27 and 28 that he has given his students, who mostly flunk it. You might peruse the 85-page ''Dictionary of Religious Literacy'' that he offers as religious ''information U.S. citizens need to make sense of their country and the world.'' 
 No doubt, your college years have brought you well beyond the high school students who think Sodom and Gomorrah were husband and wife, and Joan of Arc was married, naturally, to Noah. But how do you compare to the adults impassioned to have the Ten Commandments displayed in courthouses but unable to name half of them? Can you name the Five Pillars of Islam or who delivered the Sermon on the Mount (no, not Billy Graham, Dr. Prothero has had to point out) or a single sacred text of Hinduism? 
 Personally, Dr. Prothero suspects that ''faith without knowledge is dead.'' (Presumably you recognize that as a play on the phrase that troubled Martin Luther in the Epistle of James, ''faith without works is dead.'' Presumably you know about Martin Luther and why this troubled him.) But the purpose of a plea on behalf of religious literacy, he repeatedly insists, is not religious but civic. 
 ''In today's world it is irresponsible to use the word 'educated' to describe high school or college graduates who are ignorant of the ancient stories that continue to motivate the beliefs and behaviors of the overwhelming majority of the world's population,'' he writes. ''In a world as robustly religious as ours, it is foolish to imagine that such graduates are equipped to participate fully in the politics of the nation or the affairs of the world.'' 
 Having just completed all your requirements for graduation, you might be interested in Dr. Prothero's views on the matter. He proposes that all public high schools require one course on the Bible and one on the world's major religions. He proposes that colleges require all students to take one course in religious studies. He thinks that this can be done without proselytizing and fully in accord with the Constitution. (Incidentally, one of the things distressing him is how few college students can identify the First Amendment's two clauses dealing with religion.) 
 If high schools do not do their job, college should fill in, he says, and he is not fazed by the idea of making this mandatory. ''We do have math requirements,'' he said in a recent phone conversation. ''There's a sense that we have certain non-negotiables.''
 And remember, he also said, ''my book is called 'Religious Literacy,' not 'Religious Fluency.' I'm setting a low bar.'' It was not necessary for President Bush to have known the precise difference between Sunnis and Shias, he said, but merely to have known that there was a difference and ''that it might be important to know more.'' 
 What about atheism? Does religious literacy require the study of nonbelief? Certainly, Dr. Prothero said. At least in the West, he explained, atheism is part of the religious conversation: You cannot understand religion in the modern West without taking atheism into account, and you cannot understand atheism without understanding its religious context. 
 Perhaps Dr. Prothero overestimates what can be communicated in a fact-based course in religious studies. Perhaps he underestimates some of the important fruits of the religious diversity that you graduates have enjoyed in your dorms and classrooms. 
 It may be essential to know the basic doctrines, practices and stories of the world's great faiths -- and of atheism, too. But it is also essential to know how these believers and nonbelievers feel and think, and think about what others think about them -- the kind of knowledge that requires imagination, empathy or, what college often provides, real encounters. 
 Before this commencement day ends, graduating class of 2007, you will surely be asked to contribute to the alumni fund. But one hopes that as alumni you also have something to contribute to this fresh discussion of what a college-educated citizen should be expected to know about religion. 
 One thing is clear, Dr. Prothero says enthusiastically, ''We have a public conversation going.'' So, class of 2007, join in. And godspeed.

HEADLINE: BILLIONS IN OIL MISSING IN IRAQ, U.S. STUDY FINDS

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

 BODY:
Between 100,000 and 300,000 barrels a day of Iraq's declared oil production over the past four years is unaccounted for and could have been siphoned off through corruption or smuggling, according to a draft American government report. 
 Using an average of $50 a barrel, the report said the discrepancy was valued at $5 million to $15 million daily.
 The report does not give a final conclusion on what happened to the missing fraction of the roughly two million barrels pumped by Iraq each day, but the findings are sure to reinforce longstanding suspicions that smugglers, insurgents and corrupt officials control significant parts of the country's oil industry.
 The report also covered alternative explanations for the billions of dollars worth of discrepancies, including the possibility that Iraq has been consistently overstating its oil production. 
 Iraq and the State Department, which reports the numbers, have been under relentless pressure to show tangible progress in Iraq by raising production levels, which have languished well below the United States goal of three million barrels a day. Virtually the entire economy of Iraq is dependent on oil revenues.
 The draft report, expected to be released within the next week, was prepared by the United States Government Accountability Office with the help of government energy analysts, and was provided to The New York Times by a separate government office that received a review copy. The accountability office declined to provide a copy or to discuss the draft.
 Paul Anderson, a spokesman for the office, said only that ''we don't discuss draft reports.'' 
 But a State Department official who works on energy issues said that there were several possible explanations for the discrepancy, including the loss of oil through sabotage of pipelines and inaccurate reporting of production in southern Iraq, where engineers may not properly account for water that is pumped along with oil in the fields there.
 ''It could also be theft,'' the official said, with suspicion falling primarily on Shiite militias in the south. ''Crude oil is not as lucrative in the region as refined products, but we're not ruling that out either.'' 
 Iraqi and American officials have previously said that smuggling of refined products like gasoline and kerosene is probably costing Iraq billions of dollars a year in lost revenues. The smuggling of those products is particularly feared because officials believe that a large fraction of the proceeds go to insurgent groups. Crude oil is much more difficult to smuggle because it must be shipped to refineries and turned into the more valuable refined products before it can be sold on the market. 
 The Shiite militia groups hold sway around the rich oil fields of southern Iraq, which dominate the country's oil production, the State Department official said. For that reason, he said, the Shiite militias are more likely to be involved in theft there than the largely Sunni insurgents, who are believed to benefit mostly from smuggling refined products in the north.
 In the south, the official said, ''There is not an issue of insurgency, per se, but it could be funding Shia factions, and that could very well be true.''
 ''That would be a concern if they were using smuggling money to blow up American soldiers or kill Sunnis or do anything that could harm the unity of the country,'' the official said.
 The report by the accountability office is the most comprehensive look yet at faltering American efforts to rebuild Iraq's oil and electricity sectors. For the analysis of Iraq's oil production, the accountability office called upon experts at the Energy Information Administration within the United States Department of Energy, which has long experience in analyzing oil production and exports worldwide.
 Erik Kreil, an oil expert at the information administration who is familiar with the analysis, said a review of industry figures around the world -- exports, refinery figures and other measures -- could not account for all the oil that Iraq says it is producing. The administration also took into account how much crude oil was consumed internally, to do things like fuel Iraqi power plants and refine into gasoline and other products.
 When all those uses of the oil were taken into consideration, Mr. Kreil said, Iraq's stated production figures did not add up.
 ''Either they're producing less, or they're producing what they say and the difference is completely unaccounted for in any of the places we think it should go,'' Mr. Kreil said. ''Either it's overly optimistic, or it's unaccounted for.''
 Several analysts outside the government agreed that such a large discrepancy indicated that there was either a major smuggling operation in place or that Iraq was incapable to generate accurate production figures.
 ''That's a staggering amount of oil to lose every month,'' said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an independent economist and oil expert. ''But given everything else that's been written about Iraq, it's not a surprise.''
 Mr. Verleger added that if the oil was being smuggled out of Iraq, there would be a ready market for it, particularly in smaller refineries not controlled by large Western companies in places like China, the Caribbean and even small European countries.
 The report also contains the most comprehensive assessment yet of the billions of dollars the United States and Iraq spent on rebuilding the oil and electricity infrastructure, which is falling further and further behind its performance goals.
 Adding together both civilian and military financing, the report concludes that the United States has spent $5.1 billion of the $7.4 billion in American taxpayer money set aside to rebuild the Iraqi electricity and oil sectors. The United States has also spent $3.8 billion of Iraqi money on those sectors, the report says.
 Despite those enormous expenditures, the performance is far short of official goals, and in some cases seems to be declining further. The average output of Iraq's national electricity grid in 2006, for example, was 4,300 megawatts, about equal to its value before the 2003 invasion. By February of this year, the figure had fallen still further, to 3,800 megawatts, the report says.
 All of those figures are far short of the longstanding American goal for Iraq: 6,000 megawatts. Even more dispiriting for Iraqis, by February the grid provided power for an average of only 5.1 hours a day in Baghdad and 8.6 hours nationwide. Both of those figures are also down from last year.
 The story is similar for the oil sector, where -- even if the Iraqi numbers are correct -- neither exports nor production have met American goals and have also declined since last year, the report says.
 American reconstruction officials have continued to promote what they describe as successes in the rebuilding program, while saying that problems with security have prevented the program from achieving all of its goals. But federal oversight officials have frequently reported that the program has also suffered from inadequate oversight, poor contracting practices, graft, ineffective management and disastrous initial planning.
 The discrepancies in the Iraqi oil figures are broadly reminiscent of the ones that turned up when some of the same energy department experts examined Iraq's oil infrastructure in the wake of the oil-for-food scandals of the Saddam Hussein era. In a United Nations-sponsored program that was supposed to trade Iraq's oil for food, Mr. Hussein and other smugglers were handsomely profiting from the program, investigations determined.
 In reports to Congress before the 2003 invasion that ousted Mr. Hussein, theaccountability office, using techniques similar to those called into play in its most recent report, determined that in early 2002, for example, 325,000 to 480,000 barrels of crude oil a day were being smuggled out of Iraq, the majority through a pipeline to Syria.
 But substantial amounts also left Iraq through Jordan and Turkey, and by ship in the Persian Gulf, routes that could also be available today, said Robert Ebel, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
 ''Any number of adjacent countries would be glad to have it if they could make some money,'' Mr. Ebel said.
 Mr. Ebel said the lack of modern metering equipment, or measuring devices, at Iraq's wellheads made it especially difficult to track smuggling there. The State Department official agreed that there were no meters at the wellheads, but said that Iraq's Oil Ministry had signed a contract with Shell Oil to study the possibility of putting in the meters.
 The official added that an American-financed project to install meters on Iraq's main oil platform in the Persian Gulf was scheduled to be completed this month.
 As sizable as a discrepancy of as much as 300,000 barrels a day would be in most parts of the world, some analysts said it could be expected in a country with such a long, ingrained history of corruption.
 ''It would be surprising if it was not the case,'' said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, which closely follows security and economic issues in Iraq. He added, ''How could the oil sector be the exception?''

HEADLINE: Rates Hold Fast, and Movie Smoking Takes a Hit

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
Policy makers in Washington kept their eyes on inflation, but held rates steady. In Hollywood, the Motion Picture Association of America tossed smoking into its ratings system. 
 NOT BUDGING The Federal Reserve signaled on Wednesday that it would not be reducing interest rates anytime soon, despite signs that economic growth has slowed sharply.
 The central bank left the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 5.25 percent, the same level it has been since last June. More significantly, it did not budge from its view that inflation remained ''elevated'' and was a bigger worry than the risk of slowing economic growth.
 For practical purposes, that meant the Fed would not lower rates any sooner than its meeting on Aug. 7 -- and probably not then, either. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, still appears to expect an upturn in economic activity in the second half of the year and a slight ebbing of inflation. If growth or inflation continue to slow, the Fed will probably wait until its June meeting to adopt a ''balanced'' stance -- equally worried about inflation and growth -- and wait for at least one more meeting to actually reduce rates.
 Fed officials will be watching two crucial indicators: unemployment, because it views the current job market as fairly tight; and the next round of inflation data, due on Tuesday with the Consumer Price Index for April. EDMUND L. ANDREWS

HEADLINE: Retirement Contrarian Says Wait

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Come retirement, it will finally be time to get back the money that has been extracted from your paycheck your entire working life. 
 Indeed, requesting your Social Security benefits might seem like the first order of business as soon as the going-away party is over. But you might be a lot better off waiting a bit longer, until age 66 or even 70 before tapping into the government retirement fund. Relying at first on other savings like individual retirement accounts or the 401(k) from work could raise your living standard in retirement as much as 10 percent, according to calculations made by Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University.
This is unconventional advice as Mr. Kotlikoff is the first to acknowledge. But Mr. Kotlikoff, 56, who has been studying savings his entire career, thinks that much of what passes for financial advice is merely conventional wisdom. 
 As noted here, he has annoyed the financial planning industry with his research that suggests that the calculators used to forecast retirement needs overstate the amount that must be saved. 
 He also says that the elderly should be investing more heavily in equities rather than bonds, as most planners advise. ''There is almost nothing that you can tell me about conventional financial advice that makes any sense,'' he said.
 There are many skeptics. 
 Margaret H. Smith, an assistant economics professor at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., and a financial planner, thinks that a decision about when to take Social Security should not be coupled with other retirement funds. ''It all depends on how long you live,'' she said. As with many planners, she thinks tax-advantaged accounts, like 401(k)s or Roth I.R.A.s should be left to accumulate as long as possible. 
 ''If they can afford to take it at a later date because they have other sources of income, that's good, but the lion's share of people need every penny they can get,'' said Chad Terry, the director for retirement solutions at the Principal Financial Group, a financial services company based in Des Moines.
 But there are some compelling financial reasons to at least hear Mr. Kotlikoff out. The average retirement age is now 62, not 65. Indeed, only 27 percent of Americans retire at age 65 or later, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. 
 The early retirement might be a direct result of the early availability of the payments. But delaying retirement can make a big difference financially. The Fidelity Research Institute did a study (www.fidelityresearchinstitute.com/pdf/Beyond--Conventional--Wisdom.pdf) last year showing how advantageous a delayed retirement is. It used an example of a 55-year-old making $75,000. Upon retirement at 62, he would get $15,888 in Social Security. If retirement was postponed until 66, the amount would rise to $21,768. A further delay to age 70 would yield an annual benefit of $29, 436. 
 There is a similar effect for those who choose to stop working at 62, but don't tap Social Security until later. Instead of payments of $15,888, the retiree who waits until 66 receives $21,181 a year in benefits and one who delays until 70 receives a $28,821 annual stipend, or 81 percent more, the Fidelity Research Institute said. There is no additional financial benefit to delaying past 70. 
 So why don't more people delay taking their Social Security? Some may not know how benefits accrue. It is also possible that they figure they will die in only a few years. If that is the case, grabbing benefits early makes sense, but study after study shows Americans tend to underestimate their longevity -- one reason financial planners urge people to save more.
 A foreboding that Social Security will not be around may be another reason Americans act early. Research by Hugo A. Benitez-Silva, Debra Sabatini Dwyer and Warren C. Sanderson at the State University of New York at Stony Brook found that the fear among Americans that future benefits might not be there drives many retirees to take benefits as soon as they are available. Researchers at the RAND Corporation are studying this issue to find ways to encourage Americans to consider delaying retirement or deferring benefit payments. 
 Mr. Kotlikoff points out that because Social Security accounts increase at the rate of 7 percent a year from age 62 to 66 and then at 8 percent a year until age 70, retirees get a better return there than they might get on the bonds inside their I.R.A.s. ''That's a safe real return of 7 percent or 8 percent,'' he said. ''You can't get anything close to that in the market.''
 The tax implications of raiding Social Security first does not matter much for the wealthy, but for everyone else it might. Social Security income is tax- free for an individual with a total income of less than $25,000 ($32,000 for a couple filing jointly). As income rises, the share of benefits subject to tax rises to 50 percent and then 85 percent.
 Here is the troublesome part and it will sound familiar to anyone who has been hit with the federal alternative minimum tax on their income: the tax on Social Security benefits is not indexed for inflation. As with the alternative tax, an increasing number of people will be subject to the benefits tax and pay more to the government than they need to. ''There are a lot of taxes on Social Security benefits, if you don't do this correctly,'' Mr. Kotlikoff said.
 His advice does not mean that everyone should start delaying their Social Security payments. It may very well make sense for many to take them immediately, depending on what other assets they are counting on to tide them over in retirement. An adviser can help. 
 Mr. Kotlikoff relies on financial planning software he has been developing called ESPlanner. It has been used by a number of economists and academics who are studying retirement savings. Mr. Kotlikoff used it recently to reach the startling conclusion that over a lifetime a plumber has a higher standard of living than a physician with a general practice because the doctor starts earning later, pays higher taxes and high malpractice insurance premiums. 
 Ms. Smith, the financial planner-economics professor, is a bit wary of the software for financial planning. It comes back to death. ''His software assumes an end date,'' she said. It misses ''income uncertainty and life expectancy uncertainties, two very large unknowns in the planning process,'' she said.
 Mr. Kotlikoff has taken some other unusual stances for fixing three of the most intractable problems Congress faces: health care, taxes and Social Security. 
 He proposes an annual health care voucher from the government, with the amount to be determined by the health of the citizen. He sees it as helping the poor, because they tend to have more health problems than the rich. 
 His plan for tax reform is to substitute a federal sales tax for the corporate and individual income tax and payroll taxes like Social Security and Medicare. The government would rebate a portion of the tax to the poor. 
 His third proposal tackles Social Security. It would set up individual accounts financed with whatever has been accrued as of the date of reform. Individuals would be forced to put 8 percent of their income into the account each year and the government would match the contributions of the poor. It would be invested in a weighted global index fund, he said, to ''keep Wall Street's hands off of it.'' 
 From age 57 to 67, a person's accounts would be gradually converted into inflation-protected government bonds. If a person dies before 67, a portion of the proceeds can be bequeathed to others, a move, he said, that would help blacks and Hispanics who tend to die younger than whites and Asians. 
 Mr. Kotlikoff's ideas are way out there, but he attracted the attention of one presidential candidate. He is serving as an economic adviser to Mike Gravel, the former Alaska senator who garnered much attention in the Democratic debate in South Carolina last month with his outspokenness. 
 Mr. Gravel's popularity, it should also be noted, remains an asterisk in most polls.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aircraft Leasing Business Sold to European Equity Firm

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The European private equity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners said yesterday that it had bought the aircraft leasing business Pegasus Aviation Finance for $5.2 billion, combining it with its own AWAS unit to create the world's third-largest plane lessor. 
 AWAS, which Terra Firma bought from Morgan Stanley last year for $2.5 billion, will have a combined fleet of more than 300 planes, making it a much larger force in the aircraft-leasing business, which has boomed in the last year or so as airlines look to build up fleets quickly to meet resurgent travel demand.
In terms of fleet size, AWAS now ranks behind the General Electric Company, whose Commercial Aviation Services unit, known as Gecas, owns and manages the largest number of planes, and the International Lease Finance Corporation, a unit of the insurer American International Group.
 Gecas and International Lease dwarf even the largest airlines in terms of fleet size. They are the biggest and most important customers for the commercial plane makers Boeing and Airbus, a unit of the European aerospace company EADS.
 The companies are playing a significant role in airlines' expansion, giving carriers a way to operate the newest planes without huge capital outlays.
 Many airlines, especially smaller start-up carriers and those outside the United States, have relied on leasing firms to build their fleets to meet the new demand, as passengers return to the skies after economic slowdowns and concerns raised by the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 Terra Firma is buying Pegasus from its senior management and from funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management.
 Pegasus, which is based in San Francisco, owns 82 aircraft, manages 94 planes and has 37 planes on order, including Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner, Terra Firma said. AWAS leases 134 aircraft to airlines.
 Terra Firma, which has offices in London and Frankfurt, is run by the British financier, Guy Hands.

 BODY:
 ALABAMA WINS STEEL MILL -- ThyssenKrupp, the German steel maker, chose a site in Alabama for a $4.2 billion steel plant that will bring 2,700 new jobs to the state. The company will build the mill, scheduled to open in 2010, in Mount Vernon. The site was chosen because of its ''cost efficiency'' and ''site specific capital expenditures,'' ThyssenKrupp said. The company picked Alabama over Louisiana, which spent $3 million over 15 months trying to lure the plant, but could not compete with the financial incentives offered by Alabama, said Michael Olivier, Louisiana's secretary for economic development. 
Alabama allocated $900 million of tax-exempt debt authorized by Congress after Hurricane Katrina to help economies in areas hit by the storm, and another $400 million of bonds to help with infrastructure costs. The state also approved 20-year breaks on state and local property taxes and a 30-year period in which to apply tax credits on the plant's income to recover capital costs. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) HOME BUILDER SELLS UNIT -- The home builder KB Home said an unidentified bidder offered $783.2 million, or $71.85 a share, for its stake in a French subsidiary, Kaufman & Broad. KB Home, which is based in Los Angeles, owns 10.9 million shares in the subsidiary, which accounted for $378.4 million, or 21.4 percent, of KB Home's first-quarter revenue. KB Home said it was evaluating the offer. It is also looking at other strategic alternatives, including a public or private offering of its shares in the division or keeping the stake, equal to 49 percent of voting securities in Kaufman. EX-CHIEF OF HBO PLEADS -- The former chief executive of HBO, Chris Albrecht, settled a criminal domestic violence charge in Las Vegas, when his lawyer pleaded no contest on his behalf to battery and agreed to pay a $1,000 fine, authorities said. Mr. Albrecht, left, lost his job after he was arrested early Sunday outside the MGM Grand Hotel, where police reported seeing him ''grabbing a white female by the throat with both hands.'' Mr. Albrecht's girlfriend, Karla Jensen, declined medical treatment and told police she did not want to press charges.
 Mr. Albrecht, 54, and Ms. Jensen, 37, issued statements through a publicist in New York saying both were to blame for what Ms. Jensen characterized as a mistake. They said they intended to remain together. PROFIT IS DOWN AT FORTIS -- Fortis, a Belgian-Dutch bank and insurance company that is part of a consortium trying to buy ABN Amro, said its first-quarter profit fell 12 percent on a decline in its banking division. Fortis reported earnings of 1.17 billion euros ($1.58 billion), down from 1.33 billion euros a year earlier. It said profit at its banking arm fell 13 percent, to 903 million euros ($1.22 billion), largely from a one-time gain of 120 million euros in the first quarter of 2006 after reassessing the value of an investment. Insurance profit rose 4 percent, to 352 million euros ($477 million), reflecting strong gains in Fortis's life insurance business, which offset 86 million euros ($117 million) in damage claims after a major storm hit northern Europe in January. Fortis shares fell 1.7 percent, to 32.73 euros ($44.26), in Amsterdam. The bank and its partners in the consortium are trying to outbid a friendly offer for ABN Amro from Barclays. TOTAL TO SELL STAKE -- Total plans to sell its 13 percent stake in the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis, the French oil company's chief executive told shareholders. Total is one of Sanofi-Aventis' largest shareholders, with a stake worth 12 billion euros ($16.18 billion). Christophe de Margerie, Total's chief executive, said it would sell its stake ''probably in the short term.'' He made the comment at Total's annual shareholders meeting in Paris. Speculation of a sale of the Total stake has swirled for weeks. Sanofi-Aventis earnings for the first quarter fell 17 percent, suffering from lingering integration costs arising from the 2004 merger between Sanofi-Synthelabo and Aventis. NOKIA'S BIGGEST ORDER -- Nokia, the world's biggest mobile phone maker, unveiled the largest order in its history, to supply handsets in China in a deal worth $2.5 billion. The order from China Postel, China's largest mobile phone wholesaler, could represent more than 20 million phones, analysts said. Nokia, which sells more than a third of all mobile phones across the world, has a strong position in emerging markets like China, thanks in part to its efficient distribution system. Nokia's lead on the global market over its closest rival, Motorola, grew to its widest in years in the beginning of 2007 as the Finnish company benefits from its early entry into fast-growing emerging markets. And with Motorola's decision at the start of 2007 to back away from the tightest competition in the low-end segment, Nokia has few rivals there. (REUTERS) TRIAL ON GOOGLE AD SYSTEM -- A federal judge ordered Google to face a jury trial in a trademark infringement suit that aims at the workings of the company's main source of revenue. In the lawsuit, American Blind and Wallpaper Factory charges that Google abuses trademarks by allowing rivals of a company to buy ads that appear when consumers search for information on that company. David Rammelt, the lead lawyer for American Blinds, said Federal District Judge Jeremy Fogel of the Northern District of California had set Nov. 9 for jury selection. AdWords is the popular online system which serves up ads tied to searches users perform on Google or Google-affiliated sites. The program accounted for 98 percent or more of the company's $10.6 billion in revenue last year. (REUTERS) PROVIDENCE EQUITY BUYS USIS -- Providence Equity Partners, a buyout firm focused on media and communications, has agreed to acquire USIS, an employee-screening company, from two other investment firms for $1.5 billion, USIS said in a statement. The sellers are Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe and the Carlyle Group, USIS said. The two firms bought USIS in 2003 in a transaction valued at $717 million. Lehman Brothers is the financial adviser for USIS, based in Falls Church, Va., and is providing financing for the acquisition, which is expected to close in the third quarter. Providence Equity, based in Providence, R.I., manages about $21 billion in equity funds. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

HEADLINE: Battle to Acquire the Chicago Board of Trade Heats Up

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 11 

 BODY:
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange raised its bid to acquire its crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade, by 16 percent on Friday, closing the gap with the surprise offer by the Intercontinental Exchange two months ago.
 The latest offer, while not giving controlling ownership to the Board of Trade like the rival unsolicited bid from the Intercontinental Exchange, was nevertheless well received by executives at the Board of Trade, who praised it Friday as the preferred combination.
The Chicago marriage ''offered greater overall benefits for our shareholders and members,'' Charles P. Carey, the Board of Trade's chairman, said in a conference call early Friday. 
 Wall Street also reacted favorably to the deal, lifting the shares of both Chicago exchanges. Shares of the Intercontinental Exchange, a seven-year-old futures exchange based in Atlanta, also rose over 4 percent on speculation that it could now be a target of the New York Stock Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in yet another merger of leading financial exchanges worldwide. 
 The Intercontinental Exchange issued a terse statement indicating it was not ready to bow out quite yet. Its proposed deal offers Board of Trade shareholders ''greater immediate and long-term value as well as better growth prospects than its acquisition by C.M.E.,'' the statement said.
 The Board of Trade's shareholders will ultimately decide in a vote on July 9. But analysts gave low odds that the Intercontinental Exchange would choose to sweeten its first offer.
 ''If I.C.E. doesn't leave the dance with this partner, they will find another dance partner,'' said Michael Henry, senior executive of the capital markets practice of Accenture, a consulting firm. ''But from C.M.E.'s perspective, this would be a gut-wrenching split.''
 The Mercantile Exchange's counteroffer is worth $1.3 billion more than its original bid of $7.9 billion. But the new offer, at $9.91 billion based on Friday's closing price, still falls short of Intercontinental's offer of $10 billion ($10.54 billion based on Friday's share price) and, more important, 51.5 percent of the combined company. Under the Mercantile Exchange's new offer, C.B.O.T. Holdings shareholders would own only 34.6 percent in a combination of the Chicago exchanges, up from 31.2 percent in the original agreement. 
 The two exchanges, founded in the 19th century to trade agricultural futures, first proposed combining last October. At the time, they said they could better compete together against global players like Deutsche Borse as well as the New York Stock Exchange, which announced plans last May to merge with the European exchange Euronext. 
 Then, in March, the upstart Intercontinental Exchange, which mostly trades energy contracts and grew rapidly out of the ashes of the energy-trading industry that Enron pioneered, made its unsolicited bid. As part of its offer, it agreed to keep the combined entity in Chicago and have its headquarters at the Board of Trade's landmark building in the financial district.
 The Mercantile Exchange, which took almost two months to make its long-expected counteroffer, found other ways to sweeten its deal. It agreed to give 10 of 30 board seats to the Board of Trade, up one from its previous offer, and to buy back up to $3.5 billion in stock of the combined company at closing. The buyback is meant to add a further incentive for the Board of Trade's 1,400 members, which control more than 70 percent of the exchange's shares.
 The Mercantile Exchange also raised its previous estimate of pretax savings stemming from the combination to at least $150 million, up from $125 million.
 Mr. Carey said joining with the Mercantile Exchange offered ''less integration risk than a combination with I.C.E.'' But some analysts rejected that notion, saying that Intercontinental and the Board of Trade offered complementary products, while there was more overlap in the two Chicago exchanges that would have to be ironed out.
 Some Wall Street traders also said that the Board of Trade's stock was still trading some $13 above the value of the Mercantile Exchange's latest proposal, which might force the exchange to raise its bid yet again to secure the July shareholder vote. The deal still also faces regulatory scrutiny, but executives from the Chicago exchanges seemed to shrug off concerns on Friday of any problems gaining approval.
 Whatever the eventual outcome, the merger mania roiling the financial markets is not likely to die out soon, Mr. Henry said. Deutsche Borse and some regional exchanges in the United States are rumored to be on the hunt for partners to create larger economies of scale. ''This is not over yet,'' he said. ''There will be a transaction like this a couple of times a year for the next few years.''

HEADLINE: Child Care Workers Get Right to Unionize

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer signed an executive order yesterday that gives 60,000 home-based child care providers the right to unionize, opening the door to one of the largest organizing drives in decades in New York State.
 Two of the state's most powerful unions, the United Federation of Teachers and the Civil Service Employees Association, lobbied for the executive order, saying it would lift many child care workers out of poverty. The governor's move will also open the door to large membership increases for the two unions.
The executive order covers providers who care for the children of low-income workers whose day care is subsidized by the federal and state governments. Labor leaders say that if and when the providers join a union, unions will seek to negotiate with the state to increase the rates the providers receive and to obtain health benefits for them. 
 ''I feel exuberant about this,'' said Nila Edwards, a provider who cares for nine children at her home in East New York. ''We need a union. We want a union so we can have benefits, so that we can get decent pay, so that we can be recognized as professionals.''
 Governor Spitzer signed the executive order 11 months after his predecessor, George E. Pataki, vetoed a bill, overwhelmingly passed by the State Senate and the Assembly, that would have given these workers the right to unionize. Governor Pataki voiced concern that the bill would increase state spending on child care and might jeopardize federal subsidies for the program.
 Governor Spitzer said: ''Allowing these workers to organize and negotiate is not only fair but smart. This executive order will help both to improve working conditions and provide necessary protections for this important sector of our work force.'' He added that it would also enhance ''the quality of care for our children.''
 The Bloomberg administration, however, warned that the executive order could lead to fewer child care spots because the governor did not call yesterday for additional funds for child care. ''Increasing the cost of providing day care without increasing state funding for day care -- like today's executive order does -- will lead to reductions in affordable child care for working New Yorkers,'' Stu Loeser, the mayor's spokesman, said, warning that 15,000 child care slots could be lost in New York City. Without increased funds, he said, the executive order could counteract the mayor's plans to increase access to child care.
 The United Federation of Teachers, which represents New York City's public school teachers, is working with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as Acorn, to unionize 28,000 child care providers in the city. The two groups say that 17,000 of those providers have already signed cards saying they want to join the teachers' union. The groups say they hope there will be a unionization election this summer.
 ''These workers are at the low end of the totem pole,'' said John Kest, Acorn's lead organizer. ''There are many earning just $2 or $3 an hour.'' 
 Randi Weingarten, president of the teachers' union, said her goal was not just to help the providers obtain better incomes and benefits but also to give them more professional training.
 ''For us, it's an educational issue and a moral issue and an economic justice issue,'' she said. ''This is what unions were meant to do. Here you have one of the most exploited work forces in New York City.''
 The Civil Service Employees Association, the largest union of state employees, says it plans to organize more than 25,000 child care providers in the suburban counties and upstate. 
 Before the executive order was signed, the providers could not unionize because they were considered independent contractors. Under the executive order, they will be considered quasi-employees of a state entity, giving unions an employer to bargain with. But the executive order specifically states that the providers will not be state employees.
 The Business Council of New York State had vigorously opposed the vetoed legislation because it would have made the child care providers state employees. 
 In an interview yesterday, the council's spokesman, Matthew Maguire, said, ''We are still assessing the executive order, but our first impression is that it's not nearly as negative for taxpayers as the legislation would have been.'' 
 New York joins New Jersey, Iowa, Illinois, Washington, Oregon and Wisconsin in giving home-based providers the right to unionize.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Calls for National Energy Reforms

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

DATELINE: HOUSTON, May 11 

 BODY:
Sounding a lot like a presidential candidate, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg laid out the framework for a national energy policy on Friday and accused Washington lawmakers of ''passing the buck'' on meaningful energy reforms. 
 In a 40-minute speech delivered at a luncheon with Houston business leaders, Mr. Bloomberg called for building wind farms and nuclear power plants, raising automobile fuel standards and creating market-driven incentives to produce cleaner energy.
''We need to inject some old-fashioned American values and common-sense, practical thinking into our energy policy,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''That means a willingness to face up to our responsibilities and hold ourselves accountable for making incremental progress.'' 
 Many of the policies Mr. Bloomberg outlined here dovetailed with his recently released environmental blueprint for New York City, PlaNYC, which calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030. But the tone and broad national scale of his Houston speech is sure to fuel further speculation that Mr. Bloomberg is planning a run for the White House, even as he again denied such ambitions in a meeting with reporters after the speech. 
 That speculation was heightened earlier this week when he revived his old mayoral campaign Web site, mikebloomberg.com, with the stated intent of highlighting his professional and personal work. 
 The mayor, a billionaire, has also kept a busy schedule on his private jet, which he pays for himself. In addition to Houston, he also went to Oklahoma City on Friday, where he visited the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum and delivered the commencement address at the University of Oklahoma. 
 ''I plan to serve for the next 960-odd days as mayor of New York City,'' Mr. Bloomberg told reporters outside the memorial.
 In his Houston speech, the mayor highlighted ways both large and small of meeting three major energy challenges: producing more power, more cleanly; using it more efficiently; and creating new, sustainable sources. 
 Among his more simple energy-saving ideas was replacing incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs, which burn less energy and last about eight times longer. He pointed to plans by Canada and Australia to phase out traditional incandescent bulbs over the next few years. 
 ''Once again, the technology is there, the savings are real, and the tipping point is coming,'' he said. ''If Australia can do it in five years, we can, too.''
 His more ambitious suggestions included expanding profit incentives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The mayor pointed to the agreement by 10 Northeastern states -- including New York -- to create a market-driven cap-and-trade system for power plants. 
 ''This type of system was controversial when it was created to reduce acid rain -- but it worked,'' he said. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, also urged Congress to raise automobile fuel standards, something it is already considering. 
 ''In 1975, Congress passed a law requiring fuel efficiency standards to double over 10 years, with incremental targets that auto manufacturers were required to meet,'' he said. ''That was the responsible approach, and it worked. But since 1985, we've done nothing -- even as technology has moved at light speed.'' 
 While Mr. Bloomberg has often crossed paths with fellow Republicans on issues like abortion and gun control, he said governments that wants to be catalysts for private investment in clean energy could learn a lesson from President Bush, who as governor of Texas signed a law creating a market for wind energy. 
 ''Which has made Texas the largest producer of wind energy in the United States,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. 
 The mayor said that across the country scientists and engineers are leading a slow-motion revolution to head what he called the twin catastrophes: the potential economic problems that come with a volatile and finite supply of oil and the intensifying environmental threats that could come with continued global warming. 
 But he had sharp words for lawmakers for talking about goals for 2050 or 2070 instead of what can be done right now. 
 ''I've always thought seriously that legislators that make promises to achieve something in the far-off distant future, but refuse to take steps now that would allow us to begin the progress are really very hypocritical,'' he said. ''That's not leadership, it's not what this country needs. It's passing the buck! And I think, unfortunately, for Washington today, it's what we call politics as usual.''
 Whether he is on the presidential path or not, Mr. Bloomberg appeared to win fans here yesterday. He was invited to speak by the Greater Houston Partnership, an umbrella chamber of commerce group for the Houston metropolitan area. 
 A former deputy energy secretary under President Bill Clinton, Mayor Bill White of Houston praised Mr. Bloomberg's energy proposals. But he stopped short of saying whether Mr. Bloomberg sounded like a potential presidential candidate. 
 ''What he really sounded like was somebody who was just shooting straight about energy policy,'' Mr. White said.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Fell 0.2% Last Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 

 BODY:
Retail sales fell 0.2 percent in April, the first decline in seven months, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. And a report from the Labor Department said that wholesale prices surged by 0.7 percent, led by a third consecutive big rise in gasoline prices. 
 The weak retail spending, which confirmed reports of slumps from major chains, and the big rise in gasoline prices were seen as delivering a double whammy to the economy. The worry is that if gasoline prices spike further and the troubles in housing deepen, then consumer spending could be cut further and the country could move toward a recession.
Growth in the overall economy slowed to a lackluster 1.3 percent rate in the first three months of this year, the slowest pace in four years. Analysts were looking for that figure to be revised even lower based on a string of weaker-than-expected economic reports, raising the odds that some unexpected jolt could turn weak growth into an outright downturn.
 ''The higher gasoline prices combined with a weakening housing market and a softer job market are weighing on consumers,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com.
 Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman who sent financial markets into a tailspin back in February with his worries about a recession, used the ''R'' word again on Friday although he sought to put a more positive spin on his views, emphasizing the likelihood that a downturn can be avoided.
 ''The odds are 2-to-1 that we won't have a recession,'' Mr. Greenspan said in a speech delivered by satellite to a business group in Singapore, according to a participant.
 Wall Street was not jolted by Mr. Greenspan's latest comments as investors took comfort from the price report because it showed little price pressures outside the areas of energy and food. 
 The weak report on retail sales from the government came a day after a survey of the nation's biggest retailers, who reported disappointing sales in April.
 The 0.2 percent drop would have been an even larger 0.4 percent fall if it had not been for a 1.7 percent jump in sales at gasoline stations, reflecting the higher pump prices.
 The 0.7 percent increase in wholesale prices last month followed an even larger 1 percent jump in March with gasoline prices rising by more than 8 percent in each month.
 Wholesale food costs were up 0.4 percent in April, a significant slowing after four straight months of 1 percent-plus readings. Outside of food and energy, the unchanged performance of core inflation reflected a decline of 1 percent for new cars and a 0.5 percent drop in the category that includes sport utility vehicles.

HEADLINE: Spy Chief Backs Study Of Impact Of Warming

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 

 BODY:
Stepping into the middle of a partisan debate on Capitol Hill, the United States' top intelligence official has endorsed a comprehensive study by spy agencies about the impact of global warming on national security. 
 In a letter written earlier this week to the House Intelligence Committee, the official, Michael McConnell, director of national intelligence, said it was ''entirely appropriate'' that the intelligence community prepare an assessment of the ''geopolitical and security implications of global climate change.''
The question of whether the country's spy agencies, already burdened by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the global hunt for members of Al Qaeda, ought to investigate the security implications of global warming has been debated in Congress for several weeks. 
 A provision requiring a national intelligence estimate on climate change was in the 2008 intelligence authorization bill that the House passed early Friday morning. The exact amount of the authorization is classified, but it is believed to be approximately $48 billion, which would be the largest intelligence authorization ever considered by Congress. 
 Republicans had tried to defeat the provision on the national intelligence estimate, saying that intelligence resources were too precious to be used to study the impact of climate change. 
 ''Let other federal agencies, as more than a dozen already do, cover the 'bugs and bunnies.' But let our spies be spies,'' Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, wrote Thursday in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article. 
 But intelligence officials have already recognized the importance of studying how crises caused by climate change, like famine and rising sea levels, could affect the United States' security. Even as Congress was debating whether to order a national intelligence estimate, intelligence agencies had already planned to include a discussion of global warming in a report next year on the main security challenges facing the United States through 2025. 
 The proposed national intelligence estimate would project the impact of global warming over the next three decades, examining political, social, economic and agricultural risks. 
 In his letter to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. McConnell said that intelligence analysts would not do primary scientific research about climate change, but would instead rely on analyses by other government agencies for global warming projections. 
 Last month, a report written by several retired generals and admirals concluded that climate changes posed a ''serious threat to America's national security,'' and could further weaken already unstable governments in developing countries.

HEADLINE: We Don't Need 169 Fiefs

 BODY:
Connecticut is an old state; many towns have been part of the landscape for more than 350 years. That provides residents with a rich history. It also carries a significant downside. Communities' boundaries were set centuries ago, and so was the manner in which they raise money. Beginning in colonial times, Connecticut's towns and cities have come to rely heavily -- too heavily -- on property taxes to meet their civic needs. 
 If left unchecked, this is going to destroy what is beautiful about our state.
It is already the basis for municipalities' go-it-alone mentality and the ruthless competition for business regardless of its impact on the overall quality of life. Thinking regionally does not come easily to these communities; instead, the need for ever greater property tax revenues drives the inexorable spread of big-box stores and parking lots, and with it the sacrifice of increasing chunks of valuable and restorative open space.
 Given these perverse incentives, it is little wonder that urbanized land area more than doubled in Connecticut between 1970 and 2000, even as population inched up by only 12 percent. It also explains why Connecticut depends more than any other state on property taxes to pay for public education from kindergarten through 12th grade -- and why there are such inequities in taxes among towns, with rich towns collecting more and poor towns less. 
 This must change. Fortunately, a group called 1,000 Friends of Connecticut is challenging the status quo. The organization, which advocates smart growth and regional planning, persuaded the General Assembly to entertain a revolutionary measure aimed at overhauling the property tax system, changing the way education is financed and encouraging regional approaches. 
 The measure, Senate Bill 1215, was too radical by half for nervous legislators. It would have increased aid to education. It would have required the state to reimburse towns for tax-exempt property. And, in return, communities would have been forced to lower property taxes. 
 These provisions were removed from the bill. So was a proposal for towns to share a percentage of property tax revenue on a regional basis. In its present, attenuated form, the bill merely proposes a study of the impact of revenue sharing. 
 This was disappointing. But what remains of the bill is a good first step toward breaking the fief mentality of most of the state's 169 cities and towns. It would give councils of governments and regional planning organizations more power of review over projects of regional significance, like shopping centers near state highways. It would require them to consider the consequences of development on the air, the land and the water supply of each region, and would require a regional economic plan. 
 The Senate bill should be coupled with House Bill 7402, which would give the regional organizations $10 million this year and the next to help carry out their expanded missions. Then the General Assembly should pass it, meanwhile continuing to entertain more radical reform to help drag Connecticut, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century.
 Some things are worth leaving alone for 350 years. But the state's rote-like reliance on property taxes is not one of them.

HEADLINE: Flexibility as a Marketing Tool

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
MORTGAGE lenders have given borrowers mixed signals in recent months. Many are tightening the terms under which they offer money, even to buyers with good credit. But borrowers who clear that bar may find some user-friendly products.
 Late last month, for instance, Washington Mutual, one of the nation's biggest banks, introduced a new mortgage that offers more flexibility than many other loans, analysts say.
The new offering, WaMu Mortgage Plus, combines a first mortgage and a home equity line of credit into a single loan, giving homeowners the ability to borrow against the equity in their houses without having to take out a home equity loan. 
 With a Mortgage Plus loan, borrowers can change from a variable to a fixed rate (or vice versa) as often as twice a year. They can change from a fixed to a variable rate at no cost. Those who change from a variable to a fixed rate can do so once at no charge; subsequent changes cost $250. There is no charge for taking equity out of the home.
 The Mortgage Plus loan carries no closing costs, and the company said that borrowers may change their interest rate terms over the phone.
 ''This is an innovation,'' said Christine Barry, a research director for the Aite Group, a financial consultancy in Boston. ''It really shows an understanding of a borrower's wants and needs.''
 Ms. Barry said the Mortgage Plus loan was suited to sophisticated borrowers who keep track of interest rates and shift loans to get the best deal available at any given time, and who resist the temptation to pull equity out of their homes for nonessential reasons, leaving themselves with a big debt in the loan's later years. 
 Last week, the rate for fixed 30-year loans was 6.85 percent, and the rate for five-year interest-only loans was 6.65 percent. Both rates reflect terms for borrowers with above-average credit scores who put down 20 percent for loans of $250,000 to $500,000. 
 If they take equity out of the house, borrowers have a similar choice of loan terms, including interest-only terms for periods of 3, 5, 7 or 10 years. 
 Rates for the fixed term are less than 0.5 percent more than those of WaMu's conventional interest-only loan. Unlike other WaMu loans, the Mortgage Plus product carries no origination fees.
 At minimum, only borrowers with prime credit scores (typically above 630) and those who can afford a down payment of at least 10 percent qualify for the loan. Customers who have loan payments automatically deducted from a WaMu deposit account receive initial interest rates 0.25 percentage points lower than those who do not bank with WaMu.
 David Schneider, the president of WaMu's Home Loans group, said that the bank began testing the product with customers in March and found that ''demand has far exceeded our expectations.'' Because closing costs in New York are among the highest in the nation, Mr. Schneider said, he expects demand to be particularly brisk here. (A survey last year by bankrate.com found that closing costs in New York averaged about $3,900, the highest of any state.) 
 Ms. Barry of the Aite Group said she expected other lenders to offer competing products soon, and some banks argue that they already have.
 Mary Berg, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, said that since 2003 the company has offered a similar product, called SmartFit. According to her, the loan has grown more popular as interest rates have risen, because it allows customers to convert part of their home equity debt, which is typically tied to a floating interest-rate index, into a fixed-rate loan. 
 Wells Fargo charges an annual fee of $75, an application fee of $750 and closing costs of up to 1 percent of the loan. ''Aside from that,'' she said, ''these are very similar products.''

HEADLINE: A Good Summer To Leave the Car In the Garage

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
The summer forecast for gasoline prices is out. Quick summary: you may want to stay home for your vacation and ask your boss about telecommuting. 
 Retail prices for gasoline are projected to average $2.95 a gallon, compared with $2.84 last summer, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.
 A big reason is that global demand for oil is rising. China, for one, is behaving more like a consumer and is starting to use oil supplies the way the United States does. (The nerve!)
 Add refinery troubles at home and abroad, unrest in Nigeria and declining production from mature oil sources in the North Sea, the Middle East, Mexico and Russia, and you have more gas stations flirting with $3 a gallon.
 There are ways to ease anxiety about the high price of gasoline. One: Complain about it to Europeans, who pay even more because of taxes. Two: Be aware that new projects in places like the Caspian Sea, the Sakhalin Island, Africa and Brazil are increasing supply. 
 Three: Look at a chart of gas prices adjusted for inflation. You will then realize that prices were actually higher for consumers in 1980.
 According to the inflation chart, prices were higher in 1920, too. Back then, though, more people had the option of riding a horse to work. PHYLLIS KORKKI

HEADLINE: MKX: Beyond the Edge

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
WHILE Cadillac has staged a respectable revival of late, times are still tough for Lincoln, the other venerable American luxury line.
 Lincoln had its last bona fide hit, the Navigator sport utility, nearly a decade ago. In the years since, it has posted a lineup that could confirm the existence of chaos theory.
The bizarre Blackwood pickup for 2002 was dead on arrival -- appropriate, since it came only in black and featured what appeared to be a powered coffin lid over a carpeted bed. Failing to take the hint, Lincoln brought out another luxury pickup, the Mark LT, which has also underperformed in the showroom. On the sport utility front, Lincoln cobbled together the Aviator for 2002. It was basically a Ford Explorer with a deluxe interior, but at a price above $45,000, few left the hangar. 
 Beyond its price, the Aviator's failing -- and Lincoln's, too -- was to miss the crossover wave. Models like the Lexus RX, now the perennial top seller among luxury sport utilities, were really cars underneath. By and large, Americans have discovered in recent years that they prefer crossovers to truck-centric models like the Aviator. 
 Better late than never, Lincoln now paddles in with its first crossover: the MKX, not to be confused with Acura's competing MDX -- or with Lincoln's own MKZ, a sedan formerly known as the Zephyr, or its yet-to-come MKS. (Chaos also rules the Lincoln's naming department.)
 Based on the Ford Edge and Mazda CX-9, the five-passenger MKX is vastly more flightworthy than the Aviator. It is competent and quite striking. It starts at $36,445 including optional all-wheel drive, far less than other luxury models of its size: about $3,000 below the Lexus RX 350, about $4,000 less than the Acura, about $7,000 below a Mercedes ML350. 
 But let's be honest. The MKX may impress price shoppers and Lincoln loyalists, or people who remember where they were when Barry Goldwater got the Republican nomination. But it is less likely to impress people who have forged lasting relationships with rich foreigners, like the sport wagons from Lexus, Mercedes and BMW.
 No doubt, the Lincoln wins some style points: The MKX has an aerodynamic shape that even the Jetsons might like, and a wall-to-wall chrome grille that adds some visual sizzle. It's a handsome ride.
 The interior is reasonably comfortable, though the front seats were handicapped by a short, hard bottom cushion. A central touch screen smoothly controls the audio system, navigation unit and other functions. (Lincoln could teach BMW and Mercedes a thing or two about user-friendly electronics.) 
 An enormous sunroof is part of a $4,795 package that includes the navigation system, satellite radio and THX audio system.
 The MKX's sharply angled windshield resulted in distracting reflections from vents atop the dashboard. But the gauges may be the biggest faux pas; did anyone at Lincoln notice how cheap they look? They're penciled in a wispy, almost girlish font that recalls a J. C. Penney circular.
 The Lincoln's neatest feature may be the dual buttons in the hatch area that drop the split 60-40 rear seats flat in a one-finger operation. There is useful storage back there, though the stylishly sloping roof reduces the ultimate capacity: both the Acura and Lexus have about 20 percent more space with the rear seats folded. 
 On the road, the MKX is smooth, solid and quiet. But it drives like, well, a nice minivan, and I'd wager that a Honda Odyssey could beat it around a road course.
 Of course, the MKX is a prettified Ford Edge, and like that crossover wagon it feels rather large and unwieldy. Compared with the Ford, the Lincoln's suspension is biased toward a comfortable ride, so it is tuned like a baby's mashed potatoes: soft, messy and poorly controlled. The steering traces the right path, but the feel is vague and muffled. 
 The 3.5-liter V-6, the new go-to engine for multiple Ford models, puts out a healthy 265 horsepower and 250 pound-feet of maximum torque. The six-speed automatic transmission is decently smooth, though the lack of manual-shift ability is another clue to the Lincoln's easy-cruising intentions.
 The MKX also tips the scales at 4,420 pounds, one reason for a somewhat leisurely 8.1-second run from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. Yet despite the mass, the federal fuel economy rating is an impressive 17 miles a gallon in town, 24 on the highway, with all-wheel drive. (Front-drive models are rated 1 m.p.g. higher in town and country.) 
 Braking is less impressive, though, as proved in testing by Car and Driver. The magazine recorded a 197-foot stop from 70 m.p.h., near the bottom in the class. 
 The Lincoln weighs about 100 pounds less than the longer, wider Acura, and 300 less than a Mercedes M-Class. But the Acura, with its terrific suspension and performance-tuned all-wheel-drive system, feels like a nimble sport sedan in comparison -- without any tradeoffs in ride or roominess. 
 The Acura isn't the only one: a homegrown rival, the Cadillac SRX, pioneered an adaptive magnetically controlled suspension that has been adopted by super sports cars like the Chevrolet Corvette, Ferrari 599 GTB and Audi R8. As you might expect, the Cadillac outhandles the Lincoln.
 In the MKX's defense, the Lexus RX is no barn burner, either. And again, the Lincoln undercuts the competition: stuffed with options, my test car checked in at $43,890. 
 Skeptics will note that the Lincoln's stablemate, the Ford Edge, has a base price about $8,800 lower. They may well dismiss the Lincoln as an overpriced Ford. 
 But people who love the Lincoln's looks, and value smoothness over sport, may prefer to call the MKX a bargain Lexus. INSIDE TRACK: A more fashionable Ford.

HEADLINE: Homes for $1? Sure, but They're Real Fixer-Uppers

BYLINE: By MATTHEW J. MALONE

DATELINE: NORWICH 

 BODY:
ANDY ZEEMAN knows a good deal when he sees one, and when it comes to real estate, he prefers properties that cost as much as a bag of M&Ms. In February, Mr. Zeeman, 36, received the title to a three-story riverside home he had bought from the city. 
 The sale price was a dollar. 
 It was the second time Mr. Zeeman had gotten such a deal through the city's urban homestead program, which takes decrepit properties and offers them for pennies to buyers who promise to renovate them. 
 ''These total renovations are quite an undertaking,'' Mr. Zeeman said. ''It takes over your life.''
 Over the past several decades, programs in cities like Boston; Columbus, Ohio; and Flint, Mich., have taken similar approaches to dispose of vacant or foreclosed property and to improve the existing stock of affordable housing. In addition, since 2003, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has sold 486 foreclosed homes to local governments for $1 to help revitalize troubled neighborhoods.
 Other communities, like Norfolk, Mass., use the $1 price as a gimmick to save historic properties from demolition. Those initiatives typically come with a catch, however: The buyer must move the house elsewhere.
 Sofee Noblick, a member of Norwich's Board of Review of Dangerous Buildings, said that before the program was established in 1999, the city would auction off foreclosed properties. But Ms. Noblick said that although the auctions generated revenue in the short term, the blighted properties were often left that way.
 These days, when the city puts a home up for sale for $1, it solicits applications from potential buyers, who must outline their renovation plans and demonstrate an ability to pay for the work. The board then ranks each proposal and picks a winner. The city retains ownership until the buyer does enough work to qualify for a certificate of occupancy, which can take several years. 
 While the $1 sale price may be enticing, the houses often require hundreds of thousands of dollars in renovations. Nor is there a guarantee of a windfall on resale. The median home price here last year was $205,000, according to state housing data, and only 10 percent of the homes sold last year went for more than $300,000.
 Since 1999, the city has sold 24 homes for $1 each, but these opportunities are few and far between. To qualify, a house must be foreclosed and have an assessed value of less than $12,000. But rising property values over the last several years have pushed many blighted homes beyond that point. 
 Despite the scarcity of qualifying homes, Don Chen, chairman of the National Vacant Properties Campaign, a nonprofit group based in Washington that works to salvage vacant buildings, said programs like the one in Norwich demonstrated that even small efforts, when well conceived, could make a difference. 
 ''They're not just eyesores,'' he said of vacant homes. ''They're signs of fading hope in a community.''
 Bigger efforts are also under way. In Genesee County, Mich., home to the beleaguered auto manufacturing town of Flint, officials established a land bank in 2002 to take control of foreclosed properties, coordinate redevelopment efforts and prevent the housing market from becoming flooded, depressing land values. Dan Kildee, the county treasurer and chairman of the land bank, said the county used to sell properties at auction, but it was a losing strategy.
 ''The biggest issue for communities is resisting the temptation to simply get these properties into the hands of the first person willing to take them,'' he said. 
 So far the county has taken control of 6,300 properties, knocked down 700 homes and offered vacant lots to adjacent property owners for $1, Mr. Kildee said.
 Mr. Kildee said that increasing the size of the parcels and keeping up the vacant land had helped to change the ''trajectory'' of housing prices.
 That's also the philosophy driving the $1 homes program in Norwich. But for those who are thinking of putting down a dollar, the question is whether it still makes sense, given all the money needed for renovation.
 Mr. Zeeman says he sensed the value of the three-story, shingled multifamily house at 46 River Avenue even before the city put it into the urban homestead program in 2002. Although it was just another dilapidated, abandoned building, many homes in the neighborhood -- with views of the Shetucket River flowing several hundred yards away -- were fairly well maintained. He was unfazed, he said, by the buckling roof, the graffiti scrawled near the front door and the scrap metal business on the nearby riverbank. 
 Three years earlier, he had bought his first house from the city for a dollar, and after renovating it and renting it out for five years, he sold it at an $80,000 profit. Won over by his success, the city chose Mr. Zeeman's application for the River Avenue property over about 20 others. 
 Over the next four years, Mr. Zeeman did most of the work himself on the junk-strewn house -- which had mold on the walls and extensive water damage -- cutting costs everywhere he could. He needed to remove an old wooden staircase to complete the renovation, so he sold it on eBay for $750 and delivered it to Ohio on his flatbed truck for an additional $1,800. He got a new toilet from some friends at no cost.
 The building's exterior, which was rotting when Mr. Zeeman bought it, is now covered with rust-colored siding. A hot tub sits on the wraparound porch overlooking the river. An original marble fireplace adorns the family room. He and his wife, Leigh, live on the first floor and have rented out the two apartments above for $1,800 a month.
 Mr. Zeeman said that coming up with about $300,000 to complete the work was difficult, but that given the condition of the home when he started, getting outside financing would have been nearly impossible.
 ''Banks don't want to hear that you're buying a house for $1,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Best Drug, or Best Money Maker?

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Doctors Reaping Millions for Use of Anemia Drugs'' (front page, May 9):
 So two drug companies are paying hundreds of millions of dollars to doctors who prescribe anemia medicines that lack effectiveness and put a patient's health at risk. This is not a surprise because it reflects our broken health system, a system driven by greed.
 Although drug companies say their intentions are not to promote the use of more medicine for profit, there will always be the risk that some doctors will prescribe higher doses to gain that extra dollar. 
 As patients, we should work to eliminate the incentives to doctors and to raise patient awareness about them. We deserve the right to know the benefits of a medicine, both for us and for the doctors. Luis Rodriguez Daly City, Calif., May 9, 2007 To the Editor:
 Medical care should be guided only by what is best for patients. But throughout the medical system, rebates and volume discounts are common and can create the perception of improper incentives. 
 Our organization has long advocated evidence-based guidelines, including those we produced in 2002 with the American Society of Hematology on erythropoietin use for chemotherapy-related anemia. With the appropriate use of erythropoietin, many thousands of patients have avoided potentially dangerous blood transfusions. 
 Oncologists care deeply about their patients, and the overwhelming majority treat them based on the best available evidence.
 In the case of erythropoietin, recent studies prompted the Food and Drug Administration to issue a ''black box'' warning in March about the potential dangers of using erythropoietin to boost hemoglobin to levels higher than guidelines recommend. Early evidence suggests that doctors factored this new data into their prescribing decisions and have reduced erythropoietin use. 
 As a whole, the medical community needs to better determine the impact financial incentives may have on prescribing patterns and patient care, to ensure that patient needs continue to be at the forefront of medical decisions. Allen S. Lichter, M.D. Exec. V.P., American Society of Clinical Oncology Alexandria, Va., May 10, 2007 To the Editor:
 Many doctors appear dissatisfied with fees ethically garnered from clinical evaluation and management. They can and will prescribe for personal profit, and will readily reshape and expand diseases to suit the available reimbursement. Without disclosure, patients are typically the last to know there might be a problem.
 The investigation of anemia drugs no doubt could expose the self-serving logic, unethical inducements and poor administrative surveillance that permit exploitation of the public's soft financial underbelly. Unfortunately, there are plenty of other specialties of medicine where such professional betrayals occur. And adequate regulation is not likely to occur in the financial free-for-all of private medicine. James H. Lampman, M.D. Bismarck, N.D., May 9, 2007 To the Editor:
 The discovery and development of growth factors that stimulate the bone marrow to produce red cells was a milestone in modern medicine. In the appropriate setting, these growth factors can improve blood counts and quality of life and spare patients time-consuming, expensive, short-lasting and risky transfusions.
 In our practice the increasing use of these medicines is driven by the fact that they work so well. As with any new therapy, these medicines need to be used within established and developing guidelines to avoid serious side effects.
 Since there are two competing and equally effective drugs, the drug makers are offering incentives for preferential use -- the natural outcome of a free-market economy.
 Deciding how regulators might control drug makers is an important undertaking, but it should not detract from the tremendous benefits of these drugs when used in the right situation. Birjis Akhund, M.D. Chief of Medical Oncology Huntington Hospital Huntington, N.Y., May 9, 2007 To the Editor:
 America has the best medical care in the world. It is the most advanced and expensive. The first two qualifications are debatable, but the third is difficult to refute.
 The great expense is complicated by the high cost of drugs and procedures of dubious benefit. 
 The likelihood of being prescribed drugs of dubious benefit is obviously increased by kickbacks to doctors. The kickbacks may be legal, but should they really be allowed? The cost of medicine is increased by this practice, and the quality is sure to suffer. Alex Floyd Lexington, Ky., May 9, 2007 To the Editor:
 ''Doctors Reaping Millions for Use of Anemia Drugs'' (front page, May 9) was disturbing. I found it equally disturbing that the continuation of the article was in Business Day. In the past two decades, I have observed that news of important medical advances increasingly appears in, or is continued in, the business section. 
 This practice advances the thinking that health care is primarily a business in which providers reap riches, rather than a humane social endeavor in which providers earn their living. Ira D. Feirstein, M.D. New York, May 9, 2007

HEADLINE: Tribe's Commitment To the Environment

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 In ''High Stakes in the Catskills'' (Op-Ed, April 29), Kim Elliman and Nathan Berry challenge the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe's environmental commitment. Our tribe has a long, rich and meaningful tradition of respecting, protecting and preserving natural resources. We agree that the watershed should be protected. 
The St. Regis Mohawk Casino at Monticello Raceway is a testament to responsible development. Good planning, together with the substantial mitigation funds committed by the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe and Empire Resorts, the project's developer, will both protect local natural resources and ensure the integrity of the watershed. The St. Regis Mohawk Tribe is particularly sensitive to this issue since our own waterways on the Akwesasne Reservation were polluted by nearby industry. 
 The tribe's casino plans have undergone the most comprehensive studies ever undertaken for a project of this type, including a complete environmental assessment to fulfill federal requirements and an environmental impact statement to fulfill New York State requirements. 
 The plan enjoys wide support because it will boost the area's economy while respecting the environment. After more than a decade of planning and review, it is time to move forward. Lorraine White Tribal Chief St. Regis Mohawk Tribe Akwesasne, N.Y.

HEADLINE: Larceny in the Carpool Lane

BYLINE: By TORI TELLEM

 BODY:
CALIFORNIA is best known for two things (three if you count celebrity rehab): road congestion and bad air quality. 
 Last year the state proposed a way to help solve both. By opening up freeway lanes reserved for high-occupancy vehicles to certain clean-air cars and trucks, traffic flow could be improved and Californians would have a greater incentive to drive a hybrid or other low-emissions vehicle. Under the plan, the state Department of Motor Vehicles was to issue 75,000 Clean Air stickers to qualifying vehicles.
Applications came pouring in. Stickers were snapped up so quickly that a new bill was written to make another 10,000 available on Jan. 1. What happened next should come as no surprise. 
 The program made hybrids more appealing not only for drivers who wanted an environmentally friendly vehicle, but also for commuters desperate to get out of crawling traffic and into the car-pool express lanes. The presence of some unlikely vehicles on the eligibilty list -- natural gas versions of the Cadillac Escalade, Dodge Ram pickup and Ford Crown Victoria, for instance -- increased the stickers' desirability. 
 An underground market fed by sticker thieves emerged. The motor vehicle department's Investigations Division caught wind of at least one case in which stickers were listed on eBay and had the auction stopped, though not before the seller had set a market value, asking a $10,000 minimum bid. Talk about sticker shock: legitimate owners pay $8 for the set of four a car must carry. 
 The department must have anticipated the treasure it would have on its hands, as it built in protection. There's a holographic plastic coating with the state seal; if the sticker is tampered with or removed, the chemical will crumble. ''Getting one of these stickers off intact, though it does happen, is highly unlikely,'' said Mike Marando, a spokesman for the department. ''And being able to use it again is even less likely because of all the security features.'' 
 Even if a sticker is removed, the word void will appear on it, rendering it useless. And scanning a real sticker to make a forged one is not a solution -- the real ones are reflective, making it easy for highway patrol officers to spot cheats.
 The California D.M.V. estimates that it receives about seven applications each week for sticker replacement, and since the launch of the program it has reissued about 3,700, a figure that includes those lost in the mail or damaged in a collision.
 To qualify for the stickers that grant H.O.V. lane access, a vehicle must meet the combination of fuel economy and emissions standards in one of four classes designated by the rules. The stickers are white or yellow depending on the vehicle's classification. Hybrids that carry a rating of 45 miles per gallon or more from the Environmental Protection Agency, including the Honda Civic and 2000-4 Insight , and the Toyota Prius, are eligible, though other hybrids that do not meet the 45 m.p.g. stipulation -- the Ford Escape, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry among them -- cannot get stickers. The stickers, which stay with the car if it is sold, are good through Jan. 1, 2011.
 Checking in with a local car dealership offers some indication of how coveted these H.O.V.-lane permits are to Californians. ''Ninety percent of the requests are, 'Is this car available, and does it have stickers?' '' said Gregory Iverson, the internet sales manager for Keyes Toyota Van Nuys.
 While the Prius remains a car in high demand, one with stickers will be snapped up in days while one without them sits longer, Mr. Iverson said. ''People will buy these cars no matter what -- as long as it has the stickers on it.''

HEADLINE: Welcome to Start From Scratch, U.S.A.

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

 BODY:
AT least the meteorite survived. ''The world's largest pallasite meteorite,'' that is, or so it is claimed. ''The world's largest hand-dug well'' survived too, although it was smothered with debris by the tornado that walloped Greensburg, Kan., a little over a week ago.
 These are a small town's treasures. They are the tourist lures, perhaps, but also the things that give a place its soul, its communal identity. And Greensburg -- meteorite and Big Well notwithstanding -- saw almost all of its town touchstones flattened by the fierce winds that killed 10 people and decimated nearly everything above ground.
 Hunter Drugs is gone, with its ruffled blue-and-white fringe of an awning, its walnut and marble booths, its red leatherette and chrome stools perched before the old-fashioned soda fountain. So is the Twilight Theater, with its pressed-tin ceilings that date from the time it showed silent pictures. And no cowboys or anyone else can shop at the Cowboy Supply store, with its giant sign outside in the shape of a Stetson-topped wrangler and the words ''Howdy Podner, Come In.'' 
 The devastation leaves Greensburg, population 1,500, shadowed by a colossal question mark: When a thriving community cataclysmically finds itself reduced to rubble, how can it put itself back together?
 Many towns -- floodstruck or tumbled by tornadoes or hurricanes -- have wrestled with that question, and there is no single solution. But people who have been through it, as well as experts in town planning and disaster recovery, say there are pitfalls and priorities, and many things a place like Greensburg should keep in mind: How historically or culturally significant were the buildings? What is the town's economic engine? Where do people work? How young or old is the population? Is there a visionary leader?
 ''In some communities people may be much more comfortable just putting things back together the way they were, and in some cases they may want to embark on a totally new direction,'' said James Schwab, a senior research associate for the American Planning Association, who is considered a guru of disaster recovery.
 Take Stockton, Mo., an Ozarks town of about 2,000 that calls itself ''the black walnut capital of the world.'' When Stockton got socked by a tornado in 2003, it essentially reinvented itself.
 Stockton's epicenter had been a simple intersection of two highways, but now it is a town square, with roads that curve around a town center, with grass and flowers at each corner, said the mayor, Ralph Steele. Wood-frame buildings were replaced with steel and brick structures, and several businessmen built bigger shops -- Lester Johnson doubled the number of bays in his auto-body shop, and Aubrey Foster replaced his small restaurant and separate liquor store with a larger building that houses both.
 The Hammons Black Walnut Emporium was created, ''kind of like a Starbuck, you know what that is?'' Mayor Steele said. ''But it's even bigger and better than a Starbuck because they have a lot of gifts, candy and nuts, and even a bookstore.''
 There were some nods to the past. The country's only black-walnut processing plant remained, even though some of the largest trees were gone. The century-old community center, where people quilt and play Ozarks music, was resurrected, even though meeting guidelines for historic buildings was expensive, the mayor said.
 ''One of my best friends is a judge who has lived here all his life,'' the mayor said, ''and he told me if I didn't rebuild the community center he would put me in jail.''
 Otherwise, ''it looked like a new town to everybody,'' he said, adding that a memorial was built in a park to ''remember the tragedy, but that's all they need -- they don't want to relive it.''
 History played a more critical role in Princeville, N.C., the country's first community chartered by African-Americans. Princeville was routed by a flood after Hurricane Floyd in 1999.
 Sam Knight, Princeville's town manager, said the first question was whether to relocate the community out of its vulnerable flood plain. The town council was evenly divided, but the mayor broke the tie, siding with the large elderly population, who are active voters, and who felt, Mr. Knight said: ''This is our land. We don't want to go anywhere else.''
 Princeville decided to restore historic Mount Zion Church, even though ''it would probably have been easier to tear it down'' and build something new, Mr. Knight said. The old town hall building is also being restored, to become a museum and welcome center.
 Many towns rebuild with attention to safety or modern convenience, and Princeville did require every rebuilt house to have central heating and air-conditioning. Mr. Knight said the town wanted to rebuild its wood-frame houses in the original style, but that was too expensive, so most homes now have aluminum siding or brick. But two houses, which belonged to some of the town's first leaders, remain unlivable because Princeville is hoping to raise the money to restore them.
 David Godschalk, a professor emeritus of urban planning at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, says there is often tension between the ''real urge to get back to normal -- we don't want to wait'' and the recommendation from experts like himself that ''if you take some time, you can make it better.''
 In Utica, Ill., hit by a tornado in 2004, at least one house was reconstructed on its original plot, even though it was in the path of a proposed new road and ''is going to have to be torn down,'' said John Paige, a planner assigned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist Utica. ''I think the people that want to take a deliberate approach are the minority.''
 Arkadelphia, Ark., took a deliberate approach when a tornado clobbered it in 1997, appointing a commission of prominent residents and getting advice from architecture graduate students. Ultimately parts of the town look more old-fashioned than before, not more modern, said Joe Nix, a retired professor who was on the commission.
 ''I remember us reviewing old pictures of downtown and saying we wish we could make it just like it was in 1930,'' Mr. Nix said. Arkadelphia did not go that far, but an 1899 courthouse was restored, and some buildings with siding were renovated to reveal their old brick.
 And Malone's pharmacy, which had ''looked like a mini-Wal-Mart'' was rebuilt ''with an old soda fountain and a nice little restaurant that made it like an old-fashioned drugstore,'' Mr. Nix said, adding that the redevelopment ''made Arkadelphia more viable than a lot of other Arkansas downtowns.''
 In Greensburg, the prognosis is unclear, said Denise Unruh, executive director of the South Central Community Foundation, a local organization that has already established a rebuilding fund for the town.
 The sizeable elderly population is divided on whether to stay or move ''closer to their children, who don't live here any longer,'' Ms. Unruh said. ''My closest friend, who had an incredibly beautiful historic home, said she will probably move to where her daughter is.''
 People who worked at Dillon's grocery store or the hardware store ''will have to find jobs, and if we don't get that up and running right away they may go somewhere else,'' she said.
 There are signs of a future. The John Deere dealership is expected to stay, schools are expected to rebuild, and the hospital, a big employer, will most likely come back in some form, she said.
 But the futureof Hunter Drugs is uncertain, she said, and may depend on its legendary soda jerk, Dick Huckriede, who has made ''the best cherry cokes'' since 1952.
 ''I don't know what his family resources are to know if he will stay in town,'' Ms. Unruh said, ''but it would be hard for the drugstore to be the same if he wasn't there.''.
 Ms. Unruh envisions fusing Greensburg's old spirit with modern technology and construction, where people ''won't have to come to Greensburg and have a house built in 1902 with no closets and doorways that are 5-foot-8. People will be able to find what they find in a city, but yet have the rural flavor. It could be the community of the future.''

HEADLINE: Hunger and Food Stamps

 BODY:
If you think people do not go hungry in America, you're wrong. At last count in 2005, 35 million low-income Americans -- about a third of them children -- lived in households that cannot consistently afford enough to eat. Since 2005, the situation has most likely become worse. Last year, real wages for low-income workers were still below 2001 levels. This year, job growth is slowing and prices are rising. 
 And each year, the federal food stamp program -- the bulwark against hunger for 26 million Americans -- does less to help. In large part, that is because a key component of the formula for computing most families' food stamps has not been adjusted for inflation since 1996. Over all, food stamps now average a meager $1.05 per person per meal.
Bolstering food stamps must be Congress's top priority in this year's farm bill, the mammoth legislation that covers the food stamp program. 
 Most important, lawmakers must stop the erosion in the purchasing power of food stamps, either by pegging the benefit formula to inflation or by making a big increase in the formula's standard deduction. In 2002, when the last farm bill was passed, Congress improved the benefit formula for households with four or more people. But nearly 80 percent of all food stamp households have three or fewer members. It is unacceptable that their food stamps buy less food each year. 
 Congress should also repeal the provision that imposes a five-year residency requirement on otherwise eligible adult legal immigrants. (Illegal immigrants are not eligible for food stamps.) The children of such immigrants -- 80 percent of whom are United States citizens -- can receive food stamps without waiting. But confusion over the rules keeps many of them out of the program. The Department of Agriculture reports that of the children of immigrant parents who are citizens and eligible for food stamps, only 52 percent got them in 2004, compared with 82 percent of eligible children over all. 
 Taken together, those two reforms would cost roughly $3 billion over the next five years. In the competitive frenzy of a farm bill, that is money lawmakers would be inclined to fight over. But Democrats and Republicans alike must realize that improving food stamps is a moral and economic necessity. Food stamp allotments were cut in 1996 to free up money to ease the transition from welfare to work. But since then, food stamps themselves have become a crucial support for working families. Among food stamp households with children, twice as many work as rely solely on welfare. 
 Inadequate aid affects not only the amount of food a family can buy, but also the types of purchases. With too few dollars to spend, junk food becomes the best value because it is calorie dense, cheap and imperishable. 
 Adjustments around the edges of the food stamp program will not be enough. President Bush has proposed exempting families' meager retirement savings when calculating whether they are poor enough for food stamps. He also wants to allow families to deduct their full child care costs from the benefit calculation. Both changes would be helpful and Congress should embrace them. But Congress also needs to make much bigger changes, now.

HEADLINE: Family Ties Bind Philippine Government

BYLINE: By CARLOS H. CONDE

DATELINE: MANILA, May 12 

 BODY:
When Julian Resuello, the mayor of San Carlos City in the northern Philippines, was killed by gunmen at a campaign rally on April 28, his brother quickly stepped into his shoes.
 Mr. Resuello had been seeking the office of vice mayor, and even if his brother Joseres does not win that election, San Carlos City politics is likely to stay in the hands of the Resuello family -- Julian's son Julier was already running to succeed him as mayor.
Such swapping of roles is as common in political families as the violence that has afflicted the Philippines in the approach of the elections on Monday, in which more than 17,000 national and local positions are at stake, including all 265 seats in the House of Representatives and half of the 24 seats in the Senate. 
 More than 100 people have been killed in the pre-election violence, the police said Friday, with attacks occurring almost daily. The police say they do not have any leads in the killing of Julian Resuello, who was 54.
 For generations, political dynasties have dominated elections and governments in the Philippines. They are prominent and moneyed clans, like that of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, whose father was president in the 1960s and whose son is a congressman. Another son is running for congress.
 As these clans protect their reign, they often resort to violence to frustrate any attempt by rivals to unseat them.
 Experts say the influence of these dynasties has grown more pervasive in recent years.
 There are an estimated 250 political families nationwide, with at least one in every province, occupying positions in all levels of the bureaucracy, according to the Center for People Empowerment in Governance, a Philippine nonprofit group. Of the 265 members of Congress, 160 belong to clans, the group says.
 ''These are the same families who belong to the country's economic elite, some of them acting as rule makers or patrons of politicians who conspire together to amass greater economic power,'' said Bobby M. Tuazon, the center's director. 
 Experts say the dynasties have developed a sense of entitlement regarding public positions, while many ordinary Filipinos have come to accept the arrangement as inevitable, making it harder to change the system.
 Political dynasties were a consequence of the country's colonial era, in which an elite was nurtured by the Spanish and, later, the Americans. Even after the country gained independence, in 1946, a largely feudal system persisted, as landed Filipino families sought to protect their interests by occupying public offices.
 When he was president in the 1970s and 1980s, Ferdinand Marcos blamed the political dynasties for what was wrong with the country and promised to dismantle them. He did, but then replaced them with new ones that he controlled. Those families persist to this day.
 Experts say the rule of the clans has prevented the flowering of genuine democracy.
 ''Continuing clan dominance is a product of the seemingly immutable and unequal socioeconomic structure, as well as the failure to develop a truly democratic electoral and party system,'' said Julio Teehankee, a political scientist at De La Salle University in Manila.
 The result, he added, was a political system rife with patronage, corruption, violence and fraud, and a vicious cycle that has prevented the base of aspirants and candidates from expanding. 
 The Asia Foundation, which has been monitoring elections in the Philippines for decades, said in a report last week that ''confusion, inefficiency, corruption, and cheating damaged the credibility of elections, and cast doubt on the democratic legitimacy of elected officials.''
 Apart from contributing to corruption, the influence of political dynasties can be detrimental in other ways, according to several studies.
 For example, a family in power might not bother to finance government projects in areas controlled by its rivals. 
 A testament to the enduring power of the old order is that even though a provision in the Constitution calls for weakening the dynasties, Congress has never passed any laws that would put the provision into effect. Bills have been proposed, but many of the lawmakers voting on them are part of the very establishment that the Constitution seeks to curb.
 Although there is a widespread belief here that the political dynasties can never be eliminated, some experts point to signs of positive change.
 Alex B. Brillantes, who teaches public administration and governance at the University of the Philippines, cited several young politicians from dynasties who had broken with the old ways and shown what he said was a capacity to govern responsibly. He attributed that in part to the increased redistribution of power to local areas in recent years, including the ability to impose taxes.
 ''Because of local empowerment, good dynasties are becoming more responsive to the call for good governance and to the issue of accountability,'' Mr. Brillantes said.
 But decentralization has its downside too, experts like Mr. Tuazon and Mr. Brillantes say. They say that as provinces, cities and towns have grown richer with the power to impose local taxes, the potential spoils tempt local politicians, fueling the cycle of corruption and violence.

HEADLINE: Reviving a No Man's Land Along the Tennessee River

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: KNOXVILLE, Tenn. 

 BODY:
THE Tennessee River flows through this midsize Sun Belt city past Neyland Stadium, home of the University of Tennessee football team. On Saturdays in the fall, an armada of pleasure boats arrive in anticipation of a gridiron victory. Now developers and city officials are focusing on both shores of the river and trying to attract year-round crowds. 
 On the river's south bank, they are busy transforming 750 acres of vacant or underused industrial land into a mixed-use district of homes, office buildings, hotels, stores and riverside parks, linked by a three-mile river walk. On the north side of the Tennessee River, where the university and the central business district are situated, hundreds of rental apartments and condominiums are under construction.
The city's plan for the South Waterfront is a striking turnabout for an area that in the 19th and 20th centuries was a hub of manufacturing and heavy industry but long ago became, at least in part, a kind of no man's land, with vacant lots alongside the few active enterprises -- a propane depot, a petroleum transfer facility and a hospital. 
 Last August, the $9.4 million 50-unit River Towne Condominiums opened, becoming the first new housing development along the South Waterfront. Its two- and three-bedroom units sell for $195,000 to $320,000 and all but a handful have been sold, according to University Real Estate and Property Management, the developer.
 In March, construction began at Cityview at Riverwalk, a 122-unit condominium and marina, and the largest housing project so far in the new South Waterfront district.
 City leaders say they hope that within a generation, the South Waterfront will become the city's hippest neighborhood. A market study paid for by the city predicts that within five years the South Waterfront will have 600 units of housing, 15,000 square feet of retail space and 15,000 square feet of office space. David M. Hill, the senior director of the South Waterfront development, said the projections are conservative.
 ''We think the South Waterfront will exceed the study estimates,'' he said. 
 In 20 years, when the district is fully built out, the study says, the South Waterfront is expected to support 1,000 units of housing, 30,000 square feet of retail space and restaurants, 320,000 square feet of office space and more than 100 marina boat slips. 
 Meanwhile, along the north bank, on the other side of the Tennessee River, where Knoxville's central business district lies, housing and retail construction is also under way. More than 500 units of housing have been added since 2000, when a handful of young builders began in earnest to convert the city's vacant downtown railroad warehouses and turn-of-the-20th-century office buildings into lofts and apartments. 
 Knoxville's downtown, particularly the north end, is now alive as it hasn't been in half a century, with hotels, theaters, concert halls, bars, galleries, restaurants, coffee shops and clubs open past midnight during the week and on weekends. The changes reflects years of preparation and planning. 
 Nearly 2,000 people now live downtown, 600 more than in 2000, helping to increase the city's population from 173,890 in 2000 to 180,000, according to census data. Last year, in a signal that buyer interest is still strong, 319 new housing permits were issued in the central business area. 
 Amy Gibson, 40, a senior researcher at the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy at the University of Tennessee, is one of those downtown homeowners. Mrs. Gibson and her husband, John, 39, a software engineer, recently bought a two-bedroom 1,040-square-foot unit in the Holston, a former bank building that is under renovation to become a luxury condominium.
 ''It's cool; it's fun; it's the place to be,'' she said of the downtown area. 
 Mrs. Gibson said she was surprised, however, at the $259,000 price of her condo, which was close to the same price she would pay for a 2,500- to 3,000-square-foot home in a Knoxville suburb.
 ''Why spend that kind of money on a loft?'' she asked. ''It's because of the lifestyle -- access to arts and the rest of the city. It's a choice we wanted to make.'' 
 The Holston, scheduled to open in a year, is marketing a penthouse unit that sells for more than $1 million. It also offers 41 other one-, two- and three-bedroom condos, starting around $230,000, and 8,000 square feet of retail space on the first and second floors. Seventy percent of the units have already been sold, according to David Dewhirst, 43, an engineer and the founder of Dewhirst Properties, which restores and manages old buildings for use as lofts and condominiums. 
 Since 1997, when he finished renovating a 6,000-square-foot building on Gay Street into two offices and a loft for himself, Mr. Dewhirst has completed more than 20 loft and condominium projects that produced more than 250 new downtown housing units. The Holston is Mr. Dewhirst's newest project.
 One of his most popular projects is the Emporium, a 109-year-old furniture-store building on Gay Street that he converted into a 41-unit rental loft building. The one- and two-bedroom lofts rent for $695 to $1,595 a month. The Emporium is fully rented and has a long waiting list. 
 Other new projects in downtown Knoxville include the $20 million 70-unit Central Station Lofts; the Residences at Market Square, a 24-unit development at the corner of Union and Walnut; and the Trolley Lofts, a renovation of the city's downtown J. C. Penney store. 
 Mr. Hill, a planner and a senior aide to Mayor Bill Haslam, said the development on both sides of the Tennessee River is what city leaders and residents envisioned. ''People want and need different things from a city than they used to,'' he said. ''They want a place that is exciting and fun and clean, and caters to active lifestyles.''
 From his fifth-floor office in Knoxville's City-County Building downtown, Mr. Hill can see across the Tennessee to the South Waterfront development and the freshly turned dark ground where footings are being poured for Cityview at Riverwalk. The $30 million first phase of this seven-acre project is a five-story building that will contain a 96-slip marina and 122 condos. 
 The one-, two- and three-bedroom units at Riverwalk are all roughly 1,250 square feet and sell for $300 a square foot -- about $375,000. John Gumpert, the founder of the Atlanta-based Camden Management Partners and the developer of Riverwalk, said that 84 of the units had already been sold. It is scheduled to open in the spring of 2008. 
 ''When we started talking about Riverwalk in the community,'' Mr. Gumpert said, ''all we heard from store owners and professionals was how they wanted to live on the water.'' 
 Knoxville took a new interest in the blighted South Waterfront soon after Mayor Haslam took office in December 2003. After a series of studies and public meetings, the city introduced its land-use plan for the South Waterfront a year ago. The plan called for rewriting the rules of development along 15,000 feet of shoreline. 
 Instead of conventional land-use zoning that set up areas and restricted how they could be used, Knoxville tried an approach called ''form-based coding.'' Essentially, it allows any kind of building anywhere within the South Waterfront district. Its restrictions apply not to how a building is used but to how tall it can be (no more than 50 feet), how close it needs to be to the street and how distant from the river bank, what kinds of exterior materials can be used, and how it should be landscaped. The code calls for extensive tree planting.
 Mr. Hill said theform-based approach was intended to make it easier for developers, while ensuring that the South Waterfront has a consistent design and allows the public to have plenty of access to the river. Public parks are sprinkled throughout the plan, and the city is working with developers to finance the river walk. 
 Leigh Burch, a 50-year-old real estate developer, was one of the first Cityview buyers. His two-bedroom, two-bath condo cost $310,000.
 ''It's all about being on the water,'' he said. ''It's a great investment.''

HEADLINE: Foes Renew Efforts to Block L.I.R.R. Expansion

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
AS the Long Island Rail Road tells it, no effort is being spared to minimize the negative effects on communities along 10 miles of the Main Line from Floral Park to Hicksville where it wants to add a third track.
 The railroad recently shortened the project's western end, clipping its original 11.5-mile length and excluding Queens Village, Bellerose and half of Floral Park. Railroad planners are now working to realign sections of the Main Line's existing two tracks so they can squeeze in another track in an effort to keep the corridor as narrow as possible. 
 The railroad has also shrunk the list of whole and partial properties earmarked for permanent or temporary acquisition through eminent domain to 98 from 146. 
 But opponents -- including elected officials and groups in trackside villages like Floral Park, New Hyde Park, Mineola, Garden City, Garden City Park, Carle Place and Westbury -- are joining forces and digging in for what they expect to be a long fight. Discussion of a third track has been going on for at least 25 years, and formal efforts began in May 2005. 
 There is little middle ground. The railroad and its parent agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, say the project is vital to expanding service to and from New York City on tracks now at capacity during peak commuting times. They contend it would also spur the economy and reduce road traffic by promoting reverse commuting to and from points east, primarily in Suffolk County. 
 Opponents say they support a part of the project to eliminate five grade-level crossings, which are where most of the property acquisitions would occur and which opponents contend are hazardous and clog traffic. Three of the crossings are in New Hyde Park and two are in Westbury.
 But, opponents say, even with the railroad's revisions, the third track would be ruinous for their communities, creating noise and pollution, and would waste $1 billion to accommodate a phantom growth in ridership and a nonexistent reverse commute. 
 ''We do not see the need,'' said Robert A. Lofaro, New Hyde Park's deputy mayor.
 The Census Bureau has said the number of New York City residents who work on Long Island grew only 5 percent between 2000 and 2005. But the railroad said in a study released Thursday that the number of reverse commuters during the morning rush had jumped 76 percent since 1998.
 The railroad expects ridership to increase by 30 percent to more than 105 million annually by 2030, after completion of the East Side Access project linking the railroad to Grand Central Terminal. It anticipates that the number of weekday trains, most of them passing through the project area, will have to be increased to 1,065 by 2030 from 735 now. 
 Opponents question the numbers. Many say they believe the railroad has not been candid about the project's true long-term purpose: making way for more freight trains carrying hazardous materials and garbage. 
 The railroad and project backers, however, point out that freight trains generally run overnight or during slack daylight times when track capacity is no problem, even now. 
 Opponents want assurances in writing that there will be no increases in freight activity. ''If they say there is not going to be freight, then give us a covenant,'' Mayor Jack M. Martins of Mineola said. 
 What lies ahead is a battle over a draft environmental impact statement that the railroad is to submit this year to the Federal Transit Administration. The draft, which for the first time will detail the project and also consider a ''no action'' alternative, should become public by December, said Susan McGowan, a railroad spokeswoman. 
 That will be followed by public hearings, a comment period, a final impact statement and, depending on how it all goes, perhaps lawsuits. 
 FLORAL PARK, for one, has already retained an environmental law firm. ''We feel we should leave no stone unturned,'' Mayor Phil Guarnieri said.
 Jonathan Orcutt, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit group in Manhattan that favors the project, said officials were being ''extremely shortsighted'' and ''wildly exaggerating the impacts.''
 ''They should be taking advantage of the fact that they have this tremendous transportation asset in their midst,'' he said.
 Efforts are already under way to revive a campaign to block the project. At the Floral Park station on April 25, the Hempstead town supervisor, Kate Murray, and numerous village officials announced that they were renewing a petition drive opposing the third track. They have urged Gov. Eliot Spitzer to withdraw his support for the project. In March, he told the Long Island Association, a business group, that the project was among his priorities for Long Island. 
 The project is also strongly supported by Mitchell H. Pally, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority board member who is a Suffolk County resident. He calls local officials' efforts misguided.
 ''If we are serious about making transportation improvements on Long Island, the third track is the most important project to accomplish it,'' he said. ''It's as simple as that.'' 
 But Ms. Murray says stopping the project is a priority for her and other officials. She and others say the railroad can meet any increase in riders by adding more double-decker cars, lengthening trains and changing schedules.
 The opponents regard State Senator Dean G. Skelos of Rockville Centre as a key official in their fight to stop the project. Mr. Skelos is the Senate representative on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's capital program review board and holds veto power over the authority's five-year capital spending program. 
 Mr. Skelos's office says he will decide how to vote on further financing after the environmental impact statement is completed and local residents ''have an opportunity to understand the true impact of the proposed third track on their homes and communities.''
 Meanwhile, homeowners near the Main Line say they are in limbo. ''It's a heck of a way to live,'' said Robert N. Femminella, the president of the newly formed Save Our Village New Hyde Park Association. ''You just don't know whether they are going to take away your home.''

HEADLINE: Hey, Pop Idol, Surrender My Name!

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
HOW do you compete with an Angel?
 An Ashley Parker Angel, to be exact. As in the boy-band sex symbol and teen icon who is also my famous Internet doppelganger and, most certainly, my higher-achieving alter ego.
I discovered this one night when I was searching for something I had written, and plugged my name into Google. (Let this be a cautionary tale for those who self-Google.) I was surprised when the first page of hits turned up fan clubs in my honor, a fully-functional MySpace page and a rather comprehensive Wikipedia entry. Oh, they shouldn't have, I thought. Then I looked closer. 
 Everything was devoted to another Ashley Parker -- to Ashley Parker Angel, 25, heartthrob extraordinaire, with a mop of sun-bleached hair, aqua-blue eyes and high and rosy cheeks that slope down into a perfectly cleft chin. Google turned up his hit singles, his glossy fashion shoots, his German fan clubs.
 The points I had scored for my high school basketball team? The articles I had written for my college newspaper? The two decades I had also been alive? You had to scroll to Goooooooooooooogle to find even a mention. 
 ''See,'' I explained to friends, ''If you just go to Google, Page 14 ''
 Of course, they teased me: ''Hey, Mrs. Angel.'' Or, ''I saw your boy on MTV last night.''
 We were the same age, but in every other way, I was the opposite of the preternaturally perky he-Angel: female, dark-haired, dark-humored, occasionally Goth and perpetually awkward. 
 I fumed. I complained. And then I accepted it. Short of changing my name to Ashley Parker Devil, there wasn't much I could do. 
 But recently, when I was working out of an office in the theater district, where the other Ashley Parker was playing the lead in ''Hairspray,'' an opportunity emerged for an Ashley vs. Ashley face-off. It was the brainstorm of a well-intentioned theater publicist I had called about a profile I was working on.
 ''This isn't business related,'' he interrupted, ''but I just have to tell you. Your name is Ashley Parker, and the lead of 'Hairspray' is also named Ashley Parker ''
 ''Angel.'' I finished the sentence for him.
 ''Yes, Ashley Parker Angel,'' he said. ''So you're Ashley Parker, and he's Ashley Parker.''
 Yes. I know.
 The publicist arranged for a ticket.
 ''You simply must meet him,'' he said. ''I put down 'Ashley Parker,' and then next to your name I put a note: 'Not that Ashley Parker. Another Ashley Parker.' Because, you know, you have the same name.''
 He giggled. I didn't.
 Not only had Ashley Parker Angel co-opted my identity, but he also had done great things with it. While I was piddling around in college, Ashley Parker Angel had borrowed $800, hopped onto a plane to Las Vegas and earned a spot on the ABC reality show ''Making the Band.'' Then, horrifyingly, they had actually made the band, O-Town, with him in it. 
 By the time I moved to New York to dabble in unemployment, Ashley Parker Angel was on his way to his own MTV reality show, ''There and Back,'' and an appearance on the network's ''Total Request Live.'' And now here he was playing the dashing Link Larkin in ''Hairspray,'' an art-imitates-Ashley role that almost mirrors his own boy-wonder-to-pop-idol life story.
 Worse, here I was, following him through a squealing throng outside a West 52nd Street theater to a wine bar around the corner.
 ''Hey, great name,'' he said, grinning.
 I hoped he didn't think I was going to be won over so easily. I was there on business, after all, and I had come with a plan: Over drinks I was going to try to wrest back my identity. 
 I knew it wasn't going to be easy. While I had a few admirers (Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!), it wasn't exactly like I had thousands of fans dying to touch my hand and take my picture. 
 ''So,'' I began, ''do you ever go by your initials? Just A.P.A.?''
 ''I'm starting to, more and more,'' he said.
 I explained that acronyms were very in these days, but he seemed noncommittal, so I tried another approach.
 What about adding a second middle name? Something divine -- Heaven, Cherub, Rapture, maybe.
 ''I like that,'' he said, still grinning. ''The four names -- that could be a way to make me stand out.'' But then he hesitated: ''My name already sounds like a porn star.''
 I tried again. I'd read that he was actually born Ashley Ward Parker, and had taken on ''Angel,'' his stepfather's last name, when was adopted by him at age 3.
 ''What about bringing back the Ward?''
 ''No, I don't think so,'' he said. ''It sounds so 'Leave It to Beaver.' '' 
 This isn't about you, I wanted to shout at him. 
 But the truth was, in person, Ashley Parker Angel was endearing. He was earnest in a way you wouldn't expect him to be, full of small-town friendliness with an open and eager face. He said things like, ''This is a cool hang,'' and he described the rigors of ''Hairspray'' as, ''It's like playing football set to music.'' 
 He also glowed when he talked about his 21-month-old son, Lyric Lennon -- ''I'm into original names,'' he explained -- and pulled out pictures of Lyric in a red-and-yellow Fisher-Price car, Lyric giggling at the camera.
 He didn't even mind having a stereotypically female name. ''A girl's name,'' I goaded. He told me that his mom loved ''Gone With the Wind,'' and that he had been named after Scarlett O'Hara's heartthrob, Ashley Wilkes.
 ''I had to explain that to people,'' he said. ''Elementary school was tough.'' (As it will be for Lyric.)
 I empathized, I really did. Still 
 ''What about just going by Link Larkin?'' I asked, nodding encouragingly. ''He's very sexy.''
 ''Yeah, I have started to go by L.L. in e-mails,'' he said. ''I do like the L.L., the A.A. It's all very superhero, the double initial -- Peter Parker, Lex Luthor.''
 Finally, I cut to the chase. How frustrated, I asked, would he be if the situation were reversed? What if he woke up one day to discover that I existed, and that I had rendered him both un-Googleable and the punch line to boy-band jokes?
 ''I can see how that might be frustrating,'' he said, looking concerned. ''But I think that if we join forces, we can be even stronger. If we make people aware, we can circumvent the problem. We can be the Ashley Parker Force.''
 He offered to put an asterisk on his MySpace page, acknowledging the existence of another Ashley Parker.
 ''Yeah, and you could maybe just link to a few of my articles,'' I added helpfully.
 ''We could share all sorts of things,'' he continued, picking up speed. ''We could sign up for a Blockbuster membership and pass it back and forth. We could share Costco membership. We could share a library card. We'd save a lot of money!''
 Indeed we would. 
 Still, I took a deep breath and laid the last of my cards on the table. No offense, I told him, but boy-band stars come and go. And, well, I'm going to be a famous writer. At least, I'm going to be a writer. Aren't you a little concerned that 10 years from now you'll Google yourself and all you'll find is me?
 He ducked his head a little, and crinkled his blue eyes.
 ''That's why we have to stay friends,'' he said. ''So you can remember the little people.''

HEADLINE: A Downtowners' Club For Poets on a Curfew

BYLINE: By TIM MURPHY

 BODY:
IN the annals of New York's postpunk, polysexual downtown bohemia, celebrated haunts are best known by their memorable evenings. The night at the Pyramid in 1984, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers first played the East Coast and shocked the dive's drag queens with wardrobes limited to artfully placed socks. Or the final marathon, in December 2000, of the cult party Jackie 60, which reigned on Tuesdays in the 1990s at Mother, the club-cum-salon in the meatpacking district. 
 If the Rapture Cafe -- which opened last December at 200 Avenue A, between 12th and 13th streets -- joins that pantheon of clubs, its opening-night party may well have been the first evening there to attain such lofty status.
When the old-school demimonde of the Lower East Side heard that the cafe was being managed by Brian Butterick, whose drag alter ego, Hattie Hathaway, had been a fixture at places like Pyramid and Mother, 200 people turned out for a night of catered booze (pre-liquor license), burlesque performances and even an appearance by the former Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry, 61, whom many consider the godmother of the downtown scene. (The cafe takes its name from Blondie's hit song.) 
 ''It was a little bit of a family reunion, that's for sure,'' said the video artist Rob Roth, 37, who attended the party with Ms. Harry as well as Johnny Dynell and Chi Chi Valenti, the longtime husband-wife D.J.-promoter team that owned Mother. ''It just felt great, like something was going to happen.'' 
 Mr. Dynell, a longtime East Villager, says the evening ''was like old-home week'' for a certain downtown crowd that has partied and made art and music together as far back as the late 1970s.
 Since then, the 2,200-square-foot cafe-bookstore-performance space, which sits on a stretch thick with shabby-chic hipster bars, has become a hangout for many of the neighborhood's longtime writers and performers. It is a crowd that, in years past, socialized mostly in loud smoky black-box clubs below 14th Street.
 These days, this group is turning to Rapture's kinder, gentler morning-until-midnight atmosphere, with its wheat-colored plaster walls, light wood bookshelves (stocked with everything from the latest Amy Sedaris book to magazines like Heeb and Mother Jones), pastry-stocked coffee bar and abundance of lighting from airy-looking Japanese lanterns. 
 ''It's a warm, cozy, friendly place where all the girlfriends gather, but they're not drunk,'' said Justin Bond, the Kiki DuRane of the camp cabaret duo Kiki and Herb. Other Rapture habitues include Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls, the poet Ira Cohen and the performance artists Penny Arcade and Shelly Mars. 
 ''Rapture offers the possibility of cafe society, which has basically been blown out of New York,'' said Ms. Arcade, 56, a longtime Lower East Side resident.
 That's all fine. But given the atmosphere in the neighborhood -- skyrocketing rents, an influx of students from nearby New York University, an invasion of affluent co-op and condo dwellers -- can the Rapture Cafe survive as a clubhouse for the area's remaining bohemians?
 Joe Birdsong, the cafe's owner, believes that it can, in part because it already enjoys a ready-made clientele of locals who have outgrown the bar and club scene but still want to hang out and make or see art with their friends. 
 There is less pressure to be drunk or high in a place like Rapture, said Mr. Birdsong, 37, giving its patrons ''a certain lightness that comes after spending so much time in the dark.''
 All the same, he said he hopes the liquor license, acquired in March, and rentals for private parties will draw enough income to allow him to stay afloat without charging for readings and performances. 
 Mr. Birdsong, a former gym manager and go-go dancer at East Village gay bars, appears to have the support of his landlord, who said he is charging him below-market rent, hoping to preserve the area's quirky, artistic feel by keeping small independent businesses around.
 But such landlords are rare in the increasingly high-tone East Village, where an average studio walk-up rents for $1,700 and a one-bedroom goes for up to $2,500, according to Trina Harrison, a Corcoran Group Real Estate broker who handles rentals in the area. 
 So far, Rapture seems to be crossing the divide, filled as it is most days with both old neighborhood stalwarts and the laptop-bearing 20-somethings who ride the L train in from Brooklyn. 
 Yet similar scrappy venues in the neighborhood have a mixed record of success. On East Fourth Street, the KGB Bar, a tavern that regularly holds fiction and poetry readings, has been profitable enough since it opened in 1995 that its owner, Denis Woychuk, said he was able to buy the building in 2001. ''We couldn't do free readings here without selling drinks,'' he said. 
 Nearby, the Bowery Poetry Club, a similar establishment that opened five years ago, is also hanging in, said Bob Holman, its proprietor. ''I wanted to see if poets would drink enough for me to pay the rent,'' he said. He has needed only a handful of private contributions to help him get by, he said.
 But CBGB closed last October, after 33 years, when its landlord refused to renew its lease. And alt.coffee, a beloved cafe with a punk-rock atmosphere that opened in 1995, closed in April because of a 20 percent rent hike and a 40 percent price increase for dairy products, said its owner, Nick Bodor. 
 To survive, Mr. Bodor said, he's converting the space into a child-friendly cafe named Hopscotch, which he hopes to rent out for birthday parties. ''The East Village has gotten so expensive,'' he said, ''that the only people who can move here are the ones who can afford to have kids.'' 
 Yet the Rapture Cafe has something that many new establishments lack: a longstanding neighborhood fixture at its helm in the 6-foot-2 Mr. Butterick, 50. 
 He is better known to some as the bookish drag queen Hattie Hathaway, a persona he burnished over two decades while serving as a host at downtown clubs. Mr. Butterick is ''a real chronicler,'' says Les Simpson, a magazine editor who is also known as the drag performer Linda Simpson. ''He knows a lot of East Village history.''
 Miss Hathaway has yet to make a major appearance at the Rapture Cafe, Mr. Butterick notes dryly one afternoon, chain-smoking alongside Mr. Birdsong in the cafe's windowless basement office. Instead, Mr. Butterick, whose towering appearance and languid effect suggest a drolly observant Fred Gwynne, dresses in jeans and a baggy sweatshirt by day. In the evenings, when he presides over readings and performances, he usually switches to an oversize blazer, evoking David Byrne from ''Stop Making Sense.''
 In the 1990s, at Mother, Mr. Butterick helped found the Night of a Thousand Stevies, where clubgoers came dressed as Stevie Nicks. Gigs with various downtown acting troupes led to his role in last year's Broadway revival of ''The Threepenny Opera.'' After that, he says, ''I was seriously thinking about being a moth in Tarzan, but I don't do stunts.''
 Instead, at Mr. Dynell's urging, he ended up at the Rapture Cafe, where he's been making the transition from a clubland closing time of 4 a.m. to a last call of midnight or earlier. 
 On a Thursday in March, on came the oversize blazer. Romy Ashby and Foxy Kidd, publishers of the underground literary magazine Goodie, were the hosts for a reading by their latest cover subject, Edgar Oliver, 50, a longtime poet and resident of East 10th Street, who nervously clutched a glass of red wine. 
 In a voice that called to mind both Audrey Hepburn and Bela Lugosi, Mr. Oliver read elegantly macabre verses about solitary walks through desolate stretches of Brooklyn. ''I'm so happy to be here,'' he intoned, smiling coyly, before an adoring pack of friends and fans. ''Yay, Hattie! Yay, Rapture!''
 Ms. Ashby, in a black velvet cape, and Ms. Kidd, sporting a bowler, tattered Jackie 60 T-shirt and monster-mash eye makeup, mingled with guests that included Carole Ramer, a former assistant to Abbie Hoffman who later became a hair and makeup artist, and the painter Neke Carson, who said he was about to sell a 1972 portrait of Andy Warhol that he had done at the Factory. 
 Also on hand were about a dozen of Mr. Oliver's young acolytes. 
 ''Edgar's one of my best friends,'' said Aaron Howard, 29, a Williamsburg artist and writer. 
 Mr. Howard said that it was his second visit to the Rapture, and that he planned to come back soon. ''There's always cool people here,'' he said.
 That's the kind of reaction that the cafe's principals were hoping for. Mr. Birdsong said: ''I want to hear people say, 'I've seen amazing art there.' Or 'I wrote my first novel there.' '' He said he wants to stock more books, be host to an event every night and become a home to small film festivals. 
 Mr. Butterick wants to see more ''performers who've never appeared on stage before sharing their work here,'' he said. ''I call it their first time in heels.''
 Whether the economics of the new, post-bohemian East Village are on their side remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the neighborhood's bohemian holdouts are rooting for them. 
 ''It's going to be interesting to see how this little place survives in this neighborhood,'' Mr. Bond said. ''But right now, it does seem like a little sanctuary.''

HEADLINE: Tribe's Commitment To the Environment

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 In ''High Stakes in the Catskills'' (Op-Ed, April 29), Kim Elliman and Nathan Berry challenge the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe's environmental commitment. Our tribe has a long, rich and meaningful tradition of respecting, protecting and preserving natural resources. We agree that the watershed should be protected. 
The St. Regis Mohawk Casino at Monticello Raceway is a testament to responsible development. Good planning, together with the substantial mitigation funds committed by the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe and Empire Resorts, the project's developer, will both protect local natural resources and ensure the integrity of the watershed. The St. Regis Mohawk Tribe is particularly sensitive to this issue since our own waterways on the Akwesasne Reservation were polluted by nearby industry. 
 The tribe's casino plans have undergone the most comprehensive studies ever undertaken for a project of this type, including a complete environmental assessment to fulfill federal requirements and an environmental impact statement to fulfill New York State requirements. 
 The plan enjoys wide support because it will boost the area's economy while respecting the environment. After more than a decade of planning and review, it is time to move forward. Lorraine White Tribal Chief St. Regis Mohawk Tribe Akwesasne, N.Y.

HEADLINE: On the Snake River, Dam's Natural Allies Seem to Have a Change of Heart

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: LOWER GRANITE DAM, Wash. 

 BODY:
The wheat Bryan Jones grows in Eastern Washington begins its journey to Asia on barges along the lower Snake River. The river, once a wild, muscular torrent, was made barge friendly a quarter-century ago by four of the nation's most controversial hydropower dams.
 A tame river keeps Mr. Jones's business viable. So why is he is spending time with the guides and fishermen who want to remove the dams? In part, because he feels the tug of environmentalist arguments that the dams will endanger wild salmon that, even more than wheat, are the region's natural bounty.
''I always believed dams were economically too big of a hurdle to attack,'' said Mr. Jones, who is 52. ''But I began to realize that we are potentially losing runs of salmon'' along this tributary of the Columbia River. 
 It is still a relatively rare phenomenon, but one becoming more noticeable: some members of the dams' natural constituency, like farmers, are talking to their downriver antagonists about a future that might not include the four lower Snake River dams. There is talk of reconstituting a regional rail system to deliver Mr. Jones's wheat to Portland, Ore. There is talk of a wind farm to replace the electricity -- enough to power most of Manhattan -- generated by the four dams. 
 The conversations are still in their early stages, and political support for the dams remains strong. Congressional ties to the Bonneville Power Administration, which provides electricity from the dams to regional utilities and businesses, are many, and few politicians want to back an action that could raise electricity bills and cost jobs. At best, wind power is intermittent and expensive; in 2005, regional electricity costs were more than 25 percent less than the national average.
 But the pressures on the hydrosystem's traditional operations are accumulating, and conversions like Mr. Jones's have taken on an enhanced significance. As former Gov. John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon said in an interview, ''by not talking to each other, not trying to figure out the real economic issues, we're setting up a situation where someone else is going to figure out our future for us.''
 His allusion was clear: he fears that the operations of the Columbia River dams could be determined by a federal judge if federal and local agencies here cannot come up with a plan to successfully protect salmon.
 Indeed, Judge James A. Redden of the Federal District Court in Portland, who has presided over the central Endangered Species Act challenge to dam operations and whom the Vancouver Columbian called ''the best friend of endangered fish in the Northwest,'' has been acerbic in his dismissal of the most recent Bush Administration plan. Among other things, the administration argued that the Columbia River dams could not be removed because they were an immutable part of the landscape, having been built before the Endangered Species Act went into effect. It suggested habitat restoration would save the fish population.
 The Bush administration appealed Judge Redden's 2005 ruling, and last month the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, forcefully backed him. Under the federal government's theory, the appeals court held, ''a listed species could be gradually destroyed, so long as each step on the path to destruction is sufficiently modest. This type of slow slide into oblivion is one of the very ills the Endangered Species Act seeks to prevent.''
 On the lower Snake River, four runs of wild fish are threatened and one of these, sockeye salmon, may be irretrievable. Of the others, the spring and summer Chinook salmon, which have been going upriver for the past few weeks, are of most concern. 
 A new fish-protection plan, called a biological opinion, is due from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration later this year. Judge Redden has warned that if it fails to meet his viability test, he may have to take drastic action -- presumably, taking the running of the Columbia River hydropower system into his own hands, as another federal judge, W. Arthur Garrity, did in the 1970s with Boston's schools after the local community could not find a way to desegregate.
 The Bonneville Power Administration, also known as the B.P.A., is not a named defendant in the endangered-species lawsuit, but because the dams' operators at the Army Corps of Engineers work closely with Bonneville's engineers, B.P.A. officials are often called on by the courts to help explain corps actions.
 The Bonneville administrator, Stephen J. Wright, said in an interview in his Portland office that the potential loss of 5 percent of the electricity generated regionally each year would ''magnify substantially'' the current challenge of feeding the region's growing hunger for power without raising costs. 
 Mr. Wright and Bob Lohn, who heads the regional office of the National Marine Fisheries Service, argue that dams are hardly the only environmental disturbance harming the salmon runs, and that the bumper salmon year of 2001 demonstrates that salmon and dams can coexist. Judge Redden has deemed their plans for accomplishing the goal of salmon recovery inadequate. Environmentalists say their optimism about coexistence is belied by the steady decline in fish runs.
 Out here at the Lower Granite Dam, Witt Anderson, the chief of the Columbia River fish management office at the Army Corps of Engineers, said, ''We're mining the last few improvements we can get out of the hydrosystem.'' 
 But Mr. Anderson argues that dam removal alone would not be a quick fix to what ails the fish. Given the impact of factors including agricultural runoff, culverts, cyclical changes in ocean temperature and the amount and location of ocean-borne food available to salmon, ''We would say the solution is a comprehensive plan that addresses the life-cycle of fish, gravel to gravel.''
 Smaller private dams have been breached around the country, and there are plans to do so at dams on the Elwha and White Salmon Rivers in Washington. The idea of breaching the Klamath River dams in Oregon and California is getting new and serious scrutiny. But the Lower Snake River dams are significantly bigger, in economic terms, than any of these.
 There is, first of all, the electricity they generate. And the transportation. And the creation of inland ports, like Lewiston. Given these significant economic interests, the rethinking being done by a farmer like Brian Jones or a Lewiston city councilman like Jim Klauss is startling.
 ''When they created these dams in the 60s and 70s they said we'd have a lot of economic development,'' a promise that never materialized, said Mr. Klauss, who is 47. Now the sediment trapped behind the Lower Granite dam requires constant dredging just to make a small passage for boats and the levees may need to rise higher to keep the city safe in storms.
 So, although the City Council is pro-dam, Mr. Klauss said he was dubious. 
 ''We're kind of on a yo-yo,'' he said. ''We built these dams and changed everyone's lifestyle, and we can't say we have a lot to show for it. If you take them out you yo-yo back and change everyone's lives again.'' But, he said, it may be worth it.
 To the north, in Spokane, Wash., the president of the local chapter of Trout Unlimited sees these small cracks in the dams' natural constituencies as the beginning of a bigger political shift. ''This new generation,'' said Harvey Morrison, who is 64, ''has been willing to ask the hard questions.''

HEADLINE: Manager Frets Over the Market, but Still Outdoes It

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
EARNING 22 percent on your investments while holding half of your portfolio in cash is no easy trick, but last year Seth A. Klarman pulled it off, and it was not the first time. 
 Mr. Klarman, a 49-year-old hedge fund manager, has turned in market-beating performances since 1983, while perpetually warning that the markets were dangerous and that investors should minimize risk.
What is his investment approach? He will not spell it out, although lots of people would like to know. On the Web, the price for his out-of-print 1991 book -- ''Margin of Safety: Risk-Averse Value Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor'' -- has gone for $1,200 on Amazon and $2,000 on eBay. 
 At a time when hedge fund managers seem to be grabbing headlines with stories about their homes, hobbies, philanthropy and outsize compensation, Mr. Klarman keeps a low profile, and is reticent about the investments of his $7 billion Baupost Group of hedge funds, which has been closed to new money for the last seven years. 
 But his book, his letters to investors and other fund documents provide some clues about his thinking, and he added to the picture in a telephone interview. Mr. Klarman clearly sees himself as a deep value investor, in the mold of Warren E. Buffett or Benjamin Graham, the Columbia professor who pioneered value investing.
 He is also a world-class worrier. In one letter, Mr. Klarman said, ''At Baupost, we are big fans of fear, and in investing, it is clearly better to be scared than sorry.'' In an earlier note, he wrote, ''Rather than ratchet up risk, our approach has been to hold cash in the absence of opportunity.'' 
 Last year, the cash holdings of his hedge funds amounted to 49.8 percent of assets, an enormous proportion for actively managed investments, but not an anomaly at Baupost: a year earlier, the cash holdings amounted to 45.8 percent. To add safety to his portfolios, he said that he usually eschews leverage, or debt, in his funds, using it only in some real estate investments. Instead, he has profited handsomely from investing in the debt of other companies, particularly those in financial distress.
 Mr. Klarman, who is based in Boston and works with a team of 24 people, does not make bets on the overall market. Instead, his funds look for specific opportunities that he deems worthy. But he warns that Wall Street often tries to sell customers overvalued assets. For example, he said that he is wary of new issues because in the pursuit of large fees, banks may underwrite overpriced or highly risky securities. 
 Mr. Klarman's record has generated intense loyalty from investors. Since he began Baupost in 1983, it has posted an average annual total return of 19.55 percent, according to data provided by the hedge fund group. Declines have been posted in only 11 of the total 97 quarters since Baupost's debut.
 In 2006, Baupost's portfolio held an array of assets, including United States, European, Asian and Canadian equities, which accounted for 17.1 percent of the portfolio; debt and real estate, which each made up 10 percent; and 4.7 percent in private equity funds. And there was that big dollop of cash.
 ''Seth has a remarkable record, and even more so when you realize that he has achieved it by holding significant amounts of cash,'' said Jack R. Meyer, who until 2005 ran Harvard's endowment, which has been a longtime investor in Baupost.
 ''In other words, his risk-adjusted numbers are spectacular. What is unusual is the high return and the high cash levels,'' added Mr. Meyer, who now runs the investment fund Convexity Capital. 
 Mr. Klarman grew up in Baltimore, where his father was a health economist. After graduating from Cornell with a degree in economics in 1979, he worked for Max Heine and Michael Price at Mutual Shares for a year and a half, then went on to Harvard Business School, where he graduated with an M.B.A. in 1982. Immediately afterward, four wealthy families, including those of two Harvard professors, put up $27 million for Mr. Klarman to manage. 
 While his actual compensation has not been disclosed, years of high returns have made him wealthy. Baupost charges a 1 percent management fee on investments in its funds, as well as 20 percent of annual profit. It was managing roughly $6 billion at the end of 2005 -- which would mean a $60 million management fee for Baupost. In addition, its 22 percent return on investments last year would suggest profit of about $1.3 billion -- generating a 20 percent share for Baupost of about $260 million. The only leverage Mr. Klarman said he used was on the 10 percent of holdings in real estate, where the leverage was one to one. 
 Despite more than two decades of smart choices, Mr. Klarman seems to obsess continually about potential crises. In his most recent letter, he said that while investors had been upbeat because of relatively low market volatility and inexpensive credit, he was worried about trade imbalances and high levels of consumer debt, which he said could set off market declines. Writing about the stock market rally in 2006, he said: ''There was nothing about this party that would have made you want to leave early, unless you were a value investor. The only adverse trend was the scarcity of mispricing opportunities.'' 
 One place in which he said he had found some mispricing was in the shares of News Corporation stock, which rose 37 percent in 2006. While Baupost sold 1.8 million shares last year, at the end of December, it still owned 4.19 million shares, according to company filings. Last week, Mr. Klarman said he believed the stock was still undervalued. He added that he was not concerned about Rupert Murdoch's bid for Dow Jones & Company, at a price many have described as extremely generous, because it would be a relatively small transaction for a company the size of News Corporation. 
 Other Baupost equity holdings include Home Depot and Posco, a Korean steel manufacturer, two stocks that happen to be held by Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett's company. 
 Figuring out which distressed bonds Baupost owns is more difficult. For competitive reasons, Baupost does not name the companies, but last year Mr. Klarman told investors that its second-largest single annual gain came from an holding in NationsRent, a company that rents equipment to builders. NationsRent filed for bankruptcy in 2001. The next year Baupost invested about $100 million in the defaulted bank debt. 
 A year later, NationsRent reorganized. Baupost put in about $50 million in fresh capital in exchange for stock and ended up with a total of more than two-thirds of the stock. Last year, Sunbelt Rentals bought the company for $1 billion in cash and the assumption of debt. Mr. Klarman said that Baupost more than doubled its investment. 
 In the interview, Mr. Klarman said that he found bankruptcy investing appealing because the process of bankruptcy itself can help unlock the value of an investment.
 ''There is a catalyst,'' he said, ''because the way you make money is dependent on specific situations; the bankruptcy process itself will deliver you securities in the reorganized company.''
 DESPITE Baupost's stellar returns, Mr. Klarman's team continues to take out what he calls ''disaster insurance.'' Last year it emphasized gold, which would appreciate if the dollar and other currencies declined in value. Although Baupost did not indicate the size of its wager, it did tell investors in one of its funds that 2.87 percentage points of about 20 percent in total fund profit came from a bet that the precious metal would rise. He wrote that gold was underpriced because investors in this ''goldilocks'' era have not worried enough about currency devaluation. 
 Baupost has had its setbacks. In 2006 it lost money on an investment in TRM, which operates automated teller machines. ''It seemed cheap on cash flow, but its business deteriorated after Hurricane Katrina,'' Mr. Klarman said. ''It did not turn out to be as stable a business as we thought.'' 
 Baupost has done better with real estate. Last year, Coastal Management Resources, a company in which Baupost has an equity stake, bought the neighboring Cojo and Jalama Ranches north of Santa Barbara, Calif. Although neither the size of Baupost's investment in Coastal Management nor the purchase price of the ranches is known, the asking price was $155 million. 
 The ranch purchases may reflect Mr. Klarman's passion for horses. He has owned racehorses, and even at the track his penchant for details is manifest. One of his horses, now retired, is named Read the Footnotes.

HEADLINE: Shareholders Benefit When Managers Have a Serious Stake

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IF you own stock in a company that is ripe for takeover, you should hope the company isn't acquired by a private equity firm. 
 That, at least, is the conclusion of a new study, which found that public companies often pay a much higher price than private equity firms when buying other companies.
The study, ''Why Do Private Acquirers Pay So Little Compared to Public Acquirers?,'' began circulating last month as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. Its authors are four finance professors: Rene M. Stulz of the Ohio State University, and three from the University of Pittsburgh: Leonce L. Bargeron, Frederik Schlingemann, and Chad Zutter. A version of their paper is available at www.nber.org/papers/w13061. 
 Private equity firms are much in vogue on Wall Street these days. They are investment firms that pool money from wealthy individuals and institutions, and sometimes borrow money, for the purpose of acquiring companies, in hopes of managing them better for a couple of years and then selling for a profit. 
 Some of the largest private equity firms produced returns last year in the high double digits. Such performance has not surprisingly attracted huge sums of additional cash, which the private equity firms have quickly put to work. This year private equity firms have announced acquisitions whose total value represents nearly a third of the $684 billion in domestic mergers and acquisitions, according to Thomson Financial.
 The authors of this new study analyzed cash-only acquisitions of publicly traded domestic companies completed from 1990 through 2005. In total, they focused on 1,292 deals, 32 percent of which involved a private bidder and 68 percent involved a public bidder. They found that ''target shareholders receive 55 percent more if a public firm instead of a private equity fund makes the acquisition.''
 The professors were unable to account for this big price disparity in terms of any observable differences in the kind of companies that were acquired. It was not the case, for example, that private equity firms tended to purchase less profitable companies than public bidders did. Nor did private equity firms tend to acquire companies that were growing more slowly, or ones whose recent stock performance was poorer.
 The professors concluded that, if differences among the target companies cannot explain the huge price disparity, then differences among the acquiring firms must be the cause. Sure enough, the professors found that the highest prices tended to be paid by publicly traded acquirers whose managers owned the least amount of their companies' stock. Indeed, upon eliminating from their database those publicly traded acquirers whose managers had ownership stakes amounting to less than 20 percent, the professors found no difference in the average price paid by private and public acquirers.
 This finding suggests that it is not fair to say that private equity firms systematically pay too little to acquire other companies. Instead, it would be more accurate to say that acquisition prices tend to be too high when the acquirer is publicly traded and its management has a low ownership stake.
 Why would the percentage of shares owned by management have anything to do with the price paid to acquire another company? The professors say that when corporate managers have only a small ownership stake, they are more likely to pursue acquisitions that do not enhance shareholders' long-term value. In such cases, Professor Stulz said in an interview, their motivations may simply be to satisfy their egos by building a corporate empire.
 It might be tempting to view the News Corporation's recent bid to acquire Dow Jones & Company as a good example of this empire-building, especially since the offer of $60 a share is so much higher than the price at which the stock had been trading. But in fact it's not a good illustration of the pattern identified by the professors: Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation, owns nearly 30 percent of the company through various family trusts. In addition, Professor Stulz points out, ''it is not clear that Dow Jones's current owners have maximized shareholder value.'' (Disclosure: MarketWatch, my employer, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Jones.)
 HOW should you react if you own stock in a company that receives an acquisition bid from a publicly traded company whose management has a small ownership stake? 
 You may want to sell your stock immediately upon the announcement of that bid, Professor Stulz said, since chances are high that the bid will have inflated the price of your stock to overvalued levels. By selling immediately, you lock in much of that higher price and protect yourself from the possibility of the deal's falling through.
 A more general investment implication, according to Professor Stulz, is that investors should pay close attention to the incentives under which corporate managers operate. 
 ''You should favor companies whose managers are working on behalf of long-term shareholder value and not personal aggrandizement,'' he said. One clue that managers' interests are aligned with shareholders' is that they have a large ownership stake.

HEADLINE: Taste and Style By Way of Greece

BYLINE: By DAVID CORCORAN

 BODY:
WHEN the beloved Villa Cortina closed in 2005, after a 13-year run, the effect on its block, just north of downtown Tenafly, was like urban renewal in reverse. The stolid Colonial frame house and its grounds sprouted plywood and weeds. A fire in the vacant building left ugly black scars. Residents could have been forgiven for hoping that bulldozers would finish the job.
 So imagine their surprise in October 2006 when Axia Taverna burst on the scene, transforming the old place inside and out. The curb appeal was instantaneous: massive (and conspicuously expensive) dark-walnut entry doors, high-contrast outdoor lighting and, in an audacious touch, glass-paneled retractable garage doors that open onto a stone patio for warm-weather dining. 
The surprises continue inside. The designer, Tony Chi & Associates of Manhattan, created a powerfully inviting interior -- a dim foyer exploding into a bright two-story space with soaring ceilings, long banquettes strewn with pillows, a fetching 10-seat bar with a spectacular glass wine rack, and a granite staircase to another dining level. 
 The menu has been transformed, too, from high-end Italian to high-end Greek. The chef is Alexander Gorant, 36, who grew up in Bergen County, graduated from the French Culinary Institute in New York and cooked at Manhattan landmarks like Le Bernardin and Artisanal. He is of Greek descent (like his partners, Michael Parlamis and Tim Vlahopoulos), but he says that when he took the job he needed to ''Greek up.'' So he traveled to Athens to study at the elbow of the Greek-American chef and writer Diane Kochilas, learning how to work with ingredients like phyllo, lamb shank and the marvelously creamy Dodoni feta.
 The results are gratifying, if still a bit uneven. Mr. Gorant has mastered the standard Greek appetizers called mezedes. A pikilia, or assortment, cost $15: taramosalata, the creamy, briny fish-roe dip; smoked-eggplant dip; and tzatziki, a tangy but mellow concoction of yogurt, cucumbers, dill and plenty of garlic. Other fine starters included marinated, grilled octopus; thick grape leaves stuffed with rice; ouzo-cured salmon; beet salad with feta mousse; and a Gorant original, lamb pie, or shredded lamb shank mixed with feta and baked in phyllo. 
 There were some misses. A soup of the day featured a large shrimp and three mussels in their shells, all accurately cooked but hard to handle, even with soup spoon, fork and, finally, fingers; unappetizing globules of oil floated on the surface of the seafood broth. Oiliness marred an entree called Tenafly moussaka, Mr. Gorant's take on the classic eggplant dish. At the end, an assortment of Greek cheeses was heavy and undifferentiated, and kourabiedes, a selection of Greek cookies, were so stale and lifeless they could have been called pathetikos.
 But these disappointments didn't blot out the overall experience. Mr. Gorant has a sure hand with fish like branzino, arctic char and royal dorade, simply filleting and grilling them in the classic Greek manner. He coats skate wing in an intriguing, crunchy crust fashioned from dried fava beans and split peas, and tuna Santorini in a fragrant crust of crushed coriander seed. They come with unpretentious sides like tabbouleh, gently steamed spinach and potatoes mashed with grated lemon peel. 
 Desserts here are stylishly updated Greek-diner standards like rice pudding with chamomile and black pepper; a napoleon of yogurt, honey and walnuts; the semolina custard called galaktoboureko, wrapped in phyllo and drizzled with Cointreau; and a baklava-like honey-and-walnut pastry called kadaifi ala-poli, served with a scoop of delectable fig ice cream. 
 The restaurant's name is taken from the Greek word aksios, which means worthy. Mr. Gorant tells me the owners picked the feminine form in a tribute to Mr. Parlamis's wife, Marguerite. Their taverna is a tribute, too -- to the ability of dedicated people to reinvent a restaurant, and in so doing help rejuvenate its entire block. Axia Taverna 18 Piermont Road Tenafly (201) 569-5999 www.axiataverna.com GOOD THE SPACE -- A stylishly transformed Colonial frame house, with 115 seats on two levels, counting a bar and an outdoor patio. Fairly noisy, but tolerably so. Many steps, but the main level is wheelchair accessible via an elevator at the rear; restrooms are accessible. THE CROWD -- Casual but well turned out. THE STAFF -- Young, energetic and friendly. THE BAR -- A space unto itself, at the center of the main level. The wine list is filled with unfamiliar but well-made Greek reds and whites, many at comparatively gentle prices. THE BILL -- Lunch entrees, $10 to $21. Dinner entrees, $17 to $32. All major credit cards. WHAT WE LIKE -- Cured salmon, octopus salad, fish-roe dip, eggplant dip, yogurt dip, stuffed grape leaves, baked Cypriot cheese; skate wing, tuna Santorini, any whole grilled fish; galaktoboureko, kadaifi ali-poli, yogurt napoleon. IF YOU GO -- Open daily. Lunch: Monday to Friday, noon to 3 p.m. Dinner: Monday to Thursday, 5 to 10 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 5 to 11 p.m.; Sunday, noon to 9 p.m. Reservations recommended; necessary on weekends. On-street parking is plentiful. Reviewed May 13, 2007

HEADLINE: Assorted Mysteries of Economic Life

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THERE are many mysteries in the world of economics. The subject is in good measure terra incognita even now, 231 years after publication of ''The Wealth of Nations,'' Adam Smith's free-market bible.
 For example, why is unemployment so low when the economy is supposedly slowing rapidly? If gross domestic product grew at only roughly 1.5 percent in the first quarter of 2007, why is unemployment at barely 4.5 percent? 
 If the housing construction business is correcting rapidly, as it so clearly is, why has the fall in construction employment been so slight -- even in residential construction employment?
 Or on a subject of equivalent scope, corporate America has record profits both as an absolute number and as a percentage of G.D.P. And, in many parts of this nation, we have severe labor shortages. Why, in that case, have average wages stagnated for so long? We know wages in finance and at the top of the heap are rising rapidly, but why is wage growth stagnant throughout the rest of this superheated economy? It cannot just be foreign competition, because service sector wages are not rising or are barely rising at all. 
 Why is labor, and especially organized labor, such a whipped dog? Why isn't the tidal wave of demand created by foreign lending and borrowing from future generations pulling up demand for labor so strongly as to raise wages? I don't get it. 
 Then there's the little matter of the falling dollar. Every time the Chinese or the Japanese or the petro states scoop up another $20 billion of our Treasury bonds, they not only swallow a modest yield on their investment but also absorb a loss on the falling dollar when they translate the interest payments back into their own currency. So why do they keep piling up dollar-based assets? 
 I know they're little by little diversifying into euro-based assets, but what happens when the euro actually becomes the reserve currency of the world, or at least shares that title with the American dollar?
 When demand for dollars as a reserve asset currency falls, the dollar falls. If oil, for example, becomes denominated in euros, the price in dollars rises -- perhaps significantly. This in turn means even higher trade deficits and an even more rapidly falling dollar and then, dear reader, you eventually have a genuine dollar crisis. What do we do then? Have the powers that be in the Treasury thought about this? It's not only a distinct possibility but seems to be the direction toward which we are slouching.
 What happens to our whole economy if the world simply no longer wants to hold dollars in stupendous amounts? Is the Treasury Department's Henry Paulson worrying about this or only about how to further insulate corporate chief executives from responsibility to their stockholders? 
 Allow me to deviate from our theme a moment to consider exactly what policy makers and regulators in Washington might be up to when it comes to monitoring chief executives. 
 A new low was suggested in that realm recently by news reports saying that the Securities and Exchange Commission was considering allowing revisions to corporate law that would bar stockholders from suing their own managements in court for wrongdoing. 
 Instead, corporations would be able to require their owners -- yes, their owners -- to go through arbitration instead of court litigation if they had grievances. To say that this trivializes and betrays the ownership rights of stockholders is putting it mildly. It's really a betrayal of capitalism itself.
 O.K., back to the dollar. 
 If there is a dollar crisis and oil goes to $150 a barrel, where does the S.& P. go? Where do all of our retirement plans go? Where do our 401(k)s go? I think this is worth considering.
 Alas, all of the mysteries I've been pondering in the last week are about large, global issues. Another thing that preoccupies me, albeit on a slightly smaller scale, is an enduring mystery of the retail economic world: why don't people in New York City want a Wal-Mart in Midtown? 
 Manhattan is the most underserved market I have ever seen for retail customers. There really is nowhere for bargains on ordinary household goods and groceries in the whole borough. Yes, I know unions hate Wal-Mart. But not every New Yorker is in a union, and every New Yorker needs food and paper towels. (I, by the way, am a member of three unions: the Screen Actors Guild, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, and the Writers Guild of America, West. How many unions is Mayor Michael Bloomberg in?) 
 Don't the consumers deserve a break, too? I know Wal-Mart is not hip, slick and cool. It's for people who have to live within a budget, not for people who see movies with subtitles and have houses on Martha's Vineyard (or would like to). But don't working-class people deserve bargains on their daily bread?
 To keep Wal-Mart out of New York -- or my home, Los Angeles -- is simply to inflict a snobby class prejudice on working people. Why they and their representatives put up with this classist, ''let them eat Whole Foods'' nonsense is yet another mystery, and one that could be solved if politicians really cared about consumers. 
 You know, even thinking about politicians really caring about ordinary investors and consumers actually made me laugh as I was writing this. Pretty sad, huh?

HEADLINE: Soft Market? What Soft Market?

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL. 
E-mail: bigdeal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to transactions in the New York City real estate market, April is the sweetest month, at least for the sellers of co-ops and condominiums and those hard-working brokers who count on the commission checks handed over at closing.
 A tabulation of property closings in April and a trickle of closings in May filed with the city's Department of Finance show nary a shadow of the retrenchment in the national real estate market.
 Average prices at closings in Manhattan appear to have reached or exceeded the top levels achieved in the spring of 2006. Average prices were higher by 6 percent than prices in the previous quarter. 
 Median prices were up as well, suggesting the middle of the market remains solid, even for those without trust funds, hedge funds or tax shelters. The prices reflect contracts signed in April as well as in earlier months, and brokers say they have not seen signs of slackening in the peak spring season. 
 At the Lucida, a new glass-walled condominium at Third Avenue and 85th Street with 110 apartments, Extell Development said that more than 60 percent of the apartments had sold in a matter of weeks. 
 Buyers who have waded into this heady real estate market include Oleg Baibakov, a Russian executive who has branched out from nickel production to large-scale Moscow real estate development. A few months ago, Mr. Baibakov turned up his nose at a penthouse at the Plaza, according to an account by Bloomberg News, because the building's developer, in an effort to maintain a sense of mystery, did not allow an inspection of the raw space. 
 ''If you are buying a $30 million apartment, you are entitled to see the view,'' Maria Baibakov, Mr. Baibakov's daughter, was quoted as saying. ''It's kind of silly.''
 But property records show that Mr. Baibakov found a suitable alternative just up the street. On April 26, he closed on a $13.5 million apartment at 80 Columbus Circle, the north tower at the Time Warner Center, which comes with hotel services from the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. 
 The three-bedroom condo, with nearly 3,200 square feet, was sold by Sheila Potiker, who bought the apartment in 2005 for $9.4 million, with her husband, Hughes, the founder of Entertainment Publications, which produces books of discount coupons.
 Mr. Baibakov's purchase price was $500,000 over the asking price in a listing by Paula Del Nunzio at Brown Harris Stevens. 
 In the south tower at Time Warner, Sergio Kostek, a trader in emerging markets at Deutsche Bank, paid $6 million last month for a condo on the 58th floor. 
 Over at the Dakota, at 72nd Street and Central Park West, Ping Jiang, a trader with SAC Capital Partners, a hedge fund with offices in Stamford, Conn., paid $16.5 million for a 4,000-square-foot co-op with a den, living room and two bedrooms facing Central Park.
 Mr. Jiang presumably had no trouble meeting the co-op's financial standards. He is on the list of the top 100 traders in the current issue of Trader Monthly magazine, with an estimated income more than $100 million last year. 
 In city records, the sale price for the Dakota apartment was also more than $500,000 over the final listing price but well below the $20 million asked when the co-op was first listed. 
 The tabulation of closing prices identified 23 condominiums and 19 co-ops in Manhattan that sold for $4 million or more last month, the fifth-highest month since mid-2004, but many sales have not yet been recorded by the city. Several brokerages release market reports at the end of each quarter, but the methodologies differ, and there is no single authoritative tabulation of sales prices. 
 Greg Heym, an economist at Terra Holdings, who prepares market reports for Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, said the city's tabulation of market prices follows the same trends as his own reports. ''From what we see, the market has remained very strong in April and May,'' he said. The Dalton Dorm Mystery 
 ONE of many mysteries buried deep in the file cabinets of the Department of Buildings is the case of the student dormitory of the Dalton School, a private day school on the Upper East Side that has thrived for most of the last century without the need for a dormitory or residence for students in kindergarten through high school.
 But last October, a Greenwich Village developer filed a restrictive declaration promising to turn over six apartments in a eight-story building at 159 Bleecker Street to the school for use as a student dormitory. ''The units for Student Dormitory will be occupied by students only, and not their family,'' said the declaration, submitted by Emmut Properties, the developer.
 The document surfaced when the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation began looking into how the apartment building, constructed atop a two-story structure that once housed the Circle in the Square Theater, had gotten permission to be so tall and bulky. It towers over the small tenements surrounding it and has balconies that extend over the street. 
 The building, it learned, received a bonus allowing it to be built larger, often up to 20 percent larger, in exchange for providing ''community facilities'' -- space for doctor's offices, schools or dormitories -- under a provision of the zoning code.
 When the preservation group objected, the Department of Buildings held up occupancy of the building. But the agency reversed itself and issued a temporary certificate of occupancy, after the developer promised that the units would be used as a Dalton student dormitory.
 Ellen Stein, the head of school at Dalton, and Edward Pinger, the chief financial officer, did not respond to several phone calls last week and an e-mail message seeking comment about the filing. John Young, a principal at Emmut Properties, also did not return calls. 
 But Andrew Berman, the preservation society's executive director, said that when he checked with Dalton he was told the apartments would be used for faculty housing, a use he said was prohibited under zoning-code changes designed to eliminate abuses by developments.
 ''The community facility regulations are being abused as a way to make buildings bigger,'' he said. ''If the building is in fact larger than it is allowed, they should remove the illegal square footage.''
 The developer originally put 16 condominiums on the market, but when the market softened last year, the building was switched to a rental structure. Apartments are being marketed by Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy.
 Mr. Berman has also objected to the size of the balconies and questioned whether the building was too large even with the community-use bonus. 
 Kate Lindquist, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, confirmed that faculty housing is not an approved community use. ''The Building Department is requesting an inspection to ensure the dorms are being used as outlined in the restrictive declaration,'' she said. In an earlier audit, she added, the department objected to the balconies and the developer ''addressed the objection and resubmitted the plans,'' which were approved. Accident at Conversion 
 FOR more than a year, many of the 15 or so tenants remaining at 1200 Fifth Avenue, near 101st Street, have been skirmishing with the building's developer as the 15-story prewar tower, designed by Emery Roth in the 1920s, has been renovated and converted into luxury condominiums. Asking prices reach $19.5 million for a triplex penthouse. 
 At various times, tenants have complained about broken elevators, rats, leaks and freezing winter nights. Some went on a rent strike. They even hired an engineer to corroboratewhat they considered shoddy construction and unsafe conditions -- including concerns about the safety of triple-paned windows.
 Then last month, a 90-year-old woman who lives in the building was injured after attempting to close a new bedroom window before going to bed. The entire four-and-a-half-foot wide window, frame and all, pulled out of the wall and landed on her. The details of the accident were confirmed by tenants and the developer, who identified the woman as Ruth Newkirk. A home health aide in the apartment helped pull the window off Mrs. Newkirk and she was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where she is recovering from surgery for a broken leg. 
 Anna LaPorte, a spokeswoman for the developers, led by the Chetrit Group, said in a statement that they were doing ''a complete internal investigation and cooperating with all the agencies involved'' to make sure the windows in the building are in ''perfect working condition.''
 ''This was a terrible accident, and our thoughts are with Mrs. Newkirk and her family,'' she said. 
 But tenants provided a copy of a report by their engineer prepared in April 2006. It noted that ''the anchorage for the new windows appears inadequate as compared to the size of the window.''
 Jack Lester, a lawyer representing the tenants who went on a rent strike, said the engineer's concerns in the report had been shared with the building management. ''What is unique is that they were on notice that the installation of the windows was defective,'' he said.
 In a statement, the Department of Buildings said that the building would be inspected and that the agency ''will issue violations if appropriate.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 20, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Big Deal column last Sunday about the strength of the Manhattan residential real estate market this spring referred incorrectly to the nearest cross street to the Lucida, a new condominium on East 85th Street. It is Lexington Avenue, not Third Avenue.

HEADLINE: Bucking a Trend, More Houses Sell

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
IN the context of the depressed housing market nationwide, Westchester looks good. The number of sales has been rising since the start of the year, not falling. Prices, however, are down slightly over all, although not in every town -- Rye, for instance, has seen a substantial increase in prices. 
 And, in another indication of mixed signals about the state of the county's market, foreclosures are down from last year, but up significantly from two years ago.
Over all in the United States, sales of previously owned homes dropped 8.4 percent in the first three months of the year, according to the National Association of Realtors, a trade group in Chicago. By contrast, the number of closed transactions during the first quarter of 2007 increased in Westchester by nearly 6 percent from a year earlier, according to a report released late last month by the County Board of Realtors in White Plains. 
 Westchester's sales at the end of March totaled 1,927, compared with the record high level of 1,998 sales in the first quarter of 2005. Sales of condominiums were up by 17.3 percent in the most recent quarter, to 319.
 Economists and others who monitor the national scene ascribed the downturn to winter weather and tightened lending standards for people with weak credit. In Westchester, meanwhile, those keeping tabs on the real estate market cited the weather as a positive factor, even while acknowledging the negative impact of foreclosures and saying it had been even worse a year earlier. 
 ''The warm spell in January brought people out into the market who usually are not out at that time,'' said Harding Mason, president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and an associate broker at Houlihan Lawrence in Katonah.
 Perhaps an even larger factor, Mr. Mason said, was the continued growth of jobs in Manhattan and huge end-of-year Wall Street bonuses that ''overflowed into Westchester.''
 With sales activity strong, inventory grew only slightly. The county's inventory of 6,839 units on the market at the end of the first quarter was only 4 percent higher than last year's, according the report issued by the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, a subsidiary of the County Board of Realtors. 
 ''Westchester and Putnam Counties have not had an excess inventory problem for many years,'' wrote the listing service. ''To the contrary, a sales-limiting, price-pumping deficit of inventory has been the rule more often than not.''
 Mark Boyland, president of the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, said that if the inventory on hand would take less than six months to sell, the market is seen as favoring sellers; if it would take more than six months, the market favors buyers. ''The ideal situation,'' he said, ''is striking a balance.''
 Despite the strong sales, however, not all the real estate numbers in Westchester are positive. Most notably, the median sales price of a single-family home continued to drop, and foreclosures were far higher than they were two years ago. 
 The median sales price for a single-family house in Westchester was $635,000, down 2.3 percent from a year earlier, with 21 percent of Westchester houses selling for $1 million or more, the same percentage as in 2006. The median sale price of a condominium was $392,000, nearly 9 percent more than last year.
 The number of homes categorized as being in foreclosure in Westchester, according to RealtyTrac.com, a national online foreclosure listing service, was 425 for the first quarter of 2007. Its figures range from houses that are two months or more in arrears on mortgage payments to properties that banks have actually moved to take over. The first-quarter total was considerably lower than the figure for the first quarter of 2006, when the number of foreclosure filings in the county reached 501 -- but it was more than double the 192 filings reported for the county in 2005.
 The rate of foreclosure, according to RealtyTrac.com, was 0.12 percent, or one in 822 county households, compared with 0.17 percent in the state and 0.38 percent in the nation.
 Gary Leogrande, an associate broker for Keller Williams Realty New York, said that all areas of the county were reporting foreclosures.
 ''For a long time, we were seeing foreclosures primarily in run-down areas,'' Mr. Leogrande said. ''Now we're seeing it across the board.'' 
 If owners lag on mortgage payments, ''when house prices drop even just a little, they can't head off foreclosure by selling'' if the value of their property is now less than the amount due on the mortgage. 
 The increase in the past two years may indeed be tied to high-risk and subprime mortgage lending, but not all defaulters are what Mr. Leogrande called ''hard-luck cases.'' One case, he said, was a single-family four-bedroom house in White Plains that is now up for sale by a bank for $370,000. In that case, he said, the borrower rented out the house, intentionally did not pay the mortgage and walked away from the property, leaving it to the banks to foreclose. 
 In other cases, he said, properties are taking far longer to sell than anticipated. He cited a three-bedroom house appraised at $645,000 in White Plains that went on the market at that price a year ago and remains there. It is now listed at $575,000.
 But the situation varies depending on the area of the county, Mr. Boyland said. While the median sales price was down 2.3 percent over all for the first quarter from the same quarter a year ago, it was up 21 percent in Rye, to $1.7 million from $1,358,333, and down 11 percent in Cortlandt Manor, to $424,950 from $477,450 a year ago.
 ''Downturns in a market are rarely soft and always local,'' said Mr. Boyland, a sales associate for Keller Williams in Katonah. ''Even when there's an overall increase in the median, that comes as little relief to an individual whose house has been on the market for a long time and has had to drop the price.''
 Westchester's first-quarter performance was varied enough that the Multiple Listing Service report shied away from making a broad conclusion and cautioned that ''one quarter does not constitute a trend.''
 The quarter started at a low point for Westchester real estate. After several years of record sales, the median for a single-family home in Westchester had slipped by more than 3 percent as of the end of 2006, to $630,000. Also, the number of sales for all residential properties had dropped 14 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006, and the dollar volume of sales was down by 12 percent, to $987 million, from the year before.
 In the latest quarter, the indicators ''did not all point in the same direction and clearly showed a market that was in transition, as both buyers and sellers adjusted their strategies for dealing with the slowdown that took place in 2006,'' the report read. ''It will take another quarter or two for clearer patterns to emerge.''

HEADLINE: A Microsoft Alumnus Shares His Good Fortune

BYLINE: By JASON PONTIN. 
Jason Pontin is the editor in chief and publisher of Technology Review, a magazine and Web site owned by M.I.T. E-mail: pontin@nytimes.com.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
TARUN ANAND, the co-founder and chief executive of the Perfect Future, a start-up near Delhi, made his fortune in the United States, but returned to India to become an entrepreneur. He wants to use Web and mobile telephone technology to reform, or at least begin to improve, the uneven condition of education in his homeland. 
 I met Mr. Anand on a recent trip to India, where he introduced me to his company. Wearing a chartreuse cotton kurta, the traditional knee-length shirt of northern India, he arrived at my hotel and drove me through the squawking chaos of Delhi's industrial suburbs.
Mr. Anand, who is 34, grew up in Delhi, where his father taught political science at the University of Delhi (his mother was a chemistry teacher at a local school). He was always a tinkerer and engineer. ''At the age of 10, I built a film projector and watched strips of Indian cinema projected against a white wall,'' he said. ''Around the age of 14 I got hooked on computers and started programming.'' 
 He learned computer science at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur and at the University of Texas, Austin. In 1995, he joined Microsoft, where he helped design a number of successful systems, including Windows NT and 2000, as well as Microsoft's most important software development tools.
 In 2001, Mr. Anand returned to India to work for Microsoft as a ''technical evangelist,'' with the unenviable job of persuading other software developers to embrace Microsoft's technical standards, products and services. Even then, he said, he knew that he would eventually leave Microsoft to start his own business in India.
 ''I was honest with my boss, but I was building contacts and a network,'' he told me.
 He achieved limited institutional fame when he was named Microsoft's Worldwide Software Architect of the Year in 2003. But the next year, when his stock options vested, he quit the company to start the Perfect Future.
 Mr. Anand financed his company (which is named for a favorite book, ''A Future Perfect: The Challenge and Promise of Globalization,'' by two Economist editors, John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge) with $25,000 of his Microsoft money. He describes the venture as ''dedicated to bringing innovative solutions to emerging markets.''
 ''That's where the most demanding customers exist today,'' he said. ''Emerging markets also offer you the opportunity to experiment on both the mobile and Web platforms since the largest number of Web and mobile users exist in those markets.''
 After a number of false starts, and, like so many Indian software firms, some service work (in this case, developing the Web site of The Hindustan Times), the start-up decided to focus on education. 
 ''We realized that in Indian schools, children find education boring and static, and teachers and administrators are overburdened,'' he said. ''Parents are also out of touch with what's happening. But most importantly, children are unprepared for real life.''
 India's international reputation for educating so many to high standards is deserved, and is the more remarkable in a nation whose per-capita income was $3,700 in 2006. 
 But that reputation disguises significant disparities. 
 According to India's Department of School Education and Literacy, 90 percent of the country's children enroll in school, but after five years in class around 50 percent of the students fail basic reading tests and are unable to perform single-digit subtraction. Ninety percent of Indian children drop out before they reach high school. 
 When I visited with Mr. Anand, his company had just moved out of a garage into its new offices (an undistinguished low-rise office block in a dry, sun-blasted field in an industrial park) and was weeks away from shipping its first branded product, called ''School in a Box.'' In the 115-degree heat of a Delhi afternoon (the air-conditioning in his company's new offices had failed), Mr. Anand's small team of programmers and educational advisers proudly showed me their answer to the problems of Indian education.
 School in a Box offers Indian primary and upper primary schools (that is, for children from 5 to 14) an array of services which the Perfect Future hosts and manages. Teachers and others can use the services either on the Web, on mobile phones or even, in many cases, print them out at an Internet cafe and take them to school. 
 Among the tools that School in a Box users can deploy are simple text messages to notify school administrators, teachers, parents and children of important events; online student assessment tools; interactive question-and-answer examinations; and something called ''activity-based learning,'' or 25 games (most of them traditional and Indian) that teach children chemistry, physics and vocabulary.
 By far the most interesting and radical element of School in a Box is how it attempts to promote Vedic mathematics, a system that Bharati Krsna Tirthaji Maharaja, a Hindu mathematician and scholar of the last century, claimed to have rediscovered in the Vedas, or Hindu sacred literature. 
 Vedic mathematics is controversial. It is associated with Hindu nationalism. The section of the Vedas where Mr. Tirthaji unearthed them is notoriously obscure, and some mathematicians believe that Mr. Tirthaji was a fabulist whose inventions distracted from the genuine achievements of ancient Indian mathematics. 
 While I am no great mathematician, Mr. Anand's short tutorial revealed to me a system of remarkable power and elegance, ideally suited to calculations that must be performed without pen or paper.
 Mr. Anand believes that traditional Indian learning, of which he thinks Vedic mathematics is an example, was suppressed by the British during their administration. ''Most Indian children are unaware of the rich traditional knowledge and educational system of a great civilization,'' he said.
 The Perfect Future will earn money from School in a Box by charging schools about 15 Indian rupees, or around 40 cents, a month for each child, according to Mr. Anand. But he says the company will give away the service to the poorest schools or schools in rural areas.
 Still, School in a Box, for all its high-minded promise, faces real challenges. To flourish, it would have to be purchased by Indian school administrators, who are typically conservative, and who have limited resources. 
 For his part, Mr. Anand believes that his service will succeed because it doesn't threaten administrators, but will help them to do their jobs better. In the meantime, he is seeking the patronage of the minister of education for Delhi State, Arvinder Singh Lovely, whom he hopes will recommend School in the Box to administrators, and he is pursuing partnerships with other companies with interests in Indian education.
 More tellingly, it's not clear how much the new service can help Indian education. But for Mr. Anand, at least, it's a start. ''It's not an easy task to uproot an existing system, no matter how bad, with a new one,'' he argued. School in a Box, he said, won't foment any revolution. ''It was designed to bring an effective, affordable and user-friendly interface between technology and education.''
 Tarun Anand is one member of an intriguing and growing group: Indians who have done well in the United States, and who, in preference to becoming even richer in their adopted country, have come home to see what commercial technology can do to improve the intractable problems of the subcontinent.

HEADLINE: When the Wheels Come Off a Sport

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR

 BODY:
TOMORROW, the American cyclist Floyd Landis, the would-be heir to Lance Armstrong, steps before an arbitration panel in California to rebut the charge that his come-from-behind victory last year in cycling's most celebrated race was a fraud.
 If he loses, Landis will become the first winner in the 103-year history of the Tour de France to be stripped of the victor's yellow jersey because of doping. The disastrous toll his case has exacted on cycling's credibility -- races canceled for lack of sponsors, teams abandoned by their corporate underwriters, fans staying home -- offers a stark picture of what can happen when a sport finally confronts its drug problem in a serious way.
This couldn't be where baseball is headed, could it?
 As the two sports settle into their seasons, new, aggressive investigations are underway in both that could implicate dozens of star players and cyclists and raise questions about -- if not shatter -- the legitimacy of their accomplishments. 
 In cycling, more than 100 riders, including some of the sport's luminaries, have been implicated by the Spanish police in a blood-doping investigation. 
 In baseball, federal prosecutors have begun to pursue new avenues of investigation after a former Mets batboy pleaded guilty last month to selling performance-enhancing drugs to dozens of major-league players. He is cooperating with authorities. In addition, a special commission set up by Major League Baseball to look into the sport's drug problem has asked dozens of players to meet with its investigators and has sought medical records from at least two of the game's recent top sluggers, Sammy Sosa and Rafael Palmeiro.
 The spotlight is not likely to dim as Barry Bonds slugs his way to becoming the all-time home run king, a pursuit that has been tarnished as federal prosecutors investigate whether he lied during grand-jury testimony in a case involving the distribution of steroids to elite athletes. 
 Baseball is nowhere near where cycling has found itself as it responds to the Landis scandal with an unforgiving crackdown on drug and doping problems. 
 Cycling appears to have had little choice. Since Landis tested positive for synthetic testosterone in July, races have been canceled and teams have folded, both for lack of sponsors; fans have stayed home or switched off their televisions (for one Belgian race this spring, the venerable Tour of Flanders, there was a 77 percent decline in the live audience, according to IFM, a sports research company in Germany); and television networks in the United States and Europe have sharply curtailed their coverage of the sport.
 The Championship of Zurich which had endured for nearly a century, was canceled last month by Swiss organizers after doping scandals scared off sponsors. As for the sport's bottom line, IFM calculates that cycling has plunged as a marketing investment this season. 
 ''In every boardroom, if you talk about sponsorships for any big cycling race, they all discuss the doping problems,'' Henri van der Aat, managing director of a sports consulting agency in Amsterdam, told The International Herald Tribune this week.
 In response, teams have suspended some suspect riders, including the 2004 Olympic champion Tyler Hamilton, after he was implicated, though not charged, in the Spanish doping scandal. Other riders have been barred from races like the Giro d'Italia, second only in prestige to the Tour de France. The race began Saturday without its defending champion, Ivan Basso, who admitted involvement in the Spanish doping ring.
 For years, the cloud of doping loomed over cycling, and every champion had become suspect -- even Armstrong, the cancer survivor who won the Tour seven times. He has been dogged by doping allegations for nearly his entire career, though he has never tested positive and has denied ever doping. 
 The use of the blood-boosting drug erythropoietin, or EPO, became rampant in the sport in the 1990s. Before a test became available in 2000, riders carried thermoses filled with vials of the drug, according to Steve Swart, a New Zealander who once was an Armstrong teammate.
 Then the first big scandal hit. In 1998, the entire Festina team was thrown out of the Tour de France after drugs and doping supplies were found in a team car. Suddenly, the evidence was there, in 3-D, that cyclists might not be climbing those mammoth Alpine passes without pharmaceutical help.
 Though cyclists were occasionally caught doping in drug tests and punished, little was done to systematically clean up the sport until Spanish law enforcement authorities got involved and Landis tested positive. The result came after the Tour's 17th stage, which he won in an audacious 80-mile solo attack over three mountain passes that, for a few days, at least, ranked as one of the greatest performances in cycling's history.
 ''Cycling had to finally make changes out of survival, not because they wanted a change,'' said Greg Lemond, a three-time winner of the Tour and the first American to win the race. ''It was all because there was so much economic fallout from Floyd and other things that have happened. But look how long it took for them to get to that point. The sport was almost killed in the process.''
 Under cycling's new testing rules, the blood of the top 600 riders will be profiled to provide a baseline to aid in evaluating future test results. A major increase in random, out-of-competition testing has begun, and riders have signed agreements to provide DNA samples in the event of doping disputes. Testing is also done daily during competition, with blood and urine samples drawn from the stage winner, overall race leader and at least one random riders.
 Baseball imposed its drug-testing program just two years ago, after Congress pressured it do so. Each of the league's 1,200 players is urine-tested once in spring training, then once during the season. Another 600 urine tests are randomly conducted, including a maximum of 60 in the off-season.
 So far, no big-name current baseball players have tested positive, though the two investigations now underway may have more to say. The former Mets batboy, Kirk Radomski, has agreed to cooperate with the panel led by former United States Senator George Mitchell, who was appointed by baseball Commissioner Bud Selig last year to examine past and present drug use in the sport.
 Whether scandals, if they blossom, eventually harm baseball as they have cycling is a complicated question, in part because of the differences in the two sports. Success in cycling, in particular, depends on strength and endurance. Drugs are more likely to make a crucial difference. 
 ''At the end of the day, cycling is about who's the toughest, who has the most endurance, who can ride through the Pyrenees and ride for such long periods of time,'' said Peter Roby, the director of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University, in Boston. ''The sport itself almost lends itself to drug use because it's so physically taxing.'' 
 By contrast, he went on, baseball is ''a multiskilled sport'' that can certainly be enhanced by drugs, but only by so much.
 ''There's the hitters, the defense, the pitchers,'' he said. ''It's not just about being good at one thing.'' But both are both saturated with lore and history. Baseball is America's pastime; in Europe, cycling has its own mystique, followed in some countries more avidly than soccer. Both have their gods. Eddy Merckx and Bernard Hinault, both five-time winners of the Tour de France, are not so different from Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb in the scope of their accomplishments and the reverence they inspire.
 That reverence requires belief that the accomplishments are true -- a faith that may have been lost in cycling, and is being tested in baseball.
 Bob Costas, the sports broadcaster and former baseball play-by-play announcer, said he believed there would have to be hard evidence that huge numbers of current players had used performance-enhancing drugs before fans and sponsors would turn away, as they have done in cycling.
 ''Fans are fans of their team,'' he said. ''So, it's like a guy in St. Louis might say, 'Yeah, what Barry Bonds is doing is not authentic. But geez, Chris Carpenter is on the disabled list. Now that's terrible.' ''
 But Roby is not so sure. ''I don't think it can afford another scandal,'' he said of baseball. ''The scandals just keep coming. I think people are saying, 'Geez, when is this going to end?' It definitely has been chipping away at the credibility of the game.''

HEADLINE: Pop Quiz: Did the Tax Cuts Bolster Growth?

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
POLITICIANS from the president on down have lately been saying that the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 were responsible for the quick growth of the economy starting in mid-2003. That growth has since tapered, but as Republicans lobby to make the tax cuts permanent, it's worth asking -- are they right?
 I decided to pose that question to a large group of mainstream economists through an informal survey. The answer, in a nutshell, was no -- the tax cuts don't deserve most of the credit for the economy's strong growth. But there was a lot more to the story. 
Here's how the information was collected. Last week, I sent e-mail messages to the 177 members of the National Bureau of Economic Research's program on economic fluctuations and growth. The bureau is the nonpartisan, nonprofit institute whose macroeconomists conduct their own research and ascertain the timing of the nation's booms and recessions.
 The e-mail message had just one question: ''Which factor was most important for the economy's growth from mid-2003 through the end of 2006?'' 
 It offered the economists five possible responses:
 a. The tax cuts signed by President George W. Bush.
 b. Pent-up demand following the recession, the corporate scandals and the invasion of Iraq.
 c. Both (a) and (b) were important.
 d. Neither (a) nor (b) was important; it was the regular business cycle.
 e. There's no way to tell now.
 As a check of the economists' willingness to answer beyond the multiple choices, the options didn't include anything having to do with monetary policy, including the Federal Reserve's actions, global interest rates or the refinancing in the home loan market -- factors that could have been important. 
 Forty-nine economists responded to my message, including many of the best-known names in the field. Of these, only five, about 10 percent, said that the tax cuts were the most important factor in the economy's growth. 
 Two were Nobel laureates known for their conservative views -- Robert E. Lucas Jr. of the University of Chicago and Edward C. Prescott of Arizona State University. Two other professors, Martin S. Feldstein of Harvard and Gary D. Hansen of the University of California, Los Angeles, qualified their answers by mentioning other factors.
 Three economists chose pent-up demand, and three answered both. 
 But the majority, 30 economists, answered neither or supplied an answer not listed. 
 Robert E. Hall of Stanford wrote that ''the U.S. economy recovered from every single recession it ever had, so the growth in 2003-2006 was generally part of the normal cyclical recovery.''
 Several economists volunteered other factors, among which monetary policy was the most popular.
 ''I can't believe you left off the list: superlow interest rates caused by the Federal Reserve,'' wrote Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton professor who was vice chairman of the Fed in the mid-1990s. Paul M. Romer of Stanford echoed Professor Blinder's sentiments.
 Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University added: ''I hope others tell you that your question is absurd, because it leaves out the most obvious cause -- an unprecedented period of negative short-run interest rates that fueled spending on housing, made possible consumer cash-outs through mortgage refinance, and also supported consumer spending more generally.''
 Some professors were just as adamant in supporting an alternative hypothesis, arguing that changes in productivity had been responsible for the economy's growth.
 ''Productivity growth and financial innovation are the big stories of the 2000s,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff of Harvard. ''Innovation helped cushion the economy during the 2001 downturn, and fueled a stronger than expected recovery for several years thereafter.'' Erik Hurst of the University of Chicago said that ''aside from the inventory correction in 2001, the growth in 2003-2006 was not that different than 1996-2000 (which had nothing to do with tax cuts or pent-up demand).''
 And one economist said that most of the factors named, with the exception of the tax cuts, were part of the usual behavior that followed recessions. ''Pent-up demand following a recession sounds like the regular business cycle,'' wrote Robert J. Shiller of Yale. ''Also, part of the regular business cycle is the Fed and the behavior of speculative markets.''
 DEBATES about the business cycle aside, most of the respondents were unconvinced by the politicians' claims about the benefits of tax cuts. In fact, one actually argued that the tax cuts hurt the economy. ''The tax cuts, by increasing uncertainty about how impending fiscal imbalances will be resolved, probably hurt growth, if anything,'' said Christopher A. Sims of Princeton.
 That wasn't the only point of contention, though. A similarly contrary argument was suggested by Lee E. Ohanian of U.C.L.A. concerning the war in Iraq. ''Large increases in military expenditures are almost always associated with rapid growth (e.g. World War II, when government spending reached about 70 percent of trend output), but the size of the Iraqi conflict spending is quite small as a fraction of total income.''
 Economics is not an exact science, even in hindsight. Indeed, economists rarely say that they've proved an empirical hypothesis. Rather, they say that a hypothesis can't be ruled out. In that spirit, several answered that there was no way to say for sure which factors had caused the economy to grow.
 Paul S. Willen, a senior economist and policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said that he would answer ''neither,'' but added that ''if we hold ourselves to the highest standards of scholarly rigor, we could not answer anything but (e),'' the response for there's no way to tell now. Perhaps, for the politicians, a similar measure of caution may be warranted.

HEADLINE: Only Halfway There

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I'm glad Democrats are keeping the pressure on President Bush for a withdrawal date from Iraq. It's the only way to keep him and Iraqis focused on the endgame. But if Democrats really want to be taken seriously on foreign affairs, they need to recognize that they have only half a policy on Iraq. And it's the easy half. 
 You can't be in favor of setting a date to withdraw from Iraq without also being in favor of a serious energy policy to radically reduce our dependence on oil -- now. To call for withdrawing from Iraq by a set date, no matter what the situation is on the ground there -- without a serious energy plan here -- is reckless. All we would be doing is making ourselves more dependent on an even more unstable Middle East, because any U.S. withdrawal from Iraq is likely, in the short run, to be destabilizing. 
The Middle East today is deeply troubled. If we determine that our efforts to tilt that region in a different direction -- by building a decent Iraq -- have failed, then our efforts to minimize our exposure to that region have to begin. But the last thing we can afford to do is walk away from the Middle East militarily while remaining chained to it economically.
 More important, if Iraq totally fails, but we still believe it is in our interest to promote reform in the Middle East, a serious U.S. energy policy that permanently brings down the price of oil -- by developing scalable alternative energies -- is actually the best Plan B there is. You will see reform in the Arab-Muslim world only when regimes there can't survive just by extracting oil, but have to extract the talents of their people by educating, empowering and connecting them. 
 But to hasten that day, Democrats have to be a lot more serious about energy than they have been up to now. Everyone has an energy plan for 2020. But we need one for 2007 that will start to have an impact by 2008 -- and there is only one way to do that: get the price of oil right. Either tax gasoline by another 50 cents to $1 a gallon at the pump, or set a $50 floor price per barrel of oil sold in America. Once energy entrepreneurs know they will never again be undercut by cheap oil, you'll see an explosion of innovation in alternatives.
 ''Right now we're looking for solutions in all the wrong places,'' argues the noted oil economist Philip Verleger. ''The only way one can effectively address this problem today and get an immediate kick is by raising the price at the pump and keeping it there.'' Some of the revenue could be used to buy back the most fuel-inefficient vehicles on our roads, he added. ''The best monument to 9/11 we could erect would be a mountain of crushed gas guzzlers.''
 There are some hopeful signs: Chris Dodd has just broken ranks and become the first presidential candidate to issue a serious, comprehensive energy plan that includes the ''T word.'' He has called for a ''corporate carbon tax'' that would both help fight global warming emissions and raise gasoline prices.
 ''You say the word 'tax' and people usually head for the hills,'' Mr. Dodd told me. ''But this is one where the American people can handle the truth. Unless you address the issue of price, you're not serious about moving us from Point A to Point B.'' 
 Barack Obama also just got right in Detroit's face. He went to Motown, called for much tougher fuel economy standards and bluntly told automakers and autoworkers the truth: ''For years, while foreign competitors were investing in more fuel-efficient technology for their vehicles, American automakers were spending their time investing in bigger, faster cars. Whenever an attempt was made to raise our fuel efficiency standards, the auto companies would lobby furiously against it, spending millions to prevent the very reform that could've saved their industry.'' Those are fightin' words!
 Finally, in a move that also merits praise, General Motors announced that it was joining other major U.S. corporations, like General Electric, and signing on to the United States Climate Action Partnership (U.S.C.A.P.), which calls for a cap-and-trade program to control carbon dioxide emissions. G.M. is the first auto company to do so.
 None of these go far enough, but they are all new positions and may be harbingers of a new competition in which companies and candidates try to outdo each other in being serious about energy rather than phony. That would be a big deal -- and it might give the Democrats a more comprehensive Iraq policy just in the nick of time.
 You can't be serious about getting out of Iraq if you're not serious about getting off oil.

HEADLINE: A Winning Deal on Trade

 BODY:
The Bush administration and Congressional Democrats have reached a broad understanding on trade that should benefit American workers, American businesses and global economic growth. 
 It is good to see that even in today's Washington, partisan divisions need not stand in the way of the broader national economic interest. Faced with the prospect that Congress's new Democratic majorities would block all trade agreements, the administration decided that reasonable labor standards were not such a bad idea after all. Instead of playing to protectionist sentiments, Democratic party leaders accepted the deal. 
A commitment to basic labor standards -- including bans on child labor and forced labor and guarantees of the right to organize -- will be written into pending and future trade agreements. Trading partners will be required to enforce their own environmental laws. The administration will be responsible for monitoring compliance. 
 Adding these provisions should secure passage of at least two pending trade agreements, with Panama and Peru. It also revives the fading chances of renewing President Bush's ''fast track'' authority -- which limits Congress to an up-or-down vote on trade accords -- without which there will be no new free trade agreements.
 American trade negotiators should have been pushing for these labor standards all along. The Bush administration's explanation for not doing so was frankly embarrassing: American manufacturers were concerned that other countries could challenge American laws that prohibit union shops, permit some forms of teenage employment and allow states to sell the products of prison labor.
 Such foreign challenges, which will not be permitted under the compromise, were always unlikely. They should never have been allowed to block progress toward trade deals or overshadow concerns about the mistreatment of workers in countries where they have little legal redress. This deal, if the administration carries it out energetically, will harness America's economic power to the cause of expanding labor rights abroad.

HEADLINE: Officials Pledge $1 Billion Toward New Rail Tunnel

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLL

 BODY:
State transportation officials announced last week that they would commit $1 billion over the next 10 years toward the construction cost of a third rail tunnel connecting New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan. 
 A unanimous vote by the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority's project prioritization committee approved a plan by Gov. Jon S. Corzine that would redirect federal transportation funds to the Trans-Hudson Express Tunnel.
Mr. Corzine called the tunnel ''central to our ability to grow the economy, improve our mobility, reduce congestion, protect the environment and ensure the quality of life of our residents.'' 
 The state and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had already allocated $2.5 billion toward the $7.6 billion project, a New Jersey Transit spokeswoman said. It is expected to be completed by 2016 if construction begins by 2009. 
 If approved by federal officials, the $1 billion will come from federal funds typically reserved for highway projects and would be the ''largest flexing of such dollars for a public transit project,'' said the spokeswoman, Penny Bassett Hackett. 
 The tunnel would have two single-track rail lines and would add capacity to Pennsylvania Station under 34th Street, New Jersey Transit said. Signals and tracks along the Northeast Corridor line would be upgraded. 
 Transit officials are waiting for the completion of a final environmental impact statement before they can receive a full grant agreement from federal officials. That is expected in 2008. JOHN HOLL

HEADLINE: The Whole Empire

BYLINE: By Matthew T. Crosson. 
Matthew T. Crosson is the president of the Long Island Association.

DATELINE: MELVILLE 

 BODY:
THE state of New York's uncoordinated approach to economic development hasn't worked, and Gov. Eliot Spitzer needs to make some radical changes. 
 In recent years, New York has isolated educational, workforce training, housing, technology, transportation and regulatory reform programs and never established an integrated statewide economic development plan. The principal economic development agency, the Empire State Development Corporation, has administered incentive programs and made opportunistic deals to get companies here or keep them, but it has not coordinated all of the components of state government that affect economic development. It also has treated the economies of upstate and downstate New York as unrelated when, in fact, they are interdependent.
New York would be wise to follow the innovative approaches that Ireland has taken on this front that produced almost 10 percent annual growth during the 1990s. Underlying the success of Ireland's economic development efforts has been a clearly defined plan around which all relevant functions of the government, together with a willing private sector, have coalesced. 
 Described as a ''social partnership'' approach, the plan has put a strong emphasis on the links among education, business and technological innovation. It has introduced economic development into previously uninvolved segments of government and society. Ireland's approach has fostered economic growth and strengthened the country's competitiveness. And it has worked because it coordinates regional planning and promotes economic inclusion. 
 New York needs a plan that integrates the development of upstate, New York City and the suburbs. A recent study commissioned by my organization showed that downstate areas contribute billions more to the state than they get back. That money goes to help support upstate's flagging economy. Consequently, the better upstate does economically, the lower the burden on downstate taxpayers. That should be the downstate region's incentive to adopt a statewide economic development plan.
 An integrated statewide plan could bring significant benefits to upstate as well. For example, major business groups could organize an aggressive program to encourage downstate companies to seek upstate supply sources or locations for expansion. And large downstate technology-based companies could encourage their technology partners to invest in research and development upstate. The possibilities are significant, but they require a high level of coordination.
 Of course, economic development needs are not uniform across the state, and the plan has to accommodate the differences. Long Island, for example, needs affordable housing to begin growing again economically; western New York does not have that problem. For that reason, the statewide plan has to be developed in ''layers'' that take into account differing needs as well as consistent statewide requirements. 
 The governmental structure used to develop and coordinate an integrated statewide plan is crucial. That means coordinating state functions like K-12 education and workforce training, higher education and housing, which haven't had much to do with one another in the past. 
 In his State of the State address in January, Governor Spitzer spoke of the need for the Empire State Development Corporation to ''focus and leverage'' the state's ''balkanized'' economic development efforts that are now spread across 28 agencies. That statement was encouraging, but the governor needs to more clearly define what it means. And he needs to go further. 
 The task of creating and coordinating the state's economic development plan should be at the heart of his administration. Whoever is assigned the task should be located in the governor's office -- literally under the governor's nose -- briefing him every day, seeking the considerable weight of his support every day. That support will be essential to overcome the entrenched institutional and cultural obstacles that will resist the changes that coordinating New York's economic development will require. 
 Governor Spitzer has a mandate for change. He should use that mandate to change New York's economic future.

HEADLINE: Ocean Blues

BYLINE: By Paul Greenberg. 
Paul Greenberg, a W. K. Kellogg Foundation Food and Society Policy fellow, has written for the magazine about aquaculture. He is working on a book about seafood.

 BODY:
Not long ago, inside the residence of Hawaii's last queen, Laura Bush stepped to a lectern and carefully pronounced the word ''Papahanaumokuakea.'' A cheer went up, the Halau Pua Ali'i 'Ilima dancers chanted and Honolulu's important people took turns praising the first lady's pronunciation of the new name for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument, the largest protected marine area in the world and George W. Bush's only act of unabashed environmentalism. But amid the easy island music and Laura Bush's descriptions of the Laysan albatross (''who mate for life''), the significance of the monument felt buried. More than a native Hawaiian cultural heritage site, more than a nesting area for endangered albatrosses, Papahanaumokuakea represents something unique in U.S. conservation history: the first large-scale territorial victory of fish over fishermen. 
The eradication of our seafood bounty through overfishing is one of those Lorax-like stories that inspire sad books like ''The End of the Line'' and ''The Empty Ocean.'' Many biologists believe that the populations of large, commercially sought-after fish worldwide have been reduced by as much as 90 percent of their historical size. This disaster is particularly maddening given how avoidable it was: scientists are finding that one of the best ways to manage fish is simply to leave them alone. Even when a population has been trawled for years, in most cases if you exempt it from fishing for a while, it will recover. 
 Native Hawaiians knew this long before Laura Bush or any other outsider made landfall. In precolonial Hawaii, a district headman could declare portions of fishing grounds off limits by means of a rule called a kapu. By enforcing kapus, Hawaiians preserved spawning grounds of dozens of fish species. For Hawaiians this wasn't an animistic ritual -- it was a stewardship practice that preserved the sea's wealth for generations. 
 The white man, too, has used the kapu to conserve resources, but mostly on dry land. Theodore Roosevelt (that Republican whom the White House cited in announcing Papahanaumokuakea) became America's environmental president by protecting vast forests through executive orders. The warm glow surrounding T.R. has prompted later presidents to turn to the environment as a legacy maker. Richard Nixon's various malfeasances are somewhat offset by his creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. Bill Clinton threw up a Hail Mary late in his troubled second term by declaring 58 million acres of forest off limits to logging and road-building -- a kapu that George W. Bush later annulled. 
 Now as Bush seeks to elevate his historical stature as well as his 33 percent approval rating, he, too, has done a kapu. But the Papahanaumokuakea monument was pretty low-hanging fruit de mer. Not only had much of the modern-day legwork to create the preserve been done under Clinton, but the archipelago is so remote that only a few fishermen had to be bought out. 
 If Bush really wants a legacy, he might consider taking the ocean kapu concept national. Since the beginning of this decade, a federal advisory committee has been laying the groundwork for a system of marine protected areas (M.P.A.'s) throughout American waters. Currently the United States protects less than 1 percent of its underwater territory, compared with more than 10 percent of its land mass. Increasing its ocean preserves to at least 10 percent -- through a permanent network of M.P.A.'s -- could prove instrumental to rebuilding cod in the East, snapper in the South and rockfish in the West.
 The findings of the advisory committee are making their way sluggishly through the bureaucracy, but the process could easily die. This would be a tragic missed opportunity. By now, quite a few seafood eaters are aware that many popular commercial fish could disappear from their plates in the decades to come. A national network of no-fishing zones could help us avoid that future. Ample evidence suggests that in the long run -- from several years to several decades, depending on the species -- M.P.A.'s can halt the implosion of a vulnerable fishery and may even increase fish stocks outside the immediate M.P.A. area. Creating no-fishing zones in the ocean is about the only practical way managers have ever found to protect the big, old breeder fish that lay the most eggs and contribute the most to the endurance of a species.
 The political influence of people who catch fish, however, has Bush treading lightly. Many recreational fishermen are so strongly opposed to no-fish areas that some states have passed ''freedom to fish'' acts. Federal fisheries legislation enacted this year includes language endorsed by recreational fishing groups that spells out new requirements for any areas closed to fishing. Such provisions threaten to limit M.P.A.'s before they're even created. 
 But the president could argue that protecting fish is an economic issue. Most Americans don't realize that seafood represents a significant commodity deficit in our international trade portfolio. Whereas once we were a net exporter of fish, we have turned ourselves into a seafood beggar nation, importing as much as 60 percent of our seafood at an annual cost of about $8 billion. This country's multibillion-dollar commercial fishing industry would likely take a short-term hit from fishing-ground closures. In the long term, though, rebuilding fish stocks through M.P.A.'s would help sustain the American fishery economy and might help keep at home some of those billions spent on imports. 
 Presidential legacies come from actions that transcend the reactive political framework of the moment. Teddy Roosevelt protected millions of acres of American forest at a time when there was still plenty of timber. His 
 prescient vision of what America would need allowed him to rise above what America was ruining at the time. If Bush wants to assume the Rooseveltian mantle, he must stake a similarly ambitious claim. True, no Lorax would call W. a president who speaks for the trees. But if Bush were to act boldly on behalf of the sea, he might be remembered as a president who spoke for the fish.

HEADLINE: Formula, for Disaster

BYLINE: By Jennifer Zajfe. 
Jennifer Zajfe is a corporate communications consultant.

 BODY:
IN case you're one of the roughly 340 women who will give birth today in New York City -- on Mother's Day no less -- I have some news for you: hospitals are no longer mom-friendly. That's right, in an effort to encourage breast-feeding, what the American Academy of Pediatrics has deemed the healthier food source for newborns, 11 public hospitals in the city have decided to stop giving free formula samples to new mothers. 
 Similar actions have been taken by hospitals in California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Texas. Fueling this movement are studies that have shown that new mothers who are given free samples of formula are less likely to stick with breast-feeding after they leave the hospital. As a reference point, the academy recommends that women breast-feed their infants exclusively for the first six months, citing that a half year of breast-feeding reduces the risk and duration of infectious illnesses as well as the risk of chronic conditions like inflammatory bowel diseases and juvenile-onset diabetes. 
With all the evidence in favor of breast-feeding, I can understand why New York City hospitals are concerned. Surveys show that although 75 percent of New York City moms begin breast-feeding, more than half, 38 percent, quit before six months. Mayor Michael Bloomberg is also concerned about these statistics and has joined the breast-feeding crusade, recently beginning a multimillion-dollar parenting campaign that includes $2 million for initiatives in city-run hospitals to promote breast-feeding. Part of that campaign involves banning free formula samples to new mothers.
 I agree that breast-feeding is ideal, but I have to wonder if Mayor Bloomberg's former wife had any difficulty with it when she delivered her two children. I would guess not. If she had, he might rethink his support of the free formula ban in city hospitals.
 My own recent experience pits me squarely against the city's decision to stop giving formula samples to new moms. In my case, 20 hours of labor resulted in a complicated, emergency Caesarean section. I fully expected to breast-feed my baby, but, as I soon discovered, Caesarean deliveries often delay milk production. By Day 4 in the hospital, I was a wreck from the pain of the C-section and from trying to nurse with cracked, bleeding nipples that weren't producing milk. The nurses were encouraging and patient with my attempts to breast-feed, but I ultimately decided to bottle-feed my daughter. 
 The formula samples were a godsend. As a first-time mom who was intending to breast-feed, I had not thought to have formula waiting at home. The perfectly measured samples got us through the first sleepless days until we could get our acts together to buy formula.
 Mine is just one story. With Caesarean rates skyrocketing in New York City (some hospitals have a nearly 40 percent rate of Caesarean delivery), formula often becomes a necessary part of the equation. As in my case, women who experience a delay in milk production from these types of deliveries frequently end up relying on bottle-feeding to nourish their infants.
 I think of the other stories I've heard from friends who decided to bottle-feed their infants. Some are victims of abuse who remain too uncomfortable with their bodies to breast-feed. Some needed to return immediately to a job at which it was impossible to pump or store milk. Some needed to supplement breast milk with formula as they recovered from the delivery. For many of us, bottle-feeding is an important option. 
 Bottle-feeding versus breast-feeding is a personal choice, and the implication that distributing free formula samples promotes ''laziness'' in new moms is ridiculous. Whether bottle-feeding is voluntary or has been dictated by circumstance, neither the government nor the medical establishment should try to manipulate a woman's decision by withholding samples that formula manufacturers are more than happy to provide. 
 Denying women formula samples also seems cruel from a socio-economic standpoint. Formula is expensive, and samples are a tremendous help to many women -- single moms and those with low incomes, in particular. 
 Hospitals and government alike should support a mother's right to decide what is best for her and her child, be it breast-feeding or bottle-feeding. So go ahead, give out the free formula samples: it's a nice gift, especially on Mother's Day.

WHEN Mansueto Ventures bought the magazines Inc. and Fast Company from the German publisher Gruner & Jahr two years ago, it immediately began polishing the two titles. The paper quality was improved, staff changes were made and the editorial content was sharpened, according to Mansueto, the new owner. The company also wanted its new offices in New York to project the same retooled image, by emphasizing that the magazines were no longer part of a huge global stable of mainstream publications on subjects ranging from politics to parenting to decorating. 
 ''We wanted our new space to reflect our new ownership,'' said John Koten, the chief executive of Mansueto Ventures. ''We wanted something that could communicate that we are a more nimble company and no longer part of a big bureaucracy.'' Mansueto Ventures is owned by Joe Mansueto, who also founded Morningstar Inc., the investment research firm. Mr. Mansueto paid $32.5 million for the two magazines. 
On April 2, the publishing company and its staff of 190 moved into 40,000 square feet on the 29th floor of 7 World Trade Center. Mansueto had previously been in 39,000 square feet on a floor it had shared with the Meredith Corporation, a publisher of books and magazines like More and Family Circle, at 375 Lexington Avenue at 42nd Street. 
 Besides the developer, Silverstein Properties, and the offices of its team of architects from various firms that will be designing the buildings at Nos. 2, 3 and 4 World Trade Center, Mansueto is only the third tenant to move into 7 World Trade Center, which is part of the first phase of construction to be completed around the former site of the twin towers. 
 The company's general manager, Kristine Kern, looked at 50 spaces around Manhattan before settling on the downtown site. The new space, according to Mr. Koten, fits in perfectly with the message the company sends its 1.44 million subscribers, the majority of them high-earning male managers and entrepreneurs. 
 ''We are taking the advice we give to our readers, to be ahead of the trend, be pioneering and go where other people are afraid to go,'' he said. 
 James G. Phillips, principal in the New York-based firm TPG Architecture, and Luc Massaux, TPG's studio design director, designed the space, whose parallelogram shape is dictated by the unusual street pattern in the financial district. The center core construction of the tower, at the foot of Greenwich Street between Barclay and Vesey Streets, is column-free, making the raw floor a blank canvas for architect and tenant. Obtuse and acute angles set it apart from office towers with square or rectangular footprints, Mr. Phillips said. 
 ''It makes the floor plan more dynamic,'' he said. 
 Sweeping 360-degree vistas of New York dominate the space, whose exterior walls are all glass. ''The mandate was to do nothing to interfere'' with the view, Mr. Phillips said. ''Just bring it inside.'' Partitions were kept to a minimum to preserve the views and natural light. Seven conference rooms and 35 individual offices around the periphery have glass walls, with sliding glass doors framed with galvanized aluminum. Workstations for interns, which are away from the windows and around the inner core of the building, are equipped with stools to permit the most light and good views. 
 Mr. Koten wanted to use as few materials as possible and wanted to conserve resources when configuring the new headquarters. Seven World Trade Center is the first New York City office tower to receive a gold rating for environmental sustainability from the United States Green Building Council. 
 In the Mansueto offices, there is no dry wall, for example, and ceiling tiles are used only in the private offices and conference rooms. Ceilings are raw in the rest of the space and finished only with textured fireproofing materials, while most of the floor is bare concrete coated with an epoxy finish. 
 There are four communal copying and printing rooms on the floor, eliminating about 40 individual printers that staff members had previously used. That move cut down significantly on the use of ink and toner, according to Ms. Kern, the general manager. 
 Fewer partitions also create a sense of openness that was critical to the strategy behind the design. According to Mr. Phillips, the layout was meant to engender interaction among staff members. The space is divided into sections for three divisions: one for each of the two magazines and the third for corporate offices. Pale maple work cubicles designed by the Italian company Unifor at the center of each section were given less space in favor of communal areas. Those include conference rooms in a range of sizes -- from the principal one that seats 28 to one with a high, colorful Parsons-style table and four aluminum stools. 
 Further economizing on individual space, employees' personal gear will be relegated to the 200 high-school-style lockers soon to be installed inside space in the unfinished building core. 
 ''Tremendous emphasis was placed on the sharing of knowledge, rather than on personal territory,'' said Mr. Phillips, whose current projects include the New York headquarters for the music publisher EMI and the retail component of the Plaza Hotel. The company also designed the studio for NBC's ''Today'' show. 
 The offices will also feature a high-tech innovation in publishing. Computer monitors show images of page layouts that change as the editors revise them. There are 40 screens on each wall. A third display of eight monitors is to be used as needed for different Web sites, including those of Fast Company and Inc. 
 As in most modern office renovations, the entire floor has WiFi access so staff members with laptops can move to impromptu meetings in casual seating areas scattered around the offices or in the conference rooms. 
 The cafeteria is the most popular gathering spot, near the elevators. Also serving as a reception area, it is marked off by a large carpeted circle with modern tables and chairs and a serpentine bench. A cool white marble bar, a wall paneled in dark wood and a wall of banquettes upholstered in deep olive fabric create an unusual counterpoint to the corner conference room, which hangs like a sleek glass box over ground zero and the first few beams of the Freedom Tower. 
 The space is ultramodern but somewhat retro, Mr. Koten said. It is the feel of the newsrooms in which he started his career and which has been lost since publishing went desktop, the ''sense that something was being manufactured here, and that people were creating something,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Surprised? Maybe You Shouldn't Be

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
FOR weeks now, corporate earnings reports have outstripped analysts' expectations, contributing in no small part to the fizzy mood on Wall Street. But here's a sobering thought: those expectations were way too low in the first place. 
 In fact, as the first-quarter earnings season draws to a close, two things are clear. First, corporate profits have been much stronger than investors expected, based on the projections of the major Wall Street investment houses. It is now evident that analysts at those institutions grossly underestimated the strength of corporate earnings.
But why were analysts so far off the mark? Largely because of the so-called guidance provided by company after company, setting investors up for a pleasant surprise when earnings were announced.
 The numbers tell the story. By the end of this week the vast majority of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index will have reported their earnings. And so far, overall results have been terrific -- especially when compared with the consensus expectations on Wall Street.
 With 89 percent of S.& P. 500 reports in hand, Thomson Financial calculated that earnings in the first quarter were running 10 percent higher than in the same period a year earlier -- a number in line with the kind of double-digit increases investors have taken as their birthright during this long bull market. 
 Investors rejoiced, driving stock prices higher. After all, 10 percent is so much better than 3.7 percent -- Wall Street's consensus prediction for first-quarter earnings growth as recently as April 1, according to Thomson Financial. What's more, about two-thirds of companies have treated investors to ''positive earnings surprises'' for the first quarter. 
 How surprising were these results, though? Last October, the consensus for first-quarter earnings was for a 9 percent increase. Had this estimate stuck, it would have made most of these spectacular earnings announcements a fairly ho-hum affair.
 There are more announcements coming this week. Companies scheduled to report include Agilent Technologies, Home Depot, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Deere & Company, Autodesk, Intuit, Kohl's and Nordstrom. DATA WATCH -- The April consumer price index is to be announced on Tuesday. The core C.P.I., which excludes food and energy, is expected at a 2.4 percent annualized rate, compared with 2.5 percent in March , according to a Bloomberg News poll. 
 On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reports new housing starts for April, and the number is expected to show a deepening of the housing slump, with 1,480,000 annual starts, after 1,518,000 in March. And Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, will attend a conference on Sea Island in Georgia on Tuesday. He is speaking on a provocative topic -- the risk involved in credit derivatives.

HEADLINE: Divided Over Trade

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Nothing divides Democrats like international trade policy. That became clear last week, when the announcement of a deal on trade between Democratic leaders and the Bush administration caused many party activists to accuse the leadership of selling out. 
 The furor subsided a bit as details about the deal emerged: the Democrats got significant concessions from the Bushies, while effectively giving a go-ahead to only two minor free trade agreements (Peru and Panama). But the Democrats remain sharply divided between those who believe that globalization is driving down the wages of many U.S. workers, and those who believe that making and honoring international trade agreements is an essential part of governing responsibly.
What makes this divide so agonizing is that both sides are right. 
 Fears that low-wage competition is driving down U.S. wages have a real basis in both theory and fact. When we import labor-intensive manufactured goods from the third world instead of making them here, the result is reduced demand for less-educated American workers, which leads in turn to lower wages for these workers. And no, cheap consumer goods at Wal-Mart aren't adequate compensation. 
 So imports from the third world, although they make the United States as a whole richer, make tens of millions of Americans poorer. How much poorer? In the mid-1990s a number of economists, myself included, crunched the numbers and concluded that the depressing effects of imports on the wages of less-educated Americans were modest, not more than a few percent. 
 But that may have changed. We're buying a lot more from third-world countries today than we did a dozen years ago, and the largest increases have come in imports from Mexico, where wages are only about 11 percent of the U.S. level, and China, where wages are only 3 percent of the U.S. level. Trade still isn't the main source of rising economic inequality, but it's a bigger factor than it was.
 So there is a dark side to globalization. The question, however, is what to do about it.
 Should we go back to old-fashioned protectionism? That would have ugly consequences: if America started restricting imports from the third world, other wealthy countries would follow suit, closing off poor nations' access to world markets.
 Where would that leave Bangladesh, which is able to survive despite its desperate lack of resources only because it can export clothing and other labor-intensive products? Where would it leave India, where there is, at last, hope of an economic takeoff thanks to surging exports -- exports that would be crippled if barriers to trade that have been dismantled over the past half century went back up? 
 And where would it leave Mexico? Whatever you think of Nafta, undoing the agreement could all too easily have disastrous economic and political consequences south of the border.
 Because of these concerns, even trade skeptics tend to shy away from a return to outright protectionism, and to look for softer measures, which mainly come down to trying to push up foreign wages. The key element of the new trade deal is its inclusion of ''labor standards'': countries that sign free trade agreements with the United States will have to allow union organizing, while abolishing child and slave labor. 
 The Bush administration, by the way, opposed labor standards, not because it wanted to keep imports cheap, but because it was afraid that America would end up being forced to improve its own labor policies. So the inclusion of these standards in the deal represents a real victory for workers.
 Realistically, however, labor standards won't do all that much for American workers. No matter how free third-world workers are to organize, they're still going to be paid very little, and trade will continue to place pressure on U.S. wages.
 So what's the answer? I don't think there is one, as long as the discussion is restricted to trade policy: all-out protectionism isn't acceptable, and labor standards in trade agreements will help only a little. 
 By all means, let's have strong labor standards in our pending trade agreements, and let's approach proposals for new agreements with an appropriate degree of skepticism. But if Democrats really want to help American workers, they'll have to do it with a pro-labor policy that relies on better tools than trade policy. Universal health care, paid for by taxing the economy's winners, would be a good place to start.

HEADLINE: Less Risk Seen In Purchasing Clothes Online

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Maybe Americans don't need dressing rooms after all. 
 For the first time since online retailing was born a decade ago, the sales of clothing have overtaken those of computer hardware and software, suggesting that consumers have reached a new level of comfort buying merchandise on the Web.
In 2006, revenue from skirts, suits and shoes reached $18.3 billion, surpassing that from PCs, printers and word-processing programs, which totaled $17.2 billion, according to a report to be released today by a major trade group. 
 The surging popularity of clothing on the Web defies predictions that fashion -- which is hard enough to buy in stores, with the aid of sales clerks and fitting rooms -- would be difficult, if not impossible, to translate onto the Internet. 
 The majority of shoppers, it was feared, would never abandon the habit of trying on clothes to assess the feel of fabrics and the fit of a given size, which varies a lot by brand. 
 ''If you are looking for a sign that online retailing has really gone mainstream, I don't think you can find a better one than this,'' said Scott Silverman, executive director of Shop.org, the group that is releasing the report. 
 Online retail executives said liberal return policies and better navigation tools on their Web sites, like the ability to zoom in on and rotate the images of a $500 handbag, have bridged the once wide gap between online and offline clothes-shopping experiences. 
 At the same time, the rapid growth of high-speed Internet access in American homes -- now in about 50 percent of households -- has made it possible for online shoppers to quickly download product images and complete a purchase in seconds, rather than minutes using dial-up services.
 At Zappos.com, a popular online retailer of shoes, jewelry and clothing, free overnight shipping and free returns, with postage paid by the company, now make it possible for customers to treat the Web site somewhat like a bricks-and-mortar store, where they can try on and discard a dozen pairs of high heels. 
 ''We think of ourselves as Netflix,'' said Tony Hsieh, the company's chief executive. ''If you don't like it, you send it back.''
 Consumers are still largely reluctant to buy clothing online, at least compared with products like computers. In 2006, they made only 8 percent of all clothing purchases on the Web, compared with 41 percent of computers, 21 percent of books and 15 percent of baby supplies, according to the Shop.org report, which was prepared by Forrester Research. 
 But the clothing market is far larger than the others, which explains why apparel retailers are eager to refine their Web sites and win over new buyers. 
 There is a downside, though. Return rates for clothing bought online are about twice as high (14 percent) as other products bought on the Web, Shop.org said, giving retailers the cost of restocking and reselling merchandise. 
 Online apparel and footwear retailers are decking out their sites with a range of new features. At Timberland.com, shoppers can design their own boots right down to the color of the retailer's signature tree logo. They can consult a detailed chart that converts sizes for customers in Japan, Italy and Greece. And they can spin, rotate and zoom into images of it.
 ''You can virtually pick up the product, giving you the essence of touch,'' said Troy Brown, general manager of Timberland's Web site. Sales at the site, started in 2001, have grown an average of 35 percent over the last three years. 
 A factor behind the strong growth of online clothing sales in 2006 was the start-up of several sites from prominent retailers. Gap created Piperlime, which sells shoes; Amazon.com started Endless, a site for shoes and handbags; and eBags created 6pm.com, another handbag and shoe site. 
 Shoppers who traditionally ordered clothing from catalogs are switching to the Web, a trend spotted by J. C. Penney executives, who run both Web site and catalog operations.
 Customers now use the catalog ''as a tool for online shopping,'' said Richard Last, head of new business development for the department store's jcp.com site. It reached sales of $1 billion in 2005, two years ahead of schedule, Mr. Last said. 
 Over all, online sales grew 25 percent in 2006, to $220 billion, including travel. Still, online sales represented only 6 percent of all purchases made last year, excluding travel packages and airline tickets. 
 But Shop.org, in surveying the state of the online retail industry, said the growth suggested that e-commerce ''has come of age.''
 The report, which surveyed 174 retailers, said the young industry was in little danger of reaching a saturation point and abruptly slowing down.

BYLINE: By DAVID S. JOACHIM

 BODY:
Who says industry magazines are cozy with their advertisers?
 Last week, the International Data Group removed the chief executive of its largest-circulation computer magazine, PC World, and reinstated its top editor, who had quit days earlier over the executive's decision to not run an article critical of an advertiser.
The editor in chief, Harry McCracken, rejoined the magazine on Wednesday after the disputed article, ''10 Things We Hate About Apple,'' was posted on the magazine's Web site. 
 It was a hero's homecoming for Mr. McCracken, who was praised on the PCWorld.com message boards and in the blogosphere for sacrificing himself in the name of journalistic integrity.
 ''I was on the brink of canceling my subscription,'' wrote one reader. ''Now that McCracken's back, I'll stick around, too.''
 PC World, a monthly magazine with a companion Web site that mixes technology news with product reviews, has a reputation for smart and sometimes hard-hitting articles that often offend big tech companies. 
 In recent years, it has criticized several of its advertisers for what it described were bait-and-switch tactics and price gouging. Its survey of the reliability of manufacturers has given poor ratings to several of the magazine's advertisers. It even has a regular column chronicling the defects in Microsoft software.
 Mr. McCracken says that several advertisers have withdrawn ads over the years, after their products were negatively reviewed in the magazine, most recently last month. (He would not name the advertiser.)
 ''PC World is surprisingly reportorial, especially against some other technology magazines that don't invest a lot'' in articles that might provoke companies, said Sam Whitmore, an analyst in Beverly, Mass., who tracks technology publishers.
 That may explain why Mr. McCracken's resignation drew the attention of hundreds of bloggers. It became a cause celebre for many who viewed the spiking of the article as an affront to Silicon Valley's Fourth Estate. To others, it was a confirmation of what they had long suspected -- that the business side routinely meddles in editorial decisions at technology magazines, especially in recent years, as ad pages have declined considerably, leaving many magazines to rely on only a handful of advertisers.
 Mr. McCracken says he did not quit to make a statement. But now, a part of him is glad that the skirmish became public. ''With the conclusion we reached, this should tell everyone that computer journalism isn't sleazy,'' he said.
 Even so, on blogs and in interviews, some observers noted that the final version of the Apple article appeared next to another article titled, ''10 Things We Love About Apple,'' making them wonder whether a compromise had been made to appease Apple, and whether the ''We Hate'' article had been toned down before publication.
 Mr. McCracken, a 12-year veteran of PC World, said that the dustup with his boss occurred while the ''We Hate'' article was still a draft, and that editing was done before it was published. He said, however, that it was edited without consideration to how Apple might react. He also said that the ''We Love'' article had been planned all along.
 He acknowledged that the ''We Hate'' article made for an odd source of controversy, because it required little reporting and contained no news. ''We saw it as a fun little story that would get people talking,'' he said. Wired News called it a ''fluffy piece of Digg bait'' meant to compel user-driven news sites like Digg.com to link to it.
 The ousted chief executive of PC World, Colin Crawford, has been reassigned to his old job of overseeing business development for International Data's online properties. He did not respond to messages left at his office and on his cellphone.
 Mr. Crawford, who had been at PC World for only two months, spent 10 years as chief executive of the company's Macworld magazine, which is devoted to Apple's line of Macintosh products. International Data also runs the Macworld convention, where the chief executive of Apple, Steven P. Jobs, introduced the iPhone in January.
 Apple is ''not just any advertiser,'' Mr. Whitmore, the analyst, said, pointing out that Mr. Jobs had a reputation for trying to influence coverage of the company.
 Apple did not return calls seeking comment. The writers of the Apple articles, Narasu Rebbapragada and Alan Stafford, declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Rising Exports Putting Dent In Trade Gap

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS; Reporting was contributed by Keith Bradsher in Hong Kong, Tom Sims in Frankfurt, Heather Simmons in New Delhi and Eduardo Porter in New York.

 BODY:
Over half of the 9.1 million vehicles General Motors produced last year were sold in foreign countries. More KFC fast food restaurants are opening in China now than in the United States.
 With the slumping housing market taking a toll on its business at home, Caterpillar is counting on sales of equipment and diesel engines in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to keep growing.
American companies have been doing business abroad for a long time, but never before has it been so important. This year, for the first time, Standard & Poor's expects the 500 companies in its benchmark stock index to generate more than half of their sales in foreign countries.
 Even as companies in the United States are gaining ground overseas, they are also sending more American-made products abroad. A weaker dollar is adding to their good fortunes, helping to make American goods and services more competitive in foreign markets. 
 As a result, it now looks as if the huge trade deficit, which swelled to a record $765.3 billion last year, could gradually decrease. The trade gap widened in March, mostly because of higher prices for imported oil, but the vast disparity between what Americans import and export is expected to narrow, which would allow trade to contribute to economic growth in the United States for the first time in more than a decade. 
 The shift to a more export-driven economy, if it continues, could add more jobs at home and help the United States bounce back from its slowest economic expansion in four years. 
 When the trade deficit shrinks, ''home-grown demand is being fed by home-grown production instead of foreign production,'' said Chris Varvares, the president of Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic research firm in St. Louis. ''That requires more domestic employment, and that's better for the domestic economy.''
 Faster growth in Europe and Asia is helping to cushion the blow of a collapsing housing boom that has hampered domestic consumer spending, creating more demand from elsewhere for goods and services made in the United States. 
 Rather than hurting many American companies, a weak dollar is actually providing a strong lift. The exchange rate difference stokes profits from earnings generated abroad, countering the adverse effects on importers who must pay more and Americans traveling abroad with a less valuable currency in their wallets.
 ''The old notion that if the dollar's bad, corporate profits have to go down is no longer correct,'' said Howard Silverblatt, a senior analyst at Standard & Poor's. ''There's a lot of growth going on in the rest of the world, and companies have to be there if they want to participate. There's a lot to be sold.''
 At the same time, a number of American workers have lost their jobs as companies moved more business overseas. And there is always the risk that the dollar could suddenly plunge and set off a global economic crisis. 
 But for now, the currency's weakness is encouraging American manufacturers to keep more production at home and sell more goods abroad, and is aiding the turnaround in trade. That, in turn, could lead to a more balanced global economy less dependent on the United States as the main engine of growth, economists say. This year, growth in the United States is again expected to lag global growth. 
 Imports have been coming into the United States at a slower rate, and exports have accelerated. In the six months from October to March, the value of imports slowed in three months while the value of exports rose in all but one month, trade figures show. 
 Exports have been strongest for companies that make the tools needed to support the developing world: factory machinery, earth-moving equipment and the digital components used to build a modern telecommunications backbone.
 As the value of the dollar has eroded, these goods have become more expensive to buy from European countries. A British pound now costs around $2, and the euro has been inching toward $1.40. 
 The dollar has not depreciated as much against the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan, so American exports remain at a competitive disadvantage there. A stronger yuan, in fact, has been one of the primary trade goals of the Bush administration, which has pressed China to allow its currency to rise in value. 
 ''With the exchange rate being much more favorable for them to buy American products, it's easier to get your foot in the door,'' said Jason W. Speer, vice president at Quality Float Works in Schaumburg, Ill., a company that makes hollow metal spheres used to measure liquid levels and decorate the tops of flag poles. His foreign customers are ''much more open than in previous years,'' Mr. Speer said.
 Mr. Speer oversees the company's new exporting division, which did not start marketing to European countries until 2003. Then, exports outside North America accounted for only 3 percent of Quality Float Works's sales. Last year -- the company's highest-grossing yet -- they were 26 percent of its $2.2 million in sales. A weak dollar, Mr. Speer said, ''certainly hasn't hurt.''
 At Caterpillar, which is typical of the big companies in the S.& P. 500-stock index, slightly more than a half of its worldwide sales of more than $41 billion came from outside the United States. It met that demand almost equally with overseas production and with American exports, which increased to $10.54 billion last year from $9.16 billion in 2005.
 ''As the dollar has been revalued, it means what we produce in the United States is more competitive,'' said William C. Lane, Washington-based director for government affairs for Caterpillar, a maker of construction and mining equipment. Rapid economic growth in the rest of the world is helping. ''The folks that sold the shovels did well,'' he said. ''We're selling a lot of shovels.''
 This year, the company said it expected its export business to keep increasing overall sales. The company estimated that its engine and machinery sales in North America would fall 11 percent this year. But the rise in the rest of the world -- up 19 percent in Europe, Africa and the Middle East and 17 percent in Asia -- will more than make up for the loss.
 Caterpillar's shift reflects a larger trend. For Citigroup, which is planning to eliminate 17,000 jobs and relocate 9,500 more, India has been the biggest driver of growth for its international operations.
 Economists differ about how critical a weaker dollar is in stimulating trade and narrowing the trade deficit, but most agree that it has some effect.
 ''The weaker dollar is a smaller piece of the adjustment than underlying demand shifts,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard and a former economist with the International Monetary Fund. ''The driving factors are fast growth in Europe, slower growth in the United States.''
 While international demand is a significant factor in reducing the trade deficit, C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the dollar's role was hard to play down. He estimated that for every 1 percent decline in the average exchange rate of the dollar, the trade gap eventually narrowed by about $20 billion a year.
 But there is no disagreement that whatever the cause, the flow of orders from overseas to American producers is finally starting to decrease the trade deficit. As a result, net exports could add to growth in the United States this year rather than subtract from it. That has not happened since 1995.
 Trade contributed to growth in the second and fourth quarters last year. In the government's preliminary estimate for the first quarter of this year, trade was a slight drag on the economy. 
 Most economists, however, expect trade to improve for the rest of 2007. And when the level of trade is averaged out over the last four quarters, it faintly added to overall economic activity.
 ''The factors are in place for the trade deficit to fall,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist with the Bank of America. ''We're past the inflection point.''
 In addition to exporting more, many American companies are enlarging their operations overseas. Motorola, for example, has been very aggressive in building cellphone factories in China and now counts itself among the country's largest foreign companies. General Motors recently announced plans to more than double production in India and build a new assembly plant there. 
 This expansion, however, is not only taking place among manufacturers. Financial services companies like Ernst & Young are growing fastest in India and China. American investment banks like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch cannot seem to hire quickly enough to meet the needs of expanding Asian companies.
 If the dollar keeps falling, though, it could have adverse implications for foreign economies. Germany, Europe's largest economy and the world's biggest exporter, could suffer if the euro continues to appreciate against the dollar, a recent report by Commerzbank Economic Research concluded. While a strong euro has so far had little negative effect on German exporters, a euro at $1.50 would pose a ''serious obstacle,'' the report said. Demand for some of Germany's most popular goods -- everything from auto parts to chemicals -- would slow.
 But for now, Germany is doing very well, helping to lift demand not just in Europe but also in the United States and elsewhere.
 ''It's the global footprint that's key here,'' said Eugene M. Truett, vice president of investor relations for Harsco, an industrial services company outside Harrisburg, Pa., which provides personnel to steel mills and construction sites around the world.
 Seventy percent of Harsco's sales come from outside the United States, and Mr. Truett said that he expected the figure to increase. ''What is clear is that even if the U.S. economy slows down, the rest of the world appears to be able to grow,'' he said. ''If you are able to sell to those parts of the world successfully, then you're not tied down to one central bank, one economy.''

HEADLINE: In Native Alaskan Villages, a Culture of Sorrow

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BETHEL, Alaska, May 10 

 BODY:
The older brother hanged himself. The younger one used a gun. They died 38 days apart. 
 They had lived in this muddy town of 6,000 people, a hub at the center of scores of much smaller and more remote native villages in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of southwest Alaska. Their parents taught them to hunt for geese and seals and to fish for pike and herring and salmon. They taught them to speak their native Yupik and to cut wood for steam baths each night, even as one son played electric guitar and the family surfed the Internet.
''Sit,'' said Evon Waska, the father, directing two visitors to a freshly finished wooden bench in his living room. Mr. Waska had placed it like a pew before a makeshift memorial of cards and photographs of the dead. ''Sit with us.'' 
 ''When I was heartbroken,'' he said, ''I put my sorrow into making that bench.''
 In grieving for the older son, William George Kinzy, 34, who died on March 8, and his half-brother, Evon David Waska Jr., 20, who shot himself on April 15, Mr. Waska and his wife, Dora, are suffering a cruel concentration of the kind of loss that so many others in communities like theirs confront.
 ''Rural Alaska has some of the highest rates in the world for suicide,'' said Ron Perkins, who came to Alaska three decades ago to work for the federal government's health program for Native Alaskans and now is executive director of the Alaska Injury Prevention Center, a nonprofit organization. ''I remember talking once to an elder in a village outside Kotzebue. He said, 'I was 20 years old before I first heard of a suicide, and then it was a white man in Kotzebue.' Now, if a native kid is 10 and hasn't heard of a suicide, it's rare.''
 The suicide rate among Native Alaskans was three times that of nonnative Alaska residents and five times the national rate from 2003 to 2006, according to a study Mr. Perkins helped conduct. 
 Contrasts are also striking in the ages of those committing suicide. Nationwide, people 80 and over and those in their 40s are most likely to kill themselves. Among Alaska natives, the 20-to-29 age group had the most suicides, 39 percent of the total, while that age group ranked seventh nationwide. 
 Natives ages 10 to 19 make up just 20 percent of the state population in that age group, but accounted for 61 percent of its suicides. 
 The suicide rates for natives declined somewhat in 2005 and 2006, but Mr. Perkins said it was too soon to know whether that reflected a pattern. Roughly 80 percent of all Alaska suicide victims are male.
 Suicide among natives is commonly linked with depression and mental illness, which often goes untreated in rural areas, as well as with alcoholism and cultural and economic stress. Many native families are reluctant to discuss suicide, adding to the challenge, Mr. Perkins said.
 Native death rates over all are about 50 percent higher than for nonnatives, according to data compiled by the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage. Natives are increasingly moving to urban areas from rural villages and native families are increasingly led by a single parent. Women are more likely than men to move to cities to find work.
 ''They've lost their culture, they don't have a way to support their family, and then what we see is a lot of alcohol and drug use, particularly alcohol,'' said Diane Casto, the section manager for prevention and early intervention for the state's division of behavioral health. ''There's such a feeling of hopelessness, particularly for young men.''
 Christian missionaries, followed by government bureaucracy and modern technology, have long since transformed villages on the tundra into places where seal meat is hung out to dry in the shadow of steeples, public schools and satellite dishes. Many natives still hunt and fish for staples even as the outside culture promotes materialism. Experts say young people often have frayed connections to the old ways but poor preparation for living in a modern world.
 ''How do you move out, how do you move on?'' said Yvonne Kinegak, an intake supervisor for the Bethel branch of the state's Office of Children's Services. ''We see healthier people when they're more connected to their culture.'' 
 Bonnie Bradbury, who teaches Sunday school at United Pentecostal Church in Bethel, where her husband is the pastor, said that deaths among natives, many of whom in the delta are Russian Orthodox, are repeatedly memorialized through feasts at various anniversaries. Evon David Waska Jr. killed himself as his family was preparing for a feast on the 40th day after his half-brother died.
 ''They think, well, if they don't think much of me now, maybe they will when I'm dead,'' Ms. Bradbury said, echoing a common view. 
 Mr. Perkins, who conducted the suicide study, acknowledged that perception but said he knew of no way to confirm it. Misperceptions about native suicides are common, he said, including the belief that more people kill themselves during the dark Alaskan winters.
 ''We found that suicides occurred all during the year,'' he said, noting that December, one of the darkest months, had one of the lowest suicide rates.
 Alcohol or drugs were a factor in nearly three-fourths of the suicides among natives, the same as for nonnatives. And while about two-thirds of all suicides were from gunshot wounds, natives were twice as likely to hang themselves as were nonnatives, even though gun ownership is high among natives.
 Mr. Perkins said that efforts were being made to help people maintain their connection to native culture and language, but that some groups less likely to speak their native language, like the Aleuts, had relatively low suicide rates.
 ''They're past that cultural transition,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bank Files May Undercut Wolfowitz, Critics Say

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
Documents circulating at the World Bank suggest that Paul D. Wolfowitz, the bank president, understood that his role in ordering a pay increase and promotion for his companion in 2005 might be seen as a conflict of interest but insisted on proceeding anyway, bank officials who are critics of Mr. Wolfowitz said Sunday.
 The officials, speaking on the eve of a fateful week for Mr. Wolfowitz's efforts to remain head of the bank, said testimony and notes that Xavier Coll, vice president of human resources, provided to a bank committee investigating the matter supported the charge that Mr. Wolfowitz was aware of engaging in favoritism. One said the documents were ''devastating'' to Mr. Wolfowitz's case. 
Speaking on the condition of anonymity because the bank bars disclosure of evidence in the case, the officials said Mr. Coll's testimony and notes have become central to the charges Mr. Wolfowitz is fighting. 
 The officials did not provide the documents. It was unclear whether Mr. Wolfowitz's supporters would read the same information differently and insist that it buttressed his insistence that his actions were encouraged by others and subsequently cleared by them. 
 Robert S. Bennett, Mr. Wolfowitz's lawyer, in an interview Sunday evening disputed that any such evidence existed and suggested that there might be some misinterpretation of the evidence. Mr. Bennett has reviewed extensive amounts of the testimony in the case.
 ''Because of the instructions of the World Bank board, I am very uncomfortable talking about the evidence of the case,'' he said. ''But I will say that a careful review of all the documents shows, if anything, that there was no bad faith on Mr. Wolfowitz's part.''
 He added that the evidence from Mr. Coll and other officials shows that Mr. Wolfowitz ''agreed that he should not be involved'' in setting the arrangements for his companion, but that the ethics committee ''wanted him to get a concrete, practical result in a very sticky situation.''
 At the heart of the dispute between Mr. Wolfowitz and his accusers is what each side claims to have known about the other's actions and intentions. The decision to transfer Shaha Ali Riza, Mr. Wolfowitz's companion and a bank employee, was made after an initial discussion by both sides, although Ms. Riza hired legal representation to fight the transfer. 
 A former bank official, Ad Melkert, acknowledged that he told Mr. Wolfowitz to take care of a compensation package for Ms. Riza. But Mr. Melkert said that, contrary to what the bank president maintains, Mr. Wolfowitz went behind bank officials' backs to arrange the terms of the promotion and salary increase, which was large, as Ms. Riza was transferred to the State Department. 
 Mr. Melkert represented the Netherlands on the bank board and headed its ethics committee. He is now at the United Nations Development Program. 
 Mr. Coll, a Spanish physician and public health professional who has worked for several years at the World Bank, has declined to comment about the charges against Mr. Wolfowitz since they broke into the open last month.
 A third accuser, Roberto Danino, former general counsel at the bank and former prime minister of Peru, has also testified that Mr. Wolfowitz went behind his back on the Riza matter. Bank officials say that with Mr. Wolfowitz's word pitted against these three officials, it would be hard for the bank board not to side with the accusers.
 One of the bank officials who spoke Sunday said that one document appeared to suggest that Mr. Coll had told Mr. Melkert and Mr. Danino that he was told by Mr. Wolfowitz not to tell them about the details of the compensation package for Ms. Riza.
 Many bank officials have said that Mr. Wolfowitz was under pressure from Ms. Riza and her lawyers to resolve the matter quickly.
 ''Coll was in a very uncomfortable situation,'' said a bank official who spoke Sunday. ''For me, it is clear that Wolfowitz knew what he was doing, and that what he was doing was a violation of staff rules.''
 A special committee investigating the allegations of misconduct will transmit its findings to the larger 24-member board of the bank on Monday. Also to be transmitted is a recommendation on how or whether Mr. Wolfowitz should be censured.
 The bank board will listen to Mr. Wolfowitz's testimony on Tuesday and decide what to do on Wednesday.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 18, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about efforts by Paul D. Wolfowitz to retain his job as president of the World Bank referred incorrectly in some copies to a critic of Mr. Wolfowitz's who has accused him of favoritism. The critic, Robert Danino, is a former general counsel at the bank, not the current general counsel.

HEADLINE: Consumers Take a Break

 BODY:
Consumer spending has been the powerful and dependable engine of the current economic expansion. Americans have continued to shop through boom-time borrowing, high oil prices, on-and-off job growth, uncontrolled medical costs, rampant trade deficits, hurricanes and war. 
 Until last month, that is.
Major American retailers reported April sales declines that were among the worst on record. The pain was widespread, including discounters, department stores and specialty shops. Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, had the steepest decline since it began reporting monthly figures 28 years ago. Government retail figures for April confirmed the slump, showing the first decline in seven months.
 Clearly, consumers are squeezed as gas prices rise and wage growth slows, and as declining home prices make it harder to borrow against the house. It seems that conditions will worsen before they improve. When the initial reading on first-quarter economic growth clocked in last month at a weak 1.3 percent, there was a lot of talk about possible upward revisions in the months to come. Since then, news of a worse-than-expected trade imbalance has made a downward revision more likely. That would put economic activity well below the pace that's needed for jobs and incomes to grow. 
 If consumers retrenched in earnest, a recession would be all but inevitable. The severity would be anybody's guess, but two consequences would seem unavoidable. First, a consumer-led recession here could harm other economies as well, because spending by Americans accounts for a stunning 20 percent of the global economy. So far, as the American economy has slowed, the rest of the world has surged. But until last month, the slowdown in the United States was due mainly to the downturn in housing, not in consumer spending. 
 The other implication is political. A recession would be most painful for people who have benefited the least from the current expansion. That fact would force politicians to articulate an economic agenda that breaks with Bush-era policies -- on health care, income inequality and social spending.

HEADLINE: A Fresh Start on Energy

 BODY:
Congress's last effort to craft a decent energy strategy, in 2005, was largely disappointing. But at the risk of getting our hopes up once again, we call attention to two promising bills making their way to the Senate floor. Stapled together, they could make a constructive start toward reducing this country's dependence on oil imports and its emissions of greenhouse gases. 
 The first, championed by Senators Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici of New Mexico, has three main objectives. It seeks to reduce oil consumption by quintupling the production of biofuels -- principally ethanol from sources other than corn -- by 2022. It would mandate stronger efficiency standards for energy-intensive household appliances, including lighting fixtures and refrigerators.
And, perhaps most important, it would try to bring to commercial scale the government's nascent efforts to build coal-fired power plants capable of capturing and storing emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. Coal will remain the world's most plentiful fuel, and unless some way is found to neutralize its emissions, the battle to stabilize emissions is almost certainly lost.
 The other important bill, known as the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, was approved last week and is mainly the handiwork of Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. It would raise the fuel economy standard for passenger cars from 25 to 35 miles per gallon over the next 10 years, and -- for the first time -- would require steady improvements in fuel efficiency for medium and heavy-duty trucks. The debate over fuel economy has been deadlocked for three decades, and approval of this bill would represent a major breakthrough. 
 The bills need work. There are big loopholes in the fuel economy bill that need closing, and safeguards must be built into the Bingaman-Domenici bill to make sure that forests are not plowed under in a mad rush to cultivate feedstocks for ethanol. This will require deft management by Harry Reid, the majority leader, whose task will be to open the bills to constructive amendment without triggering the feeding frenzy that energy bills usually inspire.
 Congress must understand that these bills are not a substitute for a global warming strategy that puts a price on carbon emissions through a tax or a cap-and-trade mechanism, or a combination of both. That essential task lies ahead. What these bills offer is a chance to move the country toward developing the fuels and technologies that will be necessary for a sustainable energy future.

HEADLINE: At The Wall Street Journal, Slim Margins Open Door to Murdoch

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Does The Wall Street Journal make money? The question might seem silly. The chronicler of capitalism, the bible of business: of course The Journal turns a profit, right?
 Dow Jones & Company, which owns the newspaper, does not break out separate figures for The Journal. But the probable answer, according to analysts and current and former company officials, is yes, The Journal operates in the black, but barely, and maybe not for long.
''I would say The Journal is probably marginally profitable,'' said John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst based in Silver Spring, Md. ''No question they've made some things better in the last couple of years, but there are trouble signs.''
 Dow Jones is profitable overall, although like many media companies it has been squeezed as readers and advertisers migrate to the Web. But The Journal itself, despite weekday circulation of more than two million, second only to USA Today in the United States, has lagged far behind most major papers in profit margin. 
 That performance has helped depress the stock price, making Dow Jones an attractive takeover target for Rupert Murdoch and his News Corporation, whose bid for the company sent the stock price soaring. (Executives at Dow Jones declined to comment for this article.)
 And already, 2007 is looking worse than 2006. Early this year, Dow Jones projected that for the year, The Journal would see an increase in ad revenue in the midsingle digits. Instead, through the first four months of the year, it is down more than 4 percent from the year-earlier period, despite the resources being poured into the Saturday issue and the decision to open up the paper's front page to advertising last fall.
 Last week, Lehman Brothers projected a slight decline for the year in ad revenue at Dow Jones's consumer media group, which includes The Journal, Barron's and MarketWatch, with declines at the print Journal wiping out the online gains, and then some.
 Mr. Murdoch argues that the News Corporation can capitalize on The Journal's strength as a brand, leveraging it for a new Fox business cable channel and pouring more money into its European and Asian editions. The Bancroft family, which owns a controlling share of Dow Jones, opposes Mr. Murdoch's bid of $60 a share, although the opposition is based more on philosophical reasons than financial ones. 
 In part, The Journal's recent struggles can be attributed to its longstanding commitment to high-quality journalism that translates into high costs, and to the particular pressures felt by a business-oriented newspaper. 
 But they are also the result of some management decisions to expand during the late 1990s boom, high turnover in the paper's ad sales department and recent attempts to broaden the paper's advertising base with the Saturday issue. 
 The Journal and its Web site account for most of the consumer media group, which makes up about 55 percent of Dow Jones's revenues. As a whole, the group posted a slight operating loss in 2005 and a positive margin of 3 percent last year, despite unusually strong ad sales -- and analysts say the margins for the Journal were probably worse.
 Yet even in unsettled times, with newspapers unsure of their futures, many still rack up healthy profits. The corporate divisions that include newspapers posted 2006 operating margins of 23.7 percent at the Gannett Company, the nation's largest chain and publisher of USA Today; 18.3 percent at the Tribune Company, which publishes The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times, where editors and publishers have been under pressure to cut costs; and 9.6 percent at The New York Times Company.
 In a way, the Journal's troubles are nothing new; Wall Street analysts, big investors and, at times, members of the Bancroft family have complained for more than a generation that it was a brilliant product poorly managed, but boom times made it profitable, anyway. In 1998, the paper added Weekend Journal, a Friday section with softer news and features, and the two years after that, operations were flush as the stock market rose and the technology industry went wild. 
 But this decade has amplified the industry's troubles, with ad dollars contracting, newsprint and other costs rising, and the decades-long decline in circulation accelerating. And while Sept. 11 marked a turning point at all papers, it hit particularly hard at The Journal, whose headquarters is near the World Trade Center site.
 Like many other papers, the Journal has cut costs by shrinking the physical size of the paper, losing about 10 percent of the space devoted to news in early 2007. But it has not been willing to engage in the kind of wholesale staff cuts seen across the industry.
 Dow Jones Newswires and The Journal often produce separate coverage of the same events, and Dow Jones executives have argued for reducing that duplication, allowing some reduction in the news staff. The Journal's editors and reporters have strongly resisted such consolidation, often successfully arguing that heavier use of the wires' work would dilute the distinctiveness and quality of The Journal. But many people in The Journal newsroom also say that some consolidation is inevitable. 
 The Journal has additional challenges, including its heavy dependence on business-to-business advertising, which dropped sharply in the 2001 recession, and never rebounded the way consumer advertising has. In the first four months of this year, technology advertising -- a business mainstay -- dropped 23 percent, while total advertising volume was down 5.5 percent. 
 The paper, traditionally published only on weekdays, introduced a Saturday issue in September 2005, hoping to tap deeper into consumer ads and make itself competitive on coverage of news that breaks on Fridays. The company says the Saturday issue is meeting expectations -- 60 percent of its advertisers last year were new to The Journal, and 70 percent of the revenue was from consumer ads.
 But it is an expensive project because it means filling and printing more papers and requires new delivery arrangements to reach the homes of readers who get The Journal weekdays at work. The Weekend Edition of the Journal may turn out to be a smart long-term strategy -- analysts are divided on that question -- but for now, it loses money, and will continue to do so for some time. Dow Jones has said that the weekend Journal lowered earnings by about 15 cents a share last year, which translates to a loss of about $12 million.
 The Journal's attempts to sell ads have not been helped by the fact that the top advertising position will soon have changed hands five times in eight years, sometimes going to people with little or no newspaper experience.
 Ad revenue at the Journal began to improve in late 2005, and in 2006, it rose 8.8 percent, the first full-year increase since 2000. Some of that was because of the Saturday issue, but even the weekday numbers rose.
 But in February, the executive in charge of ad sales, Judy Barry, who was well-regarded in the company, resigned. People at Dow Jones who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about internal matters said that she clashed with Richard F. Zannino, who had become Dow Jones's chief executive in February, 2006. Ad revenue has dropped sharply since she left.
 Last Thursday, the company put Michael F. Rooney, a career magazine executive, in charge of ad sales, with the new title of chief revenue officer. By the time he takes over next week, the position will have been vacant for three months.
 Increasingly, Dow Jones is positioning itself as a digital information supplier whose parts -- including newswires and the Factiva archive service -- nourish one another and should not be judged singly. 
 But the domestic edition of the Journal remains by far the largest piece of that puzzle. The Journal is also the only large paper in the country to charge for access to its Web site. With more than 900,000 subscribers, WSJ.com has become an important source of income, but the demand for payment limits the audience it can offer to online advertisers, and the ad rates it can charge. 
 A former Dow Jones executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of damaging career prospects, said: ''I don't think there's much hope of averting a revenue decline this year at The Journal, maybe even the company as a whole, and I wouldn't be surprised if The Journal was operating in the red by year's end.''

HEADLINE: Briton Bullish on Buying Small Newspapers in Europe

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: LONDON, May 13 

 BODY:
As Rupert Murdoch trains his sights on Dow Jones & Company, owner of The Wall Street Journal, another veteran of the British newspaper wars is betting on the future of lower-profile print publications.
 Last week, while Mr. Murdoch wooed reluctant Dow Jones shareholders and as the financial information providers Thomson and Reuters were explaining their case for a possible merger, David Montgomery was quietly seeking to buy control of the Dutch publisher Koninklijke Wegener.
Koninklijke Wegener's newspapers, including De Twentsche Courant Tubantia, may not have the global name recognition of The Wall Street Journal, but they attracted a bid of up to 806 million euros, or nearly $1.1 billion, from Mr. Montgomery, through Mecom, the London company that he heads. 
 In a series of deals since 2005, Mecom has acquired more than 100 local and regional newspapers in the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Denmark, Norway and Ukraine at a cost of more than 2 billion euros.
 Mr. Montgomery, a onetime copy editor who was chief executive of the Mirror Group of newspapers in the 1990s, is going after smaller targets than Mr. Murdoch or Samuel Zell, the Chicago investor who recently bought the Tribune Company, owner of The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times.
 But his acquisition spree reflects similar trends, analysts say. After several years of handwringing about readers and advertisers defecting to the Internet, some investors see value in old-fashioned print publishers -- at least, if their share prices have fallen enough to create bargains.
 ''There's a lot of money sloshing around, and things are not as bad as people suggest,'' said Gavin O'Reilly, president of the World Association of Newspapers, during a presentation last week to journalists and financial analysts in London.
 Mr. Montgomery, who started Mecom in 2000, is bullish on the industry despite -- or perhaps because of -- the often-cited threat of the digital media revolution.
 ''We are in the most exciting stage of development not only in the history of our business but also the entire history of print,'' he said last week in a phone interview. ''Newspapers have totally underestimated the main resource they have, of content gathering and content projection.''
 So far, newspapers in Europe may have lost fewer readers to the Internet than their counterparts in the United States, analysts say.
 Last year, circulation of paid-for newspapers rose 0.7 percent in Europe, in contrast to a 2 percent drop in North America, according to the World Association of Newspapers, which is based in Paris.
 But like North American newspapers, European papers have been hurt by a more sluggish advertising market.
 Over the last five years, newspaper ad revenue has risen only 11 percent in Europe, compared with 16 percent in North America and 21 percent in Asia, according to the newspaper association.
 Harsh business conditions have created an opportunity for investors like Mr. Montgomery, a native of Northern Ireland. In 2005, Mecom and a partner, the New York investment firm Veronis Suhler Stevenson, bought control of the owner of Berliner Zeitung, becoming the first foreign owners of a major German newspaper.
 Mr. Montgomery's reputation as a cost-cutter in Britain preceded him, and his investment in Berlin prompted protests from the paper's journalists.
 The editor who led the revolt, Uwe Vorkotter, has since been replaced, and Mecom has moved to take full control of Berliner Verlag, the paper's parent company.
 Mr. Montgomery has said he wants to raise profit margins across the company, in part by cutting costs. But that may be more difficult on the Continent than in Britain, where labor protections are weaker, analysts say.
 ''Montgomery still has to prove he can do that in Europe like he did in the U.K.,'' said Oskar Tijs, an analyst at Kempen Research in the Netherlands.
 By keeping costs low, some publishers in Britain have turned regional papers into a lucrative business. One of these companies, Johnston Press, has enjoyed profit margins of more than 30 percent in recent years.
 On the Continent, margins are typically tighter, in part because costs are higher. Employees at Koninklijke Wegener, for instance, receive 70,000 euros (about $95,000) in annual pay and other benefits, considerably more than their British counterparts, Mr. Tijs said.
 Still, Mr. Montgomery is not the only European publisher who is sanguine about the prospects of Continental newspapers.
 Axel Springer, the German publisher of the tabloid Bild, recently started a paper in Poland, and it plans to introduce a tabloid this year in France, one of the most depressed European newspaper markets in recent years. And Metro International and other publishers of free newspapers have expanded rapidly across the Continent; two-thirds of the 40 million free dailies circulated globally are distributed in Europe, according to the newspaper association.
 Mecom is not wedded to any one type of publication. It owns or holds majority stakes in paid-for broadsheets like Berlingske Tidende in Denmark and Rzeczpospolita in Poland, as well as tabloids and free papers.
 One of the advantages of owning large clusters of newspapers, Mr. Montgomery said, is the economies of scale. Mecom has been able to eliminate overlapping administrative jobs, he said, and to buy newsprint and other supplies in bulk.
 ''Scale is not just a defensive mechanism through cost reductions,'' he added, ''but also part of an offensive strategy, in terms of generating new lines of revenue.''
 Consolidation has helped small publications with limited resources develop an online presence, he said. And Mecom is also prodding its papers to develop new business lines that tap existing subscribers, selling them wine or financial services, for instance.
 Despite moves to make the papers more businesslike, Mr. Montgomery insisted that editors, not business managers, maintained control over content. But he said journalists ''have to understand the commercial realities of a changing newspaper environment.''
 Mr. Montgomery said he would continue to look for opportunities to expand, primarily in Northern European markets with fragmented newspaper ownership.
 Mr. Tijs said: ''I think he understands the value of these regional newspaper franchises. A few people on the stock market forgot that.''

HEADLINE: Bank's Report Says Wolfowitz Violated Ethics

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
A World Bank committee charged Monday that Paul D. Wolfowitz violated ethical and governance rules as bank president by showing favoritism to his companion in 2005. In response, the Bush administration mounted a last-ditch global campaign to save Mr. Wolfowitz from being ousted from office. 
 On a day of rapid developments that intensified the furor over Mr. Wolfowitz at the bank, in the Bush administration and at government ministries around the world, the special committee that has investigated his conduct in the last month issued a scathing set of conclusions that seemed certain to hasten a decision on Mr. Wolfowitz's fate.
The report charged that Mr. Wolfowitz broke bank rules and the ethical obligations in his contract, and that he tried to hide the salary and promotion package awarded to Shaha Ali Riza, his companion and a bank employee, from top legal and ethics officials in the months after he became bank president in 2005.
 Citing what it said was the ''central theme'' of the matter, the report said Mr. Wolfowitz's assertions that what he did was in response to the requests of others showed that ''from the outset'' of his tenure he ''cast himself in opposition to the established rules of the institution.'' 
 ''He did not accept the bank's policy on conflict of interest, so he sought to negotiate for himself a resolution different from that which would be applied to the staff he was selected to head,'' the committee said, adding that this was ''a manifestation of an attitude in which Mr. Wolfowitz saw himself as the outsider to whom the established rules and standards did not apply.''
 ''It evidences questionable judgment and a preoccupation with self-interest over institutional best interest,'' it said.
 The committee, consisting of seven of the 24 members of the World Bank's board, in the end seemed to challenge the larger governing body to declare him unfit by saying that it must now determine ''whether Mr. Wolfowitz will be able to provide the leadership needed to ensure that the bank continues to operate to the fullest extent possible in achieving its mandate.''
 With that challenge, bank officials familiar with the mood of the board said it would have little choice but to punish him. 
 In the face of that storm, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. was on the telephone during the day with counterparts in at least half a dozen countries to tell them that ''these facts do not rise to the level of warranting dismissal,'' according to a senior Treasury official.
 Until Monday, Mr. Paulson's conversations with finance and development officials, many of whom have told him they favor Mr. Wolfowitz's ouster, have been confined to urging that there be no ''rush to judgment.'' 
 Vice President Dick Cheney said in an interview with Fox News in Jordan before the committee's findings were released that Mr. Wolfowitz was ''one of the most able public servants I've ever known'' and that ''he's a very good president of the World Bank, and I hope he will be able to continue.''
 White House and Republican officials said that from the beginning, President Bush has seen the controversy over Mr. Wolfowitz as a proxy fight waged by liberals at the bank opposed to Mr. Bush's policies, and that he would not toss him or Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales overboard just because opponents want them out.
 Beyond pride and politics, administration officials said that having someone at the bank who is viewed as committed to combating corruption and waste in aid programs, and who commands the confidence of Republicans and conservatives, helps guarantee Congressional funding for the bank's projects.
 But European governments have increasingly signaled that they will not finance the bank if Mr. Wolfowitz stays. In particular jeopardy is a commitment made in 2005 by Mr. Bush and other Western leaders to cancel the debts of poor countries, a pledge that will cost $30 billion in new financing over the next three years.
 These clashes of perspective have ruptured the bank's governance system so deeply that finance officials in many countries worry that it may be irreparable whatever happens to Mr. Wolfowitz. If he refuses to resign, many said he might find it hard to travel or issue directives. If he leaves, a fight over choosing his successor is sure to erupt.
 Almost lost in this interplay are the conflicting versions of what actually happened in 2005 that led to the crisis. As each new disclosure has occurred in recent weeks, more light was shed on the events of mid-2005 after Mr. Wolfowitz came to the bank. The committee's 52-page report was released Monday evening on the bank's Web site and other documents were obtained from both critics and supporters of Mr. Wolfowitz.
 According to his own submission to the committee investigating him, made available by his supporters, Mr. Wolfowitz vehemently disputed the conclusions of the committee.
 His defense rested on arguments he made earlier that he had been directed by ethics officials to arrange for Ms. Riza's compensation only after he had tried to avoid involvement, and that officials subsequently approved of what he had done.
 The new evidence that surfaced Monday revolved around Mr. Wolfowitz's charge that one of his accusers, Xavier Coll, the bank personnel director, was wrong in recalling that Mr. Wolfowitz tried to cover up the salary and promotion package for Ms. Riza. 
 Mr. Coll, according to the report issued Monday, said that he had told Mr. Wolfowitz that the pay package for her was ''outside the staff rules'' and that the bank president had told him not to inform two top ethics officers, Roberto Danino, then the bank's general counsel, and Ad Melkert, head of the board's ethics committee.
 But Mr. Wolfowitz noted that in one memo he dictated for himself, Mr. Coll acknowledged that ''there is no precedent to his kind of situation and no policy that would clearly apply to resolve it.'' In another Coll memo, Mr. Wolfowitz noted, the personnel director said he thought the president was embarking on ''a reasonable way to move forward.''
 Ms. Riza had been at the bank for seven years when Mr. Wolfowitz arrived. She was angry and distraught over being told to leave because she could not be supervised by Mr. Wolfowitz, and was also inclined to sue, according to various documents made public earlier and elaborated on Monday. Mr. Wolfowitz said paying her was the only way to ease her anguish.
 He charged further that ethics officials in effect washed their hands of the matter, deliberately looking the other way until after he had made his decision over how to handle her compensation.
 ''It would only be human nature for them to want to steer clear of her,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said in a rebuttal submitted earlier to the bank panel and obtained Monday from Wolfowitz supporters.
 The bank committee ended up siding with Mr. Coll, however, and with Mr. Danino and Mr. Melkert in saying that Mr. Wolfowitz was never authorized to arrange for the package for Ms. Riza himself.
 The bank also sided with Mr. Coll in his contention that Mr. Wolfowitz seemed to be trying to keep the matter of Ms. Riza's salary from Mr. Danino and Mr. Melkert, the chief ethics guardians at the bank. But Mr. Wolfowitz maintained that he had asked Mr. Coll to keep the terms secret only for the brief time they were being negotiated.
 He said he fully expected that once the salary and promotion package was in place, the proper authorities at the bank would find out about its composition. Indeed, he assumed they had done so when they decided not to act against him in late 2005 and again in early 2006.
 Though it tended to side with Mr. Wolfowitz's critics, the committee's report acknowledged that the instructions conveyed to him were ''not a model of clarity'' and subject to ''the possibility of misinterpretation.''
 Nevertheless, the report concluded, ''Mr. Wolfowitz has taken the position that there were no rules that applied to the situation and therefore no rules could have been broken in resolving the matters as he did.'' 
 In a gesture to critics of the bank who say that the entire episode showed a flawed governance system, the committee recommended a full review of governance procedures in the future.

HEADLINE: Trusting in Levees, St. Louis Area Builds on Flood Plains

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY; Malcolm Gay contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, May 14 

 BODY:
Miles and miles of bigger and stronger levees have been built along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers since the deadly floods of 1993, and millions of dollars have been spent on drainage improvements.
 Yet as the rush of water that caused the Missouri River to overflow its banks and submerge dozens of towns last week rolled toward St. Louis on Monday, attention was turned to a metropolitan region that since 1993 has seen runaway residential and commercial development in the rivers' flood paths.
About 28,000 homes have been built and more than 6,000 acres of commercial and industrial space developed on land that was underwater in 1993, according to research by Nicholas Pinter, a geologist who studies the region at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. 
 Building is happening on flood plains across Missouri, but most of the development is in the St. Louis area, and it is estimated to be worth more than $2.2 billion. Though scientists warn about the danger of such building, the Missouri government has subsidized some of it through tax financing for builders. 
 ''No one has really looked at the cumulative effect,'' said Timothy M. Kusky, a professor of natural sciences at St. Louis University, who calculates that there has been more development on the Missouri River flood plain in the years since 1993 than at any other time in the history of the region.
 The good news for St. Louis right now is that forecasters say the two rivers will crest well below their 1993 levels by Tuesday, sparing the area significant flooding. But many scientists remain concerned that the effect of the new construction, should a levee break, could eventually be even more severe flooding.
 Levees constrict a river's path and raise its water level, which causes higher, faster flow. A flood plain, conversely, exists in nature to absorb a river's overflow.
 ''The more levees we build, the higher we have to build them,'' Professor Kusky said. ''It's a self-perpetuating problem.''
 Still, people have been drawn to the area, assured by the sense of security the levees provide. Disincentives beyond the possibility of flooding seem to be few.
 ''This was absolutely a dodged bullet,'' Professor Pinter said. ''This could have been a very bad situation for St. Louis, but luckily it was a near-miss.''
 People living in the flood plains are eligible for the National Flood Insurance Program or for any private insurance they can secure, though the private alternatives are increasingly difficult to obtain. And they are entitled to whatever federal disaster relief is offered to the state after a flood, be it temporary housing or buyouts, said Butch Kinerney, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
 THF Realty Inc. used Missouri's tax program, known as tax increment financing, to build what is said to be the largest strip mall in the country on land in the Chesterfield Valley area of St. Louis County that was submerged in the floods of 1993. The shopping center, which cost $275 million to build, opened in 1999 and now has more than two million square feet of retail space, mall officials said. 
 The developers spent more than $35 million on levee and storm drainage improvements, replacing an old levee that had offered protection against a 100-year flood with a levee that met the standards for a 500-year flood. And, they said, they have brought jobs and revenue to a formerly sleepy part of the county. 
 ''We built the shopping center and interchange that opened the entire valley,'' said Marian Nunn, the chief operating officer of THF Realty. ''The difference is that the levee is maintained now, on top of being bigger, stronger and better. The risks are really substantially mitigated.''
 The company was able to use the special financing because Missouri allows it for projects in areas that are considered blighted, or where development is not likely to occur without help. 
 ''We will continue to build even more,'' Ms. Nunn said.
 Faith in the levees seems to trump other concerns here.
 ''We're not even close to having any issues,'' said Brian McGownd, the deputy director of public works in Chesterfield. Of the new levee, Mr. McGownd said, ''We have 100 percent confidence that it's done right, and the way it's supposed to be, and that it will be a good, strong levee for many years.''
 Fear of flooding did not appear to scare off prospective buyers at the New Town at St. Charles, a housing development whose sales office hummed with activity on Sunday, even as the Missouri River was rising. Although the community is near the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, residents are not required to have flood insurance, because they are beyond the 100-year flood plain. 
 The location was a selling point for Ken Snider, a high school teacher from St. Louis.
 ''It's not going to flood here for another 100 years,'' Mr. Snider said, ''and I won't be around by then.'' 
 But critics of the developments say someone else is likely to be around then, and taxpayers in general will carry the tab after the next disaster bailout. 
 ''If history tells us anything, it's that levees once built eventually fail,'' Professor Pinter said. ''But instead of being farmland there, now it's a strip mall or residential area, or a whole city.''
 The floods of 1993 killed 38 people and caused $16 billion in damage across the Midwest. More than 500 counties were declared federal disaster areas. 
 Adolphus A. Busch IV, a member of the Anheuser-Busch brewing family who helped found the Great Rivers Habitat Alliance in St. Louis in 2000, is alarmed at the pace of development in the rivers' paths after the 1993 flood. 
 ''That was the milestone for us,'' Mr. Busch said. ''At that point the federal government came in and did major buyouts, and people said, 'Look, we've learned our lesson: no more development.' Well, that lasted for about six or seven years.''
 He continued, ''We always realized that there would be fringe development, but we never envisioned after 1993 that anyone would try to build major levees and enclose thousands of acres.''
 Some people already living in the flood plain at the time of the last big flood now say that it just makes economic sense for them to stay close to the river, and that it is an issue of personal-risk calculation and property rights. 
 Doris Hulst, a 65-year-old school bus driver, is the sole homeowner on a 109-acre swath of land that once housed three trailer parks near the Missouri River in St. Charles County. 
 ''They all took the buyout,'' Mrs. Hulst said of her neighbors who relocated after the flood. ''I took the buyout on a trailer I owned across the street, but you didn't make enough money to buy anything decent.''
 Today, Mrs. Hulst's trailer is elevated on three rows of cinder blocks. ''We'll be fine as long as the Mississippi doesn't back up,'' she said. 
 Alan Dooley, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, St. Louis District, said people, like water, had certain natural inclinations.
 ''People have a tendency to locate near water,'' Mr. Dooley said. ''These people vote; they pay taxes. It's kind of difficult to go through with a broad brush and say, 'You all ought to get out of here.' ''

HEADLINE: As Demand for Donor Eggs Soars, High Prices Stir Ethical Concerns

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
Samantha Carolan was 23 and fresh out of graduate school when she decided to donate eggs to an infertile couple. Ms. Carolan concedes that she would never have done it if not for the money, $7,000 that she used to pay off some student loans.
 She has since had a second egg extraction, for which she was paid $8,000, and she is planning a third before taking a break.
''The first time, it's frightening,'' said Ms. Carolan, now 24, of Winfield Park, N.J. ''It is surgery, and I don't think I would have done it without compensation. But I had very limited pain, and it was a great experience for me. I would have done it the second time for less money or even no compensation.''
 Though many egg donors derive great satisfaction from knowing that they helped someone start a family, the price of eggs has soared in recent years as demand has increased, and the sizable payments raise controversy. 
 A survey published this month in the journal Fertility and Sterility, ''What Is Happening to the Price of Eggs?'' found that the national average compensation for donors was $4,217. At least one center told the authors of the paper that it paid $15,000. Many centers did not respond.
 Though laws prohibit the sale of transplant organs, sperm donors have always received small payments, and prospective parents in the United States are allowed to compensate women for their far greater expenditure of time and energy. (Many countries, including Canada and Britain, do prohibit payments to egg donors.)
 The American Society for Reproductive Medicine considers compensation of $5,000 or more to ''require justification'' and sums exceeding $10,000 ''beyond what is appropriate.'' 
 Meanwhile, advertisements recruiting students from elite universities to donate promise tens of thousands of dollars, and donor agencies have sprung up, appealing to would-be parents with online videos and photo galleries of donors. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5,767 babies were born in 2003 from donor eggs; the number of actual egg donations is probably much higher, however, because the success rate is fairly low.
 Ethicists and some women's health advocates worry that lucrative payments are enticing young women with credit-card debt and steep tuition bills to sell eggs without seriously evaluating the risks.
 ''The real issue is whether the money can cloud someone's judgment,'' said Josephine Johnston, an associate for law and bioethics at the Hastings Center, a research group in Garrison, N.Y., that specializes in medical ethics. She does not oppose compensation, but she does worry about high prices. 
 ''We hear about egg donors being paid enormous amounts of money, $50,000 or $60,000,'' Ms. Johnston said. ''How much is that person actually giving informed consent about the medical procedure and really listening and thinking as it's being described and its risks are explained?''
 Adding to the debate was a proposal by lawmakers in Maryland to ban payments for eggs. Proponents of compensation say if payments are lowered or eliminated, the supply of eggs will dwindle or dry up. 
 ''Women aren't exactly lining up to be donors,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer, director of the Center for Women's Reproductive Care at the Columbia University Medical Center. ''There are a lot more recipients than donors.''
 Part of the problem is that the risks of donation have not been thoroughly studied. Although the consensus among most reproductive endocrinologists is that extraction is safe, five deaths have been reported in Britain. There are enough unanswered questions that stem cell researchers have promised not to pay for eggs. 
 ''One of the most striking facts about in vitro fertilization is just how little is known with certainty about the long-term health outcomes for the women who undergo the procedure,'' a recent report by the Institute of Medicine said.
 The 2005 guidelines of the National Academy of Sciences for human embryonic stem cell research discourage paying for eggs for research. The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine reimburses women only for out-of-pocket expenses like lost wages or cab fare. 
 ''As a public agency, we felt we shouldn't be putting money on the table that might induce someone to take a risk,'' said Geoffrey Lomax, senior officer for medical and ethical standards at the institute.
 So far, women have not come forward to give away eggs for research. ''I just completed an outreach initiative to 21 institutions across the state that we've funded,'' Dr. Lomax said. ''No one has had an egg donated specifically for research.''
 The reluctance is understandable. The process of egg extraction is time consuming, and it is not comfortable. For some women, it can be painful. A woman first has to take medications to stop her menstrual cycle and then daily hormone injections for several weeks to stimulate her ovaries to produce a crop of mature eggs at once. 
 The drugs may cause bloating, weight gain, moodiness and irritability, and there is a risk of a rare condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome that can cause life-threatening complications, blood clots and kidney failure. 
 The egg extraction itself is a surgical procedure in which a thin needle is inserted through the vagina into the ovary to retrieve the eggs and liquid from the follicles. Risks include adverse responses to anesthesia, infection, bleeding or the inadvertent puncture of an organ.
 It is the long-term risks, both physical and psychological, that are harder to assess. Questions have been raised about whether extraction may jeopardize the donor's fertility, and critics worry about the potential psychological harm to a donor of eggs as a young woman who later finds that she is unable to have children. 
 And since egg donors go through much the same process as women trying to conceive in vitro, there are concerns that they may be prone to the higher rates of certain cancers that some studies have found among infertility patients. Still, said Dr. James A. Grifo, director of the division of reproductive endocrinology at the New York University School of Medicine, ''There is no credible evidence of long-lasting effects or health consequences down the line.''
 That does not necessarily mean that the procedures are safe.
 ''There's no health-outcome data collected by anybody other than some voluntary reporting, and there's no postmarket testing on how these drugs are being used,'' said Susan Berke Fogel, co-founder of the Pro-Choice Alliance for Responsible Research, a project of the Public Health Institute in Oakland, Calif.
 In a recent article in The New England Journal of Medicine, a Harvard Business School professor said the controversy over the price of eggs was obscuring questions of women's health. The author, Debora L. Spar, an economist who wrote ''The Baby Business'' last year, calls for more studies of the drugs being used, more long-term follow-up of donors and federal regulations to ensure proper informed consent.
 When Ms. Carolan went to donate, the short-term risks were described to her in detail, but she said she did not recall any mention of possible long-term risks. Her family opposed her decision because they worried about her health, she said, and her friends did not understand.
 ''They all think I'm crazy,'' she said. ''If the topic comes up, and I tell friends I've done it, they're like: 'Why? Oh my God, aren't you afraid you have a baby out there?' They're so stunned and shocked.''
 Then she tells them how much she was paid. ''And then they go, 'O.K., I understand now, that's cool,' '' she said. ''People understand the money.''

Japan's current account surplus widened to a record in March, as exports to Asia and Europe helped counter slower growth in shipments to the United States. The surplus expanded 36.9 percent, to 3.32 trillion yen ($28 billion) from a year earlier, the ministry of finance said. In other economic news, Japan's machinery orders fell unexpectedly for a second month in March. Non-government orders excluding shipping and utilities dropped 4.5 percent from a month earlier after declining a revised 4.9 percent in February.

HEADLINE: The Right to Paid Sick Days

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
It sounds reasonable: seven paid sick days a year. Why should you have to lose a couple of days pay, or maybe even your job, because you had the misfortune to catch the flu?
 And it certainly seems unreasonable to penalize an employee in good standing who misses a day or two of work to care for a child who is ill or has met with a serious accident.
After all, this is the 21st century. 
 The reality, for a surprising percentage of the U.S. population, is more like the 19th century. Nearly half of all full-time private sector workers in the U.S. get no paid sick days. None. If one of those workers woke up with excruciating pains in his or her chest and had to be rushed to a hospital -- well, no pay for that day. For many of these workers, the cost of an illness could be the loss of their job.
 The situation is ridiculous for those in the lowest quarter of U.S. wage earners. Nearly 80 percent of those workers -- the very ones who can least afford to lose a day's pay -- get no paid sick days at all.
 I recently spoke with Bertha Brown, a home health aide who lives in Philadelphia and has two young daughters. She makes $7 an hour caring for people who are ill or disabled. ''I feed them and dress them,'' she said. ''And if they have to be changed, I do all that.''
 She has worked for the better part of two decades without ever being paid for a sick day. And her wages are so low she can't afford to lose even a day's pay. ''If I get sick, I work sick,'' she said. ''I cover my nose and my mouth with a mask to keep my clients from getting sick.''
 Food service workers are among those least likely to get paid sick days. Eighty-six percent get no sick days at all. They show up in the restaurants coughing and sneezing and feverish, and they start preparing and serving meals. You won't see many of them wearing masks.
 There's an effort under way to change this picture. A growing number of organizations and activists are lining up behind proposed federal legislation that would give most workers the right to seven paid sick days annually to take care of their medical needs or those of their families. The legislation, sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy and Representative Rosa DeLauro, would require employers with 15 or more workers to provide the sick days.
 Among the organizations pushing for paid sick days is the Public Welfare Foundation in Washington, which recently approved a $1 million ''special initiative'' on the issue. Deborah Leff, the foundation's president, noted that it's the poorest workers who most often are forced to choose between going to work sick or losing a day's pay, and that a disproportionate number of those workers are women -- many of them with children.
 ''At least 145 countries have paid sick days,'' said Ms. Leff. ''The United States is the only industrialized country lacking such a policy. Our goal is to change that.''
 An overwhelming majority of Americans favor paid sick days for full-time workers. One poll showed that 95 percent of workers find it ''unacceptable'' for employers to deny sick days to workers. But the Kennedy-DeLauro legislation is facing a tough road.
 As one might imagine, the industries that would be affected are ice-cold to the idea.
 The response of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store to my inquiries on this issue is illustrative. A spokeswoman said in an e-mail message: ''Because employees working in the restaurants have flexible schedules, they can schedule doctors' appointments and other appointments that sick leave and personal time are generally used for at times when they are not working.
 ''If employees need to miss a shift due to illness, there are generally many opportunities to make up that lost shift later in the week, or the next week.''
 That is the kind of workplace policy that prompts Debra Ness, the president of the National Partnership for Women and Families, to note that ''for millions of workers, getting sick can mean the beginning of an economic disaster.'' 
 Allowing a worker to recuperate from an illness, or take care of a sick child, without suffering undue economic hardship should be a matter of basic humanity and fundamental decency. It should not be politically controversial in a country that considers itself the most advanced on the face of the earth, and that babbles incessantly about the importance of family values.

HEADLINE: One Misstep And They're Out the Door

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Misbehaving executives, take note: before you have your day in court, you may already be out of a job. 
 Last Wednesday, Chris Albrecht, the chief executive of Home Box Office and a star at Time Warner, was asked to resign three days after he was accused of assaulting his girlfriend in the parking lot of the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. Two days later, he pleaded no contest and agreed to pay a fine.
Hollywood, where outrageous behavior by studio executives has always been quietly accepted, may have been shocked by the swiftness of Time Warner's decision. But experts say that public companies are under increasing pressure to respond rapidly when an executive gets into trouble over drugs, alcohol, abusive behavior or an affair that catches the attention of co-workers or others. 
 Earlier this year, Todd S. Thomson, the head of Citigroup's global wealth management group, departed over questions about his relationship with Maria Bartiromo, a news anchor on CNBC. 
 A month earlier, Wal-Mart fired Julie Roehm, its high-powered marketing executive, over allegations that she had accepted gifts from agencies and had an affair with a co-worker. 
 ''Companies are just far less accepting of this omnipotent behavior,'' said Mortimer Feinberg, chairman of BFS Psychological Associates, which counsels chief executives and corporate boards.
 Media companies are becoming particularly sensitive to the image projected by their employees. Last month, both CBS Radio and MSNBC fired Don Imus after he made racially insulting comments on his program about the women's basketball team at Rutgers, despite Mr. Imus having built his career on comments like those and his show's ability to generate tens of millions in revenue.
 It is a sign of how much the times have changed that when Mr. Albrecht, who was seen by the police in Las Vegas with his hands around his girlfriend's throat, went through a similar episode in 1991, he suffered no repercussions from his company. 
 At that time, he was accused of choking Sasha Emerson, another executive who was herself on the fast track at HBO. The company, a division of Time Warner, paid her a $400,000 settlement. Despite having a contract, she left the company. 
 HBO's decision to protect a male executive back then was hardly an anomaly. In 1999, Richard D. Beckman, then publisher of Conde Nast's Vogue magazine, banged the head of Carol Matthews, a Vogue advertising manager, against that of another woman. Ms. Matthews's cheekbone was broken, requiring reconstruction. 
 Mr. Beckman was known to be a hard-driving executive who also enjoyed partying, according to reports at the time. 
 The matter was settled for a payment believed to be $1 million to $5 million, and Ms. Matthews left the company.
 Mr. Beckman kept his position as publisher after the incident and is currently president of the Conde Nast Media Group and the company's chief marketing officer. 
 Maurie Perl, a company spokeswoman, said that Conde Nast had no comment.
 One significant change, many experts contend, is the greater presence of women and minorities in the executive ranks. If companies do not act decisively in cases of offensive behavior, they can face opposition from both inside and outside their offices. 
 Companies, Mr. Feinberg said, ''are afraid of the exposure, bad publicity and lawsuits, and there is also a greater sensitivity to minority groups and their reactions.'' 
 Time Warner has faced criticism from some of its own female employees recently over a decision to retain another executive, according to a person close to Time Warner. Last year, a woman accused of being a prostitute alleged that she had had a relationship with the company's chief financial officer, Wayne H. Pace. At the time Mr. Pace denied that he had had an inappropriate relationship. Ed Adler, a Time Warner spokesman, said that the company had investigated the allegations and found no illegal activity and Time Warner took no action. 
 Voices of various insiders and outsiders played a crucial role in the decision last month by NBC Universal to drop Mr. Imus from its morning slot on MSNBC's cable television network. Faced with anger from prominent blacks like the ''Today'' show's Al Roker and Senator Barack Obama, the Illinois Democrat who is running for president, NBC said that after ''many conversations with our own employees,'' it decided to drop the show. 
 ''It used to be that people in lower economic groups -- women and minorities -- had no power,'' Mr. Feinberg said. ''If an executive had an affair with a secretary, you would fire her. Now she goes to the gossip columns and that is dangerous for companies.''
 And those gossip columns -- along with tabloid television and blogs -- now give heightened scrutiny to every misstep. That means the news moves so fast on so many outlets that companies want to stop the debate before it harms the corporate image. 
 Bloggers from the liberal group Media Matters were instrumental in giving wide exposure to the comments of Mr. Imus.
 Web sites like the Smoking Gun, which swiftly posted Mr. Albrecht's arrest photo, and TMZ.com follow the peccadilloes of studio executives as though they were celebrities themselves. 
 William Simon, who heads the media and entertainment practice for the executive search firm Korn/Ferry International, said that ''there are plenty of people who have survived experiences like what happened to Chris Albrecht, but in today's competitive media marketplace and coverage by such diverse sources as gossip columns, blogs, and the Internet, it is impossible to keep such news away from the public.'' 
 Last week some of Mr. Albrecht's associates argued that Time Warner should have given him ''a second chance,'' as a talent agent, Ari Emanuel, a friend and sometimes business associate, wrote on HuffingtonPost.com.
 In addressing the incident, Mr. Albrecht said that he had started drinking again after stopping for 13 years and regularly attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
 Douglas Tieman, chief executive of Caron Treatment Centers, which treats addicts, pointed out that alcoholics generally get at least one chance to address their problems without corporate repercussions. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, addiction is considered a disability, and therefore addicted employees cannot be terminated if they agree to seek help. 
 But experts on alcoholism, including one chief executive who quit drinking 25 years ago, were less tolerant if a person knows he is an alcoholic, starts drinking again and does not get help. Geoffrey McKernan, the chief executive of NSM Insurance, a $300 million private property and casualty insurance company, stopped drinking 25 years ago. But he still attends meetings and describes himself as a recovering alcoholic.
 In his view, Mr. Albrecht's admission that he had been drinking again meant he needed help. Whether Mr. Albrecht was prompted to resign or did so on his own, Mr. McKernan said he should get himself healthy first, and then worry about his job. 
 ''Getting himself sober should be his priority,'' Mr. McKernan said in a telephone interview.
 Perhaps the most widely publicized dismissal of a top level executive was Citigroup's ouster of Mr. Thomson. At the time, the press reported that Mr. Thomson had invited Ms. Bartiromo to fly home from Hong Kong and Shanghai on the corporate jet, bumping several Citigroup executives from the flight.
 But a leading executive search veteran, who agreed to speak only if his name was not used because he deals with many different top executives, said that in his opinion, once a crisis develops, ''the way it comes down is somewhat affected by the goodwill that exists -- or doesn't -- toward that person.'' Ms. Bartiromo has maintained her job at CNBC.
 Mr. Tieman said that the very character traits that make executives successful can also lead to their belief that they can overcome alcoholism or other addictions themselves. 
 ''They have a big work ethic, are very clever and creative,'' said Mr. Tieman, whose company treats about 1,200 executives a year at its centers in Pennsylvania and Florida. ''They also have the notion of invincibility. They suffer from terminal uniqueness. They think: 'I am different. I can drink again.' That creates a very slippery slope.''

HEADLINE: Bush Calls for Work Toward Higher Car Fuel Efficiency

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
President Bush announced on Monday that he had directed his administration to begin the long process of establishing higher fuel efficiency standards for new cars.
 But officials said that it was unclear if at the end of that process Mr. Bush would take it upon himself to raise the gas mileage of the nation's automobiles, which has not significantly increased in decades. And Mr. Bush, speaking in the Rose Garden on Monday afternoon, said nothing would be put into effect until the regulatory process was completed at the end of 2008, just weeks before the end of his term.
Environmental groups, which have long called for substantial increases in the government-mandated fuel standards, expressed skepticism that the administration would enact new standards without Congressional action, and dissatisfaction that Mr. Bush had not offered specifics. And Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, called the announcement ''a stall tactic.'' 
 Mr. Bush's announcement came during a period of new headlines about resurgent gasoline prices, as well as international and domestic political pressure to control American emissions of heat-trapping gases from burning petroleum and other fossil fuels. It comes six weeks after the Supreme Court, rebuffing the administration's arguments, ruled in favor of states that were seeking new federal controls on these emissions from automobiles. 
 The court found on April 2 that carbon dioxide, the principal heat-trapping gas, is a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and must be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency unless the agency scientifically determines that it does not contribute to climate change or that action is not necessary. A growing scientific consensus holds that carbon dioxide emissions are a serious problem that ought to be addressed urgently. 
 The E.P.A. administrator, Stephen Johnson, said during a teleconference with reporters on Monday that the administration was not arguing otherwise. ''We accept the Supreme Court's decision,'' Mr. Johnson said, hailing what he said was ''the first regulatory step to craft a proposal to control greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles.''
 Mr. Bush began the process with an executive order directing the E.P.A., the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture to explore regulatory options to enact a proposal he announced in his State of the Union address earlier, which set a goal of reducing the projected growth of oil consumption within 10 years to a level 20 percent lower than current forecasts. Officials have expressed frustration that Congress has not enacted his plan, based on efficiency standards as well as incentives for alternative fuels, which environmentalists have harshly criticized as insufficient.
 Mr. Bush said on Monday that he still preferred Congressional action to executive action and that his officials would ''work with Congress to pass the 20-in-10 bill.'' He said he had directed his cabinet secretaries to complete the regulatory process by the end of 2008 and to ''evaluate the benefits and costs before they put forth the new regulation.''
 The president has opposed setting across-the-board standards of the kind that Congress imposed decades ago, preferring flexibility to account for vehicle size and safety specifications, said Scott Stanzel, a White House spokesman.
 Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, said in a statement that the Senate would move forward with its own proposals, which include raising average passenger car fuel standards to 35 miles per gallon over 10 years from 25 m.p.g.. But, he said of the president, ''if he brings forward proposals that make legal, economic and environmental sense, we will work with him as we legislate.''
 Mr. Johnson, of the E.P.A., said that if the administration moved forward with the new rules, they would go into effect by the end of 2008. 
 Officials said the review would also consider regulatory avenues toward increasing the production of alternative and renewable fuels to 35 billion gallons a year, which would be significantly above the current mandate. 
 Environmental advocates said that taking many months to propose new rules, receive public comment and issue them in final form was reasonable. But they said Monday's announcement gave them no reason to abandon their doubts about the probable result.
 ''This really amounts to saying, 'Trust us, we're doing something,' '' said David Doniger, policy director for the climate center of the Natural Resources Defense Council, which was a party to the Supreme Court case. ''It's a clever effort, maybe a half-clever effort, to slip out of a corner. We haven't been promised any specific reduction in global warming pollution, or any specific increase in the efficiency in cars.''
 He said the president's directive seemed to limit the E.P.A.'s flexibility by requiring that it act with sister agencies, meaning, ''they can only walk as fast as the slowest one of them.''
 Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a public interest group, criticized the president's plan for relying on his ''20-in-10'' proposal as a starting point because of its large reliance on alternative fuels, which ''opens the door for coal-to-liquids based fuel, which has the potential to emit more than twice as much carbon dioxide as gasoline.''
 She called on Congress to set standards legislatively. Arguments in Mileage Lawsuit By The New York Times 
 SAN FRANCISCO, May 14 -- Lawyers representing California and 10 other states gave arguments here on Monday in a lawsuit intended to force the government to increase gas mileage requirements for minivans, pickups and sport utility vehicles. 
 The suit, filed in November, asks the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to force the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to conduct an environmental impact study of fuel efficiency standards announced in April 2006. Those rules, which require automakers to act by 2010, raised fuel efficiency requirements by a little over a mile per gallon. 
 Attorney General Jerry Brown of California said the rules failed to take into account how man-made pollution affected the environment, as well as ignored political instability in the Middle East and the development of newer, cleaner fuels. 
 ''They didn't consider global warming; they didn't consider alternative technologies; therefore they didn't do their job,'' said Mr. Brown, standing on the steps of the courthouse. ''It doesn't make any sense from a science point of view or a homeland security point of view.'' 
 Charles Miller, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, said the department had no comment.

HEADLINE: A Human Capital Agenda

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In 1998, the Republican Party was in disarray. ''G.O.P. Train Careens Out of Control,'' was the headline on one George Will column. The folks at National Review surveyed the wreckage of the Republican Revolution and asked, ''What Went Wrong?'' 
 The Republicans were not only directionless and depressed, they had sacrificed their identity as the party of limited government. They'd just passed a $217 billion highway bill with 1,850 pork barrel projects. In 1998, the Republicans spent more money than Bill Clinton thought to ask for. ''Big Government Republicans,'' wailed an editorial in Investor's Business Daily. 
 By now, this should sound familiar. And it should be clear that while some Republicans argue that big government conservatism started under George W. Bush and that the G.O.P. was in decent shape until Bush ruined it, this is a total myth. In fact, it was Bush in 1999 who single-handedly (though temporarily) rescued the Republican Party. He did it not by courting Republican interest groups, but by coming up with something new. On July 22, he delivered a speech in Indianapolis in which he explicitly distanced himself from Washington Republicans and laid the groundwork for compassionate conservatism. 
 Today, we know the substantive problems with compassionate conservatism. It involved blending church and state in ways that made people on both sides uncomfortable. It was too small an agenda to build an entire domestic policy around. 
 But as a matter of leadership, that speech was a masterstroke, and should be instructive to anybody running for president today. Instead of looking small by chasing the approval of midlevel power brokers, he made himself look big by defining his own agenda and making them come to him. Instead of enmeshing himself in the controversies that were contributing to G.O.P. decline, he gave the country something unexpected, and offered a break with the past. 
 Today, Republican candidates should hunger to give that kind of speech, this time with a bigger policy agenda. Republicans should learn from Bush's false dawn and create a real dawn. What the country needs is a candidate who can transcend current categories and give a speech laying out a human capital agenda, which offers several advantages. 
 First, it's really important. As Isaac Ehrlich of the State University of New York at Buffalo detailed recently, the U.S. became the richest country because in the 19th and 20th centuries it had the most schooling and the best circumstances to help people develop their own capacities.
 But this advantage is eroding. High school graduation rates have peaked and are sliding. And over the next 25 years, the Educational Testing Service reports, better educated people will leave the work force and they'll be replaced by people with less education and worse skills.
 Second, a human capital agenda leads to policies that cut across left and right. At the very least, it means preserving low income-tax rates, which cause people to work harder and develop their capacities. It means creating high-quality preschools for children from disorganized single-parent homes. It means giving parents more school choice so they can take advantage of the information they now have about failing schools thanks to No Child Left Behind.
 It means increasing child tax credits to reduce economic stress on young families. It means encouraging marriage, the best educational institution we have. It means a national service program, so young people can experience the world.
 Third, politically, a human capital agenda exploits the divisions between liberal populists and independents. Liberal populists, about 26 percent of the country, believe in redistribution policies. Conservatives and independents do not. Liberal populists believe the global economy is so broken all the benefits of it go to the top 0.01 percent. Independents and conservatives observe that hard work still leads to success. Liberals emphasize inequality. Moderates and conservatives believe inequality is acceptable so long as there is opportunity. 
 In the 1980s, Republican supply-side policies helped spur investment. Today, the world is awash in money. That's not the problem. Instead the shortage is in people to invest in.
 Over the next few weeks I'll detail some policies that might go into a human capital agenda. What's needed is a candidate who will break from the G.O.P. death spiral and who will stop talking about himself. After the Iraq debate crescendos in September, public attention will turn domestic. Republicans had better have something big and growth-oriented to talk about.

HEADLINE: Magazine Publisher Is Selling Special-Interest Unit for $1.15 Billion

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The publisher Primedia said yesterday that it would sell its Enthusiast Media division, which includes magazines like Motor Trend, Soap Opera Digest and Surfer, for about $1.2 billion in cash to Source Interlink Companies, which is controlled by the billionaire investor Ronald W. Burkle through his Yucaipa investment firm. 
 The unit, which Primedia said in February it would consider selling, includes more than 70 magazines and 90 Web sites. It leaves Primedia with its Consumer Source business, which publishes free consumer guides.
The move comes after Primedia agreed to sell its hunting and fishing magazines to the private equity firm InterMedia Partners for $170 million in cash in December.
 Primedia expects $1.15 billion in net proceeds and will be debt-free after the sale.
 Source Interlink, which is based in Bonita Springs, Fla., said it expected the all-cash deal to add to adjusted earnings per share excluding one-time costs.
 Source Interlink manages retail checkout areas for more than 1,000 retail chains and makes in-store displays. It also manages the delivery of magazines and other entertainment products like DVDs to retailers and consumers.
 The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. Source Interlink said Enthusiast Media would operate as a division and would be led by Steve Parr, who heads the group at Primedia.
 Primedia said that certain stockholders affiliated with the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company who own 61 percent of its shares unanimously agreed to the deal.
 Primedia shares rose 34 cents, to $2.83, while Source Interlink shares fell $1.01 cents, to $5.79.

HEADLINE: In Albany, Bloomberg Pushes Congestion Pricing, but Many Want to Talk About '08

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and DIANE CARDWELL; Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 14 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg came to the Capitol on Monday to pitch his plan for reducing traffic congestion in Manhattan to state lawmakers and Gov. Eliot Spitzer, but there is no apparent sense of urgency in Albany to move on the mayor's complex environmental proposals. 
 The mayor is proposing dozens of environmental projects and regulations to prepare New York City for a projected surge of one million additional residents by 2030. 
Under the most contentious proposal, known as congestion pricing, the city would charge $8 for cars and $21 for commercial trucks that enter Manhattan below 86th Street from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays, or $4 for drivers within Manhattan, with several exceptions. 
 The plan, similar to a program in London, calls for the revenue to be used to finance environmental and mass transportation projects. 
 ''This is a plan about trying to solve problems of success,'' the mayor said. 
 ''Just listen to the radio in the morning,'' he added. ''There's an hour wait to get on the G. W. Bridge, there's a 45 minute wait to get to the Lincoln Tunnel, 55 minutes for the Holland Tunnel. Think about, No. 1, the pollution that gets put in the air, but think of the economic value of somebody that commutes.''
 Although Mr. Bloomberg's visit was ostensibly about the environment, there was also considerable talk around the Statehouse on Monday about whether he might run for governor or president since term limits require him to leave office at the end of 2009. 
 Enough interest, indeed, that Mr. Bloomberg tried to dismiss such questions before reporters could even ask them. 
 Given the more than 900 ''days left in this job -- and I'm not running for governor and I'm not running for president -- the time to do this is now,'' he said during a news conference. 
 The mayor made the rounds with a number of environmental and health groups, including Environmental Defense and the American Cancer Society. After meeting with the governor in the late afternoon, Mr. Bloomberg said, ''I'm optimistic that we'll find a way to get his support, but his staff wants to look at it first, obviously.''
 State officials were noncommittal. 
 The governor's staff and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver reiterated that three weeks after the plan was unveiled, they were reviewing it and had yet to take a position on it. More enthusiastic was the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who said the mayor, a fellow Republican, made an ''outstanding presentation'' to Senate Republicans. 
 ''We're going to look forward to working with the mayor on the details of the plan,'' he said. ''The general reception was very upbeat, very positive, because what benefits New York City benefits all of New York State.''
 Mr. Bruno also pointed out that the mayor's proposal was not to be confused with the income-based commuter tax that expired in 1999, which Mr. Bruno had opposed. 
 But the landscape of opposition for the plan is still considerable. 
 ''My colleagues and I feel like our folks are taxed enough and tolled enough and fee-ed enough under the present scenario,'' said Senator John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican. ''So why would we want to do anything more that's going to take more money out of their pocket?'' 
 Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Manhattan Democrat, called the plan ''a very hard sell, but I think the mayor is making a very good case and that he's put together the coalition he needs if he's going to get this done.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's visit coincided with the start of a three-day global climate conference in the city, in which he will be host with former President Bill Clinton. 
 At the conference, which is drawing international business and municipal leaders, a number of cities, including Los Angeles and Toronto, are expected to announce plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
 Mr. Clinton is also expected to announce an arrangement through his foundation's Climate Initiative to help cities reduce emissions. The conference focuses on cities because they are responsible for three-quarters of the world's energy consumption, organizers say. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, who welcomed delegates to Gracie Mansion on Monday night, was scheduled to address the conference on Tuesday in a speech that was to be translated simultaneously into several languages, offering him a global platform for his plan to guide the city's growth. It will also give him an opportunity to hammer a pet theme of late: that urban mayors are in the best position to enact problem-solving policies, whether fighting illegal gun trafficking or global warming.
 Mr. Bloomberg's push for his plan, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030, came as Environmental Defense and the Partnership for New York City, a business group, released a television advertisement over the weekend showing belching smokestacks, an asthmatic child visiting the doctor and lines of traffic, while urging New Yorkers to ''act now'' and ''make a difference'' by supporting Mr. Bloomberg's plan.

HEADLINE: Barely in Office, but G.O.P. Rivals Are Circling

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: MILFORD, N.Y. 

 BODY:
The furniture has yet to arrive for one of the offices that Kirsten Gillibrand, a freshman Democrat in Congress, recently opened here. But the list of Republicans angling to challenge her next year is already growing.
 Alexander F. Treadwell, a former state Republican Party chairman, opened a headquarters near Ms. Gillibrand's main office in Saratoga Springs and has assembled a campaign staff, including a former political director for the House Republicans' re-election committee.
Richard Wager, an aide to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City, formed a campaign committee and is raising money from his old network of allies, including well-heeled donors on Wall Street.
 And several other potential rivals -- including a retired United States Army lieutenant colonel, a former candidate for governor and even the man Ms. Gillibrand defeated last year -- are considering a run. 
 It may seem unusually early for the opposition to begin mobilizing against Ms. Gillibrand, who only recently wrote and introduced her first bill since arriving in Washington four months ago. But the maneuvering reflects a growing confidence among Republicans that they can win back the district, where the vast majority of voters are registered to their party. 
 Indeed, Republican officials in Washington are so confident of Ms. Gillibrand's vulnerabilities that they say they intend to field test an array of themes in the district that they believe can be applied to other freshman Democrats around the country.
 Chief among those themes: Ms. Gillibrand's willingness to collect special-interest money despite having deplored the influence of special interests in Washington as a candidate last year, and her propensity for voting with what they call the party's left-leaning leadership after having campaigned as a centrist. 
 ''There are a lot of these recently elected Democrats who claimed to be reformers of the system on the campaign trail but have turned out to be something quite different,'' said Ken Spain, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.
 All this has placed enormous pressure on Ms. Gillibrand, 40, to raise a great deal of money just months after she won her seat in November. Though her advisers say raising money does not detract from legislating, there is little question it has lengthened her workweek. 
 Those demands were evident one recent weekend, when she arrived late to a family barbecue after having attended both a fund-raiser in Cooperstown and a town-hall-style meeting in Milford where officials and residents aired their concerns about issues like the local economy and schools.
 The event in Cooperstown was the eighth fund-raising reception this year held by Ms. Gillibrand, one of the largest fund-raisers in the House in the first four months of this year, having taken in nearly $700,000. 
 ''It's the reality of modern-day politics,'' she said, with a hint of resignation in her voice. 
 Ms. Gillibrand has agreed to allow The New York Times to chronicle her first year in office representing New York's 20th Congressional District, which runs from the mid-Hudson Valley to Lake Placid. 
 For her and other freshman lawmakers, it is a time of intense learning and sudden challenges, harried travel and nonstop work. But it is also a period of political peril: Gary Jacobson, a professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego, has found that while veteran incumbents enjoy a re-election rate of 98 percent, the rate drops to less than 92 percent for first-term incumbents. 
 Not surprisingly then, 30 of the 41 Democratic freshmen in the House are facing Republicans who have either announced their candidacies or are said to have plans to announce them, according to the National Republican Congressional Committee.
 Political analysts in both parties predict that the race will cost much more than the roughly $6 million that Ms. Gillibrand and her Republican predecessor, John E. Sweeney, spent on their campaigns last year.
 John Nolan, who is known as Jasper and has been chairman of the Saratoga County Republican Committee for the past 20 years, says that he has been telling prospective candidates that they will need at least $1 million by the beginning of next year if they hope to compete effectively.
 ''It's never too early to start running when you are going up against an incumbent,'' he said. ''You can't wait until 2008.''
 But even Republicans are aware that there are risks in gearing up this early in a district where there is ample evidence that the bitterly contested race between Ms. Gillibrand and Mr. Sweeney left voters weary.
 A reminder of those perils came a few weeks ago when the editor of The Glens Falls Post-Star described the Republicans moving to challenge her as ''piranhas'' and pointedly asked in a column, ''Shouldn't someone be allowed to do their job for at least a year before they have to worry about keeping it?'' 
 Still, Republicans have not been shy about attacking Ms. Gillibrand, for example, by trying to use one of her own open-government ideas against her. 
 Shortly after taking office, Ms. Gillibrand directed her staff to publish the details of her meetings, no matter how sensitive, on her Congressional Web site, calling the listing the Sunlight Report.
 But Republicans see these reports as a potential trove of damaging information. Examining them, they discovered, for instance, that Ms. Gillibrand, while vacationing with her family in Europe recently, held several fund-raisers for her re-election campaign, including two in London and one in Paris.
 Michael Brady, a former National Republican Congressional Committee operative, disseminated the information on a new Internet news service, the Majority Accountability Project, that he started, noting that it is illegal for foreign citizens to contribute to American campaigns. (The Gillibrand camp insisted that attendees were required to show American passports before being permitted into the events and that no money was donated by foreign citizens.)
 In an interview, Mr. Brady accused Ms. Gillibrand of hypocrisy, saying that she had denounced Mr. Sweeney during the campaign for holding a weekend fund-raiser with pharmaceutical lobbyists at a ski resort in Park City, Utah. 
 ''This is a woman who criticized her opponent for going to Utah, and here she is going to fund-raisers in foreign countries,'' Mr. Brady said.
 But to Gillibrand supporters who have been concerned that Republicans may use her Sunlight Report against her, the episode shows that ''no good deed goes unpunished,'' as one of her advisers put it. 
 Republicans are also depicting Ms. Gillibrand as a liberal who is cloaking her true ideological leanings behind the politically moderate language she employs in her public appearances in the district, as well as in her mailings.
 Mr. Nolan, the Republican leader in Saratoga, is seeking to tie Ms. Gillibrand to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi -- a strategy that is also being employed by Republican operatives in Washington who are compiling a political dossier on Ms. Gillibrand.
 ''She's kind of attached to the hip of Pelosi, who is one of the most left-wing speakers in American history,'' Mr. Nolan said.
 Ms. Gillibrand scoffed at such criticism, which she said began within weeks of her taking office. She pointed to what she considered her accomplishments so far: voting to cut interest rates on federally backed college loans; supporting security initiatives recommended by the 9/11 Commission; providing $1 million in grants for sewage, water and road projects in her district.
 ''It's political,'' she concluded about the attacks. ''It's not about my performance or the good job I am doing.''
 How far the Republican candidates themselves are willing to go in directly attacking Ms. Gillibrand is an open question. Many are clearly mindful of the fact that voters were turned off by the ugly tone of the race between Ms. Gillibrand and Mr. Sweeney.
 (In the final days of that contest, for example, Mr. Sweeney accused the Gillibrand campaign of being behind published reports that his wife placed a call to 911 to report that he had physically abused her. No charges resulted from the episode, which he called campaign propaganda. Her campaign denied Mr. Sweeney's contention.)
 ''The voters of the 20th District have gone through a negative campaign in the past, and anyone who goes that way again will turn them off,'' said Mr. Wager, the Bloomberg aide, who has been traveling the district meeting with party leaders and rank-and-file Republicans.
 Mr. Treadwell, the former state Republican Party chairman, agreed. ''I think people are tired of it,'' he said. 
 Mr. Treadwell, who recently met with Republican leaders in Washington and sent letters to all 1,400 Republican committeemen in the 20th District, said he is focused on building support for his candidacy among Republicans -- not attacking someone who has barely been in office.
 ''She's just starting,'' he said of Ms. Gillibrand. ''We'll have to see how her record develops.''
 Through it all, Ms. Gillibrand has worked like a candidate who is in a tight race. She visits even the most politically unwelcoming regions of her district, trying to deliver constituent services and to make the case that she is staying above the political fray. 
 That was the case recently when she came here to Otsego County, a heavily Republican area that represented a tiny percentage of the overall vote in the previous election. As is her practice, she took along an aide to handle constituent needs, like helping to obtain Social Security benefits.
 Tom Gale, the Republican town supervisor of Milford, said he was pleasantly surprised to see Ms. Gillibrand. ''It's good to see that kind of representation,'' he said. ''She actually took the time to come here even though the population here isn't all that large.'' The Freshman

HEADLINE: Rock Star Still Hasn't Found the African Aid He's Looking For

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
With less than a month to go before the leaders of the Group of 8 nations gather at a Baltic Sea resort in Germany for their annual summit meeting, Bono, the rock star and antipoverty campaigner who helped sweet-talk, cajole and otherwise persuade them to make commitments to double aid to Africa, says most of them have fallen behind on their promise.
 Italy, France and Germany have what the report by Bono's advocacy group, DATA, called ''a particular crisis of credibility.'' Bono said in a telephone interview yesterday that their failure to increase aid has been masked behind artificially high debt-relief write-offs. 
Excluding debt relief and adjusting for inflation, DATA, which stands for Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa, calculates that Germany's aid to Africa has grown only 2 percent since 2004, France's has fallen 1 percent and Italy's has decreased 30 percent. 
 France praised the group's detailed report in a statement, but disagreed with its exclusion of debt relief. ''The freeing up of resources previously dedicated to debt service allows developing countries to increase spending to reduce poverty,'' it said.
 Spokesmen for Germany and Italy in Washington said yesterday that they would reserve comment until the report is formally released at a news conference in Berlin today. 
 In its country-by-country analysis of aid to Africa, DATA found that the seven wealthy nations in the G-8 -- the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan (the other member is Russia) -- have increased aid by less than half of what would be expected to reach the goal they set in 2005 to double aid to Africa by 2010.
 Japan and Britain have increased aid enough since 2004 -- 62 percent and 40 percent, respectively -- to be on the right path to achieving the goal, DATA said. It said the United States had fallen behind in 2006, but seems to have gotten back on track since the new Congress, controlled by Democrats, adopted a 2007 budget that gave President Bush even more than he requested for Africa -- at least an extra $1 billion, mostly to fight AIDS and malaria. 
 ''We're on a trajectory to exceed the target laid out by the president in Gleneagles,'' the Scottish golf resort where the G-8 met in 2005, said Bobby Pittman, a special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council.
 Canada has increased aid 25 percent since 2004, still not at a rate that would double aid by 2010, DATA said. Russia, which has canceled a large amount of debt owed by African countries, did not pledge in 2005 to double its aid to Africa.
 The group's report focuses on G-8 aid to Africa, but its findings are broadly consistent with overall patterns of giving described last month by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, based on figures provided by 22 donor nations that are its members. The total aid to developing countries -- $104 billion -- in 2006 was 5 percent below the 2005 level, the O.E.C.D. found. Aid to Africa grew 23 percent, but once debt relief to Nigeria was subtracted, it rose only 2 percent. 
 Richard Manning, chairman of the organization's development assistance committee, said that he was surprised that aid to Africa other than debt relief grew so slowly -- and noted that such aid would have to rise at a faster pace to double aid to Africa by 2010. ''I would have thought in the general scheme of things, donors would be putting more aid on the table,'' he said.
 The economic development organization allows donor nations to write off the full face value of debt relief to poor nations in the span of a year or two, though often only a portion of the debt would have been repaid, and only over a long period of time. 
 Some wealthy nations, in addition to France, are likely to object to DATA's decision not to count debt relief in its calculations. The group replies that rich nations overstate the real value of debt relief to poor countries. It notes that by 2010, when aid to Africa is supposed to reach $50 billion a year, debt relief will have largely been accounted for and will no longer substantively bolster the amount of aid each country provides.
 Despite the tough talk in its report, Bono, who has cultivated the rich world's leading politicians for years, expressed empathy for the laggards in Europe. He has already met with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the host for this year's meeting, who he said is very conscious that this is a moment when the Group of 8 will be watching to see whether Germany plays a leadership role on poverty.
 Of Italy's prime minister, Romano Prodi, Bono said: ''He's a beautiful man, but he's broke. I don't know what to do about Italy.''
 Bono said that President Jacques Chirac of France had spoken eloquently of the need to support Africa, though he added that France had not yet come through with the resources. Nicolas Sarkozy, the president-elect, has requested a meeting, ''which is very flattering,'' Bono said. 
 Bono said rising political support in Britain and the United States for fighting African poverty has helped strengthen the hand of those who have sought increasing aid budgets.
 ''I want to grow the social movement,'' he said. ''It's no coincidence that in the countries where churches and students are out on the streets -- that's where the numbers are getting better.''

HEADLINE: Sometimes, What's Needed Is a Nudge

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I was walking through the intensive care unit of a San Francisco hospital earlier this year when I noticed a jarring sight. Most of the patients in the unit were sitting up in their beds. Some of them were gravely ill, drifting in and out of consciousness, but their mechanical beds were still propped up, much as the bed of an alert patient receiving visitors might be.
 For more than a decade, it turns out, medical researchers have known that people on ventilators should generally have their heads elevated. When the patients are lying down, bacteria can easily travel from the stomach, up to the mouth and breathing tube, and ultimately into the lungs, causing pneumonia. When people are propped up, gravity becomes their ally.
But hospitals have had a hard time translating this scientific knowledge into better medical care. Patients frequently need to be put on their backs, to be bathed or to receive treatment, and once they are lying down, doctors and nurses -- busy worrying about dozens of other things -- don't always remember to move the bed back up. 
 ''When you have to rely on someone to do it, it's not going to happen every time,'' said Dr. Michael Gropper, the director of critical care medicine at UCSF Medical Center, the hospital I was visiting.
 So Dr. Gropper made a new rule. Unless there was a written order from a doctor saying that a patient should be lying down, every patient on a ventilator had to be sitting up. 
 The rule was one small part of a common-sense campaign to reduce infections in the intensive care unit over the last two years. None of it was cutting-edge science, but it has made a big difference: the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia has fallen more than 40 percent since 2005. There are people walking around Northern California this morning who otherwise would not be alive.
 The pneumonia campaign is an excellent example of the economics of nudging. By changing what was normal, Dr. Gropper enabled his colleagues to do what they already knew they should be doing. 
 A couple of weeks ago in this space, I described some ingenious food psychology experiments that help explain why this country has become so fat. By surrounding ourselves with foot-wide dinner plates, huge popcorn buckets and 20-ounce bottles of Coke, we have made gorging seem normal. The only obvious way to fight back is through thousands of individual decisions, like buying smaller plates and avoiding the bulk bags of potato chips. (The bigger the bag, the more you'll eat. Really.)
 But in a lot of areas beyond the kitchen -- like health care and education -- innovative people are starting to devise policies based on the economics of nudging. Like the push to elevate beds, these policies don't restrict choice; they simply make sure the right choice in most circumstances is also the default. Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, two professors at the University of Chicago, have referred to this idea as ''libertarian paternalism,'' and they are now writing a book about it. The book is tentatively titled ''Nudge.''
 They're not ready to talk about all their ideas, but I think there are two big ways that libertarian paternalism can work its magic. The first has to do with bureaucracy. No matter how lofty the aims of a government program, it usually won't make a difference if people can't understand it.
 Five years ago, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, the largest district in North Carolina, started a school choice program, giving parents a bigger say over where their children went to school. But finding good information about schools, like their average test scores, sometimes seemed like an unpleasant exam in its own right. Parents often had to wade through a Web site filled with acronyms like EOC, EOG, ABC and AYP. 
 Last year, at the urging of an economist named Justine Hastings and two other Yale researchers, the Charlotte schools conducted a little experiment to see if this complexity mattered. Along with their school choice applications, a few thousand parents were also mailed a sheet of paper listing a single test score -- the average of the math and reading scores -- for each school they could apply to. 
 And guess what? These parents were much more likely than others to apply to schools with high scores. They were starting to create the feedback loop that is the whole point of school choice. 
 Unfortunately, Charlotte hasn't drawn the obvious lesson from the experiment and continues to make good information hard to find. This same sort of complexity has plagued Medicare Part D, the new prescription drug benefit. Almost one-quarter of low-income people eligible for a subsidy aren't getting it because they have not signed up for the program at all. ''It's sufficiently complicated that people sort of throw up their hands and say, 'I can't deal with it,' '' said Joseph Newhouse, a Harvard economist. 
 Likewise, there are almost seven million children without health insurance who are eligible for the State Children's Health Insurance Program but are not in it. A few proposals to make it easier for children to be signed up are now working their way through Congress. In every one of these cases -- school choice, Medicare, health insurance -- the government can help people make good choices by tearing down bureaucratic hurdles. 
 The second big nudging strategy puts up hurdles -- in front of bad choices that are otherwise easy to make. This is what Dr. Gropper did in his intensive care unit. Other hospitals have undertaken similar efforts in the last decade, and as a result, the national pneumonia rate has fallen. 
 But it is still too high. Throughout the health care system, in fact, the nudging possibilities remain enormous. Almost 150 years after Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis demonstrated the danger of dirty hands, patients still die every year because doctors and nurses do not wash their hands often enough. 
 Millions of Americans, meanwhile, aren't taking diabetes and heart disease medications that could help them. Sometimes, the solution is as simple as a reminder, like a hand washing sign placed at eye level or a pillbox with an alarm clock embedded in it.
 As Atul Gawande, a surgeon and writer, argues in ''Better,'' his new book, ''The scientific effort to improve performance in medicine -- an effort that at present gets only a pitifully minuscule portion of scientific budgets -- can arguably save more lives in the next decade than bench science, more lives than research on the genome, stem cell therapy, cancer vaccines and all the other laboratory work we hear about in the news.''
 There are a lot of problems that nudging won't solve. It won't keep Medicare from going bankrupt. It won't lift stagnant middle-class incomes or reverse global warming. But there are also a lot of problems in which neither politics nor knowledge is the real obstacle, and a whole lot of progress is just waiting to be made.

HEADLINE: Warding Off Diseases, Many Vaccines at a Time

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
DARREN E. HIGGINS wants to help your immune system in a hurry and on the cheap. 
 Dr. Higgins is a co-founder of Genocea, a biotechnology start-up company working on a novel method of vaccine development. His goal is to find the quickest way to make inexpensive vaccines that fight numerous complex and aggressive viruses and bacteria.
 In a laboratory in Boston, Dr. Higgins, a 40-year-old associate professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Harvard Medical School, oversees graduate students tending samples of proteins drawn from infectious disease cells. 
 They are trying to determine which proteins, or combination of proteins, stimulate an immune system response. Once discovered, these proteins could, in theory, be administered to people to prepare their immune systems to resist attacks by the likes of tuberculosis, H.I.V. or malaria.
 The process, Dr. Higgins said, is ''a major breakthrough.''
 ''We are mimicking the human body immune response,'' he said. 
 His efforts are part of a broad renaissance in vaccine research and development that may hold great promise but also faces considerable challenges. In the case of Genocea, identifying proteins is just a first step. They must still be incorporated into vaccines, which then must be tested for safety and approved by the Food and Drug Administration. After that, they must be manufactured and distributed effectively. 
 Those expensive and time-consuming steps have made the vaccine business a high-cost, low-profit one, dominated by giant corporations, with little room for innovation by smaller companies.
 Yet the momentum is shifting. Scientists and entrepreneurs -- and their financial backers -- are taking a new interest in vaccine research and development, aided by a confluence of social, technological and economic changes.
 From a social standpoint, the ravages of infectious disease in poor nations are more visible and have a greater economic impact on wealthier countries than in the past, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. 
 Not coincidentally, private charities like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have pledged more resources for vaccine development. And governments, including the United States, have directed public funds to the fight against potential pandemics and bioterrorism attacks.
 Technological developments in microbiology and genetics have provided new tools for creating vaccines and manufacturing them quickly and economically in huge quantities. Examples of the new generation of vaccines include Gardasil, which helps prevent cervical cancer, and Prevnar, which is used to prevent infections in infants and children.
 Investments are starting to follow. In the first quarter of 2007, venture capitalists invested $192 million in start-ups working on infectious-disease technology (a category that includes but is not limited to vaccine development). At that rate, investors would put $800 million into such start-ups this year, outpacing any of the past six years.
 ''I see a renaissance not only in vaccine development, but in the availability of vaccines,'' Dr. Fauci said. Still, he added, change will not come overnight, given the complexity of both the business issues and the scientific ones. He noted, for example, that there was no H.I.V. vaccine yet despite the enormous amounts of money, intellectual and political capital and social good will that have been fighting the disease.
 When it comes to creating vaccines, the devil is in the many details, or the micro-organisms.
 Enter Dr. Higgins, who earned a Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School, then did postdoctoral work at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California, Berkeley.
 At Berkeley, he focused on intracellular pathogens -- infections that can be insidious because they are not easily detected by the immune system. Cells infected by these pathogens can appear normal to the immune system, even though they carry disease inside them.
 Dr. Higgins and his colleagues wondered how they could help the immune system recognize these stealthy diseased cells. Could there be a way to identify the clues that are given by the diseased cells but often missed by the immune system during infection?
 Dr. Higgins determined that they could be identified by using a number of scientific advances. The approach developed by Genocea relies on breakthroughs in microbiology but also in human and disease genome mapping, and on technology that allows more effective delivery of vaccines into the body.
 The traditional method of vaccine development entails the trial and error of modifying infectious disease cells, then injecting them into humans or animals to see if the immune system responds with a near-perfect defense. Such testing can take decades and can include great safety concerns for patients who receive the unproven vaccines.
 Dr. Higgins said that Genocea removed an important area of guesswork by giving vaccine developers the critical disease components -- protein building blocks -- around which to create the prospective drugs. It could save years and, in turn, millions of dollars in research costs, he said.
 In 2006, the market gave him some validation. In two separate rounds of financing, venture capitalists invested about $5 million in Genocea, giving the company seed money for two to three years of development. The company has about 15 full-time employees, and has begun applying its technology to numerous diseases to try to discover their immune-system-provoking proteins. (For competitive reasons, the company declined to say which diseases it is researching.)
 Dr. Higgins's work takes place in two locations. The one in Boston is in a cramped lab at Harvard Medical School, pulsing with activity. The other, at Genocea, has its own state-of-the-art laboratory in a renovated office building across the Charles River in Cambridge. 
 Its investors are hopeful, up to a point.
 ''We're not going to be able to speed up the F.D.A. approval process, but we are going to speed up the time it takes to discover vaccine candidates that you would ultimately bring to the F.D.A.,'' said Robert Paull, a co-founder of Genocea and managing partner at Lux Capital, the lead investor in the company.
 The process of finding vaccine candidates ''could go from 10 years' worth of development to a couple of months,'' Mr. Paull said. He added that he believed the company could, in the next year, begin licensing some of its technology to vaccine developers.

HEADLINE: Bush Opens Door to Wolfowitz's Resigning Voluntarily

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, shifting strategy in the face of mounting opposition to Paul D. Wolfowitz, opened the door Tuesday to his resigning voluntarily as World Bank president if the bank board dropped its drive to declare him unfit to remain in office.
 But the administration's new approach -- outlined in a telephone conference call between the Treasury Department in Washington and economic ministries in Japan, Canada and Europe -- appeared to gain few immediate supporters, various officials said. 
Indeed, bank officials said the board seemed determined on Tuesday evening to endorse the findings of a special committee that Mr. Wolfowitz broke bank rules, ethics and governance standards in arranging for, and concealing, a pay and promotion package for his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, in 2005.
 The officials said the 52-page report of the committee, released Monday evening, had emboldened Mr. Wolfowitz's critics on the board, and made it difficult for the board to avoid concluding that he could no longer lead the institution.
 Late in the day on Tuesday, Mr. Wolfowitz made a personal and impassioned appeal to the bank board at a private meeting, seeking to stave off what some said was an inevitable rebuke.
 According to a text made available by a supporter of Mr. Wolfowitz, he warned that a vote of no confidence in his leadership, tantamount to requesting his ouster, ''has the potential to do greater long-term damage to the institution'' than any conflict of interest he may have failed to avoid.
 Declaring that he had been ''held up to public ridicule'' and ''caricatured as a 'boyfriend' who used his position of power to help his 'girlfriend,' '' Mr. Wolfowitz said that ''for the sake of the bank, and for your sake, this process has to be fair.''
 He promised to change his management approach by relying less on advisers from the Bush administration, restructuring his office, delegating more to managers and placing ''more trust in the staff,'' according to the text.
 ''I implore each of you to be fair in making your decision, because your decision will not only affect my life, it will affect how this institution is viewed in the United States and the world,'' he said. This was an apparent reference to criticism of the bank among American conservatives and fears of Congress cutting off financing for the bank.
 European and American officials said that senior aides to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. held a telephone conference with their counterparts at the leading industrial nations, raising the idea of a two-track approach to Mr. Wolfowitz. 
 The first track, administration officials said, required the board to agree that while Mr. Wolfowitz had erred, so had others and that all had acted in good faith.
 ''The fact is that he made mistakes,'' Tony Snow, the White House spokesman, said of Mr. Wolfowitz as he presented this approach on Tuesday. ''They are not, in our view, firing offenses.''
 The second track would involve a discussion of ''all options,'' as Mr. Snow and others put it, on what to do about Mr. Wolfowitz's future ability to lead the bank as a result of the deep antipathy he has engendered among the staff, the board, senior managers and finance ministries of major donor countries.
 Mr. Snow, addressing this track, said that ''at some point in the future, there are going to be conversations about the proper stewardship of the World Bank,'' and that at that point, ''all options are on the table.''
 But there is so much distrust of the United States at the bank that some saw these and other comments as a feint designed to keep Mr. Wolfowitz in office.
 ''The odds of this flying are very, very low,'' said a senior bank official. ''It is too little, too late. It might have been possible a day or two ago, but not after he was found guilty as charged of a whole slew of violations.''
 A senior European official briefed on the conversation with Mr. Paulson's aides said that European and Canadian ministries found the American approach outlined in the conference call to be a tough sell. 
 ''The general view from capitals, with the exception of the Japanese,'' he said, ''is that it is impossible to disentangle the charges of misconduct and corruption from the credibility of the bank, which is going around the world lecturing countries not to engage in misconduct and corruption.''
 Nevertheless, the administration held out some hope on Tuesday evening that it could get its point of view across. There was a fear, some administration officials said, that the two-track approach would entail a long investigative process examining Mr. Wolfowitz's leadership abilities, when in fact an inquiry could be finished quickly.
 It appeared that the best the administration could hope for was the possibility of President Bush appealing personally to Prime Minister Tony Blair, with whom he is scheduled to meet at the White House on Wednesday, and to other elected leaders.
 A factor that kept emotions high was the disclosure on Tuesday of documents that seemed to buttress the bank committee's conclusion that Mr. Wolfowitz tried to keep the pay and promotion arrangement for Ms. Riza a secret.
 According to one document, Mr. Wolfowitz had a bitter showdown with the bank's personnel director, Xavier Coll, in March 2006 over Mr. Wolfowitz's concern that word of the salary was leaking out to the press.
 Mr. Coll recounted that Mr. Wolfowitz became ''increasingly agitated'' and said he was ''tired of people'' who were ''attacking him.'' 
 ''You should tell your friends to stop it,'' Mr. Wolfowitz added, using expletives and threatening retaliation, according to the memo. 
 Aside from the coarse language, the document seemed to demonstrate that Mr. Wolfowitz was aware six months after he arranged for Ms. Riza's compensation that few people at the bank knew about it. This appeared to contradict his contention that it was well known at the bank and deemed appropriate.

HEADLINE: Poppy Fields Are Now a Front Line in Afghanistan War

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
In a walled compound outside Kabul, two members of Colombia's counternarcotics police force are trying to teach raw Afghan recruits how to wage close-quarters combat.
 Using wooden mock AK-47 assault rifles, Lt. John Castaneda and Cpl. John Orejuela demonstrate commando tactics to about 20 new members of what is intended to be an elite Afghan drug strike force. The recruits -- who American officials say lack even basic law enforcement skills -- watch wide-eyed.
''This is kindergarten,'' said Vincent Balbo, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration chief in Kabul, whose office is overseeing the training. ''It's Narcotics 101.'' Another D.E.A. agent added: ''We are at a stage now of telling these recruits, 'This is a handgun, this is a bullet.' ''
 It is a measure of this country's virulent opium trade, which has helped revive the Taliban while corroding the credibility of the Afghan government, that American officials hope that Afghanistan's drug problem will someday be only as bad as that of Colombia. 
 While the Latin American nation remains the world's cocaine capital and is still plagued by drug-related violence, American officials argue that decades of American counternarcotics efforts there have at least helped stabilize the country. 
 ''I wanted the Colombians to come here to give the Afghans something to aspire to,'' Mr. Balbo said. ''To instill the fact that they have been doing this for years, and it has worked.''
 To fight a Taliban insurgency flush with drug money for recruits and weapons, the Bush administration recognizes that it must also combat the drug trafficking it had largely ignored for years. But plans to clear poppy fields and pursue major drug figures have been frustrated by corruption in the Afghan government, and derided by critics as belated half-measures or missteps not likely to have much impact.
 ''There may have been things one could have done earlier on, but at this stage, I think there are relatively limited good options,'' said James F. Dobbins, a former State Department official who served as the administration's special representative on Afghanistan.
 Poppy growing is endemic in the countryside, and Afghanistan now produces 92 percent of the world's opium. But until recently, American officials acknowledge, fighting drugs was considered a distraction from fighting terrorists. 
 The State Department and Pentagon repeatedly clashed over drug policy, according to current and former officials who were interviewed. Pentagon leaders refused to bomb drug laboratories and often balked at helping other agencies and the Afghan government destroy poppy fields, disrupt opium shipments or capture major traffickers, the officials say. 
 Some of the officials declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
 Former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and military leaders also played down or dismissed growing signs that drug money was being funneled to the Taliban, the officials say. 
 And the C.I.A. and military turned a blind eye to drug-related activities by prominent warlords or political figures they had installed in power, Afghan and American officials say.
 Not so long ago, Afghanistan was trumpeted as a success, a country freed from tyranny and Al Qaeda. But as the Taliban's grip continues to tighten, threatening Afghanistan's future and the fight against terrorism, Americans and Afghans are increasingly asking what went wrong. To that, some American officials say that failing to disrupt the drug trade was a critical strategic mistake.
 ''This is the Afghan equivalent of failing to deal with looting in Baghdad,'' said Andre D. Hollis, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for counternarcotics. ''If you are not dealing with those who are threatened by security and who undermine security, namely drug traffickers, all your other grandiose plans will come to naught.''
 Administration officials say they had believed they could eliminate the insurgency first, then tackle the drug trade. ''Now people recognize that it's all related, and it's one issue,'' said Thomas Schweich, the State Department's coordinator for counternarcotics in Afghanistan. ''It's no longer just a drug problem. It is an economic problem, a political problem and a security problem.'' More American Help 
 To step up efforts, last fall President Bush privately prodded President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan to curb opium production, then vowed publicly in February to provide more help.
 While the D.E.A. has imported Colombian trainers in Kabul, United States Justice Department officials are helping build from scratch an Afghan judicial system to deal with drug cases. State Department officials, meanwhile, have helped found the Afghan Eradication Force to wipe out opium poppy crops. The American military is providing logistical support for D.E.A. raids and eradication.
 The symbolic heart of the Bush administration's efforts is a construction site amid tin shanties and junkyards near the Kabul International Airport: a new $8 million Counternarcotics Justice Center. After its scheduled opening in July, the center will be a one-stop shop for drug cases, with two courts, offices for 70 prosecutors and investigators and jail cells for 56 suspects.
 But while new Afghan drug prosecutors are charging hundreds of messengers and truck drivers with drug offenses, major dealers, often with ties both to government officials and the Taliban, operate virtually at will.
 An American counternarcotics official in Washington said a classified list late last year developed by several United States agencies identified more than 30 important Afghan drug suspects, including at least five government officials. But they are unlikely to be actively sought anytime soon, several American officials caution. 
 In part, that is because the Afghan drug prosecutors are eager, but their legal skills are weak. ''You look at the indictments, and it looks like a sixth grader wrote it,'' said Rob Lunnen, a Salt Lake City federal prosecutor assisting the Afghan drug task force.
 Another American prosecutor said, ''If we try to go after deputy ministerial or ministerial level corruption cases, then you are not going to have a system that can handle it, and they would just get released.'' 
 The few times that influential drug figures have been investigated, the resistance has been intense. In January, for example, the D.E.A. and the Afghan national police arrested two drug suspects in remote Kunduz Province, only to find themselves hauled before the provincial governor as a crowd gathered outside. The drug team had to leave their suspects in custody in Kunduz.
 ''It's happened several times that there will be a raid, and a mayor is involved, and nothing happens,'' Mr. Lunnen complained. ''Every day we feel frustrated.'' He added that the Karzai government did not adequately support the Afghan drug task force because it was viewed ''as a creation of the West.'' 
 Failing to charge major traffickers feeds Afghans' skepticism about American intentions, said counternarcotics officials, lawmakers and experts on Afghanistan.
 ''To Afghans, our counternarcotics policy looks like a policy of rewarding rich traffickers and punishing poor farmers,'' Barnett R. Rubin, a New York University professor and an expert on Afghanistan, told a Senate panel in March.
 Many Afghans are hostile to opium eradication, saying it deprives farmers of their livelihoods. Mr. Rubin and others say that destroying crops drives villagers into the arms of the Taliban. But the United States has not embraced large-scale aid and employment programs that might deter farmers from planting poppies. Instead, the antidrug teams venture out into the countryside, where some have been killed by suicide bombers and Taliban forces allied with drug lords. 
 Fearing a backlash from the populace, the Afghan government has rejected American proposals for chemical spraying, permitting only manual eradication. That requires hundreds of men with sticks and tractors -- often surrounded by American contractors for protection -- to knock down poppy bulbs by hand. It is agonizingly slow and largely ineffective. 
 So far this year, about 20,000 acres have been destroyed, just a fraction of the record 407,000 acres planted with opium poppy, according to the United Nations. The crop is expected to yield more than 6,500 tons of opium, exceeding global demand. The export value -- about $3.1 billion -- is equivalent to about half of the legal Afghan economy.
 Like the law enforcement efforts, the eradication program is rife with corruption. Farmers know they must offer bribes to avoid having their crops destroyed, American and Afghan drug officials said. It is often only those who lack money or political connections whose fields are singled out.
 ''I would go out to an eradication site, and we would be driven past miles and miles of poppy fields, and the Afghans would say, 'You can't do that field,' because it belongs to such and such a commander, 'You can't do that field, you can't do this field,' '' recalled one American counternarcotics official. ''Finally, we would arrive at one field where we could set up for eradication, and you had to wonder, why had they chosen this one?'' 
 Gen. Sayed Kamal Sadat, chief of the Afghan national drug counterforce, acknowledges that many officials are for sale. Opium Used as Currency 
 ''We have security chiefs, police chiefs, who traffic in drugs,'' he added. ''Traffickers give money to governors to allow cultivation in their areas. So far, I haven't seen any governor or security commander willing to crack down.'' Drug production is now greatest where the Taliban is strongest. In Helmand Province, which the insurgents mostly control, opium is so abundant that blocks of it serve as local currency. 
 Farmers growing poppies in Taliban-controlled areas pay a tax to the insurgents, who then hire ''day fighters.'' For their part, drug traffickers pay the Taliban for security. Smugglers who take opium and heroin out of Afghanistan bring weapons and bombs back for the insurgents, officials say.
 In Nimruz Province, in southwest Afghanistan, the Taliban demanded that traffickers provide $4,000 a month and a Toyota Land Cruiser to support 10-man fighting units, according to United Nations officials. An Afghan official said Taliban forces were given five Land Cruisers for attacking the Afghan border police so traffickers could move drugs more easily.
 The Bush administration was reluctant to take on the drug issue even from the start of the war. Soon after the Sept. 11 attacks, military and intelligence analysts turned over to the Pentagon a list of targets linked to Al Qaeda -- and its Taliban hosts -- inside Afghanistan. It included military targets, as well as drug labs and warehouses, where the Taliban was believed to have stockpiled opium after banning poppy cultivation in 2001. 
 Destroying the government's principal source of revenue would help put the Taliban out of business, the analysts figured. 
 But when the air campaign over Afghanistan began, top military officials removed all drug-related targets, according to one analyst who attended meetings where the bombing raids were discussed. 
 After the Taliban collapsed in late 2001, farmers began to plant opium across the countryside. 
 Some warlords and commanders that the C.I.A. and military helped put in power -- including tribal figures who had been in exile in Pakistan and others in the American-backed Northern Alliance -- quickly began to enrich themselves through drug trafficking, several American officials say.
 ''At the time of our intervention, there wasn't an active drug trade going on,'' said Mr. Dobbins, the former State Department official. ''But some of the people we supported became involved and active as the drug trade took hold.'' American officials say that the postwar chaos left them with no choice but to work with militia leaders involved in drug dealing. 
 ''You've got to consider the time and the context,'' said Craig Chretien, a counternarcotics official at the United States Embassy in Kabul. ''D.E.A. wasn't here. There was no investigative arm to look into any of their activities of these people after whatever cooperation they gave the C.I.A.''
 Some Afghans do not share that view. ''The C.I.A. should have moved swiftly against those people,'' said the Afghan attorney general, Abdul Jabbar Sabit, arguing that ignoring the drug dealing encouraged lawlessness.
 Later, though, American officials in several agencies urged taking steps to curb opium cultivation and trafficking, and grew frustrated when nothing happened.
 Mr. Rumsfeld opposed any military involvement in counternarcotics operations, several American officials say. Aside from concerns about stirring up resentment by peasants or alienating Afghan officials, the Pentagon viewed fighting drugs as a dangerous diversion from fighting terrorism. 
 And with a war in Iraq already quietly under discussion, Mr. Rumsfeld and his commanders did not want to commit more forces to Afghanistan. 
 The Pentagon also argued that countering drugs had always been a law enforcement mission, not a military one. But in war-ravaged Afghanistan, without the assistance of American troops, it was virtually impossible for other agencies to work effectively. Seizing an Opportunity 
 The Pentagon's own counternarcotics office, though, was eager to take on the fight. Soon after the American-led invasion, Mr. Hollis, the former counternarcotics official, raised the matter with top military officials.
 ''The commanders said we don't do drugs, we're just killing terrorists,'' Mr. Hollis recalled. ''That showed a lack of understanding of the threat. I cared about going after the drug routes. If you could smuggle drugs, you could smuggle weapons and terrorists. It concerned me that if we didn't go after the drug trade then, we would lose a golden opportunity.'' 
 Later, when Mr. Hollis asked the Defense Intelligence Agency to assess the link between drugs and the Taliban, the agency refused to do so, he said. It was not until the fall of 2004, when both the United Nations and the C.I.A. issued stunning estimates of Afghan opium cultivation, that the White House expressed alarm about the issue. 
 That November, President Bush met for the first time with his top advisers to discuss the drug strategy. Colin L. Powell, then secretary of state, pushed for aggressive measures that had been used in Colombia -- aerial spraying, promoting alternative crops, singling out drug labs and disrupting drug shipments.
 Mr. Bush seemed willing to adopt the measures, saying he did not want to ''waste another American life on a ''narco-state,'' recalled Bobby Charles, a former State Department counternarcotics official who attended the session. But the president later backed off after lobbying by Mr. Rumsfeld and Zalmay Khalilzad, then the American ambassador in Kabul, according to Mr. Charles.
 A spokesman for Mr. Khalilzad, now the American ambassador to the United Nations, said he did not want to discuss his recommendations to the president. A Pentagon spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Rumsfeld's decisions, as did a spokesman for Mr. Rumsfeld.
 D.E.A. officials were also thwarted in their attempts to stem drug corruption. In 2005, D.E.A. agents and their Afghan counterparts found nine tons of opium in the office of Sher Muhammad Akhundzada, the governor of Helmand Province. 
 But the counternarcotics team was blocked from taking any action against the governor, who had close ties to American and British military, intelligence and diplomatic officials. Mr. Akhundzada, in a recent interview, said he was just storing opium that had been seized as contraband. Eventually, he was forced aside, though he now serves in the Afghan Senate.
 The Taliban offensive in the spring of 2006 finally forced military officials and civilian Pentagon officials to drop their opposition to fighting drugs. The resignation of Mr. Rumsfeld, along with prodding by some House Republicans, also contributed to what Mr. Chretien, the counternarcotics official, described as a ''sea change'' in attitude among defense officials.
 In Kabul, the D.E.A. is trying to move ahead, if only in small steps, like training the Afghan drug force. ''The Colombians are here to instill the heart of the lion,'' said Mr. Balbo, the D.E.A. official. But even that appears daunting.
 Recruits for the 125-member National Interdiction Unit lined up in sweatsuits one day in March. Supposedly a handpicked elite, they were a ragtag group as they stretched for their morning jog. Some were young, but many were older and out of shape. During the day, they had trouble keeping up with the Colombians. 
 ''They aren't used to working long hours, '' said Lieutenant Castaneda, the Colombian counternarcotics officer. Trying to be diplomatic, he added: ''I understand that there are cultural challenges that we have to deal with. They have a lot to learn.''
 Mr. Balbo counseled patience. Drug wars are long, he said, and there are no quick solutions.
 ''This is going to take 20 or 30 years,'' he said. ''D.E.A. has been in Thailand for 40 years. Here, we're in year two.''

HEADLINE: Inflation and Wages Show Slower Growth

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Businesses kept a lid on prices again last month, and wage gains were scant for most working Americans, signs consistent with an economy in the midst of a slowdown.
 In its monthly survey on prices for everything from cars to groceries, the Labor Department said yesterday that inflation decelerated in April.
The report was in line with the Federal Reserve's forecast that a cooling economy would eventually drag price increases down with it. And it showed that inflation was inching toward a level the central bank could accept. 
 Wall Street, emboldened by the prospect of an interest rate cut by the Fed, bid stock prices up but then gave back much of its early gains.
 Despite the market's confidence, inflation has yet to settle into a predictable pattern, and many economists have said an interest rate cut is still at least several months away.
 Consumer prices could shoot back up again -- a fact that became clear this week as the average cost of a gallon of gas hit $3.10 nationally. 
 And there is the risk that high energy prices will bleed into the prices of other consumer goods. But economists said that was unlikely to happen because incomes were not rising fast enough to give businesses the ability to raise prices much higher.
 ''On the one side you've got cost pressures, and on the other side you've got consumers who are losing real income,'' said Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Dresdner Kleinwort in New York. ''You might want to raise your prices, but you can't if people aren't willing to pay.''
 A separate report from the Labor Department yesterday showed that average weekly earnings for workers in nonmanagement jobs fell 0.5 percent in April when inflation was taken into account. Compared with a year earlier, weekly earnings rose just 0.9 percent, the slowest pace in eight months.
 The inflation report showed that the overall measure of consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in April after rising 0.6 percent in March. 
 The more closely watched core price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.2 percent after rising 0.1 percent in March.
 The annual data suggested a more moderate path for inflation. Core consumer prices rose 2.3 percent compared with last April -- the slowest annual pace in a year. 
 ''It's not quite low enough to fully satisfy the Fed,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Financial Services Group. ''It's a very slow process, but it appears the glacier is moving in the direction the Fed wants. This number, frankly, should make them a little less concerned.''
 The moderation of consumer prices last month was fairly broad based. Prices declined for motor vehicles, tobacco, personal computers and clothing. And while housing costs rose over all, the increase was unchanged from March. 
 Economists said that a deceleration in housing costs would be one essential factor in keeping core inflation down -- and the Fed pacified. Rents increased just 0.2 percent in April and have been rising less rapidly in recent months.
 ''The question that raises is whether the big cyclical downturn in the housing industry is finally cooling shelter costs,'' said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. With so many unsold homes on the market for rent, Mr. Mayland added, ''In principle, the housing downturn should lead to some cooling.''
 The cost of food, medical care and gasoline kept inflation elevated last month. Gas prices jumped 4.7 percent last month, compared with March's rise of 10.6 percent. Medical care prices increased 0.4 percent, from a 0.1 percent rise in March. And staying in the hospital got more expensive, with hospital service prices climbing 0.8 percent compared with 0.4 percent in March.
 Some experts took the report as a sign that inflation had turned a corner. April was the third consecutive month that the core rate did not increase compared with a year earlier. ''We're down to 2.3 percent,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''I think that's pretty convincing evidence that the worst of inflation is behind us.''
 Even so, the Fed will probably not be persuaded in the short term. 
 ''For the time being, they look disinclined to ease policy until it is clearer just what the underlying trend rate of core inflation is doing,'' Rob Carnell, an economist with ING Financial Markets, said in a research report.

HEADLINE: Good Medicine, Under Attack

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Curing the System,'' by Atul Gawande (column, May 10):
 There is even a simpler system than the Massachusetts-style reform discussed by Dr. Gawande. That proposal introduces economic burdens for the new system while maintaining those of the old. 
Like the Clinton proposals and the Medicare drug program, there is an incorrect assumption that we must maintain involvement of private insurance companies, when they are really a core part of the problem with their added cost infrastructure and limits on coverage and benefits. 
 We have seen how to provide good medical care to our elderly: Medicare. All we need to do is extend it in batches that can be swallowed and digested. One way is to extend it downward in slices -- include 55-to-65-year-olds. Another is to cover children and maintain the coverage as they age until everyone is covered, as discussed in the column.
 Our goal should be the health of the nation and not of the insurance companies. Richard Margolese, M.D. Montreal, May 10, 2007 The writer, a professor of surgical oncology at the Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, was president of the National Cancer Institute of Canada, 1990-92. To the Editor: 
 Re ''Bad Medicine, Sneaking In'' (column, May 12):
 As a practicing anesthesiologist for the last 32 years, I am horrified by the grave issues raised by Atul Gawande. Anesthetics, whether injected or inhaled, are potent drugs that must meet accurate specifications. If those agents are not precisely what I believe them to be, cardiac arrest, organ damage or paralysis are potential calamities for the most routine of surgical procedures.
 Indeed, a tainted anesthetic never comes to mind when discussing potential risks with patients. 
 In the United States, tens of thousands of patients are at risk every single day, and it is thus obvious that government oversight of imported drugs and medical materials is just as important as securing the borders from potential terror attacks. Fikry B. Salib, M.D. Stamford, Conn., May 13, 2007 To the Editor:
 In ''Bad Medicine, Sneaking In,'' Atul Gawande explores the frightening problem of counterfeit medications and medical supplies. This is one of many aspects of patient care over which practicing physicians have no control. 
 I would retitle his column ''Good Medicine, Sneaking In'' because that which he can control -- how he offers support to a patient in whom he unknowingly placed a fake mesh -- is done with such honesty and empathy. 
 ''We then considered what to do,'' he writes. This is good medicine, and this is the take-home message for me. Bob Friedlander, M.D. Hopkinton, N.H., May 13, 2007

HEADLINE: Cavalier Seeks Players' Support for Darfur

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, May 15 

 BODY:
Ira Newble was not politically active until he read about Eric Reeves. Reeves was not a fan of professional basketball until he received a flurry of e-mail messages from Newble.
 But Reeves, a 57-year-old English professor at Smith College in Massachusetts, is now rooting hard for the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Newble, a Cavs reserve, is now pushing hard to advance Reeves's humanitarian cause.
 Their common ground is Darfur, the region of Sudan where an armed conflict has caused the death of an estimated 500,000 civilians and the displacement of 2.5 million others. It has been called genocide by a number of governments, including the United States, and by Reeves, a leading scholar on the conflict. 
 A passionate advocate for international intervention, Reeves was profiled by USA Today in March. Newble read the story while the Cavs were on the road, and was so moved that he reached out to Reeves.
 ''There's innocent people dying, and it's just a tragedy to stand back and let them do what they're doing,'' Newble said.
 So Newble chose to act. He absorbed as much information as he could find on the Internet. He downloaded fact sheets and articles, made printouts and put copies in every teammate's locker. 
 The result is a letter, signed by Newble and most of his teammates and released last week, that takes aim at China, which supplies the Sudanese government with money and weapons. China, in turn, is a major importer of Sudan's oil.
 The letter reads in part, ''We, as basketball players in the N.B.A. and as potential athletes in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, cannot look on with indifference to the massive human suffering and destruction that continue in the Darfur region of Sudan.'' It concludes with a plea to the Chinese government ''to use all available diplomatic resources and economic pressure to end the agony of Darfur, and to secure access for U.N. peace support personnel.''
 The letter has not been signed by the star LeBron James but has been endorsed by most of the Cavaliers' roster, including the starters Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes, Sasha Pavlovic and Zydrunas Ilgauskas. Reeves said this simple gesture could be the start of something much greater.
 ''This is the catalyst that's going to stimulate within the sports world a phenomenal response, and an international response to the realities in Darfur, which the world has allowed,'' Reeves said in a telephone interview. ''This is the fifth year of genocidal destruction. It's unconscionable that the international community has allowed this to continue for so long.''
 Newble is reaching out to as many of the N.B.A.'s 400-plus players as he can. His agent, Steve Kauffman, has spread the word through his peers. Kauffman also plans to contact the players unions of the National Football League and Major League Baseball to enlist their support.
 Reeves envisions the movement spreading across the athletic spectrum. Advocates have reached out to Muhammad Ali, perhaps the most famous athlete-activist, and are optimistic that he will join their cause.
 Reeves and others say China holds the key to improving the situation in Darfur. They are highlighting Beijing's role as the host of the 2008 Olympic Games, but are not calling for a boycott.
 Newble, a seven-year N.B.A. journeyman playing for his third team, is probably unknown to most basketball fans. He is not in the Cavaliers' regular rotation and has made only a token appearance in their Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Nets.
 Newble will probably have little impact on the series, which Cleveland leads, 3-1. But the longer the Cavaliers play, the more chances Newble has to recruit players to his cause and to give interviews on Darfur, which is why Reeves finds himself rooting for Cleveland.
 In the Cavaliers' locker room, Newble -- who idolized Ali as a child -- is known for his outspokenness, his intellect and his keen interest in world affairs.
 ''He's a very caring person and he's very educated, very knowledgeable about a lot of different things,'' his teammate Damon Jones said.
 The campaign is straightforward and relatively restrained, but is potentially awkward for the N.B.A. Last week, Commissioner David Stern hinted at operating a league in China and designated the Cavaliers' James as the N.B.A.'s ambassador. The players union just announced its own partnership with a Chinese corporation.
 Stern declined to address Newble's letter specifically but said through a spokeswoman, ''We respect our players' rights to express their views on important public issues.'' The players union issued a statement stressing that it was doing business with a Chinese corporation, not the Chinese government, adding, ''The problems and issues in the Sudan and Darfur are extraordinarily complex and nuanced.''
 Only three of Newble's teammates did not sign the letter, and two of them -- James and Jones -- have business ties to China. (The third player, David Wesley, is away from the team tending to family matters.)
 James, one of the N.B.A.'s most marketed stars, has a $90 million endorsement contract with Nike, which has extensive dealings in China. Jones has an endorsement deal with Li Ning, a shoe company in China.
 ''It's basically not having enough information,'' James said of his decision not to sign the letter.
 Jones said of the letter, ''I can't comment about that.''
 Newble considers the impact that a major N.B.A. star -- perhaps Shaquille O'Neal, Dwyane Wade or Carmelo Anthony -- could have on the Darfur campaign. He says he understands that some will be reluctant to risk their names and business opportunities.
 ''But at the end of the day,'' he said, ''if you're doing something good, it's all going to come back to you.''

HEADLINE: Dow Inches Up to a Record As Broader Measures Sag

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street gave up a huge advance and closed mixed yesterday after an unimpressive snapshot of the housing market unsettled investors. The Dow Jones industrial average, which passed 13,400 early in the session, slipped back but still eked out a record close, its 22nd this year.
 Investors bought enthusiastically after a tame reading on inflation, but reversed course after the National Association of Home Builders said its housing index dropped to 30 in May, from 33 in April, indicating a deteriorating housing outlook. 
The day's movement followed the recent pattern of blue-chip stocks' performing better than their smaller counterparts.
 ''We've got a real dichotomy going on here,'' said Stephen J. Massocca, president of Pacific Growth Equities. ''Big corporate America, the staid and stodgy companies, are doing well. They're going up today. Stocks that are riskier, stocks that are smaller, stocks in the emerging market vein or technology vein, those are being sold.''
 The Dow had surged more than 130 points by midday after the inflation data raised hopes that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates later this year. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent after rising 0.6 percent in March, while core prices, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent March gain.
 The Dow rose 37.06 points, to 13,383.84, after rising to a new trading high of 13,481.60.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.96 points, to 1,501.19. The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index lost 21.15 points, closing at 2,525.29. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.15 points, to 814.18.
 Investors have been driven by optimism that the Fed is done with its campaign of rate increases, and that it will soon start lowering rates. Still, when new data reminds them of the fragility of the housing markets, they tend to retrench, as they did yesterday.
 Concerns also lingered in the commodities market about refinery problems and uncertainties over whether United States gasoline inventories can meet summer driving demand. A barrel of light crude rose 71 cents, to $63.17, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Investors were mostly undeterred by disappointing first-quarter results from two Dow components, Home Depot and Wal-Mart Stores. Both companies are considered to be barometers of consumer spending, and weaker sales were interpreted as another sign of a slowing economy that could also motivate the Fed to cut rates.
 Home Depot, the nation's largest home improvement chain, posted lower quarterly profit as a sluggish housing market dented sales. Sales at stores open at least a year, an important measure of how retailers fared, slumped 7.6 percent.
 Wal-Mart Stores missed Wall Street projections and warned that second-quarter results might be disappointing. Last week, it reported April same-store sales were the weakest in its history for April.
 Shares of Wal-Mart fell 22 cents, to $47.62, while Home Depot shed 71 cents, to $38.30. The second-largest home improvement chain, Lowe's, fell 10 cents, to $30.89.
 The Reuters Group agreed yesterday to a $17.2 billion takeover by the Thomson Corporation that would create the world's largest financial data and news provider, ahead of Bloomberg L.P. Shares of Reuters rose $2.72, to $74.34; Thomson gained 16 cents, to $42.16.
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about three to two on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.64 billion shares, up from 1.39 billion on Monday.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, to 98 13/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.70 percent, from 4.69 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Price: 99.637 High Rate: 4.665 Coupon Yield: 4.760 Low Rate: 4.620 Median Rate: 4.655 Total applied for: $40,096,067 Accepted: $20,066,822 Noncompetitive: $372,132 The four-week bills mature June 14, 2007.

HEADLINE: Handling House Calls in a Managed-Care World

BYLINE: By DEE GILL

 BODY:
THE day when doctors treated patients at home disappeared decades ago in most of America as house calls gave way to more cost-effective office visits. But a small company that devised a way to charge for doctors' house calls could encourage a return to the practice -- not just as a service for the rich, but as the most economical way for Medicare and private insurers to care for their frailest patients. 
 Care Level Management, a company based in Woodland Hills, Calif., that employs about 100 doctors in five states, offers medical service to 13,500 chronically ill patients. It pairs each patient with a doctor who provides a cellphone number and urges the patient to call for a home checkup at the first sign of trouble.
Medicare and private insurers pick up Care Level's bill (the patient is usually charged a co-payment as well). Care Level takes on the 2 percent to 5 percent of the insurers' patients who have amassed the highest medical bills. Its average patient is 76, battling 11 chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension and congestive heart failure, and has been hospitalized often. 
 Care Level says that its house calls save insurers money by drastically reducing emergency room visits and hospitalizations. In fact, it guarantees savings.
 For example, in a three-year trial Care Level is conducting with the federal government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Medicare pays Care Level a monthly case rate and a fee per visit to care for up to 25,000 patients in Texas, California and Florida. But Care Level must return the money unless net costs for its patients are at least 5 percent lower than the costs for patients in a control group. The company splits any saving above 5 percent with Medicare.
 The company has used a similar payment structure to charge private insurers, although most of its private customers have switched to flat fees. Care Level says that independent audits show that it has reduced hospital admissions for private-insurer patients by 60 percent on average, for a net cost saving to clients of about 30 percent. 
 Medicare will not release data about the trial until the numbers are crunched when it ends in August 2008. Officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services do say that Care Level's patients and families often call Medicare offices to praise the program, sometimes crying in gratitude. ''This personal visiting physician service, with 24-hour access to doctors, has some real promise for reducing costs,'' said James Flick, the Medicare administer for the region that includes California.
 Insurers have long understood that a tiny percentage of customers spend most of the insurers' money, Mr. Flick explained. The top 2 percent of Medicare consumers spend about 25 percent of Medicare's annual budget, he said. The top 5 percent -- about two million people and growing -- spend 43 percent of the budget. A program that reduces care costs for this population can strikingly reduce the system's overall costs, he said. 
 Doctors who work in other house-call programs say that Care Level's model can invigorate their fledgling industry, which has struggled to find profits. 
 ''We absolutely believe this is one of the best ideas for Medicare reform that's around,'' said Constance Row, executive director of the American Academy of Home Care Physicians. 
 The academy includes doctors from medical centers that have house-call programs, as well as those in small practices. The organization is lobbying Congress for permission to bill Medicare and Medicaid using a Care Level-type model that includes monthly rates, rather than paying for each visit.
 Dr. Henri Becker developed the model for Care Level in 1995, when he was the medical director of the Huntington Provider Group in Pasadena, Calif. Dr. Becker found he could cut repeat hospital admissions by treating the sickest patients at their homes, before their medical problems grew dire. In 2001, he teamed with Raouf Khalil, an entrepreneur who had sold a successful home-infusion business, to start the company. 
 Care Level has grown to about $65 million in annual revenue with 350 employees in California, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida. Mr. Khalil, the chief executive, would not disclose income amounts, but said the company was profitable. About 85 percent of its patients are in the Medicare trial, with the rest coming from commercial insurers. 
 At WellPoint, the nation's largest health insurer, Josh Valdez, the management executive for the Pacific zone, is one of Care Level's most ardent fans. Care Level takes care of 300 of WellPoint's chronically ill California patients under 65. 
 Mr. Valdez was regional director for the federal Department of Health and Human Services in 2002 when he first heard of Care Level. He was also fielding daily calls from his sick father at home, who had diabetes, hepatitis C and other health problems. He said that sorting out his father's doctor appointments, medications and medical emergencies ''was just exhausting.''
 He says that Care Level saves WellPoint a lot of money, although he was not specific. He says he is more impressed with the care the company gives.
 ''You could see that they fell in love with their doctors,'' he said of patients, recalling home visits he attended with a company doctor. ''In 21 years in health care policy, I had never seen that.'' 
 One Care Level doctor is Richard Powell, who left his private practice in Tampa, Fla., after nine years. With Care Level he sees five or six patients a day. Despite the 24-hour access, he says, they rarely call him in the middle of the night. (The average salary for Care Level doctors is $175,000; they also have minimum paperwork.) 
 In Sanford, Fla., Mary Garland, 75, welcomed Dr. Powell into her home with a hug. In past years, Mrs. Garland said, she had waited in emergency rooms to get treatment for her lung and orthopedic problems. But the last time she had trouble breathing, she called Dr. Powell, who treated her at home several times over a week.
 She says she called 911 when she fell in April, but after paramedics stanched the bleeding, she sent them away and called her doctor's cellphone. He was there two hours later, she said. 
 If Mrs. Garland needs intravenous antibiotics or an X-ray, Dr. Powell can call a Care Level nurse to arrange it. Mrs. Garland has not been to the hospital since joining the program in August.
 A few teaching hospitals have also found they can make chronically sick patients healthier and reduce their costs by giving them 24-hour access to doctors at home. But the programs lose money.
 ''I estimate we save Medicare $1 million a year per physician in reduced hospitalizations, nursing home stays, emergency room visits, etc.,'' said Dr. George Taler, a co-director of the Medical House Call Program at the Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. His two teams, each with a doctor, a nurse practitioner and other staff, treat about 650 patients. ''Yet we are losing $125,000 per physician per year,'' he said.
 Dr. Jeremy Boal, executive director of Mount Sinai Hospital's 800-patient Visiting Doctors Program, said government reimbursements cover less than a third of costs. Medicaid payments for services ''barely cover the taxi ride to get there,'' he said. 
 The payment problem has put a damper on reviving house-call practices, said Ms. Row of the Academy of Home Care Physicians. The number of house calls doctors billed to Medicare rose about 36 percent from 2000 to 2004, but she says that it has since leveled off, and that many of these practices are struggling. 
 Dr. Roberta Miller has run a home-visit practice for about 500 patients in the Albany area with her husband and another partner since 1998. She sees little chance for profits under Medicare's payment plan. Overhead costs are kept low, she said, ''but we can't see a patient every 15 minutes.''

HEADLINE: Your Ad Here

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
THE Internet search engine is an indispensable tool of modern life and an advertising gold mine for Google, the favorite first stop on the Web. 
 But searching accounts for only about 5 percent of the time people spend online; the other 95 percent is spent on the wider Web, where a different advertising landscape looms. Instead of the short text ads that appear on a Google results page after a search, visitors often find display ads that are the Internet's equivalents of glossy magazine ads or television commercials. These are typically the province of brand advertisers like Cadillac and Coke.
Until recently, however, it was impossible to tell whether these ads were in fact reaching their target audiences because no one had applied the computing tools and powerful mathematical analytics that were needed to link online display ads to specific markets. But that is changing, and a number of small companies are standing at the forefront of this transformation. 
 Indeed, many in the industry regard display advertising that can reach specific audiences as the next big online opportunity -- the postsearch wave, the Internet ad market 2.0. 
 ''The promise is to be able to measure the reach and effectiveness of brand advertising as never before,'' said Rich LeFurgy, a principal at Archer Advisors, a digital-advertising consultant. ''If that happens, it will really accelerate the migration of brand advertisers online.'' 
 The big Web portals like Yahoo, AOL and Microsoft are working on it, trying to tease out which display ads should be shown and to whom. Last month, when Google paid $3.1 billion for DoubleClick, which specializes in software for display ads and has close relationships with Web publishers and advertisers, it declared that display ads would be crucial to its future strategy. 
 But besides the giant portals, there are scores of small, innovative companies -- typically venture-backed start-ups -- that are behind the revolution on Madison Avenue. 
 Industry analysts estimate that there are about 200 such companies. Many call themselves ad networks, while others are referred to as ad exchanges or optimization services. The roster includes Revenue Science, Tacoda, Tribal Fusion, Rapt, AdECN and x+1. In one way or another, they are all trying to bring more effectiveness to the online display ad market. 
 ''There is so much money pouring into online advertising that there is a lot of opportunity for newer players,'' said Emily Riley, an analyst at Jupiter Research.
 These players are actually hybrids, possessing varying degrees of media smarts. They often operate thousands of miles apart, with the ad experts in New York and the quantitative analysts, or quants, as they are called, on the West Coast. Together, they are changing the nature of display advertising on the Web. 
 In the old days of the dot-com era, online ads were simple billboards plastered onto a Web site in the hope that visitors would notice them if not exactly read them. But faster and cheaper computing and sophisticated software algorithms are making advertising more intelligent and measurable. The quants have become a force in the advertising industry, much as they became a force on Wall Street starting in the 1970s and 80s.
 The process of delivering relevant search-based ads is comparatively easy -- a typed search term sets off related text ads, which appear next to the results, exposing consumers to sundry, generally relevant, advertisers.
 Brand advertising, however, starts higher up on the marketing food chain; it is meant to foster brand and product awareness as well as purchases. The goal is to deliver select audiences -- of thousands, even millions -- to mass marketers. 
 The new science of online display advertising involves a potent mix of behavioral targeting, social networking algorithms, predictive economics, pricing optimization and other mathematical strategies. 
 These geeky tools are used to address the marketer's quandary, well articulated by John Wanamaker, the 19th-century Philadelphia merchant who said that half the money he spent on advertising was wasted, but he didn't know which half.
 ''We're trying to not only tell which half of ads don't work, but we're not going to buy that half,'' said Toby Gabriner, chief executive of x + 1, an ad optimization service in New York. 
 The ideal, Mr. Gabriner said, is to advertise only to prime customers. ''Imagine an environment where the company that makes dentures and denture products only advertises to people who don't have teeth,'' he said.
 The most common technique for identifying an audience is called behavioral targeting, which tracks, analyzes and predicts online behavior based on where you (actually your browser software) have gone before on the Internet. The ad targeters cull vast quantities of Web-viewing behavior and other data, like the speed of your Internet connection, the time of day you visited a site, whether it was done from work or home and even associated ZIP codes. 
 These defined audience clusters consist of people who share characteristics based on their behavior on the Internet, not personal information like names, ages, home addresses or telephone numbers. So, for example, a person who recently visited sports and auto Web sites and read global warming articles on news sites would most likely turn out to be an 18- to 45-year-old male. An algorithm would then determine that he would be a good candidate for an ad about Toyota's hybrid-electric Prius. Advertisers are willing to pay much higher rates to reach such screened audiences. 
 ''The technology finds the best virtual person for an advertiser and that person's behavioral friends -- in the thousands or millions,'' said Bill Gossman, chief executive of Revenue Science, a behavioral targeting company in New York whose payroll has doubled to 70 employees in the last year. 
 The ads are not personalized electronic marketing, however, a prospect that was popularized in the movie ''Minority Report,'' in which virtual advertisements on the street addressed potential customers by name. But targeting companies do place small software programs, called cookies, on people's personal computers to monitor their movements on the Web, making privacy advocates uneasy. 
 Tacoda is an ad network that specializes in behavioral targeting. Its network has 125 million individuals (PCs with the Tacoda cookie). Its software tags are also on 4,000 Web sites; and it collects nine billion data items a day. For every dollar it collects from an advertiser, Tacoda keeps 40 cents, gives 40 cents, as a broker, to the Web publisher displaying the ad and distributes 20 cents to the sites providing targeted data.
 Tacoda, which is based in New York, works closely with Web sites at several large media companies, including ABC, NBC, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, as well as consumer-product companies and ad agencies. Computing and esoteric mathematics play a role in advertising on the Internet, but so do brand managers, publishing salespeople and ad strategists, said Curt Viebranz, chief executive of Tacoda and a former Time Warner executive. ''There's a lot here that transcends algorithms,'' he said.
 But automated efficiency is the online advantage. Right Media, for example, wanted to bring the supereffectiveness of the stock market to online display advertising. 
 The company was founded in 2003 by Mike Walrath, a former fitness manager at a New York Sports Club in Stamford, Conn., who went to work for DoubleClick in 1999. He experienced the dot-com boom and bust of the Internet ad business at DoubleClick, which he called his business school. He started Right Media with many contacts, as well as the belief that the online ad business was riddled with inefficiency. 
 The company's first office was a reconverted supply closet at x+1, the optimization service. Right Media provided services for Web advertisers, like AOL, by poring through their data to determine where their ads were most effective. Working on Excel spreadsheets, Mr. Walrath and a few employees performed endless calculations, manual labor by today's standards. 
 ''It was me and a couple of quants in a windowless room and a willingness to stay up all night,'' he said.
 In 2005, Mr. Walrath opened the Right Media Exchange, in which advertisers and publishers buy and sell online ad placements in real time through auctions, with Right Media's optimization technology predicting where the ads will work best. The exchange built gradually but really took off in the last year, handling tens of thousands of auctions in fractions of a second. 
 Its employment has more than doubled in the last year to 220, to include computer scientists and ad veterans. Last year, its customers transacted $150 million in deals on the exchange, and the company collected an average fee of 7.5 percent, or about $11 million for the year. Mr. Walrath predicted that the volume would more than triple this year. 
 Right Media's rapid growth attracted Yahoo, which paid $40 million for a 20 percent stake last fall. Two weeks ago, Yahoo agreed to pay $680 million for the other 80 percent. An industry consultant put Mr. Walrath's share at about $200 million. (Mr. Walrath, 32, would not confirm this.) 
 In an interview recently, he said: ''Are we pleased? Absolutely. But we haven't accomplished what we set out to do, which is to bring more efficiency and rationality to these markets. I'll be here for a long time.''
 Joe Zawadzki was the person who let Mr. Walrath set up shop in the spare closet. At the time, Mr. Zawadzki was president of Poindexter Systems, which evolved into x+1. 
 In the early days, he said, he almost joined Mr. Walrath at Right Media, but decided against it. Mr. Zawadzki, 32, left x+1 last year. 
 He is planning another online-ad venture. While he is tight-lipped about it, he adds, ''There's still plenty of opportunity out there.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Soccer: The Right Coach Is Right Here

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
With national soccer coaches, the job is always interim. Coaches can win the World Cup and still turn back the job, weary of the entire country camping on their doorstep, critiquing their choice of midfielders.
 Bob Bradley was the interim coach of the United States from last December until today, when he will be given the official title. The alternate path that seemed so desirable last fall -- hiring a coach from the top level in Europe or Latin America -- faded away. Bradley earned this job by never acting like an interim coach, like somebody afraid for his job.
Oh, yes, and the United States won three international matches and drew one, which is why the national federation is doing right by Bradley today during a news conference in New York. 
 ''It wasn't the input -- it was the output,'' said Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, who confirmed the decision last night.
 Now it begins for Bradley, age 49, originally from Essex Fells, N.J., and Princeton University, who had the best coaching record in the 11-year history of Major League Soccer. Now he will be expected to compete against the big boys in the World Cup, with better results than his friend Bruce Arena was able to manage last June.
 Squeezed by an unfavorable draw, Arena's team struggled against a tough field in Germany, as millions of nouveau fans back home took advantage of the six-hour time difference and sat in sports bars at midday and loudly second-guessed Arena and players like Landon Donovan and Kasey Keller and some unlucky defenders. 
 Bitterness and complaints! Advice and second-guessing! Suddenly, America was acting like a real soccer nation, screaming for Arena to get DaMarcus Beasley back to the left side and pack in the defenses against the burly Czechs, and, while he was at it, to stop using Mariano Rivera for more than one inning of relief. 
 The Americans lost to the Czechs, played a gallant, blood-and-grass-stains draw against Italy -- which would merely win the World Cup -- and lost to Ghana, and Arena's job became terminally interim.
 At first the common wisdom was that America, to get to the next step, had to hire a foreign coach who knew how world-level soccer was conducted yet could also address the American mentality, whatever that is. There was really only one of those -- Jurgen Klinsmann, the touchy-feely coach who had just coached Germany to a glorious third place. 
 Klinsi, who lives in Southern California and speaks English better than a lot of citizens, was a natural. But he didn't want the job badly enough to put up with the bureaucratic demands of a gigantic nation with a thousand and one soccer interests, so Gulati, an economics professor at Columbia University, appointed Bradley as the interim coach.
 ''Quite a long time ago, I saw Bob as the national team coach,'' Gulati said yesterday. ''It was just a matter of when.''
 It is possible that Klinsmann had been such an obvious choice that even English-speaking Europeans like Carlos Queiroz and Gerard Houllier seemed totally foreign by comparison. Americans are -- as somebody may have noticed -- different. Some Yanks have thrived in the hard-bitten environment of Europe, where talented reserves will take out a teammate during an obscure midweek scrimmage to earn a promotion. But even the most resourceful of Yanks like to come home and hear American being spoken. Bradley had already shown his skill in Chicago, in New York and in one year with a new franchise, Chivas, in Los Angeles. 
 ''He's a great coach,'' Jonathan Bornstein, 22, who thrived under Bradley at Chivas last season, told The Associated Press recently. ''He has this knack of really taking a group of guys and bringing them together as one.''
 Bornstein added that he saw the same process with the new national team: ''In the first meeting, he was telling us how we've got to band together. His style is great. He's a great guy, someone I really look up to.'' 
 Gulati undoubtedly knows that the players were comfortable with Bradley, even when Bradley tightened up some of the internal procedures like team meals and togetherness during training sessions. 
 Bradley also impressed Gulati right away by releasing several key players to their clubs in Europe rather than forcing them to play exhibitions against Ecuador and Mexico. Gulati was also impressed with Bradley's choice of an assistant, the Polish-born Peter Nowak, whom Gulati called ''a strong personality.'' 
 ''We had the absolute luxury of time,'' Gulati said yesterday. ''But now we will have more games by the end of July than we have had in a decade.''
 The first game under Bradley will be an exhibition against China on June 2, followed by two important tournaments, the Concacaf Gold Cup, starting June 7, and the Copa America, beginning July 28.
 The United States, which has qualified for five consecutive World Cups, will be expected to qualify for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. At that point, Bob Bradley's job will become truly temporary all over again.

HEADLINE: In China, It's Not Always Clear for Whom the Booth Tolls

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: CHEN VILLAGE, China 

 BODY:
Few motorists in any country brighten at the sight of tollbooths ahead. In China, which is building more toll roads than any other country in the world, legions of drivers are trying almost anything to avoid them.
 In Chongqing, a sprawling municipality in central China, so many owners of private cars and trucks are using fraudulent toll-exempt military plates that one toll highway has estimated its annual losses at roughly 10 million yuan, or $1.2 million.
 In March a driver outfitted his vehicle like an ambulance, with flashing lights and an emergency response phone number painted on the side. He then raced through a highway tollbooth as if rushing to a hospital, until the police arrested him. 
 For centuries, commoner and collector have waged a volatile contest in China that has occasionally toppled dynasties but never quite been resolved. Leaders of the current dynasty, the Communist Party, are worried enough about angry peasants that they lifted the centuries-old agriculture tax as a populist gesture. 
 Tolls are another matter. By 2020, if all goes as planned, China will have completed almost 53,000 miles of expressways, a network roughly equivalent to the Interstate System in the United States. China considers expressways crucial to maintaining its economic growth and developing its western and interior provinces. 
 But the cost is so exorbitant that China is financing much of the system with tolls that are, by Chinese standards, pricey. 
 Two people who should know are Mr. Wang and Mr. Gu. The two men -- who were nervous about divulging their first names to a snooping foreigner -- are posted at a dingy intersection in this farming village in Hebei Province. 
 Not far away is a highway tollbooth. Every day cars and heavy trucks, as steady and determined as a trail of ants, try to skip the toll by cutting through the village on a narrow road. 
 Mr. Wang, 65, and Mr. Gu, 58, try to send them back. They say the tollbooth operator is paying the village a monthly fee to help crack down on toll jumpers. For its part the village is trying to stop heavy trucks from ruining its roads. The two men regulate traffic with a long, crooked stick that goes up and down like a crude crossing barrier. 
 Mr. Gu does the talking. Mr. Wang wields the stick.
 ''Can I get through?'' one motorist asked on a recent afternoon as other cars waited. 
 ''No,'' Mr. Gu replied. Only local people are allowed to pass.
 ''Is there any other way around the toll?'' the driver asked, smiling. ''Come on, let me through.''
 Toll road building has been so feverish in China that roughly 25,000 miles of toll expressways were built from 1990 to 2005, according to the World Bank. At the same time, the country has been adding millions of new cars to the roads every year, a seemingly perfect combination of vehicles and toll roads. But Chinese are famous economizers, and beyond that, tolls are expensive compared with income levels.
 A recent World Bank report on China's highway construction program found that the toll roads were charging roughly the same as the German toll system -- about 25 cents a mile for trucks -- despite far lower incomes in China. 
 It costs $1.30 to go from the Beijing airport to the city, and about $5 for the roughly 25-mile trip from the capital's northeastern suburbs to the Great Wall. Not all that much for a Westerner, but a lot here, where an average farmer -- most of whom cannot afford cars -- makes less than $400 a year and urban factory workers can average roughly $1,000 or perhaps a bit more.
 ''The price of the tolls is an issue,'' said Greg Wood, a consultant who worked on the World Bank report. Mr. Wood said China needed to ensure that prices did not inhibit traffic from growing to the levels necessary to pay off the debt on the roads.
 As toll roads have expanded, many areas nearby have become toll escape zones. Mr. Wood said some private companies investing in toll roads were demanding the right to collect tolls on adjacent roads as one means of curbing toll jumpers. On the outskirts of Beijing it is common to see lines of trucks stretching for several miles along a narrow two-lane highway as they try to avoid the toll on the faster highway nearby. 
 Chen Village is on the northwestern outskirts of the city of Shijiazhuang, the gritty capital of Hebei Province. In recent years, tolls have blossomed on roads and bridges around the city. Public reaction has not been joyous. A group of local Communist Party representatives circulated an angry petition last year after higher authorities allowed a Hong Kong investor to open a tollbooth in exchange for fixing a bridge.
 One local newspaper, sympathetic to the petitioners, published an in-depth report under the headline ''This Toll Is Tyranny.''
 Near Chen Village, the Shigang Highway opened several years ago with a tollbooth that charged cars $1.30. Trucks are charged about twice as much. Motorists quickly began exiting before the tollbooth and detouring through the village, which had recently pooled donations from farmers to pave local roads.
 Miao Penghu, the head of the village, said the village had responded by opening its own unofficial toll station -- the post currently overseen by Mr. Wang and Mr. Gu -- to pay for the damage to roads by heavy trucks. But such unsanctioned tollbooths were outlawed a few years ago. Mr. Miao said that the village no longer collected tolls but that it was under contract with the Shigang Highway's managers to block traffic.
 ''They are paying us, and by us turning the trucks around, they are making money, too,'' Mr. Miao said. ''It's a win-win situation.''
 Or not. 
 Ask the driver of small green taxi from Shijiazhuang who approached Mr. Wang and Mr. Gu. 
 ''You can't pass through,'' Mr. Gu announced.
 The taxi window was rolled down, and an arm emerged with the universal lubricant of rural Chinese society: an offer of free cigarettes.
 ''No, no cigarettes,'' Mr. Gu said. ''Look at our road. It is all torn up.''
 ''But it is the trucks, not me,'' the driver pleaded before finally speeding away in the opposite direction. Mr. Gu and Mr. Wang insist that deterrence is their sole purpose. Money no longer changes hands, they say. 
 But one villager said that while the inspection point did send back some trucks, it also allowed some cars to pass for a small fee.
 ''This is not a tollbooth,'' Mr. Gu protested. ''It is not a tollbooth!''
 A city taxi driver who regularly passes through the village laughed at such a notion. He said the village fee was usually 25 cents or a bit more. He avoids it because he speaks the local dialect and can pass as a resident. 
 ''In China,'' the driver said, ''whoever builds the road can collect tolls.''

HEADLINE: Death-Squad Scandal Circles Closer to Colombia's President

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Jenny Carolina Gonzalez contributed reporting from Medellin.

DATELINE: CALI, Colombia, May 15 

 BODY:
President Alvaro Uribe, the Bush administration's closest ally in Latin America, faces an intensifying scandal after a jailed former commander of paramilitary death squads testified Tuesday that Mr. Uribe's defense minister had tried to plot with the outlawed private militias to upset the rule of a former president.
 Speaking at a closed court hearing in Medellin, Salvatore Mancuso, the former paramilitary warlord, said Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos had met with paramilitary leaders in the mid-1990s to discuss efforts to destabilize the president at the time, Ernesto Samper, according to judicial officials. 
 Mr. Mancuso also said that Vice President Francisco Santos had met with paramilitary leaders in 1997 to discuss taking their operations to the capital, Bogota. 
 A spokesman for the Defense Ministry said the minister would not comment. The spokesman said a meeting did take place in which Mr. Santos, the defense minister, discussed an effort to reach a peace plan between two guerrilla groups and the paramilitaries. 
 The vice president, who was traveling outside the country, was not immediately available for comment. 
 Mr. Uribe went on national television on Tuesday night, but did not address the allegations. 
 These revelations followed the disclosure this week of an illegal domestic spying program by the national police force and additional arrests of high-ranking political allies of Mr. Uribe on charges of ties to the paramilitaries.
 The scandals also come as Mr. Uribe tries to win Congressional support in Washington for a trade agreement and the disbursement of American counterinsurgency and antinarcotics aid. Mr. Uribe, though popular in Colombia, faces growing scrutiny in the United States Congress.
 ''This is going to hurt,'' said Michael Shifter, vice president for policy for the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. ''As much as Colombia's government tries to make the case that the system is working, what dominates perception is that there's a lot of rot.''
 Mr. Uribe tried to contain the newest scandal by forcing 12 generals in the national police to resign Monday over illegal wiretaps of political opponents, government officials and journalists.
 Among those whose phones were tapped was Carlos Gaviria, an opposition leader who ran for president against Mr. Uribe last year. ''This cannot happen under a democratic government,'' Mr. Gaviria said.
 The purge of the generals came after the newsmagazine Semana published transcripts of cellphone calls from imprisoned paramilitary leaders in which they orchestrated murders and cocaine deals. It was not clear whether these intercepted phone calls were part of the police surveillance program.
 Mr. Santos, the defense minister, said neither he nor Mr. Uribe knew of the police wiretapping operation. Still, the report has hurt the credibility of Mr. Uribe's government, already suffering from a perception of being soft on the paramilitaries.
 Mr. Uribe was elected to a second term last year after being credited with making the country's large cities safer and presiding over a growing economy. But the scandal over the paramilitary ties now threatens a growing number of legislators, business executives, military leaders and American corporations over their collaboration with the paramilitary death squads, which are classified as terrorist organizations by the United States State Department.
 The paramilitaries, which are largely demobilized but regrouping in some areas, committed some of the worst atrocities in a long internal war. Prosecutors ordered the arrest on Monday of five legislators for entering into a secret pact with the paramilitaries in 2001, bringing to 14 the total number of legislators implicated in such ties.

HEADLINE: Breaking Our Addiction to Oil

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Only Halfway There'' (column, May 13):
 Thomas L. Friedman says that none of the current initiatives regarding moving to alternative energy go far enough (for example, Senator Christopher J. Dodd's call for a ''corporate carbon tax'' and Senator Barack Obama's call for tougher fuel economy standards). I agree.
If we can allow our military to sacrifice their very lives and their families to be devastated caring for brain-damaged young men and women, can we not, as a society, make a most inconvenient sacrifice and ration gas, as we did in World War II? 
 The very inconvenience of such a move would generate serious dialogue and move this country to find the solutions to oil addiction quickly. 
 If we are at war, we should take wartime measures. Katherine Rose Ellicott City, Md., May 14, 2007 To the Editor:
 I recently studied policy options to achieve energy independence and a clean environment for a lecture at Stanford. The most effective option was a combination of an across-the-board floor price on all forms of energy at $45 a barrel, and regulatory reform so that, all things being economically equal, clean goes ahead of dirty. 
 Also helpful were ultra-fast permitting for ultra-clean projects; targeted federal research programs; incentives to sell power plants and heavy equipment while still in relatively good condition; and mandatory minimum renewable energy purchases by utilities.
 Thomas L. Friedman appropriately suggests an urgent need for a floor price on oil sold in the United States. This should be extended to all forms of energy so that all the alternatives can prosper. Bob Danziger Carmel, Calif., May 15, 2007 To the Editor: 
 Thomas L. Friedman is certainly correct when he says, ''You can't be serious about getting out of Iraq if you're not serious about getting off oil.'' I would suggest, however, that there are two related but more immediate things we must be serious about if we're going to be serious about getting out of Iraq.
 We must make it clear to the world, first, that we are committed to getting along without Iraqi oil; and, second, that we have no intention of maintaining a permanent military presence in Iraq.
 What puzzles me is why our politicians and presidential aspirants never talk about these two pieces of the picture. Perhaps it's because such talk would reveal too much about the real reasons we went to war in Iraq in the first place -- and why we are so reluctant to leave without accomplishing our mission. Roy G. Smith Denver, May 13, 2007 To the Editor: 
 Thomas L. Friedman wants us to ''radically reduce our dependence on oil.'' 
 The reality is that we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
 The ''radical'' remedy is that we need to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and along the outer continental shelf. The fact that we do not use our own natural resources, which would benefit us economically and strategically, is utterly perverse, and a testament to how we are held hostage by the environmental movement. 
 Efficient and economical alternative sources of energy will take time to develop. In the meantime, let's not foolishly ignore the oil under our feet. Thomas D. Cramer Ithaca, N.Y., May 13, 2007 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman writes that you can't be serious about exiting Iraq without getting off oil. In other words, the personal is political. Right on. I'm getting a converted electric car next month. Steve McCrea Fort Lauderdale, Fla. May 14, 2007 The writer is an editor of an advocacy Web site about vehicles converted to run on battery power.

HEADLINE: White House Picks General To Coordinate Its War Policy

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
The White House said Tuesday that President Bush ended his lengthy search for a so-called war czar to carry out Iraq and Afghanistan policy by offering the job to an active duty three-star Army general who said in his interview that he had been skeptical of the troop buildup in Iraq.
 Mr. Bush selected Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, currently the top operations officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He will retain his active military status and must be confirmed by the Senate, which approves new assignments for three- and four-star generals. 
''We needed to get the right concept, the right man -- or woman -- and we have,'' the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, who led the search, said in an interview on Tuesday evening. 
 If he is confirmed, General Lute would have the rank of assistant to the president and deputy national security adviser, and would report directly to the president. His job, which is part of a broader reorganization of the National Security Council staff responsible for Iraq and Afghanistan, would be to brief Mr. Bush every day on the two conflicts, and work with other government agencies -- including the Pentagon and the State Department -- to carry out policy.
 In a written statement, Mr. Bush called General Lute ''a tremendously accomplished military leader who understands war and government and knows how to get things done,'' adding that he had ''played an integral role in implementing combat operation plans in Iraq and Afghanistan.''
 Even before the White House had made the news public, war opponents were using the impending announcement to criticize the administration's Iraq policy. Americans Against Escalation in Iraq, an advocacy group, issued a statement citing a remark General Lute made in an interview with the Financial Times in August 2005, in which he argued for significant troop reductions. ''You simply have to back off and let the Iraqis step forward,'' the general said at the time. ''You have to undercut the perception of occupation in Iraq.''
 A spokesman said General Lute was not available for comment on Tuesday evening. Mr. Hadley said the general had expressed his doubts, but that he now supports the strategy.
 ''He said to me when he interviewed for this position, 'Now, you need to understand that I was skeptical of the surge,' '' Mr. Hadley recalled, using the administration term for the troop buildup in Iraq. He said that General Lute, who helped to develop the strategy, had raised questions about whether ''Iraqi security forces would step up and contribute what they were supposed to do,'' and whether the Iraqi government was committed to political reconciliation and providing economic resources.
 ''We developed a strategy that we thought answered those questions,'' Mr. Hadley said, adding, ''He's saying that he supports the strategy, very clearly supports the strategy.''
 The White House has spent more than a month searching for a high-profile general to fill what Mr. Hadley described as an ''implementation and execution manager'' for the conflicts. 
 The idea for the position has proved controversial. Some critics have said that Mr. Hadley was abandoning responsibility for Iraq and Afghanistan, while others cautioned against putting a military person in what has been a civilian role. The job was also difficult to fill, as several retired generals said they were not interested.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Hadley said that while he had spoken to a number of people about their interest and availability for the new position, no one had received a formal offer until General Lute met Monday with the president.

HEADLINE: Obama and Clinton Back Ending Iraq Combat by March 31

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton said for the first time on Tuesday that they would support legislation to curtail major combat operations in Iraq by March 31, 2008, cutting off financing for all but a limited mission of American forces.
 Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, two leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, made separate announcements on the eve of a largely symbolic Senate debate on using the power of the purse to end the war. For weeks, the two senators had declined to state their positions, but they issued statements after rivals -- and liberal groups -- criticized their silence. 
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, seeking to draw more attention to his presidential candidacy, began broadcasting advertisements on Tuesday in states with early primary elections, highlighting his support for the legislation. ''Unfortunately, my colleagues running for president have not joined me,'' he said. Hours later, at least two of his colleagues did.
 As the Senate prepares for final negotiations with the House over Iraq war spending, presidential politics have, once again, become intertwined with the debate in Congress. Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, aides said, had resisted signing onto the plan, fearful of being portrayed as cutting off money for the troops, even though supporters say the bill will not prevail.
 Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, introduced the legislation, which calls for a troop withdrawal to begin within 120 days. Senate Democratic leaders agreed to give the Feingold proposal -- and plan by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan -- a vote on Wednesday as a prelude to negotiating with Republicans and the White House over an Iraq spending plan. 
 Mr. Obama said he did not believe that cutting off money for all but a limited mission was the ''best answer.'' But he concluded he would support it, he said, ''to send a strong statement to the Iraqi government, the president and my Republican colleagues that it's long past time to change course.''
 Mrs. Clinton, who has struggled to explain her initial support of the war to some potential voters in Democratic primaries, said she would vote to support the Feingold plan ''because we, as a united party, must work together with clarity of purpose and mission to begin bringing our troops home and end this war.''
 The dispute over the war spending bill has consumed Congress for weeks and prevented the administration from getting the roughly $95 billion it is seeking for the Pentagon for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, opted to allow lawmakers to debate their competing Iraq proposals on Wednesday during consideration of an unrelated measure providing billions of dollars for hundreds of local water projects. By doing so, Democrats can vent their frustration with Iraq policy, then proceed to efforts to find a compromise with the White House over war spending.
 Mr. Reid and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, have been negotiating over how to win quick Senate approval of a preliminary war spending measure, so compromise talks can begin with the House and White House over a final bill. Mr. Reid was adamant on Tuesday that Congress would not break for the Memorial Day recess until it produced a final Iraq spending measure that would be accepted by President Bush.
 ''We're going no place until we finish this bill,'' Mr. Reid said Tuesday evening on the Senate floor.
 But Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the House majority leader, raised the possibility that meeting next week's deadline would be difficult. If Congress does not meet the deadline, it will, for the second time, leave for a recess without finishing the Iraq spending measure.
 While the Iraq votes on Wednesday may not have a significant impact on the immediate war spending bill, the results will reflect Senate sentiment on conditions in Iraq, which could influence the war debate as it proceeds throughout the summer.
 Democrats said the Feingold proposal to cut off money for most combat operations by March 31 could draw more support than expected, particularly after a surprisingly strong Democratic vote in the House for a similar plan last week. 
 Senate Republicans were preparing options of their own. One included a proposal sponsored by Senators John W. Warner of Virginia and Susan Collins of Maine, requiring the president to report to Congress on the progress in Iraq by July 15 and Sept. 15.
 According to a draft copy of the proposal, it would allow some economic aid to be withheld if the president did not certify that Iraq was meeting benchmarks for success. But at the request of the White House, the proposal was changed to allow the president to waive that penalty.
 While the two parties aired their public differences over Iraq on Tuesday, lawmakers and aides said the talks over a final spending plan still centered on providing money for the war tied to conditions on the Iraqi government to show progress in unifying Iraq politically and stabilizing it from a security standpoint.
 ''I think there's widespread frustration with the Iraqi government, and, clearly, these benchmarks are going to be directed toward the Iraqi government and its performance, or -- at least so far -- its lack of performance,'' Mr. McConnell said.

HEADLINE: At Mayors' Summit, Bloomberg Campaigns for Clean Air

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL; Ray Rivera contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg thrust himself onto an international stage yesterday as a champion of the environment, telling a roomful of leaders from this country and overseas that the solution to global warming lay with the world's mayors.
 Addressing roughly 250 mayors and other leaders over lunch at the Jumeirah Essex House on Central Park South, Mr. Bloomberg argued that cities, which are responsible for 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, must take the lead in addressing issues where national governments have not. 
''The world really is looking to these cities for leadership,'' he said, straying from his prepared remarks at the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit. ''You're not going to get this from other government bodies. You're going to get it from the mayors of the world and the cities of the world, where they have to make decisions, and the consequences of their decisions are visible within hours or days. We are the ones that can take this world ahead.''
 Mr. Bloomberg highlighted what he called ''our greenprint'' for guiding New York City's development over the next 23 years in an environmentally sustainable way. Expecting 900,000 more residents by 2030, he said, the city would focus on encouraging the use of cleaner and more efficient heating and cooling systems and appliances, upgrading heavily polluting power plants, promoting greater use of renewable power and reducing transportation-related carbon dioxide emissions.
 He also promoted his most contentious proposal, known as congestion pricing, under which -- with several exceptions -- the city would impose fees on drivers below 86th Street from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays.
 The plan, similar to a program in London, calls for the revenue to be used to finance environmental and mass transportation projects.
 But Mr. Bloomberg's main message was the importance of local leaders working together, an approach he has pursued in creating a national coalition of mayors to fight illegal gun sales. After the lunchtime address, Mr. Bloomberg crossed the street to Central Park for a news conference with a phalanx of mayors behind him, like a bureaucrat's version of ''The Warriors.''
 And there are signs that the message is being heard.
 Among those assembled in the park, Mayor Douglas H. Palmer of Trenton, president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, announced that 500 cities had signed onto the organization's agreement requiring them to reduce emissions below 1990 levels.
 Across the country, said Eric A. Goldstein, a co-director of the urban program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group, ''cities and states have increasingly taken the lead in climate and sustainability issues as frustration has grown with the federal government's environmental policies.'' Among cities that have been in the forefront of the movement are San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Chicago and New York, Mr. Goldstein said.
 But as Mr. Bloomberg struggles to sell congestion pricing to state lawmakers, other local leaders are running into roadblocks. Senate Republicans in Texas, for instance, recently voted to block a plan by Mayor Bill White of Houston that would allow him to fine industrial plants outside city limits that pollute city air.
 Indeed, Mr. Bloomberg's visibility at the conference was only part of an elaborate effort to overcome the political challenges of enacting his program. Flanked in the park by mayors from the United States, Europe and South America, Mr. Bloomberg announced that New York had joined the nonprofit Climate Group, which is dedicated to accelerating emissions reduction. In turn, officials with the group said they would work to support Mr. Bloomberg's plan.
 There is the advertisement on television released by Environmental Defense, an advocacy group, and the Partnership for New York City, a business group that has pushed for congestion pricing and helped organize the climate summit. In addition, the Campaign for New York's Future, a coalition of 80 environmental, civic, business, labor, neighborhood and public health groups, put up a Web site to provide information about the city's proposals. Members are also creating a brochure and are to lobby legislators in Albany today.
 In addition, the city's marketing department is devising a public education campaign, officials said.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Finds a Client In Bond Management Firm

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman whose pronouncements continue to jolt world markets, has signed a consulting deal with Pimco, the giant bond management firm.
 Mr. Greenspan, 81, will meet with executives of Pacific Investment Management Company once a quarter to discuss economic trends and has agreed to discuss Fed policy -- but only behind closed doors, an associate with knowledge of the deal said. 
 Mr. Greenspan will also hold periodic telephone and video conferences with senior executives, this person said. It is his first client since leaving the Fed.
 Pimco, the bond specialist in Newport Beach, Calif., has more $687.1 billion under management. Its chief investment officer, William H. Gross, is closely followed for his bond expertise.
 The deal, first reported on The Wall Street Journal's Web site, will only be part of Mr. Greenspan's business enterprises. He also plans to enter other consulting deals, though not with firms that compete directly with Pimco, his associate said, and he will continue offering lectures at rates of up to about $150,000 apiece.
 Mr. Greenspan has also finished a book, which is part memoir and part economic analysis, and for which he reportedly received an advance of more than $8.5 million. The book is due out in September.
 Though he has been away from the Federal Reserve since February 2006, Mr. Greenspan remains an influential economic voice and his comments have rocked markets more than once.
 Over the last year, he has held what are known as ''intimate conversations'' -- private lectures to business and investment groups.
 But his comments have leaked out of several meetings, at which he cautioned that conditions in the United States were in some ways ripe for a recession.
 Those comments conflicted with the views of his successor at the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke, who has predicted a modest rebound later this year and a gradual easing of inflationary pressure.
 Until now, Mr. Greenspan has insisted that he would not talk about Fed policy or about the outlook for interest rates, because he did not want to appear to be second-guessing Mr. Bernanke.
 But his associate said last night that he would talk about those topics within the confines of Pimco, at least on occasion. ''It would be a very small part of what he talks about,'' the associate said.
 That could cause heartburn for Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke, because most of his recent comments about the economy have been behind closed doors, and have still made headlines.

HEADLINE: Plan for Middle-Class Homes on Queens Bank of East River Prompts Ideas and Protest

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Stephen M. Ross wants some of the wealthiest developers in the city to come together to build 5,000 apartments for nurses, teachers, firefighters, construction workers and other middle-class employees on the bank of the East River -- at no profit.
 Mr. Ross, one of the city's most active and politically connected developers, and some of his colleagues have been in secret talks with the Bloomberg administration about designing and financing the city's initial plan for middle-class buildings on a 24-acre publicly owned parcel at Queens West in Long Island City His proposal is to have the industry's powerful lobbying arm, the Real Estate Board of New York, form a nonprofit corporation to build the huge complex. 
But some local residents, civic and church groups and housing advocates are outraged by the talks, saying that City Hall has locked them out of what was supposed to be an open planning process on the future of an important piece of public land on the East River. Developers' goals may not be in the best interest of the local community, they say. 
 Fearing that such apartments would not be affordable for most Queens residents, the local community board and a coalition of 20 organizations sent letters this week to Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff saying that turning the land over to the Real Estate Board would be ''a serious mistake that could jeopardize a valuable and important opportunity to create thousands of units of affordable housing.''
 The groups cite an effort by the Real Estate Board during the 1980s real estate boom to build 1,000 subsidized condominiums in the Bronx for the middle class that suffered from escalating costs and ended in failure and ugly recriminations.
 The Real Estate Board, widely known as Rebny, said yesterday that the current hubbub was premature, since the city had yet to make a decision on how the site would be developed, or by whom. 
 ''There's no deal,'' said Mr. Ross, chief executive of Related Companies and chairman of Rebny. ''The city is in total control. We're trying to come up with a program to get the housing built at the lowest price possible. I don't think that anybody sees this as a profit opportunity.''
 Mr. Doctoroff said that the city was still exploring the possibilities for the site.
 ''We'd only enter into a partnership with Rebny if we thought it was going to provide more affordable housing than we'd otherwise be able to create,'' he said. ''People should hold their fire until they have a better sense of what we're doing.''
 Mr. Ross and other developers have been talking with Mr. Doctoroff and city planning and housing officials about the project for more than four months, exploring the role of Rebny as a builder or adviser.
 The city announced plans to build 5,000 apartments for middle-class families earning between $60,000 and $145,000 at Queens West last October, amid a growing public outcry over the high cost of housing in New York and the loss of affordable apartments to gentrification.
 Under the plan, the city said it would buy the land from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for $100 million and spend $46 million more on roads, sewers and other improvements. The city has yet to close on that deal.
 Developers who know him say that Mr. Ross is motivated in part by the belief that the city needs more of what he calls ''work-force housing'' to stay economically healthy, and in part by a desire to counter the image of developers as greedy.
 The project would also help the Bloomberg administration, which has an ambitious affordable-housing program, and give a political boost to Mr. Doctoroff, who is Mr. Ross's friend and former business partner. 
 But it has not been easy for Mr. Ross to persuade his fellow developers to go from adviser to nonprofit builder at Queens West. ''The question is, do the other developers feel as altruistic as Steve Ross claims to be,'' another developer involved in the talks said. It is unclear whether nonprofit means that there will be no developers' fees.
 Some Rebny members say they worry about who would provide the financial guarantees for lenders, and who would be responsible for the almost inevitable cost overruns. 
 ''The exposure here would be enormous,'' another developer said. ''Rebny is genuinely trying to help the mayor. But my guess is, before the whole thing is done, we'll have egg on our face.'' New York has a relatively large and vibrant moderate-income housing industry, although few of those builders were willing to talk about their interest in Queens West for fear of angering the city officials they deal with every day.
 Whatever the misgivings of some Rebny members, critics like Queens for Affordable Housing, a coalition of 20 community-based groups, say that the city should not abdicate its responsibility for good urban planning and for ensuring that the land is developed for public benefit. 
 They also question the wisdom of giving the site to a trade association like Rebny, rather than designing the complex and then asking developers to compete for the right to build all or part of it. Such competition, they say, would give builders an incentive to keep down costs.
 In a letter to Mr. Doctoroff, Joe Conley, chairman of Community Board 2 in Queens, wrote that the land was a ''precious and limited resource for New Yorkers of modest means and the city should not hand it off to Rebny.''
 Councilman Eric N. Gioia of Queens expressed support for the mayor's Queens West project last October. But in a letter to Mayor Bloomberg on Monday, he complained about the ''absolute lack of community outreach'' to discuss the need for schools, a library and transportation.
 Mr. Gioia, Mr. Conley and Brad Lander, a spokesman for Queens for Affordable Housing, also want the city to make some of the apartments available to lower-and moderate-income families. Under the city's current plan, they say that a majority of families in Queens, where the median household income is $45,000, could not afford to live there.
 Mayor Bloomberg initially indicated that all 5,000 apartments would be subsidized for middle-income families earning $60,000 to $145,000. Now, the city is considering setting aside 60 percent for middle-income families, while the remaining 40 percent would be sold at market rates. 
 Mr. Doctoroff argues that the city cannot solve every problem at one site. ''This is a great opportunity to make a significant impact on middle-income housing problems,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Citing Waste, Albany Seeks To Rein In Public Authorities

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
For almost a century, public authorities have been the universal solvent of New York politics, burning through legislative or bureaucratic gridlock to build ambitious public works projects, from subways to hospitals to public housing. 
 But over the years, their broad powers to borrow money and grant tax breaks, and their relative freedom from oversight, have also allowed hundreds of public authorities to be put to other, more creative and not always legal uses.
 In 2004, for instance, a former executive director of the New York State Bridge Authority, which runs several Hudson River bridges, pleaded guilty to billing the authority for trips to visit relatives and scout vacation homes. 
 The Long Island Power Authority, which provides electricity to Nassau and Suffolk Counties at some of the highest prices in the nation, spent more than a million dollars on public opinion polls over a few years beginning in the late 1990s. Some of the polls were conducted by a company that was chosen without using a competitive bidding process and that asked customers about politicians including former Gov. George E. Pataki and Rick A. Lazio, a former United States representative. 
 And until last year, the Olympic Regional Development Authority held an annual getaway in Lake Placid for members of Congress in the hopes of wrangling more federal money for the sports facilities there. Yet federal funding was reduced almost every year the getaways were held, while the lobbyists and campaign contributors invited by a local Republican congressman enjoyed lavish dinners and entertainment.
 Those are only a few of the many examples of waste, fraud and mismanagement uncovered by legislators or the state comptroller in recent years, spurring occasional bouts of lawmaking designed to make public authorities more accountable. But they have remained inscrutable enough that even now, no one knows precisely how many are active at any given time.
 Now Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the State Legislature are negotiating what could be the most significant overhaul of the authorities in years, perhaps ever.
 The legislation being considered would impose sweeping financial disclosure requirements on the hundreds of local and state-level authorities and grant state officials new powers to monitor and enforce their compliance. It would also require public authorities' board members, most of whom are appointed by the governor for fixed terms, to swear an oath to uphold fiduciary responsibilities similar to the ones assumed by directors of public corporations. 
 ''Many authorities have become Soviet-style bureaucracies, cash cows and patronage mills for the political class and completely removed from control of democratic institutions,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who has been a voluble critic of public authorities. 
 Separately, Spitzer administration officials say that of the more than 700 authorities, they hope to consolidate or close as many as 200 superfluous or defunct ones. And they say Mr. Spitzer will appoint only highly qualified individuals to the authorities' boards and executive ranks. 
 ''At the end of the day, there will be authorities,'' said Lloyd Constantine, a top adviser to Mr. Spitzer who is overseeing the administration's efforts. ''It's not a question of whether we turn away from them. The intention is to tweak them so they better serve the public interest.''
 It would be the latest effort in recent years to overhaul public authorities through legislation. In 2005 and 2006, the Legislature and Mr. Pataki passed measures that created a budget office to collect information about the authorities and an inspector general with limited powers to investigate them. (A special commission on public authorities recommended further changes last year, but Mr. Pataki and the Legislature could not agree on legislation.)
 ''We took a major step to recapturing them in last year's bill,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''But this second step is absolutely essential.''
 Armed with the power to issue tax-free debt, the authorities were designed to perform some of the duties of public agencies with the nimbleness of private corporations. But that strength, critics say, has also been a weakness: Public authorities face neither the accountability of elected officials nor the market pressures of truly private enterprises.
 Corruption, cronyism and mismanagement are among the consequences. In 2002, a New York State Thruway Authority subsidiary sold the rights to develop up to 45 miles of Erie Canal shoreline for $30,000. (The deal, details of which became public through an inquiry initiated by Mr. Brodsky, was later scrapped.) Efforts by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to renovate a Lower Manhattan building and use it as a headquarters ran $300 million over budget. Investigations later uncovered no-bid contracts, kickbacks and links to organized crime. 
 The authorities' quasi-independent status has also made them infinitely malleable to politicians' goals and ripe for abuse.
 The state's largest authorities have accumulated more than $120 million in debt. Most debt issued by the authorities is backed by their own revenue, like tolls or parking fees. But state officials who are otherwise barred from borrowing money without voter approval have also used the authorities as a conduit to borrow nearly all of the state's $48.5 billion debt -- already among the highest per capita in the country.
 And not all of the money goes for urgent infrastructure projects. In the last nine months of 2006, Mr. Pataki and the Legislature borrowed nearly $2 billion through the authorities. Some of that money financed projects run by politically connected companies or favored nonprofit organizations in lawmakers' districts. 
 The authorities also have a tendency to evolve well beyond their original mission, albeit usually at the behest of governors and lawmakers. 
 ''You have not so much mission creep as mission gallop,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative group.
 The Dormitory Authority, originally created to build housing at state universities, now finances hospital renovations and economic development projects across the state. 
 According to the state comptroller's office, 740 local and state authorities and subsidiaries are on the books. Mr. Constantine said that 100 to 200 of them may not be active.
 But even those numbers may not tell the whole story. Many authorities have spun off one or more subsidiaries, some of which have in turn created their own legal subsidiaries, buried under piles of paperwork, making them hard to track. 
 ''They have metastasized into sprawling organizations that no one has their hands around, and that's got to stop,'' Mr. Brodsky said.
 The Empire State Development Corporation, one of the state's largest authorities, announced this month that it would close 13 of its subsidiaries and merge 25 others into a single holding company. But that would still leave it with 164 subsidiaries, according to administration officials.
 It can be difficult to figure out which authorities are active, partly because they are subject to little oversight. Some are created in statute but are never opened for business. Others fulfill their intended purpose and cease operating, but continue to exist on paper. Some appear to die but are later revived.
 Two years ago, for example, the state budget office took an industrial development agency in Dunkirk off its list of active authorities. According to city records, the agency, which borrowed almost $5 million in the 1980s to help build a waterfront hotel that later went bankrupt, appeared to haveno outstanding debt and thus no legal existence. The agency also had not submitted financial reports to the comptroller for several years. 
 But earlier this year, lawyers for the city told state development officials that the agency had issued a $100 bond in 1997, expressly for the purpose of keeping it active so it could offer a tax break to a company interested in buying the hotel. City officials defended the decision, saying the hotel, which was reopened and is now prospering, anchored the city's waterfront tourist district. 
 ''That transaction by the I.D.A. served the purpose that the city I.D.A. was chartered for: the creation of jobs and the industrial development of the city,'' said Daniel C. Gard, the city attorney, who is also counsel to the agency. 
 Now Dunkirk politicians have found another potential use for the agency: offering tax-exempt bonds and mortgage tax breaks for a $150 million power plant nearby.
 Whatever the successes of Dunkirk's industrial development agency, the scores of similar agencies around the state appear to have a poor record of success. According to a recent analysis of 2005 data by the research group New York Jobs With Justice, almost 21 percent of the businesses receiving aid from industrial development agencies did not meet job creation targets -- and an additional 25 percent of the businesses actually lost jobs. As a result, governments across the state gave up $266 million in tax revenue that year.
 Some legislators also point to another problem. Most of the authorities' contracting and lobbying scandals in recent years resulted from the improper meddling of executive branch officials, they said. .
 Mr. Brodsky and State Senator John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican, said they would like the new legislation to allow more oversight of the authorities but also insulate them from the executive branch. 
 Mr. Flanagan said administration officials had balked at putting those measures in the bill, though Mr. Spitzer supported similar proposals when he was attorney general.
 ''They were solid provisions then, and they are solid provisions now,'' said Mr. Flanagan, who added that the Senate would include those measures in its own version of the bill.
 Mr. Constantine said that the governor and the Legislature had agreed on most provisions of the new bill, but that he would not comment on the possibility of provisions to prevent executive interference. 
 ''When you're governor and take over the budget division,'' he said, ''you get a different perspective, and you have the opportunity to see how things work from a different vantage point.''

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Near Agreement On New Immigration Rules

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
Senators from both parties said Wednesday that they were close to agreement on a new system of selecting immigrants that would give greater weight to education and to job skills deemed helpful to the economy.
 Under the proposal, the government would adopt a point system to evaluate the qualifications and claims of many people seeking permission to immigrate.
Family ties would remain an important factor, but would have less weight than under current law. 
 The point system is one element of a comprehensive bill that calls for the biggest changes in immigration law and policy in more than 20 years. The full Senate plans to take up the legislation next week.
 Although Democrats now control the Senate, the bill incorporates many ideas advanced in some form by President Bush. A draft of the legislation says that Congress intends to ''increase American competitiveness through a merit-based evaluation system for immigrants.'' 
 Moreover, it says, Congress will ''reduce chain migration'' by limiting the number of visas issued exclusively on account of kinship.
 Democrats insisted, and Republicans agreed, that some points be awarded to people who had close relatives in the United States or could perform low-skill jobs for which there was a high demand.
 Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, one of the more optimistic negotiators, said, ''There's a 90 percent chance that we will get a deal this week.'' Mr. Graham added that the legislation ''would free up thousands of green cards in the future for people who meet our economic needs, while still allowing members of the nuclear family to come to this country.''
 Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell University, said: ''The legislation taking shape in the Senate represents a major philosophical shift. It tells the world that we are emphasizing characteristics that will enhance our global competitiveness, like education and job skills. We would not rely as much on family background as we have in the past.''
 Under the proposal, Mr. Yale-Loehr said, ''foreign-born spouses and minor children of United States citizens could still get green cards, but foreign-born siblings and adult children of citizens would be hurt.''
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said lawmakers had narrowed their differences on some issues.
 ''This is not the architecture of an immigration bill that I would have initially liked to see,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''But this is a legislative process. A lot of different interests are at work. For the sake of this legislation, we had to come back to a point system. It will recognize a number of elements: high skills, low skills and family relationships. There are always differences about what the proportions ought to be.''
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, had set a test vote for Wednesday. But after learning that negotiators had made progress, he deferred it to Monday, to allow more time for talks.
 The bill would offer legal status to most of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States. But they would not automatically qualify for citizenship. The proposal would require them to ''touch back'' in their home countries and apply for green cards, like other immigrants seeking permanent residence in the United States.
 Some conservatives still dislike the idea of a large legalization program. But Mr. Graham said the bill struck a realistic balance.
 ''We are not going to put 12 million people in jail,'' Mr. Graham said. ''Nor should we give them an advantage over those who played by the rules to become citizens.''
 Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, said he had doubts about this approach, but said Congress had to do something because his constituents were telling him that ''they feel they are being overrun with uncontrolled immigration.''
 The legislation also calls for major increases in the Border Patrol and tougher enforcement at the border and in the workplace.
 Senator Ken Salazar, Democrat of Colorado, one of the negotiators, said he wanted the new point system to be equitable. ''We do not want to create a system that is just for the wealthiest and most educated immigrants,'' Mr. Salazar said.

HEADLINE: Magazine Suspends Its Run In History

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
After more than 50 years American Heritage, the magazine that furnished not just the minds but, in its original hardcover format, the dens of generations of American history buffs, is suspending publication, its editor, Richard F. Snow, said last week. 
 The bimonthly magazine, which is owned by Forbes Inc., has been for sale since January, and in the absence of a buyer, Mr. Snow said, the publishers have decided to put the next issue, June-July, on indefinite hold. For at least the time being, however, American Heritage will continue to maintain a Web site.
That leaves Mr. Snow and his staff, which has dwindled to four from a dozen, in limbo, where they have been since just before Christmas, when they were informed that the magazine was going on the block. ''It's a little like sailing the Flying Dutchman through the fog,'' Mr. Snow said. ''On the other hand, I've been here for 40 years, so I can't really bitch about job instability.''
 The magazine has always been a bit of an anomaly among American publications. 
 The circulation is currently 350,000, or as high as it has ever been, and hundreds of those readers can still be reliably counted on to write in arguing about the true causes of the Civil War or, as happened recently, to point out that the author of a World War II article doesn't know the difference between the M-1 rifle and the M-16, which didn't come in until Vietnam. 
 American Heritage was founded in 1954 by James Parton, Oliver Jensen and Joseph J. Thorndike Jr., refugees from Life, who from the beginning broke most of the rules of magazine publishing. They determined not to accept ads, for example -- on the ground that there was a ''basic incompatibility between the tones of the voice of history and of advertising'' -- and instead charged a yearly subscription of $10, a figure so steep at the time that readers were allowed to pay it in installments. They also published in clothbound, hardback volumes with full-color paintings mounted on the front. 
 The format was an instant hit with readers, who instead of tossing back issues often shelved them in their bookcases, but it initially confounded the United States Post Office, which decreed that American Heritage could use neither the book rate nor the periodical one. That ruling was eventually overturned, but not until the magazine had almost bankrupted itself by paying for parcel post.
 The first editor of American Heritage was Bruce Catton, a Civil War historian who wrote in the inaugural issue in December 1954 that ''the faith that moves us is, quite simply, the belief that our heritage is best understood by a study of the things that the ordinary folk of America have done and thought and dreamed since first they began to live here.'' In the beginning, at least, that meant a fair amount of WASPy nostalgia and a steady ration of stories about the Civil War. That inaugural issue, for example, includes a piece about a Union general who was falsely accused of treason in 1862, as well as articles about the country store, the Fall River steamship line and a lament by Cleveland Amory about the decline of New York men's clubs. 
 Mr. Snow, 59, went to work in the American Heritage mailroom in 1965, when Columbia University insisted he take a little time off, and joined the staff full time when he finally graduated, in 1970. He has been there ever since, and in 1990 he became the magazine's sixth editor, succeeding Byron Dobell. 
 Either he was a perfect fit to begin with, or over the years he has taken on many of the characteristics of his workplace, for he now closely resembles his own magazine. He is quite youthful looking, on one hand (probably because he is one of those people who mature early and then never change), and a little old-fashioned on the other. He speaks in perfectly turned paragraphs and may be the last person left in New York to unself-consciously use ''indeed'' as an exclamation. 
 He favors gray suits and sweater vests, his telephone manners are impeccable, and he has a bubbling, high-pitched voice that turns a simple ''hello'' into something that resembles the opening bar of a Broadway show tune. Like his magazine he has an almost insatiable curiosity and is particularly expert on the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, not to mention Coney Island amusement rides at the turn of the last century.
 Mr. Snow has been at American Heritage long enough that he can remember when it was an empire in the mid-'60s, employing 400 people, with the magazine as a flagship for what was in effect a publishing company selling books, many of them by some of America's best-known popular historians, by direct mail. He was managing editor in 1980, when the magazine ceased publishing in hardback (except for subscribers who wanted to shell out extra for what Mr. Snow now calls a ''padded, leatheroid edition''), and in 1982 when, bowing to economic necessity, it began soliciting ads. 
 ''We all felt very bad about taking advertising,'' Mr. Snow recalled. ''But it had the odd effect of making us feel we were in touch with the world. There was a sense of a living connection to a process that was actually sort of fun -- or at least it was fun while we were getting ads.'' 
 American Heritage remained more driven by circulation than by ads, however. According to Scott Masterson, a senior vice president at Forbes and president of American Heritage, the magazine was losing money when Forbes bought it in 1986 and then bounced back for a while. But in the late '90s, Mr. Masterson said, it failed to reap the kind of profits that many magazines did, and after 2001 it experienced the same downturn that afflicted the magazine business in general and had trouble recovering. 
 Part of the problem was the Internet, Mr. Snow said. ''We're really a general interest magazine,'' he said. ''We don't play to a history buff in any narrow sense -- like the Civil War re-enactors, for example. They can go on the Web and get thousands and thousands of hits.''
 Three years ago Mr. Snow and Mr. Masterson decided to embrace the magazine's aging readership and rejiggered American Heritage to appeal more specifically to baby boomers, mostly publishing articles about things that had happened in their lifetime. The formula was an editorial success, Mr. Snow said, yielding articles like one that appeared in the February-March issue about the Wrecking Crew, an unheralded studio band that played on many hit records in the '60s and '70s. But it failed to provide the hoped-for bump on the business end. ''Forbes has been very, very patient,'' he said. ''but basically they've been carrying us for a while.''
 Over lunch recently at Keens -- another venerable New York institution, decorated with old clay pipes and playbills and where he pointed out, for the sake of accuracy, that the famed mutton chop is really lamb -- Mr. Snow lamented that the next issue of American Heritage might never get into print. 
 ''We're just about finished with the issue, and we have a particularly fine piece by Teller, the nontalking half of the Penn and Teller team,'' he said. ''It's a superb piece of writing, an essay about a fellow named David Abbott, who was a great American magician.'' 
 Mr. Snow added, ''You know, some issues are better than others, but I don't think there's been a single one where anything really bored me.''
 He said he was still unsure about his own fate, but if need be he could go back to writing historical novels. ''I've written four,'' he said. ''Two were loathed by everyone who read them, but two actually got published.'' And no matter what happens, he has worked out a crucial point of his severance: He gets to keep his Royal manual typewriter. 
 ''That was the typewriter I was assigned in 1970, and it will follow me to the grave,'' he said, and he added: ''I wish this were more a sign of granitic stability, but in fact it's a sign of my computer incompetence. I use it just to type labels, but it works beautifully. Every year someone comes in and cleans it. I don't think he's paid by Forbes. He's some spectral presence who just turns up.''

HEADLINE: Energy Standards Needed, Report Says

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Energy saving opportunities in American homes are immense with current technology, but new product standard mandates will be needed, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute. 
 The research group's study, scheduled to be released today, concludes that projected electricity consumption in residential buildings in the United States in 2020 could be reduced by more than a third if compact fluorescent light bulbs and an array of other high-efficiency options including water heaters, kitchen appliances, room-insulation materials and standby power were adopted across the nation.
The energy saving over that time, if achieved, would be equivalent to the production from 110 new coal-fired 600-megawatt power plants, the researchers estimate. That would result in a significant reduction in the amounts of fossil fuel burned and carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, spewed into the atmosphere. 
 Yet market forces alone, even considerably higher energy prices, will not be enough to cause wholesale adoption of the most energy-efficient technology, the report said.
 ''The study makes a strong case for what economists tend to shy away from -- market intervention,'' said Diana Farrell, director of the institute, the economics research arm of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company. ''But this would be market intervention to correct market distortions that exist.''
 Such distortions, Ms. Farrell said, result from individuals' lacking adequate information to make the best decisions or the market's failure to encourage individuals to make energy-efficient investments. 
 For example, a person renting an apartment may be using appliances that consume a lot of electric power. The landlord has little incentive to buy new, more efficient appliances because the tenant pays the electricity bills. And the person renting the apartment, who may intend to stay for a year or two, has scant incentive to buy energy-efficient appliances. So a lot of electrical power is wasted.
 ''Everyone would be better off if the capital investments were made,'' Ms. Farrell said. ''But the individual parties do not have the incentives to make the needed investments.''
 The solution, the McKinsey report suggested, is more stringent product standards so that all new appliances are energy-efficient models.
 Robert N. Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard University, who has not seen the study, said he was skeptical about the size of the efficiency gains the McKinsey study projected. The notion that ''massive free lunches in energy efficiency'' will result from tweaking the market with new regulations and standards, he said, is misguided.
 ''Often, the reason energy-efficient improvements have not been widely adopted is that there are real costs to many sets of individuals,'' he said, ''and they are making personally rational choices.''
 With appliances, Mr. Stavins said, the household with the greatest incentive to buy a more expensive energy-efficient washing machine is the one that does many loads of laundry each week, while a person who does a load or two has less incentive.
 Energy-efficiency requirements, he added, raise the prices of products and can impose ''significant costs on the less affluent.''
 So some economists, like Mr. Stavins, say that putting a price on carbon -- through a tax on carbon emissions or a pollution-trading system -- is the preferred method to promote efficiency and curb global warming. A $100-a-ton tax on carbon dioxide, he said, would increase the cost of coal-fired electricity by 400 percent and natural-gas-generated power by 100 percent while hydropower costs would not increase at all.
 The McKinsey policy prescriptions resemble the California model. Starting in the 1970s, the state began imposing requirements for appliances and building materials, among other energy-saving measures. A consumer, said Terry Tamminen, a former director of the California Environmental Protection Agency, is not forced to choose between, say, appliances that are power hogs and ones that are energy-efficient.
 ''Enlightened regulation ensures that all your choices are relatively good ones,'' said Mr. Tamminen, now director of the climate program at the New America Foundation, a public policy institute, who has read the McKinsey report.
 The report is the second stage of a 16-month research project that involved dozens of McKinsey consultants and outside experts. The first part, released in November, was an overview of global energy demand through 2020 and how productivity gains could cut consumption.
 The new study is a more detailed examination by country and industry sector, where energy savings can be achieved and how large the savings may be. Residential buildings in the United States, the largest single energy-consuming group worldwide, are one of a few categories that McKinsey pointed to as policy priorities for making sizable savings.
 The report will be presented at an energy symposium in Washington sponsored by the New America Foundation and the Climate Group, a nonprofit organization. It is available at www.mckinsey.com/mgi.

HEADLINE: Why Is Income Inequality in America So Pronounced? Consider Education

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University and co-author of a blog at www.marginalrevolution.com.

 BODY:
The most commonly cited culprits for the income inequality in America -- outsourcing, immigration and the gains of the super-rich -- are diversions from the main issue. Instead, the problem is largely one of (a lack of) education. 
 The extent of outsourcing, for instance, is not yet high enough to have much effect on American wages. Even if a call center is set up in India, this helps American business expand at home. Most generally, the net flow of investment is into the United States, not away from it. It appears that more American jobs are ''in-sourced'' than outsourced. 
Nor should we be distracted by the gains of the top 1 percent. The goal should be to elevate the poor, not knock down the tall poppies. Microsoft has created cheap software and many jobs, and its co-founder, Bill Gates, is giving away most of his fortune.
 For the economy as a whole, labor's share of national income has stayed roughly constant at just above 70 percent. What has changed is that highly skilled laborers earn more labor income than low-skilled workers. 
 Many of the very wealthy have built their fortunes by taking companies private, buying the right securities at the right time or running successful hedge funds. Arguably, these activities improve the allocation of capital and thus enhance productivity.
 But even if these individuals perform no socially useful function, their gains reallocate wealth from one class of investors to another. That is, one group of investors reaps profits by buying in first and bidding up equity prices, thereby causing later investors to pay more for the same companies. This process transfers value from the relatively wealthy to the extremely wealthy, but it doesn't much hold back the poor.
 Nor are recent changes in equality about the tax system. Whatever one thinks of President Bush's reductions in marginal tax rates, pretax incomes also show greater inequality.
 Immigration has a smaller influence on wages than is often believed as well. Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, both professors of economics at Harvard, estimate the numbers in their recent paper, ''The Race Between Education and Technology: The Evolution of U.S. Educational Wage Differentials, 1890 to 2005,'' soon to be expanded into a book. 
 College graduates have been gaining relative to high school graduates. But competition from immigrant labor accounts for only 10 percent of the change in the wages of unskilled workers, relative to the skilled, since 1950. 
 Starting about 1950, the relative returns for schooling rose, and they skyrocketed after 1980. The reason is supply and demand. For the first time in American history, the current generation is not significantly more educated than its parents. Those in need of skilled labor are bidding for a relatively stagnant supply and so must pay more.
 The return for a college education, in percentage terms, is now about what it was in America's Gilded Age in the late 19th century; this drives the current scramble to get into top colleges and universities. In contrast, from 1915 to 1950, the relative return for education fell, mostly because more new college graduates competed for a relatively few top jobs, and that kept top wages from rising too high. 
 Professors Goldin and Katz portray a kind of race. Improvements in technology have raised the gains for those with enough skills to handle complex jobs. The resulting inequalities are bid back down only as more people receive more education and move up the wage ladder.
 Income distribution thus depends on the balance between technological progress and access to college and postgraduate study. The problem isn't so much capitalism as it is that American lower education does not prepare enough people to receive gains from American higher education. 
 Bottlenecks currently keep more individuals from improving their education. Professor Katz has suggested changes at multiple levels, including additional college aid, more-accessible community colleges, easier financial aid forms, more serious attempts to identify and retain top teachers in high schools and school voucher experiments.
 It doesn't suffice simply to increase the number of people in college; rather the new students must be prepared to learn. There is, however, no single magic bullet. 
 Pessimists like Charles Murray, co-author of the much-debated 1994 book ''The Bell Curve,'' have argued that only so many individuals are educable at a high level. If that were the case, current levels of inequality might be here to stay.
 But the evidence suggests that when additional higher education becomes available, it offers returns in the range of 10 to 14 percent per year of college, at least for the first newcomers to enroll. 
 Nonetheless it will, sooner or later, become increasingly difficult to deliver the gains from college -- not to mention postgraduate study -- to the entire population. Technology is advancing faster than our ability to educate. So even if inequality declines today, it may well intensify in the future. Even if American education improves at every level, the largely not-for-profit educational sector may simply be less dynamic than the progress of new technologies. 
 The lesson is this: Economists are homing in on the key to the inequality problem, but don't think any solution will necessarily last for long.

HEADLINE: Jews Come to a Well-Worn City, And Discover a Bit of Paradise

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

DATELINE: WATERBURY, Conn. 

 BODY:
The 7-Eleven on Cooke Street in this central Connecticut city now offers kosher Slurpees. A deli offering Shabbat specialties like cholent and kishke sits on a blighted street where the police frequently block off vandalized homes. An abandoned synagogue that was nearly sold to a church about seven years ago is now a bustling yeshiva where 200 young men study the Talmud.
 Just north of downtown in this struggling city of 107,000, the Hillside neighborhood is a mix of boarded-up windows and pristine views of the green and lakes of Fulton Park below. Lately, there have been rumors of a police sting operation for prostitution.
Increasingly, the streets are filled with men in skullcaps and dark suits and women in wigs and long skirts as about 100 Orthodox Jewish families, many from the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, have moved in. 
 ''We are building from scratch, from the very beginning we have to establish everything,'' said Rabbi Avrohom Krohn, 35, who spent a decade in Jerusalem before moving here with his wife, Genendel, and four children three years ago. ''Everyone has to take some responsibility.''
 If anyone would have suggested a decade ago that this heavily Roman Catholic city whose best-known religious landmark is a large steel cross on a hill would become an Orthodox Jewish enclave, they would have been laughed out of shul. 
 Back then, there was little more than a shell of a Jewish community in Waterbury: the synagogue that was not sold to a church had dwindled to a handful of congregants. Now, plans are under way to build a second Orthodox synagogue among a new development of dozens of homes in the hills being marketed to Jewish families. 
 There is a ritual bath, a Jewish bookstore and cooperative exchanges for used appliances and furniture. There is a Waterbury branch of Hatzolah, a volunteer Jewish ambulance service, and a communal emergency locksmith. 
 Rabbi Ahron Kaufman, who spearheaded the migration here, said that while growing up in New York, he had ''never even heard of Waterbury, and Connecticut -- what was that?'' 
 Now he talks of it as the golden land, a sly smile spreading across his face, as if he were letting an interloper in on a secret. ''This is the best of every world,'' he said. ''A city, the suburbs and the bungalows in the Catskills, all wrapped into one.''
 Religious Jewish communities have migrated across the New York region for decades, generally either settling in suburban areas or creating new enclaves in empty expanses. In the 1950s, a group followed a charismatic rabbi to Lakewood, N.J., and today Orthodox Jews make up a major part of the community there. In the late 1970s, Hasidic Jews migrated to Rockland County from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, setting up the insular town of Kiryas Joel. And on Long Island, secular Jews have recently sparred with their more religious counterparts in the Five Towns. 
 But it is practically unheard of for Orthodox Jews to flock to dilapidated midsize cities like Waterbury, a place few people have lately seemed interested in moving to, and where there is virtually no other Jewish presence. 
 A former industrial hub about a two-hour drive from either Boston or Manhattan, Waterbury has grappled for years with an eroding business base and declining property values. Once-resplendent homes have long been vacant and tarnished by graffiti. Though an influx of immigrants from Latin America and development projects have helped the economy in recent years, downtown still has scars of decades of decay.
 Enter Rabbi Kaufman and his followers. With the help of real estate developers in 2001, the city's political leadership courted the Jewish leaders, offering a $60,000 lease on a former campus of the University of Connecticut in exchange for a promise to bring in 100 families by this summer. 
 That goal was reached a year ahead of schedule. The kindergarten-through-eighth-grade school expanded from one to two buildings on the university campus, and is expected to soon fill all five buildings there. The high school will award its first batch of diplomas next summer. And the yeshiva, the adult religious school that is the heart of Jewish life here, is moving its dormitories into a 10-story apartment building in the center of town later this year. 
 The families who move here are drawn in large part by economics -- Yisroel Weinreb, 23, who originally came from Brooklyn to study at the yeshiva as a teenager, bought a six-bedroom house for $160,000 in 2005. Now he is remodeling the basement. 
 ''I couldn't get even a closet for that in Brooklyn,'' said Mr. Weinreb, who is in charge of maintenance at the schools. ''And here I know my neighbors, I talk to them, I say good morning. In New York I wouldn't even look at the guy.''
 Many of the community's adult men study full time, teaching classes at the schools to earn money; women generally teach the elementary classes. People run the small businesses that sustain Jewish life here, or work locally as lawyers, real estate brokers or developers and the like; very few commute. The growth has been financed with significant fund-raising among the wider Jewish community. 
 In many ways, the Jewish influx in Waterbury is similar to that of the immigrant groups that have settled in declining cities in upstate New York or the South. And by following religious dress codes -- women are rarely seen in pants, and men wear beards and hats -- the Jews in Waterbury look different enough to invite stares. 
 But apart from a few derogatory shouts from cars whizzing by the Jewish neighborhood, there has been little conflict, according to residents and officials. Still, after a sudden rash of vandalism and robberies last month, several people in the community are suddenly skittish. 
 On one Friday night, a group of boys broke into Malky Kolodny's car, putting it into neutral, then rolling it into a fence. 
 Now, Ms. Kolodny, 28, and her family have put their home on the market -- though they are hoping to move just a few blocks away. ''We love it here, but something like that scares you a little bit,'' she said. 
 Longtime Waterbury residents have also had their challenges accepting the change. Last year, the city's zoning commission received dozens of complaints about the dormitories surrounding the yeshiva, where more than a dozen young men were piled into each house. Neighbors said that the school was violating occupancy codes, and that the young men were loud at night and drove dangerously through the area.
 Yet in a sign of how important the growing Orthodox community has become, the response from city officials was tempered. 
 ''We're in a pickle,'' Giuseppe N. Pisani, the zoning commissioner, said at the time. ''It's like a cop giving a parking ticket to his grandmother.''
 After some negotiations, the yeshiva agreed to buy an apartment building down the road for $4 million and give up the houses where the young men live now. As Rabbi Kaufman sees it, almost any price would be worth avoiding prolonged troubles with city officials. 
 ''We want to be welcome, to reach out and to be a part of the entire community,'' he said. ''We don't want to just be to ourselves.''
 Though the Jews who live here frequently use shorthand to refer to any place outside Brooklyn as ''out of town'' -- Flatbush is ''town,'' and ''out'' can mean Florida or Stamford or Boston -- Rabbi Kaufman imagines the day when everyone considers Waterbury the nucleus of New England Jewish life. 
 While members of the community are strict in their religious observance, they have also embraced interacting with the outside world and encourage students to pursue secular activities. 
 Rabbi Kaufman, 48, an ebullient man who sees the building of the Orthodox community in Waterbury as a personal mission, takes particular pride in Ingenious Productions, a fledgling film company that has made movies for several Jewish organizations and a three-part spoof called ''Rabbis'' for the yeshiva. 
 As Yossi Reichmann, 23, and Moshe Bree, 22, two filmmakers, sat in his office one afternoon, Rabbi Kaufman prodded them a bit about their future.
 ''You know, you could really make it,'' Rabbi Kaufman said, another grin on his face. 
 ''We know, we know,'' Mr. Bree said. 
 ''And,'' Rabbi Kaufman said, his eyes gleaming, ''you could set up a film company in Waterbury, bring in all kinds of business.''
 Mr. Reichmann looked far more skeptical. 
 ''Um, well,'' he said, ''I don't know that Waterbury will ever be the center of the film industry.''

HEADLINE: WOLFOWITZ SAID TO PUSH FOR DEAL TO LET HIM QUIT

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
After six weeks of combating efforts to oust him as president of the World Bank, Paul D. Wolfowitz began Wednesday to negotiate the terms under which he would resign, in return for the dropping or softening of the charge that he had engaged in misconduct, bank officials said.
 Mr. Wolfowitz was said to be adamant that he be cleared of wrongdoing before he resigned, according to people familiar with his thinking.
The negotiations were still under way on Wednesday evening, and bank officials said they were increasingly hopeful that a solution was in sight, ending what had become a bitter ordeal at the bank, within the Bush administration and at economic ministries around the world.
 The World Bank's board of directors met Wednesday afternoon to discuss the conclusion of its special committee that Mr. Wolfowitz was guilty of ethical and governance violations. Many were firm about not dismissing the findings that Mr. Wolfowitz violated the bank's trust by arranging for a pay and promotion package for Shaha Ali Riza, his companion and a bank employee, when he became president in 2005. 
 At the same time, talks took place between emissaries of Mr. Wolfowitz and bank officials with backing from board members who favored easing him out without provoking a confrontation with the Bush administration. Bank officials said the negotiations were aimed at finding a way for the board to accept the findings of the bank committee, while also declaring that Mr. Wolfowitz had acted in good faith and that mistakes were made by all sides.
 The new discussions about Mr. Wolfowitz were prompted by a signal from the White House on Tuesday that if the bank board cleared him of ethics charges, the administration would be willing to talk about his possible resignation down the road. That offer became more of a quid pro quo on Wednesday, with the talks focusing on his exoneration in return for an actual resignation, as opposed to a promise to talk about a resignation in the future.
 People close to the negotiations said that the threat to oust Mr. Wolfowitz had, in the previous 24 hours, taken a bizarre U-turn, with Mr. Wolfowitz challenging the bank's directors to vote him out, knowing that the United States would oppose that move. Previously, Mr. Wolfowitz had been doing everything in his power to prevent such a vote.
 In effect, bank officials said, he was using the fear among European leaders at the bank of a possible rupture with the Bush administration at a time when the United States and Europe are struggling to cooperate on Iran sanctions, trade and other economic issues. While the United States cannot prevent the ousting of Mr. Wolfowitz, it has by tradition picked the president of the bank and has such influence that its consensus-driven members want to avoid an open break with Washington. 
 ''The bank board is ready to vote Wolfowitz out of office, and Wolfowitz is calling their bluff,'' said a bank official briefed on the negotiations. ''It's going to be difficult for the board to drop its charges against him, but they're going to have to do it if they want to resolve this. They're staring each other down, but the bank side is blinking furiously.''
 Bank officials said they did not know the precise wording of what the bank might agree to and that Mr. Wolfowitz and his lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, would also accept.
 They said it appeared that both the White House and the Treasury Department were involved in guiding Mr. Wolfowitz's strategy, and that the interests of the United States were being represented at the bank by the American director on the board, Eli Whitney Debevoise II.
 Mr. Debevoise, a Washington lawyer, arrived at his job at the bank in early April, the precise moment when the furor over Mr. Wolfowitz erupted.
 The negotiations over Mr. Wolfowitz's possible exit unfolded quickly on Wednesday, officials said. As recently as late on Tuesday night, they said that a last-minute appeal by Mr. Wolfowitz to deny the charges against him and to demand a fair process in which he could stay on the job seemed to backfire. Especially galling to bank board members, officials said, was Mr. Wolfowitz's request that the 24-member board reject the conclusions of its seven-member subcommittee charging him with violating several codes of conduct and trying to cover up his involvement in Ms. Riza's salary and promotion.
 By the next morning, a flurry of second thoughts and back-channel conversations spread through the bank, officials said, in large part because of the signal from the White House on Tuesday. Previously the administration had rebuffed suggestions that he could not lead the bank, as both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney declared their confidence in his abilities. 
 In the morning, some bank officials said they were worried that the White House signal was a feint aimed at getting Mr. Wolfowitz to stay. They said they wanted Mr. Wolfowitz to put in writing his promise to resign under the right circumstances.
 The events of the day added up, in any case, to a hairpin turn in the fortunes of the beleaguered bank president, who over his two-year tenure has alienated virtually all segments of the bank, and a fair number of economic ministries around the world. In the last few weeks, he has reinforced their anger by dismissing the charges of misconduct against him as a ''smear campaign.''
 The saga seemed to be playing out according to a time-honored Washington formula: confrontation, impasse and crisis, followed by sudden negotiations to avert a possible breakdown of the institution.
 Bank officials said that one of the lead negotiators in trying to salvage a compromise was Thomas Scholar, the British director on the board, who is close to Prime Minister Tony Blair and his presumed successor, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer.
 Speculation about Mr. Wolfowitz's successor ranged from Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, to Mr. Blair and Stanley Fischer, the governor of the Bank of Israel. Also mentioned have been various prominent figures on Wall Street, including Douglas A. Warner III, a former chairman of JPMorgan Chase and chairman of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. In addition, speculation has centered on two officials close to Mr. Bush: Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert M. Kimmitt and Robert B. Zoellick, a former deputy secretary of state. 
 The most critical element to the negotiations was the overwhelming sentiment among bank board members in favor of endorsing the committee's criticism of Mr. Wolfowitz in its 52-page report, released Monday evening.
 But officials said that leaders of Britain, France and Germany and smaller countries in Europe also saw the advantage of resolving the Wolfowitz matter without a trans-Atlantic rupture, especially in advance of the summit meeting of leading industrial nations in Germany in June.
 That meeting will be the last for Mr. Blair and the first for the new president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy.

HEADLINE: Financial Angels Band Together

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN. 
E-mail: jamesflanigan@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, 40 successful businesspeople sat around a horseshoe table in a university lecture hall firing questions at four aspiring entrepreneurs. The aspirants were giving 20-minute presentations about their start-up companies to the Los Angeles chapter of Tech Coast Angels, a group that invests in new businesses. 
 Last Monday, in a hotel ballroom in Anaheim, a dozen eager entrepreneurs took part in an even more intense screening called the Fast Pitch competition of the Orange County chapter of Tech Coast Angels. In Fast Pitch, competitors have 60 seconds to give an account of their business and their plans in hopes of impressing venture capital funds, which typically put up bigger money than the Angels do.
Early in a company's financial life, after friends and family have been tapped for initial stakes, comes angel capital -- investments from individuals, often successful entrepreneurs themselves, who back newcomers starting out as they once did on a smile and a shoeshine. 
 Their numbers and importance are growing. Last year Angels, along with some venture capital backers of start-ups, invested $4.2 billion in more than 1,000 early-stage companies, according to Luis Villalobos, founder of Tech Coast Angels in Orange County. It is one of some 200 angel capital groups in the United States.
 The movement was inspired by Band of Angels, the first formal angel group of a dozen Silicon Valley entrepreneurs gathered by Hans Severiens, a nuclear physicist and investor, to listen to aspiring entrepreneurs and possibly take a flier on their dreams. The Band, which first met in 1994, has backed household names like Cisco Systems. It now has more than 100 members and still meets once a month to examine prospects. 
 It was advice from Mr. Severiens, who died in 2004, that encouraged Mr. Villalobos, a two-time successful entrepreneur and engineer, to persevere in forming Tech Coast Angels in 1997. At that time, he recalled, local business colleagues told him: '' 'You're crazy. There are no venture investors or technology or entrepreneurs in Orange County, other than maybe in real estate.' ''
 Yet in 10 years, Tech Coast Angels has grown to 270 members in four locales -- Orange County, Los Angeles, San Diego and Westlake/Santa Barbara -- who have invested collectively $85 million in 128 companies.
 It's a sign of how attitudes toward risk have changed in little more than a decade that seasoned executives and financial managers now readily join groups to put $200,000 to $1 million behind people with ideas and a sense of adventure. Top corporate executives with outsize pay and perks may have been heroes of American business in bygone decades, but these days the entrepreneur is king or queen and praised for creating jobs and innovation in the American economy.
 It helps that returns on angel investing have been quite attractive. ''Angel investors typically earn 5 to 10 times their money in four to eight years,'' said Mr. Villalobos, citing a PricewaterhouseCoopers Money Tree study of venture capital. But the spread of angel investing attests also to the economy's encouragement of innovation, whether in high technology or everyday products.
 For example, Richard Morganstern, a patent lawyer who is president of Los Angeles Tech Coast Angels, recalled the group's introduction to Language Weaver, a company that created a software product for automatic translation at the University of Southern California, with the aid of grants from the Defense Department. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency asked the group in 2000 to help Language Weaver become a commercial enterprise, Mr. Morganstern said.
 ''So we mentored the inventors and brought in executive talent,'' he said. ''And then in 2002, after 9/11 increased demand for Middle Eastern languages, we invested along with other venture groups.'' Today, Language Weaver, much in use in Iraq, is adding corporate customers interested in translations to Chinese and 16 other languages. 
 In April, the Orange County Tech Coast Angels invested $900,000 in YouMail, a company that adapts telephone greetings so that a group of selected callers receives a personalized message. The firm's original idea was that the service would appeal to sales agents and brokers eager to greet clients in a personal way, but Alex Quilici, YouMail's chief executive, said that his customers tended to be younger. ''Generation Y that likes to personalize everything is spreading the use of our product,'' he said.
 Angel capital groups, whose members invest their own money, pride themselves on rolling up their sleeves to help fledgling concerns. With each group member obliged to review four to eight companies a month and invest $50,000 a year in some of them, Angels say they act like a ''farm system'' doing the due diligence on small companies that traditional venture capital funds no longer take time for. 
 One Angel network, the Keiretsu Forum, founded seven years ago in Lafayette, Calif., east of San Francisco, has grown to 500 members in Colorado, Idaho and Washington as well as California. Keiretsu's size allows it to make larger investments, said Randy Williams, who started the group. (The name derives from the Japanese word for companies linked by cross-ownership of shares.)
 Two years ago, for example, Keiretsu investors backed Earth Class Mail with $1.75 million. The firm is a licensed mail receiver that can collect clients' mail, show it to them on e-mail and then, with customer approval, open the mail, scan it and show the contents on the e-mail screen. Employees traveling the world for multinational companies are customers, said the founder, Ron Wiener, ''and also today's decentralized employees who work on their own and check in for conferences to rented office suites.'' 
 For all today's enthusiasm for entrepreneurs, angel capital is not easily handed out. Gerrie Adams, co-founder of Xengaru Fun Foods of Laguna Niguel, in Orange County, tells of competing in the Tech Coast Angels Fast Pitch Competition to get expansion capital. Ms. Adams and her business partner, Anuradha Prakash, had gained Angel backing and even National Aeronautics and Space Administration recognition for the low-cholesterol and fat content of their Pizzettos pizza chips. 
 But in 2005, Xengaru needed more money to expand nationally. Ms. Adams recalled facing 300 professional investors. ''I was terrified,'' she said. ''I had 59 seconds to get my point across.'' So Ms. Adams, a former sales and marketing manager, opened her pitch with alarming statistics about childhood obesity, noted that state governments were already banning unhealthy snacks, and then related quickly that schools loved Xengaru's low-fat pizza chips because they were healthy and children loved them because they taste good. She won the right to a potential $500,000 in expansion money for Xengaru. 
 The next stage for angel capital? Not surprisingly, it's globalization. Keiretsu Forum opened a chapter in Beijing last year ''and we will open next in Shanghai,'' Mr. Williams said. There appears to be a receptive audience for entrepreneurship in China. 
 Kevin Scanlon, a member of the Los Angeles Tech Coast Angels, returned recently from China, where government officials and businesspeople ''were eager to learn how angel capital works and how we put our groups together,'' Mr. Scanlon said. ''The angel capital idea could be our next great export.'' This column about small-business trends in California and the West appears on the third Thursday of every month.

HEADLINE: Factory Output Rises, but Housing Permits Sag

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
Factory output picked up in April and groundbreaking on new homes unexpectedly rose, but permits for future home building slid to their lowest level in nearly a decade, signaling that woes continue in the housing sector. 
 A Federal Reserve report on Wednesday showed that output at factories, mines and utilities rose a greater-than-expected 0.7 percent in April. The amount of industrial capacity put to use increased to 81.6 percent, also above Wall Street forecasts.
Other Commerce Department data showed that while housing starts unexpectedly rose 2.5 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.528 million units, the rate of new building permits sank to the slowest pace since June 1997.
 The data offered a mixed picture of the economy's health, but most economists are still expecting to see tepid growth through the first half of this year as the economy squeezes out of its housing market troubles.
 ''Make no mistake about it, residential investment will take another big bite out of Q2 G.D.P.,'' said Ken Mayland, an economist and president of ClearView Economics.
 The rise in housing starts was a surprise, as economists had expected starts to slip to an annual pace of 1.49 million units in April, from the 1.518 million rate first reported for March. The government revised the March figure down to 1.491 million.
 But building permits, which signal future construction plans, dropped 8.9 percent in April, to a pace of 1.429 million units, well below expectations for 1.525 million units.
 Housing starts are down 16 percent from a year ago, and building permits were off 28.1 percent from a year ago. Pace of Growth Slows in Japan 
 TOKYO, Thursday, May 17 (AP) -- Japan's economy expanded for a ninth consecutive quarter, the government said Thursday, but the pace of growth began to slow.
 The economy expanded 0.6 percent in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter, the government said. 
 If maintained for a full year, the economy would grow 2.4 percent. 
 While the increase is the ninth quarter of growth, the pace slowed from a 5.5 percent annualized growth rate in the previous period. That was the fastest growth rate logged by Japan in three years.

HEADLINE: Sales Practices At Dell Draw New York Suit

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, announced yesterday that his office had filed a lawsuit against Dell Inc. and its Dell Financial Services unit, accusing them of deceptive business practices and of failing to provide adequate customer service. 
 At a news conference in his Manhattan office, Mr. Cuomo said the suit came after an investigation and more than 700 complaints by Dell customers in New York State.
''At Dell, customer service means no service at all,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''Dell's consumers were intentionally misled, and they had to pay for that privilege.'' 
 A spokesman for Dell, Bob Kaufman, defended the company's practices and said that its customers were generally satisfied with the services. ''While our customers remain our top priority, Dell will vigorously defend itself in court,'' Mr. Kaufman said in a statement. 
 ''We are confident that our practices will be found to be fair and appropriate,'' he said. ''While even one dissatisfied customer is too many, the allegations in the attorney general's filing are based upon a small fraction of Dell's consumer transactions in New York.'' 
 He also noted that, ''between 2003 and 2006, Dell had more than six million consumer transactions in the state of New York.''
 He said that the 700 complaints discussed by Mr. Cuomo should be viewed ''in proper context, although we don't want any customer to be dissatisfied.'' 
 Mr. Cuomo said the suit, which was filed in Albany County Supreme Court, accuses Dell of using bait-and-switch financing methods and of failing to provide customers with adequate support and repair services. 
 More specifically, he said, Dell failed to provide repair service to customers who bought contracts for onsite and expedited service. In addition, he said, Dell routinely sought to attract customers by promotional offers claiming that the financing was interest-free. Instead, the suit charges, many customers faced interest rates on their purchases that were as high as 29 percent. 
 The suit singled out Dell Financial Services, a venture of Dell and the CIT Group, which provides financing to customers on computer purchases. Mr. Cuomo said that the company had misled customers with regard to its promotional financing and rebate offers. 
 Mr. Cuomo said the suit was filed after talks with Dell executives failed to resolve the issue.

HEADLINE: Parallel Paths Diverging Sharply

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
On a hot evening this week in the Museum of Modern Art's garden, Marie-Josee Kravis, the museum president, and her husband, Henry, played host to more than 900 guests who mingled near two giant Richard Serra sculptures. Her presence was cool and reserved, and her outfit of a shimmering sequin top and dark slacks struck a conservative tone amid the sun-fired skin and tummy-hugging gowns that the wives of other moguls favored.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was there, as was Martin Scorsese -- clad in tuxedos, as were most other men. The buyout executives Leon Black and Stephen A. Schwarzman huddled in a corner, and Bruce Wasserstein, the chairman of Lazard, chatted with Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of Time Warner.
Part society gala, part networking session for the city's business titans, it was the kind of event that Ms. Kravis, who is 57, has been working with verve and diligence since her days as a young economist in Canada, making her the toast of Ottawa, Montreal and now New York. With her smile sparkling, she was far removed from the pained testimony she gave this month as a prosecution witness in the trial of her friend Conrad Black, the former chief executive of Hollinger International, where she served as board member for eight years. 
 Part of the Canadian establishment in the 1980s, they emerged together in New York business and social circles in the 1990s. Today, Ms. Kravis remains a pillar of New York society, while Mr. Black, if convicted, faces a life prison term.
 With its mix of high society and big business, the MoMA event might have appealed to Mr. Black.
 ''The essence of social life," he said in an interview in 1989, ''is to make your contacts as interesting as they can be. Many people are intellectually stimulating. Some are not, but they happen to be important. So there is some utility in my knowing them.''
 Marie-Josee Kravis, who would not comment for this article, was indeed a person worth knowing -- a charter member of the Canadian establishment, whose conservative politics and glamorous countenance gave her entree to numerous Canadian boardrooms throughout the 1980s. In 1994, her marriage to Mr. Kravis, the buyout executive, gave her an additional luster, and several months later she accepted an offer from Mr. Black to join the Hollinger Inc. board.
 Since his early days as a newspaperman in Montreal, Mr. Black has blended his business and social ambitions, packing his board with social and political dignitaries, and prosecutors say he charged to his company part of a birthday party and household expenses for a Park Avenue apartment and made liberal personal use of the company's private plane. Prosecutors say Mr. Black and others took more than $60 million from his company, and engaged in fraud by using Hollinger's money to help finance such a grand lifestyle.
 In today's era of increased scrutiny, corporate spending on social and personal matters, a once blurred line, can now be questioned by directors, shareholders and in some cases, regulators and prosecutors.
 Such indulgences can also be tiresome, as Mr. Black himself seemed to suggest when he sent an e-mail message to an associate in 2001 expressing some exasperation at having to buy a $15,000 table at a Museum of Modern Art party in honor of Ms. Kravis.
 ''I suppose in accordance with our longstanding custom of supporting our directors that we're stuck with this,'' he wrote. ''These New York charities are terribly rapacious.''
 In fact, as evidenced by some long faces and slack jaws as the evening wore on at the MoMA party, getting ahead in society can be hard work.
 ''Go very light on the vices such as carrying on in society,'' counseled Satchel Paige, the baseball pitcher and aphorist. ''The social ramble ain't restful.'' Now facing 100 years in prison, Mr. Black might well agree.
 Until recently, Ms. Kravis and Mr. Black pursued a similar path.
 With their taste for conservative politics, hunger for social advancement and ease in corporate boardrooms, Ms. Kravis and Mr. Black left their Canadian origins in the past.
 How sharply the symmetry of their respective ascents has diverged was displayed vividly this month in a Chicago courtroom.
 On the stand was Ms. Kravis, who at various times has served on the audit committee of four major corporate boards in addition to Hollinger. Watching her intently was Mr. Black.
 Subjected to a barrage of pointed questions by Mr. Black's lawyer, she admitted to missing some board meetings, to not being a financial expert as defined by new Sarbanes-Oxley requirements for audit committee members, and most crucially, to not having read parts of documents that disclosed the noncompete payments made to Mr. Black. Other audit committee members who testified were Richard Burt and former Gov. James R. Thompson of Illinois.
 Legal analysts say that by admitting that she was shown papers that described the payments, she may have undercut the prosecution's case that he schemed to steal the money.
 But for Mr. Black, the sharpest cut of all may have come with the low regard she seemed to show for the 60th-birthday party he gave for his second wife, Barbara, in 2000. Held at La Grenouille, a restaurant that caters to tastemakers on the Upper East Side, it was a lavish bid by Mr. Black to cement his place in Manhattan society, and those invited included Oscar de la Renta, Dixon Boardman and Barbara Walters.
 Prosecutors contend that this was a social gathering, not a business one as Mr. Black contends. On the stand, Ms. Kravis agreed: ''It was a birthday celebration,'' not a business event, she said. And had she attended the party?
 ''Only the last 15 or 30 minutes,'' she replied flatly. ''I had another obligation that evening.''
 For a woman used to wielding her influence in the privacy of closed boardrooms and evening dinner parties, the Black trial was a rude blast of publicity. But it was not the first time she had been thrust uncomfortably into the spotlight.
 In 1976, Ms. Kravis, then known as Marie-Josee Drouin, was a 27-year-old economist working at the Hudson Institute in Canada. According to The Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper, Ms. Drouin became embroiled in a controversy when she flew free of charge to a holiday in Mexico with Jean-Pierre Goyer, a cabinet minister in the government of Pierre Trudeau whom she had previously served as an executive assistant. Such a privilege was supposed to be accorded only to family members. In offering an explanation, Mr. Goyer, who was living apart from his wife although not legally separated, said Ms. Drouin, who was single, was his common-law wife.
 B. Bruce-Briggs, the author of ''Supergenius,'' an independently published biography of Herman Kahn, the founder of the Hudson Institute, recalled that Ms. Kravis escaped the headlines by locking herself in her house in Ottawa for 72 hours.
 ''She was embarrassed,'' he recalled. ''But she had a stiff upper lip and she adjusted her makeup and moved on.''
 Her willingness to work long hours, an ability to communicate on television or in print in French and English and a well-honed glamorous side would make Ms. Kravis indispensable to a series of powerful men who would support her career over the coming decades. They included Mr. Kahn; Paul G. Desmarais Sr., the head of one of Canada's wealthiest families; and the former prime minister, Brian Mulroney, as well as Mr. Black.
 ''I knew she would go far,'' said Claude Frenette, a financial executive who gave Ms. Drouin her first job as a graduate of the University of Ottawa.
 She became head of the Hudson Institute in Canada, and her public stature grew through a serious of columns that she wrote for The Financial Post. 
 In 1987, she joined the board of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, perhaps the most prestigious corporate board in Canada; Mr. Black had long been a member.
 According to her testimony, it was through the bank's board that she came to know Mr. Black. She soon became part of his expanding social world, attending such luminous events as the annual Hollinger dinner in 1989, when President Ronald Reagan spoke.
 In 1994, after her marriage to Mr. Kravis -- for both of them it was their third -- Ms. Kravis moved to New York.
 People who know Mr. Black say he is an imperious, headstrong man and not one to take criticism easily. Yet in 2003, as Hollinger came under scrutiny, it was Ms. Kravis who, according to her testimony, advised him ''to be a little more humble'' toward his antagonists. She was, however, one of the first major directors to resign as the scandal broke, doing so in late 2003 in a serious public relations blow for Mr. Black.
 As she acknowledged on the witness stand, her role in Hollinger's downfall has been embarrassing. On the stand, she admitted to receiving a notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission saying that she might be under investigation, although the commission did not bring any action against her. Stung by the Hollinger experience, she has resigned from her major corporate boards, including Ford Motor, Vivendi and IAC/InterActiveCorp.
 ''She was an excellent director,'' said Barry Diller, the chief executive of IAC. ''But she said this has become an unpleasant process.''
 Now, she has assumed the full trappings of the billionaire's wife: she is an active trustee and past chairwoman of the Robin Hood Foundation and is in the middle of a five-year term as president of MoMA, where she has used her corporate ties to energize and deepen support for MoMA from business leaders. 
 ''Marie-Josee is a serious person,'' said Jerry I. Speyer, a real estate executive and fellow MoMA trustee. ''And she is not a lady who goes to lunch. She is successful in her own right and not just because she married Henry.''
 She and Mr. Kravis split time among homes in Southampton, N.Y.; Paris; and New York.
 For some close followers of Mr. Black, it was this rapidly elevated status that enhanced the couple's taste for the luxurious lifestyle that would prove to be his undoing.
 ''The Kravises were a role model for Conrad and Barbara,'' said Peter C. Newman, a biographer. ''It was the jets, it was Palm Beach and it was New York society where they wanted to be accepted. And that is where the trouble started, because Marie-Josee's husband was a billionaire and Conrad was only a millionaire.''

HEADLINE: Global Coalition to Make Buildings Energy-Efficient

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN and PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
A coalition of 16 of the world's biggest cities, five banks, one former president and companies and groups that modernize aging buildings on Wednesday pledged investments of billions of dollars to cut urban energy use and releases of heat-trapping gases linked to global warming.
 Under a plan developed through the William J. Clinton Foundation, participating banks would provide up to $1 billion each in loans that cities or private landlords would use to upgrade energy-hungry heating, cooling and lighting systems in older buildings.
The loans and interest would be paid back with savings accrued through reduced energy costs, organizers of the initiative said at a news conference in Manhattan. Typically, such upgrades can cut energy use and costs by 20 percent to 50 percent, they said.
 Many scientists consider making more efficient use of energy to be the best starting point for addressing global warming, particularly because there is a potential immediate financial payoff along with the long-term environmental benefit. 
 At the news conference, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York said that investing in retrofitting existing buildings was vital because they would make up 85 percent of the buildings that will stand in New York City in 2030. 
 Mr. Bloomberg said banks and corporations appeared to be grasping the importance of considering long-term environmental risks when making investments.
 ''Major business and financial institutions increasingly understand that shrinking the world's carbon footprint is a pro-growth strategy, indeed the only pro-growth strategy for the long term,'' he said.
 Energy use in buildings accounts for about a third of global releases of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. In densely populated older cities, like New York City and London, buildings are the dominant source of the gases.
 The first targets under the initiative, organizers said, would be municipal buildings in the participating cities, which are Bangkok; Berlin; Chicago; Houston; Johannesburg; Karachi, Pakistan; London; Melbourne, Australia; Mexico City; Mumbai, India; New York; Rome; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Seoul, South Korea; Tokyo; and Toronto.
 The project is intended to propel energy-saving investments that otherwise tend not to happen even when long-term financial benefits are clear -- because cities or property owners lack access to capital, organizers said.
 Also yesterday, the National Academy of Sciences and the scientific academies of 12 other countries issued a joint statement calling on world leaders to address global warming by increasing energy efficiency, promoting a shift to less-polluting energy sources and intensifying research into new energy technologies that produce no emissions. 
 ''Increasing energy efficiency is a first crucial step toward solving the climate-energy problem,'' the statement said. It emphasized the importance of developing financial mechanisms for encouraging such investments and on sharing technology and information that could spur such changes. 
 The plan was announced at the end of a three-day meeting of mayors, business leaders and environmental experts organized by former President Bill Clinton's foundation and other partners as part of a two-year-old initiative intended to advance local actions that could blunt global warming. 
 ''Climate change is a global problem that requires local action,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''The businesses, banks and cities partnering with my foundation are addressing the issue of global warming because it's the right thing to do, but also because it's good for their bottom line.'' 
 ''They're going to save money, make money, create jobs and have a tremendous collective impact on climate change all at once,'' he continued.
 Mr. Clinton's remarks on climate change have been a talking point this spring for his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, as she pursues the Democratic nomination for president in 2008. Because Mrs. Clinton has yet to give a major speech on climate change, her campaign views Mr. Clinton's highly visible work on the matter as a political plus.
 Advisers to Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, are keen to avoid ceding the political issue of global warming and climate change to another Democratic candidate -- or, especially, to former Vice President Al Gore, who has helped to make climate change a civic and political cause worldwide.
 As president, Mr. Clinton drew some criticism for not seeking Senate approval of the climate treaty that requires industrialized countries to cut emissions. The Bush administration has rejected that treaty, the Kyoto Protocol.
 Yesterday, Mr. Clinton said the strength of the new initiative was that it would quickly produce concrete change on the ground, demonstrating that a transition away from fossil fuels need not be a burden on economies of rich or developing countries. 
 ''We all know that this is a global problem that requires a successor to Kyoto and national legislation,'' he said, ''but we also know that as you reduce greenhouse gas emissions you must do it place by place, specifically company by company, building by building. The mayors are in a remarkable position to do this.''
 Several experts not involved with the Clinton foundation project said it appeared to be a valuable initial step in limiting the human impact on climate.
 One challenge, said Thomas J. Wilbanks, an expert on energy and climate at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, is that the accelerating building boom in fast-growing developing countries means that investing in making new buildings energy efficient will be far more important in the long run than tightening up old ones. 
 ''Potentials for energy-saving retrofits are significant in industrialized countries,'' Dr. Wilbanks said, ''but the real challenge in rapidly growing developing countries is increasing the efficiency of new building construction.'' 
 Dr. Wilbanks, who was also an author of one of the recent United Nations climate reports, said that ''the greatest value of this initiative is that it jump-starts an inevitable global process of making buildings more energy-efficient.'' 
 The first step under the Clinton foundation's retrofitting project will be energy audits of older municipal buildings, identifying systems or structures that could be replaced, organizers said. 
 The financing of the upgrades is being designed by the Clinton Climate Initiative, set up by the foundation and Hannon Armstrong, a company specializing in arranging such investments, along with the participating banks, Citigroup, UBS, Deutsche Bank, ABN Amro and JPMorgan Chase & Company.
 The upgrades would be done by four international energy-services companies that are already seeing a booming business in these types of conversions. They would guarantee a certain level of energy and monetary savings for particular projects under the plan.
 The influx of capital from the new project could potentially double global business in such energy upgrades, which is several billion dollars a year now, bankers and business representatives said. 
 ''I've been involved in a couple billion dollars' worth of projects in the last several years,'' said Bob Dixon, senior vice president of Siemens Building Technologies, one of the energy-services companies. ''They've all paid for themselves in energy savings.''

HEADLINE: Students Gain Only Marginally on Test of U.S. History

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Federal officials reported yesterday that students in 4th, 8th and 12th grades had scored modestly higher on an American history test than five years earlier, although more than half of high school seniors still showed poor command of basic facts like the effect of the cotton gin on the slave economy or the causes of the Korean War.
 Federal officials said they considered the results encouraging because at each level tested, student performance had improved since the last time the exam was administered, in 2001. 
 ''In U.S. history there were higher scores in 2006 for all three grades,'' said Mark Schneider, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, which administers the test, at a Boston news conference that the Education Department carried by Webcast.
 The results were less encouraging on a national civics test, on which only fourth graders made any progress. 
 The best results in the history test were also in fourth grade, where 70 percent of students attained the basic level of achievement or better.
 The test results in the two subjects are likely to be closely studied, because Congress is considering the renewal of President Bush's signature education law, the No Child Left Behind Act. 
 A number of studies have shown that because No Child Left Behind requires states to administer annual tests in math and reading, and punishes schools where scores in those subjects fail to rise, many schools have reduced time spent on other subjects, including history. In a recent study, Martin West, an education professor at Brown, used federal data to show that during 2003-4, first- and sixth-grade teachers spent 23 fewer minutes a week on history than during 1999-2000. 
 Given such circumstances, lawmakers and educators are likely to puzzle over why achievement in history has increased. Some suggested that the fourth-grade results were tied to better reading skills.
 The tests, known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, divide achievement levels into basic, proficient and advanced. The 2006 history assessment had the highest percentage of 12th-grade students scoring below basic of any subject tested in 2005 and 2006. And only 1 percent of students at any grade level scored at the advanced level. 
 The history test was given to a national sample of 29,200 4th-, 8th- and 12th-grade students. Among the results were these:
 Some 47 percent of the 12th graders performed at the basic level or above. In 2001, 43 percent were at or above basic. 
 Sixty-five percent of eighth graders achieved the basic level or better, up from 62 percent six years ago.
 Seventy percent of fourth graders attained or exceeded the basic level, compared with 66 percent in 2001. Even this result, however, left 30 percent who, for instance, lacked an ability to identify even the most familiar historic figures or explain the reasons for celebrating national holidays.
 ''It's heartwarming that the test organizers have found positive things to say, but this report is not anything to break out the Champagne over,'' said Theodore K. Rabb, a professor of history at Princeton who advocates devoting more classroom time to the subject.
 The civics exam was given to a national sample of 25,300 4th, 8th and 12th graders. Seventy-three percent of fourth-grade pupils performed at the basic level or better, up from 69 percent in 1998, the last time the civics exam was administered. The scores of 8th and 12th graders showed no change.
 ''What is most discouraging is that as students grow older and progress through the grades towards adulthood and eligibility to vote, their civic knowledge and dispositions seems to grow weaker,'' said David W. Gordon, superintendent of the Sacramento County School District in California, who is a member of the board that sets policies for the test.
 Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings seized on yesterday's results to rebut critics who argue that the federal law has narrowed the curriculum. 
 ''When students know how to read and comprehend,'' Ms. Spellings said, ''they apply these skills to other subjects like history and civics.''
 But Kim Kozbial-Hess, a fourth-grade teacher from Toledo, Ohio, who is a member of the assessment board, argued that the test results were not promising enough to justify the federal law's focus on reading and math alone.
 ''Are we doing well enough in U.S. history that it should continue to be left out of the No Child Left Behind legislation?'' she asked at the Boston news conference. 
 In Washington, Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, reintroduced a bill on Wednesday based on the premise that the National Assessment gave history short shrift, testing it every five to seven years instead of every other year as with reading and math. Their legislation would require national history tests every four years, with more students tested.
 David McCullough, John Hope Franklin, Douglas Brinkley and dozens of other prominent historians have sent Congress a petition urging the bill's passage.

HEADLINE: Reports Show Wealth as a Common Factor Among 2008 Contenders

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Russ Buettner contributed reporting from New York, and Leslie Wayne from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, who just six years ago told a divorce court he had only $7,000 in assets under his control, has amassed a net worth of more than $30 million, much of it from paid speeches. 
 Former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, who has spent the last three years crusading against poverty, also reported about $30 million in assets. His income included nearly half a million dollars for advising an elite investment fund and $40,000 for directing a poverty studies program at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. 
Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Edwards reported their assets in personal financial disclosure forms released Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission. Federal election laws require all the presidential candidates to file the forms. Together, they offer a glimpse of the general affluence of all the primary candidates and the truly extreme wealth of a few.
 Neither Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, nor Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, is the richest of the White House hopefuls. That title belongs to Mitt Romney, a founder of the private equity firm Bain Capital, who has said he expects to report as much as $350 million in assets, including a trust for his heirs. Mr. Romney and Senator John McCain of Arizona, both Republicans, and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, have all received extensions of the filing deadline for their forms.
 Mr. Giuliani's $30 million fortune is the most unexpected information to emerge from the disclosure forms so far. During his divorce from Donna Hanover in June 2001, a lawyer for Mr. Giuliani said he had only $7,000 in personal money ''under his control.'' His salary as mayor of New York at the time was about $195,000, and his local financial disclosure forms showed less than $800,000 in deferred compensation, pension, retirement and mutual funds. He had also signed a contract to write two books for an advance of $3 million.
 The latest disclosure form suggests that his biggest source of income was speeches, capitalizing on his celebrity after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. For the period covered by the form -- roughly the calendar year 2006 -- Mr. Giuliani reported making 124 speeches for as much as $200,000 each and earning a total of about $11.4 million. 
 Self-help and motivational rallies were his top audiences. He made about 26 speeches at events staged by Get Motivated Seminars, the company of the impresario Zig Ziglar, and 8 more at major events put on by the executive education group HSM. 
 Mr. Giuliani put a value of $5 million to $25 million on his stake in his consulting firm, Giuliani & Company, which he said paid him about $4.1 million last year. He said he received about $1.2 million in income from his law firm, Bracewell & Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani, who opened a New York office for what had been a Texas firm, said the $1.2 million he received reflected a guaranteed payment of $1 million a year from the firm, plus 7.5 percent of the New York office's revenue.
 Mr. Giuliani's book has apparently sold well enough to earn royalties covering his $3 million advance; he reported $146,092 in book royalties in 2006. In addition, Mr. Giuliani reported $496 in theatrical royalties. A spokesman for his campaign said Mr. Giuliani earned that money for playing himself in the films ''Anger Management'' and ''The Out-of-Towners,'' as well as for guest appearances on the television programs ''Law & Order'' and ''Saturday Night Live.'' 
 Mr. Edwards, who earned his millions as a trial lawyer before running for the Senate in 1998, reported assets worth $14.3 million to $44.7 million in 2004. Since leaving office that year, he has devoted most of his energy to promoting efforts to help the poor, but he has recently faced questions about signing on part time in 2005 as an adviser to the hedge fund manager Fortress Investment Group. 
 Like many hedge funds -- loosely regulated investment companies open only to the rich -- some Fortress funds are incorporated in the Cayman Islands to avoid taxes. Fortress has invested in a firm that lent high-interest rate mortgages to low-income homeowners. A recent wave of foreclosures on such so-called subprime mortgages has elicited accusations from Mr. Edwards and others that some firms had engaged in predatory lending. Mr. Edwards has said he was not involved in any specific Fortress investments in that business.
 Mr. Edwards's financial disclosure form shows that he received $479,512 from Fortress in 2006; the forms did not cover 2005. In addition, the forms show that Mr. Edwards sold several million dollars in other assets to personally invest in Fortress funds. His disclosure form put the value of his holdings in Fortress funds at $11.2 million to $24.7 million.
 Mr. Edwards has said he joined Fortress both to make money and to learn about finance. 
 Mr. Edwards's campaign said he gave $350,000 to charities in 2006, including $333,334 in book royalties.
 Eric Schultz, a spokesman for Mr. Edwards, said: ''The bottom line is, if you look at where John Edwards comes from and his record, it's clear what makes him tick: helping those who haven't been as blessed as he has been. John Edwards is running for president to give every American the opportunities that he's had.''
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, another Democratic candidate, also disclosed an investment of more than $50,000 in the Fortress Investment Group. Mr. Dodd reported total assets of more than $1.5 million and a cottage in County Galway, Ireland, that he valued at $100,000 to $250,000. 
 Not all the candidates were so flush. Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, reported assets worth hundreds of thousands of dollars but also said he owed more than $30,000 in car loans and more than $75,000 in credit card debt. His was the only disclosure form to be filled out in handwriting.
 Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a Democrat, reported owning more than $100,000 in stock and options worth at least $250,000 in a major oil refiner on whose board he once sat. 
 Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican, reported assets valued at less than $700,000, including his retirement benefits as a former Southern Baptist minister. He earned about $150,000 in royalties from his book about his weight loss. 
 Representative Ron Paul of Texas, a libertarian-minded Republican who often warns that excessive government threatens the economy, has put his pessimism into his portfolio. If the dollar collapses, Mr. Paul will be ready: his favorite investments are real estate, silver and gold.

HEADLINE: Democrats Agree on a $2.9 Trillion Budget

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
House and Senate Democratic leaders reached agreement on Wednesday on a $2.9 trillion budget for 2008 that envisions a return to budget surpluses by 2012 and assumes that some of President Bush's tax cuts will be allowed to expire.
 The five-year blueprint, which is primarily a declaration of basic principles, represents a broad alternative to President Bush's agenda. It calls for more money for children's health care, education and a wide variety of other domestic programs. 
While it calls for a two-year extension of Mr. Bush's tax cuts for middle-class families, which are now set to expire at the end of 2010, it assumes that Mr. Bush's signature tax cuts on stock dividends, as well as rate cuts for people in top brackets, will be allowed to expire. 
 The House and Senate are expected to vote on Thursday on the plan, and both are likely to pass it. That in itself would be a significant accomplishment, one that eluded Republicans, torn over spending cuts, when they were in control of Congress last year.
 ''It moves us in the right direction and to balance in five years,'' said Representative John M. Spratt Jr., Democrat of South Carolina, the chairman of the House Budget Committee. ''On all the basics, our budget is better than the president's.''
 Republicans denounced the plan, saying it would inevitably lead to huge tax increases that would jeopardize economic growth.
 ''This bill looks like it's promising the largest tax increase in American history,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. ''It basically puts the government and spenders first, and taxpayers at the end of the line.''
 Democrats insisted that the plan need not lead to any tax increases, saying that they had assumed the same amount of revenue as President Bush had and could plug budget gaps by cracking down on tax cheats, offshore tax havens and abusive tax shelters.
 As a practical matter, the Democratic plan postpones many of the hardest budget decisions. None of Mr. Bush's tax cuts expire until the end of 2010, and the new budget agreement extends the most popular tax cuts two more years.
 Nor does the Democratic plan envision a permanent fix to the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax originally aimed at the very rich that has begun to engulf tens of millions of other families because it has not been adjusted for inflation. Repealing the alternative minimum tax, or simply freezing it at current levels, would cost more than $1 trillion over the next decade.
 The budget also calls for several new spending initiatives without saying where the money would come from. 
 For example, it calls for spending an additional $50 billion over five years on the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or Schip, which provides health insurance for children in low-income families. But the budget does not have enough money for that expansion. Instead, House and Senate lawmakers included the expansion in a ''reserve fund,'' which is not a fund at all but rather a commitment to pay for the program once Congress figures out where to raise the money.
 In deference to conservative Democrats in the Senate, the resolution pledges to use $180 billion -- most of that from a projected surplus of $132 billion in 2012 -- to extend the so-called middle-class tax cuts through the end of that year. 
 Those cuts include the $1,000 child tax credit, a reduction in the so-called marriage penalty for two-income families and the special 10 percent tax bracket for low-income taxpayers.
 The list does not include Mr. Bush's rate reductions for people in higher tax brackets, his tax cuts on stock dividends and capital gains or a complete repeal of the estate tax on inherited wealth.
 The plan assumes that the war in Iraq will not require financing after 2009, an assumption that could prove wrong but one that Mr. Bush made in his budget as well. 
 The Bush administration quickly attacked the plan, threatening to veto any specific spending bills that exceeded the president's budget request.
 ''The Democratic majorities are standing by their misguided plans for tax hikes and big spending increases,'' Rob Portman, the White House budget director, said in a statement. ''Tax and spend is no way to balance the budget.''
 Republicans contend that Mr. Bush's tax cuts for high-income families, especially the tax cuts on investment income, have spurred strong economic growth for the past five years and ultimately helped reduce the federal deficit.
 Indeed, tax revenues are increasing sharply, and the budget deficit for 2007 is likely to decline to less than $200 billion this year -- the third year in a row of shrinking deficits. 
 But budget experts in both parties say that trend will provide little comfort over the longer term. Spending on old-age entitlement programs, Medicare and Social Security, is expected to explode over the next decade as a result of rapid increases in prices for medical care and the looming retirement of millions of baby boomers.

HEADLINE: Biggest Building Site in Manhattan Up for Auction

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
It is the largest building site left in Manhattan, 26 acres on the Far West Side, where the Bloomberg administration envisions the equivalent of five Empire State Buildings rising on $1 billion worth of concrete columns over bustling railyards.
 And starting next month, some of the city's biggest developers will have a chance to bid for the rights to make that grand -- some say grandiose -- plan real.
''The city hasn't done anything like this before, certainly not in Midtown,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding. ''We want to create a 21st-century Rockefeller Center.''
 Known as Hudson Yards, the project is central to one of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's longstanding ambitions: to transform the heavily industrial Far West Side into the city's third business district, after Wall Street and Midtown, with not just high-rise office and apartment towers, hotels and parks, but also an expanded Jacob K. Javits Convention Center nearby. 
 The challenges are daunting. Developers say it will probably cost $1 billion to build platforms over the yards for skyscrapers as tall as 70 stories, and the work must be done while Long Island Rail Road trains are running. Some residents want assurances that the development will include permanent housing for poor and working-class families. And a sharp debate is emerging over whether to tear down the northern end of the High Line, an unused railroad structure that is being converted to an elevated park south of 30th Street.
 The plan, which is likely to take more than a decade to complete, calls for the construction of 12.4 million square feet of commercial, residential, recreational and cultural space over the railyards, which span 11th Avenue between 30th and 33rd Streets. It is Mr. Bloomberg's second attempt at developing the yards: His first attempt, which involved building a $2.1 billion stadium for the Jets football team, crumbled in the face of opposition in the neighborhood and in Albany.
 The city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the land, are working together to develop the railyards. The project must go through the city's lengthy land-use review process, but unlike the plan for a football stadium, it will not require approvals in Albany.
 The city and transit officials say they will begin an auction for development rights over the parcel next month, and they expect five of the city's biggest developers to bid. They also plan to hire a contractor this summer to begin drilling work for the extension of the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to 11th Avenue and 34th Street. 
 ''The Hudson Yards are one of the most expensive and complicated developments ever to be undertaken,'' said the developer Douglas Durst. 
 Mr. Durst has formed a partnership with Vornado Realty Trust to bid for the property. Extell Development Company also expects to bid, as does Brookfield Properties, and Tishman Speyer Properties, which real estate executives say may have an alliance with Lehman Brothers as a tenant. Tishman Speyer declined to comment, but if such a collaboration exists, the company would immediately jump to the front of the race. 
 Debate over the plan has focused on two potentially conflicting demands: that the development provide public benefits, like subsidized housing, parks and other amenities, and that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority get the highest possible price for the land.
 Developers insist that any requirements for affordable housing or parks will increase their costs by $100 million, reducing the price they can pay. Critics contend that the sale of public land should lead to community benefits, and that the cost of those benefits is a small price to pay for a rare commodity: land in Manhattan.
 ''It's a vast undertaking, and it pitches these competing public goals against each other,'' said Anna Levin, a member of Community Board 4. ''I understand that the entire burden shouldn't be placed on developers. But this is a public undertaking. There have to be public resources that can be brought to bear, otherwise this will become a gold coast that doesn't serve the entire city.''
 Although the Bloomberg administration failed to win legislative support to build the football stadium over the railyards in 2005, it did succeed in a more far-reaching goal: rezoning a wide swath of the West Side, including 45 blocks outside the railyards, for large-scale development. However, the portion of the railyards west of 11th Avenue still needs to be rezoned and to go through a public review process. 
 Last year, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rebuffed the city's offer to buy the development rights to the yards for $500 million, saying it was too little. The two sides then agreed to create a strategic development plan for the yards, which is now complete, and put them up for sale.
 The winning bidder would be assured of state and city support -- though not necessarily community backing -- during the lengthy public review, which can be unpredictable for a developer. Last week, the city and state publicly unveiled the plan, which calls for up to 5.7 million square feet of residential and commercial development on the western portion of the yards.
 Under the proposal, towers as high as 70 stories are pushed to the north and south sides of both the western and eastern yards. There is public space at the center of the eastern yard that would connect to a tree-lined boulevard that the city wants to build from 39th to 33rd Streets between 10th and 11th Avenues. The open space is designed to draw pedestrians across the western yard, to the waterfront.
 One of the thorniest issues concerns the fate of the High Line, which some people want converted into a park all the way to its northern terminus inside the Hudson Yards area. The city already plans to turn the railway into a park from 30th Street south to Gansevoort Street, where the mere promise of an elevated park has helped spur a residential boomlet in west Chelsea. 
 But state and city officials have expressed concern that keeping the High Line inside Hudson Yards could impede the already difficult task of construction. At least one critic, Mr. Durst, said retaining the line would add $100 million to the cost of construction.
 ''Any additional complications will subtract from the value the M.T.A. receives, and leaving the High Line in place will have a substantial effect on that value,'' Mr. Durst said.
 But Friends of the High Line, an advocacy group, contends that retaining the rail structure will cost only about $800,000, with the benefits outweighing any problems.
 ''You don't often have the opportunity to take a piece of the city's industrial infrastructure and reuse it in an interesting way, to connect west Chelsea, Hudson Yards and the waterfront,'' said Robert Hammond, a leader of the group. ''It'll be a great park that'll serve the city as well as Central Park.''
 At a community board meeting last week, an official with the transportation authority said for the first time that the authority supported retaining the High Line, although it also wanted to maximize revenues for rail operations. Privately, one official indicated that the authority did not want the High Line venture to cost it more than $25 million.
 Elliot G. Sander, the executive director of the authority, said he was trying to work out the housing issue and had set aside land controlled by the authority outside the railyards for subsidized apartments. Officials say bidders will be asked to submit offers based on keeping or demolishing the High Line.
 There are other snags in the Bloomberg administration's plans for the Far West Side. The long-awaited expansion of the Javits Convention Center is stalled while the Spitzer administration continues its review of the $1.8 billion project, which has come under criticism from trade show producers. That, in turn, has held up plans to sell land across 11th Avenue from the Javits center, for a convention center hotel, as well as the block between the center and the western railyard.
 But the administration is eager to show progress while the real estate market is hot. So officials say the request for bids on the railyards will be issued no later than early June. 
 ''This is for the future of New York, so it's not going to be done overnight,'' said Stephen M. Ross of the Related Companies, one of the city's most active developers. ''I don't think there's ever been anything like this, on this scale.''

HEADLINE: The President and Wolfowitz

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
As Paul Wolfowitz is to the World Bank, the U.S. is becoming to the world.
 We should look at the battle unfolding at the World Bank not as the story of one man falling to earth, but as a moral tale of the risks the U.S. faces unless the Bush administration spends more time rebuilding bridges it has burned all over the world.
Mr. Wolfowitz genuinely aspired to help Africa develop, but he ended up isolated, friendless and vulnerable; receiving no credit for his genuine accomplishments; and unable to make progress on the issues he cares about. And the U.S. is in a similar position today. 
 The similarity arises in part because although President Bush's best-known role has been as a conservative hawk -- and everything he has done in that role has been a disaster -- he has also aspired to fight poverty and help Africa. And Mr. Bush has genuinely scored some major accomplishments as a humanitarian. 
 O.K., pick yourself off the floor: It's true. In the world of foreign aid, Mr. Bush has done better than almost anyone realizes -- or gives him credit for. It's his only significant positive legacy, and it consists of four elements.
 First and most important, Mr. Bush started Pepfar, his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Africa -- the best single thing he has done in his life. It's a huge increase over earlier programs and will save more than 9 million lives. Granted, it has been too ideological about promoting ''abstinence only'' programs, but at the grass-roots level it is increasingly pragmatic (don't tell the White House, but the U.S. still gives out far more condoms than any other country). 
 Second, Mr. Bush started a major new foreign aid program, the millennium challenge account. This involves giving large sums to countries selected for their good governance and from top to bottom reflects smart new approaches to foreign aid.
 Third, the Bush administration elevated sex trafficking on the international agenda. Mr. Bush spoke about it to the U.N., and he appointed a first-rate ambassador for the issue, John Miller, who until his resignation late last year hectored and sanctioned foreign countries into curbing this form of modern slavery. (Alas, since Mr. Miller left, the administration's anti-trafficking efforts have faltered.)
 Fourth, Mr. Bush has begun to focus attention and funds on malaria, which kills more than 1 million people a year in poor countries and imposes a huge economic burden on Africa in particular. 
 So why doesn't Mr. Bush get any credit for these achievements? Partly, I think, because he never seems very interested in them himself. And partly because, like Mr. Wolfowitz, Mr. Bush's approach to governing is to circle the wagons rather than build coalitions; they both antagonize fence-sitters by coming across as unilateralist, sanctimonious, arrogant and incompetent.
 In December, the White House held an event to call attention to malaria. But Mr. Bush's staff barred me from attending: They apparently didn't want coverage of malaria if it came from a columnist they didn't like. 
 I can't recall an administration as suspicious and partisan as this one, one so disinclined to outreach, one that so openly adheres to the ancient Roman maxim of Oderint dum metuant: Let them hate, so long as they fear. 
 So Mr. Bush, unwilling to concede any error, unwilling to reach out, unwilling to shuffle his cabinet, staggers on. And the U.S. itself has been tainted by the same haughtiness; long after Mr. Wolfowitz has gone, and even after Mr. Bush has gone, the next president will have to detoxify our relations with the rest of the world.
 Moreover, even in those areas where Mr. Bush has done well, like foreign aid, our strained relations with the rest of the world have undermined our ability to succeed. Indeed, Bill Clinton (who wasn't nearly as generous with foreign aid as Mr. Bush when he was in the White House) has shown in recent years how much can be accomplished when a leader cooperates with partners on issues like AIDS and development. If Mr. Clinton were pursuing Mr. Bush's development agenda, it would be in a flurry of meetings and visits and multilateralism that would be far more effective in seeing that agenda put in place.
 But instead the international stage is riven in ways that mirror the World Bank itself. And it looks as if we're drifting toward the end of a failed presidency of the United States that parallels Mr. Wolfowitz's failed presidency of the World Bank.

HEADLINE: Mixed News About Housing Only Briefly Slows the Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street shot higher yesterday after investors shrugged off a mixed reading on the housing sector and focused on a jump in industrial output, a retreat in crude oil prices and new cash pouring into the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 103 points to another record.
 An early rally was punctured by a Commerce Department report that showed that housing construction unexpectedly rose in April but that building permit applications fell by the biggest number in 17 years. But stocks gradually regained strength as a Federal Reserve report showed that industrial output rose more than expected in April, and crude and gasoline inventories rebounded, causing crude oil prices to pull back. 
News that the billionaires Warren E. Buffett, Edward S. Lampert and Carl C. Icahn were increasing their equity investments also gave investors confidence that stocks would climb further, although the Dow has risen more than 1,300 points in the last two months.
 ''We seem to be in a period of time where it doesn't make a difference what the news is -- the market seems to find a reason to go up,'' said Ron Kiddoo, chief investment officer at Cozad Asset Management. ''How long will this last? It's anybody's guess.''
 The Dow rose 103.69 points, to 13,487.53, and also hit an intraday trading high, 13,489.57.
 Broader stock indicators also advanced. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 12.95 points, to 1,514.14, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 22.13 points, to 2,547.42.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.02 points, to 820.20.
 Light crude oil fell 62 cents, to $62.55 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude prices have risen in recent sessions amid concerns about supply disruptions, particularly in Nigeria, but yesterday's federal inventory data showed that domestic gasoline and crude inventories rose more than expected last week -- a development that investors hope will help pump prices drop under $3 a gallon.
 Sectors that are helped by falling oil prices, like airlines, showed strength. United Airlines' parent, UAL, advanced $1.32, to $34.62; Continental Airlines rose $1.48, to $37.83; and American Airlines' parent, AMR, gained $1.28, to $26.66.
 Investors also embraced the Fed's report that industrial output rose by 0.7 percent in April. The gain was more than double the 0.3 percent gain that had been expected, in part reflecting a rebound in manufacturing. In March, output fell 0.3 percent.
 In corporate news, Citigroup, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrials, rose $2.12, to $54.91, after Mr. Lampert, the hedge fund manager, said he acquired more than 15 million shares.
 Mr. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, reported in a regulatory filing that it doubled its stake in Johnson & Johnson, also a Dow component. Johnson & Johnson rose $1.23, to $63.05.
 In another sign that liquidity is high and likely to keep buoying stocks, Mr. Icahn's fund disclosed a new stake of 3.1 million shares in the oil and gas producer Anadarko Petroleum and a new stake of 2.7 million shares in CSX. Anadarko rose 73 cents, to $47.20, and CSX rose 66 cents, to $46.40.
 Injecting the market with an extra dose of confidence, corporate takeover activity keeps soaring. Bausch & Lomb, the maker of eye care products, rose $6, to $67.50, after a private equity firm, Warburg Pincus, struck a $4.5 billion deal to acquire the company, which has faced product recalls and accounting troubles.
 The price of the 10-year Treasury note slipped 2/32, to 9811/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.71 percent, from 4.70 percent.
 Advancing issues outnumbered those declining by about five to three on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.51 billion shares, from 1.64 billion on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Conference Board's Outlook Points to a Summer Slowdown

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A gauge of future economic activity forecasts that the nation's economy will slow in coming months, reversing recent gains, and suggests that higher gas prices and a sluggish construction industry are beginning to take their toll. 
 The Conference Board said Thursday that its index of leading economic indicators fell 0.5 percent in April, deeper than the 0.1 decline analysts were expecting. The index is designed to forecast economic activity over the next three to six months.
The decline, which almost reversed an amended 0.6 percent increase in March, should relieve pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, analysts said.
 ''The data may be pointing to slower economic conditions this summer,'' said Ken Goldstein, labor economist for the Conference Board. ''With the industrial core of the economy already slow, and housing mired in a continued slump, there are some signs that these weaknesses may be beginning to soften both consumer spending and hiring this summer,'' Mr. Goldstein said.
 The reading tracks 10 economic indicators. Two of those readings were positive in April: stock prices and real money supply.
 The negative indicators, beginning with the largest, were building permits, weekly unemployment claims, manufacturers' new orders for nondefense capital goods, consumer expectations, vendor performance, average weekly manufacturing hours and interest rate spread.
 With the latest decline, the cumulative change in the index over the last six months has dropped 0.2 percent.
 The slowdown should ease concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. 
 The Conference Board's report came amid a batch of mixed economic data, reflecting the uncertainty over the direction of the economy.
 The job market showed surprising strength Thursday, with the Labor Department reporting a drop in jobless claims. The number of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits last week fell for a fifth straight week, to the lowest level in four months.
 ''The job market is holding together better than any other part of the economy. Otherwise, we might be sliding into a recession,'' Mr. Zandi said.
 A better-than-expected picture of the industrial sector also bolstered investors' confidence this week, but mixed housing figures offered a more measured dose of optimism. Construction of new homes rose in April, but housing starts fell to their lowest level in 17 years.
 ''If you add up the plethora of economic data, it shows expansion will continue but that it's soft,'' Mr. Zandi said.

HEADLINE: Paid Sick Leave

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 As a physician, I applaud Bob Herbert for his insightful May 15 column about the importance of paid sick days for American workers. I've been saying for years that the coughing, sneezing and flu-like symptoms among workers in restaurants and other public places are a public health hazard. 
These employees deserve the same benefit afforded the rest of us: the chance to recover from their illnesses without paying an economic price. And just as important, the public deserves the chance to have food prepared and served by people who are healthy and not spreading viral and bacterial illnesses. Robert T. London, M.D. New York, May 15, 2007 The writer is a medical columnist.

HEADLINE: U.N. Rejects Belarus for Seat on Its Rights Panel

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 17 

 BODY:
Belarus, one of the world's most repressive states, was blocked Thursday from gaining membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council after being outvoted in favor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a late entry. 
 Human rights groups had been campaigning for weeks to head off the once seemingly assured choice of Belarus after the Eastern European group submitted only Belarus and Slovenia as candidates for the two seats from its region.
 Western countries persuaded Bosnia to enter last week and then lobbied General Assembly members vigorously as the only way to reject the bid by Belarus.
 In the first round of voting, Slovenia won handily. Bosnia came in second and Belarus third, setting up an immediate runoff that then secured Bosnia's position.
 Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador, hailed the outcome as ''heartening.'' He said, ''Some have called Belarus the last dictatorship of Europe.''
 The decision avoided what would have been a serious embarrassment for the rights council, which in the past has inspired scorn for permitting countries like Cuba and Libya as members.
 Last week, the United Nations came in for renewed criticism on a similar front when it elected Zimbabwe, a country with one of the most battered economies and worst rights records, to be chairman of the Commission on Sustainable Development.
 Thursday's election in the General Assembly chose 14 new members for the Human Rights Council, which has 47 members and was formed last year to replace the discredited Human Rights Commission.
 The countries elected were Angola, Bolivia, Bosnia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Italy, Madagascar, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Qatar, Slovenia and South Africa.
 The only other contested race was for one of the Western European seats, where Italy defeated Denmark in a runoff. 
 The United States decided not to be a candidate for the council last year and again this year, saying it thought that the body, while better than its predecessor, fell short of being credible and effective. There was also concern that given the hostility in the United Nations to American actions in Iraq, the United States might not win a place if it ran.
 Steve Crawshaw, the United Nations advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, said his group had been particularly galvanized by the prospect of Belarus on the council.
 ''Belarus's track record is frankly appalling,'' he said. ''It has no real civil society, no freedom of expression; its elections have been deemed absolutely not to be free or fair. There is no breathing space, and the U.N. special envoy to Belarus has been blocked from visiting the country.''
 Asked why Bosnia, a country with a recent past of rights abuses, was a better candidate, he said: ''Bosnia's record is far from perfect. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly criticized it on a number of issues, but Belarus is simply in a league of its own.''
 Earlier this month, two watchdog groups, UN Watch and Freedom House, expressed disapproval of Angola, Egypt and Qatar, which won seats on Thursday. All of them, the two groups said, ''are authoritarian regimes with negative U.N. voting records on rights issues and are not qualified to be council members.''

HEADLINE: Union Plans Advisory Tool for Young Workers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Helped by start-up money from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Service Employees International Union has created a nonprofit organization that plans to help young workers who lack health insurance and are saddled with debt. 
 The nonprofit, Qvisory Tools for Life, will provide health insurance and financial advice and will begin doing so this fall, largely through its Web site, qvisory.org. Qvisory plans to give career advice and have blogs and forums in which workers 18 though 35 can discuss jobs and various services.
 Eileen Quigley, the organization's chief executive, said, ''What's new about Qvisory is it's an attempt to pull together in one place tools and advocacy for the emerging work force.'' . 
 Ms. Quigley, who previously was an executive with the software company RealNetworks, said Qvisory would charge fees to participants that would vary depending on the services requested.
 Andrew Stern, president of the 1.8-million-member service employees' union, said he hoped Qvisory might get its members to make themselves heard the way MoveOn.org does. Qvisory, which is open to union members and nonmembers, is likely to promote issues like higher minimum wage, broader health coverage and greater government support of child care, he said.
 ''We're in a world where 18-to-34-year-olds have 9 to 12 jobs by the time they're 35,'' Mr. Stern said. ''This new effort is seeking to be a safety net for these young people as they move from job to job.''
 The service employees' union put up $500,000 to create Qvisory, and the Rockefeller Foundation announced yesterday that it had committed $1 million to the new group.
 Mr. Stern said it made sense for his union to undertake this because unions had to find new ways of serving workers -- even when they were not union members. 
 ''We've done a lot of research,'' he said, ''and we've learned that the three things young people are concerned about are finance, finance and finance.'' 
 Mr. Stern said Qvisory would help his union in several ways. Many of the union's young members, be they nurses or home-health aides, want advice on finances, and those workers can turn to Qvisory. And many older members would be happy to see the new group help their children. This, he said, will make it easier for his union to stick to its focus: organizing workers, collective bargaining and politics. 
 Qvisory, which is based in Seattle, is negotiating with health insurers about which health plans it will offer and with financial companies about savings plans and low-interest-rate credit cards. 
 Mr. Stern said his union had no intention of pushing Qvisory's members to lobby on issues that they might not be excited about, like labor's No. 1 legislative objective, a bill that would make it easier to unionize workers.
 ''What I've learned, for better or worse, is that when it comes to an online community, they lead you, you don't lead them,'' Mr. Stern said. ''People don't come back if they think they're being used.''
 Qvisory plans to reach out to college graduates and to nongraduates, but one problem is that those without college degrees do not embrace online services and communities as readily as college graduates do.
 ''In our market research,'' Ms. Quigley said, ''the acceptance and rate of interest among those who are less well-off and have less education is extremely high, and that is extremely exciting. But we're going to have to work hard to reach out to them.''

HEADLINE: Park Feels Right at Home Among Sybase Leaders

BYLINE: By DAMON HACK

DATELINE: CLIFTON, N.J., May 17 

 BODY:
On an L.P.G.A. Tour rife with translators and passports, Angela Park may have the most diverse background of all.
 Park, 18, who is of South Korean ancestry, was born in Iguassu Falls, Brazil, near bubbling and misting waterfalls. When she was 8, she moved with her family to a suburb between Los Angeles and San Diego, where she discovered malls, text messaging and golf.
''I've been to a lot of places,'' Park said Thursday after her opening-round four-under-par 68 at the Sybase Classic at Upper Montclair Country Club tied her for second place with Lorena Ochoa, Se Ri Pak, Hye Jung Choi and Brittany Lincicome. The group trailed Sarah Lee by two shots. 
 Though Park is one of a close-knit group of 45 South Koreans on the L.P.G.A. Tour, she did not come up through the Korean junior ranks. She speaks Korean -- along with English and Portuguese -- but she has been to Korea only for vacation.
 Brazil remains at the center of many of Park's childhood memories. Her father, Kyung Wook Park, and mother, Kyung Ran Lee, have a home in Sao Paolo and own an embroidery business. Her grandparents also live there.
 ''At the time, the economy was really on a spur in Brazil,'' she said of her parents' decision to immigrate there. ''So then my dad thought it would be easier to make money in Brazil.''
 She added: ''I really miss the time where, on weekends after church, all of our families would go to the beach an hour or two away.''
 When Park moved to the United States, she and her three brothers started playing golf while their father was at business meetings. 
 Park was a fast success on the American Junior Golf Association circuit, winning five times. In 29 events in four seasons, she posted 24 top-10 finishes.
 In 2005, Park reached the semifinals of the United States Women's Amateur Championship and, last year, she turned professional, competed on the Duramed Futures Tour and secured her L.P.G.A. playing privileges by tying for fifth at the qualifying tournament. Her father accompanies her on the Tour.
 On a Tour thick with young talent in players like Ochoa, Morgan Pressel and Paula Creamer, Park has had to work to stand out. Instead of attending college, she opted to learn her profession on the fly. 
 ''These kids, for whatever reason, are in a hurry,'' Lisa Mickey, a Duramed Futures Tour spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. ''Even though Angela's young, I think she can win this year. She's so incredibly determined. She has the skills and she has the work ethic. Angela is my sleeper this year.''
 In nine starts this season, Park has made every cut. She finished tied for third at the Fields Open in Hawaii and tied for 17th last week at the Michelob Ultra Open at Kingsmill in Virginia.
 At the Sybase Classic on Thursday, she did not bogey a hole. After making par on her first seven holes, she birdied 4 of her last 11, including the 461-yard, par-5 11th hole after reaching the green in two.
 ''It always seems like I do well the first couple rounds, and then I would trickle down a little,'' Park said. ''I'm trying to stay focused for the next three days and not change anything.''
 Ochoa, the tournament headliner, defending champion and No. 1 player in the world, also took advantage of a day of light breezes. She offset two bogeys with six birdies and was safely in the tournament mix.
 Ochoa, who won the Sybase Classic at Wykagyl Country Club last year, played Upper Montclair on Thursday with little stress.
 ''It was a good day,'' she said. ''I just kind of feel really comfortable, and I think the key today was hitting my driver straight.''
 Park, who has had homes in South America and Southern California, now lives in Orlando, Fla. Though she came to the L.P.G.A. Tour via a unique route, her goals echo those of her competitors. 
 ''I'm trying to get better,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Listings: May 18 - May 24

 BODY:
Selective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition. Theater Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater. 
 Previews and Openings 'THE BUTCHER OF BARABOO' Previews start on Thursday. Opens on June 11. Did the butcher of Baraboo, Wis., kill her husband? Find out in this black comedy (2:00). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 246-4422. 'CRAZY MARY' In previews; opens on June 3. In A. R. Gurney's new play, Sigourney Weaver stars as a woman who discovers that her cousin, the title character, who is a patient in a psychiatric hospital, holds the keys to the family fortune (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'IN A DARK DARK HOUSE' In previews; opens on June 7. Neil LaBute's latest drama features Frederick Weller and Ron Livingston as hostile siblings sorting out a history of abuse (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. 'PHALLACY' Opens tonight. An art historian and a chemistry professor argue over the authenticity and value of a statue in this new drama by the scientist and playwright Carl Djerassi (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. 'TEA' Previews start on Sunday. Opens on May 30. Set in Kansas in 1968, this play is about four Japanese war brides who gather to mourn a friend. West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101. '10 MILLION MILES' In previews; opens on June 14. A new musical by the singer Patty Griffin and the playwright Keith Bunin (''The Busy World Is Hushed'') is about a road trip from Florida to New York. Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200. 'XANADU' Previews start on Wednesday. Opens on June 26. The 1980 cult roller disco film about a Greek muse sent to earth goes Broadway -- and it's about time. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CORAM BOY' Set in 18th-century England, this melodrama about imperiled orphans is big and broad but not particularly deep. With a cast of 40, an orchestra in the pit and bursts of choral music (Handel, mostly) decorating the proceedings, it is tastefully splashy and certainly impressive, but less emotionally engaging than you might hope (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISERABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Miserables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BETROTHED' Rachel Dickstein weds dance and spoken drama in a distinctive theatrical language. The marriages in this lovely and uneven work are less convincing: aiming to depict women's views about matrimony, this piece, based on three dissimilar short stories, actually depicts marriage as an imprisoning convention from which all three heroines escape. It's no accident that the first part of this triptych, based on Jhumpa Lahiri's story ''The Treatment of Bibi Haldar,'' provides the defining image of the work as a whole: wreathed in a haze of (implied) incense and saffron, this lovely sequence is the strongest of the evening (1:20). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'DAUGHTER OF A CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY' A standard-issue solo play about a fascinating Cuban family (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GOD'S EAR' Jenny Schwartz's formally inventive and brilliantly performed drama about how the death of a child affects a family is more interested in language than in narrative (1:20). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly cliched territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE RECeiPT' A lost bar receipt provides a one-way ticket to bedlam in a clever and diverting show that mirrors the idiosyncrasies of modern life as two young archaeologists study a ''lost'' city and postulate on a day in the life of one of its inhabitants (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Wilborn Hampton) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway * 'HAMLET' Gorilla Rep specializes in outdoor performances of Shakespeare; this workshop is an indoor performance of an outdoor performance, which removes the gimmick and leaves, simply, good theater. The strong cast revolves around note-perfect portrayals of Claudius and Gertrude (Elizabeth McGuire is particularly fine); of the Polonius family (Al Twanmo plays the patriarch as a kind of insurance salesman battling forgetfulness); and, finally, of Hamlet, which Jacob H. Knoll pulls off as an angry young Dane. Christopher Carter Sanderson, the director, shows that the play's the thing, indoors or out (3:00). Roy Arias Theater Center at Times Square Arts Center, 300 West 43rd Street, Clinton. (Midgette) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen(1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200.

The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway?

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BAD BLOOD (MALASANGRE)' A wife is offered a lucrative job in Texas; her husband moves with her from Puerto Rico but rails against the condition of being a Latino in the United States. Presented in Spanish and English on different nights, this play by Roberto Ramos Perea is full of ideas and anger, but the political fury of the husband is not, in the English version, completely borne out by his characterization, and you can see the charting of the play a little too clearly between the lines (2:30). Puerto Rican Traveling Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 354-1293; closes on Sunday. (Midgette) 'BEYOND THERAPY' This Christopher Durang play is still pretty funny, and all the more interesting because it is performed in American Sign Language by New York Deaf Theater. Unobtrusive speaking actors provide the dialogue for the benefit of nonsigners, but in the production's best moments they're hardly needed, so animated are the actors and their hands (1:45.) Actors Theater Workshop, 145 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger) 'COUPLES' An evening of eight one-acts offers an update on the battle of the sexes. Some skits work better than others, but each has a kernel of conflict and flashes of humor. Likewise, some characters are more fully drawn, while others border on stereotype. The best of the two-handers, however, is both funny and poignant (1:40). WorkShop Theater Company, 312 West 36th Street, fourth floor, (212) 695-4173; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) 'ON THE VERGE' An amusing revival of Eric Overmyer's play about three Victoria-era ladies who set out, armed with parasols and machetes, to explore a terra incognita. As they ''whack the bushes'' into virgin territory, they soon discover they are traveling into the future (2:00). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 777-4280; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) 'REALISM' and 'JUMP!' The stately Jean Cocteau Repertory (now known as the Exchange) gets a hipster makeover with two foul-mouthed and aggressive new provocations from Britain (1:30 each). Kirk Theater, 420 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) * 'WEST MOON STREET' Rob Urbinati's adaptation of Oscar Wilde's short story ''Lord Arthur Savile's Crime'' delightfully mines a comedy of manners, a meditation on premarital fear, out of a clever mystery of fate. The performances, one and all, are first-rate (2:00). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'CASTING ABOUT' (No rating, 86 minutes) The documentary filmmaker Barry J. Hershey (''The Empty Mirror'') has created this record of casting calls for lead actresses in a dramatic feature that he wrote but has yet to direct: a seemingly Hemingwayesque drama involving a wounded combat photographer, a nun, a dancer and a painter's model. ''Casting About'' is a solid documentary about how art is made but it is also an unnerving inquiry into power relationships between filmmakers and performers and, more pointedly, between men and women. (Matt Zoller Seitz) THE CONDEMNED' (R, 100 minutes) This simple-minded vehicle for the wrestling star Steve Austin follows a bunch of muscle-bound lowlifes as they fight to the death for the benefit of an Internet reality show. Leaden and inept, the movie fails to deliver even the action goods, presenting every fight scene in such quaking, extreme close-up that it's difficult to tell who's pummeling whom. Fortunately, the language of pain is universal. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'DAY NIGHT DAY NIGHT' (No rating, 94 minutes) For most of its 94 minutes, this gripping but evasive portrait of an unidentified 19-year-old terrorist undertaking a suicide bombing mission in Times Square focuses on the face of its star, Luisa Williams. (Holden) 'DELTA FARCE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) In his second vehicle Larry the Cable Guy takes greater risks, sharing significant screen time with two co-stars (his ''Blue Collar Comedy'' colleague Bill Engvall and D J Qualls) and asking viewers to accept him as a soldier and romantic leading man. When he and his buds are plunked down in Mexico en route to Iraq and liberate a village plagued by marauders, a metaphor for the war proves utterly brain-dead. For starters, where's the oil? (Andy Webster) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) 'THE EX' (PG-13, 89 minutes) The best jokes in this scattershot screwball satire -- about the cutthroat workplace, job insecurity, upward mobility, political correctness, yuppie marital tensions, and the disabled -- have claws that leave scratches. (Holden) 'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Dargis) 'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than an entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) * 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis) 'I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP ALONE' (No rating, 115 minutes, in Taiwanese, Malay, Mandarin and Bengali) A dreamy, melancholy tale of three-way desire, shot in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and imagined by the director Tsai Ming-Liang with his usual blend of sensuality and formal rigor. (Scott) 'IN THE LAND OF WOMEN' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This mopey comedy is the film equivalent of a sensitive emo band with one foot in alternative rock and the other in the squishy pop mainstream. The movie would like to think of itself as a softer, fuzzier ''Garden State.'' (Holden) 'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn that there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) 'LUCKY YOU' (PG-13, 124 minutes) Eric Bana plays a poker player with daddy issues (Robert Duvall is his dad), and Drew Barrymore is an aspiring singer who catches his eye in this tepid Las Vegas romance. It's not terrible, just content to break even. (Scott) 'MEET THE ROBINSONS' (G, 93 minutes) Actually, if you see them coming, run in the other direction. (Scott) 'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PERFECT STRANGER' (R, 109 minutes) There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish, paranoid thriller set in the New York media world that even after it lurches from the farfetched into the preposterous, the movie leaves a clammy residue of unease. (Holden) 'PROVOKED' (No rating, 113 minutes) Holding fast to the movie-of-the-week formula perfected by Lifetime Television, Jag Mundhra's overly restrained drama is based on the true story of Kiranjit Ahluwalia, a London-based Punjabi housewife who torched her sleeping husband in 1989 after suffering a decade of abuse. Unfortunately, by keeping its inflammatory subject matter at arm's length, ''Provoked'' does exactly the same to its audience. (Catsoulis) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Seitz) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Rachel Saltz) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) 'THE TREATMENT' (No rating, 86 minutes) Oren Rydavsky's adaptation of the Daniel Menaker novel about love and psychoanalysis in New York has its heart and head in the right place, but not much else, including its sympathetic stars, Chris Eigeman, Famke Janssen and Ian Holm. (Dargis) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series JEAN GENET ON FILM (Monday and Tuesday) This French writer, radical and colorful ex-criminal is represented by two of his works adapted for film: Christopher Miles's 1974 version of ''The Maids,'' starring Glenda Jackson and Susannah York (Monday), and Tony Richardson's ''Mademoiselle'' (1966), based on a Genet story as touched up by Marguerite Duras (Tuesday). BAMcinematek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) JULES AND JIM (Today through Sunday) Francois Truffaut's New Wave classic, about two best friends (Oskar Werner and Henri Serre) who fall in love with the same spritely woman (Jeanne Moreau) on the eve of World War I, is the designated ''Weekend Classic'' this week at the IFC Center. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $11. (Kehr) ALLAN KING (Tonight through Thursday) A continuing retrospective devoted to one of Canada's most accomplished documentary-makers, who is not to be confused with his near-namesake, the comedian Alan King. This is unlikely for anyone who has seen the searing film ''A Married Couple,'' Mr. King's 1969 cinema-verite study of a marriage in crisis, which is screening tonight. ''The Dragon's Egg: Making Peace on the Wreckage of the Twentieth Century'' (1999), screening tomorrow, concerns the uneasy relationship between native Estonians and the Russians imported into their country by Stalin. ''Dying at Grace'' (2003), one of Mr. King's most recent films, is an intimate portrait of five terminal patients in a Toronto Salvation Army hospital (Wednesday and Thursday). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) LEE MARVIN: THE COOLEST LETHAL WEAPON (Today through Thursday) Week 2 of a retrospective devoted to Marvin, a silver-haired ex-marine who became one of the last great movie stars. Highlights this week include ''The Spikes Gang,'' a rarely screened 1974 coming-of-age film directed by the perennially underestimated Richard Fleischer and featuring Marvin as a wounded outlaw who takes three teenagers under his wing (tonight and tomorrow); Robert Aldrich's 1973 Darwinian duke-out ''Emperor of the North Pole'' (Saturday and Tuesday); and, for the truly fearless, a brand new print of Joshua Logan's insanely misconceived musical ''Paint Your Wagon'' (Sunday), with a talk-singing Marvin joining the nonsinging Jean Seberg and the barely verbal Clint Eastwood in a frontier menage-a-trois. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. LAURIE ANDERSON (Tonight) Ms. Anderson's entrancing performances weave coolly surrealistic songs and reflective monologues with a witty, seamless dream logic. She unveils a new piece as part of David Bowie's High Line Festival. At 7:30, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com or highlinefestival.com; $37. (Ben Sisario) JOSEPH ARTHUR (Wednesday) Romance, despair and the struggle for faith intermingle in Mr. Arthur's songs, which can float in a gorgeous acoustic reverie or flare up in electrified anger. With Stars of Track and Field. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) DAN BERN (Tuesday) With a nasal sing-speak that recalls the young Bob Dylan, Dan Bern offers smooth folk-rock and a world-weary cynicism. (''There's nothing innocent about a newborn babe,'' he sings, ''that a few years here can't cure.'') At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $16. (Sisario) JIM CAMPILONGO ELECTRIC TRIO (Monday and Thursday) A well-traveled guitar whiz who plays with Norah Jones in her country band, the Little Willies, Mr. Campilongo has had a Monday night residency at the Living Room forever. Also on the bill this week is Mike Viola, whose strident power-pop is laced with jagged wit. At 8 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; no cover. Mr. Campilongo's trio also plays on Thursday at 8 p.m. at Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10. (Sisario) * VINICIO CAPOSSELA (Tuesday) Calling himself an ''enchanter,'' Mr. Capossela, one of the cleverest and most eccentric musicians in Italy, spins enigmatic fantasies of both skid row Americana and mythological Italy in a grittily elegant cabaret-jazz style that recalls Tom Waits and Paolo Conte. He makes his American debut at Joe's Pub with a band that will include the guitarist Marc Ribot, a Waits collaborator who has appeared on Mr. Capossela's records as well. At 7:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) CITIZEN COPE (Sunday) Clarence Greenwood, a k a Citizen Cope, is the umpteenth singer-songwriter to use hip-hop beats and drawled, rap-sung vocals in search of novelty. With Soulive, a guitar-organ-drums group from Woodstock, N.Y., whose hip-hop-spiked jams pay groovy homage to 1960s soul-jazz and to the funk of Sly Stone and Stevie Wonder. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) COCOROSIE (Tomorrow) As CocoRosie, the Casady sisters, Sierra and Bianca, make a swirling psychodrama out of hints of trip-hop, chirping crickets and cooed Billie Holiday-ish vocals. For this concert they will be accompanied by teenage poets presented by UrbanWord NYC, an organization that offers free writing workshops for young people. At 7:30 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. (Sisario) DEVIN THE DUDE (Tonight) This Houston rapper, a raunchy but self-deprecating comedian with a mellow flow, has lingered on the fringes of fame since making an appearance on Dr. Dre's album ''2001,'' released eight years ago. He might learn a lesson from Snoop Dogg, Andre 3000 and the other big names who have guest spots on his new album, ''Waitin' to Inhale'' (Rap-a-Lot): nobody becomes a rap star by being laid-back, man. With Bavu Blakes, Grit Boys, Surreal, DJ Kutz, Gator and DJ Rapid Ric. At 10, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario) * FROG EYES (Tonight and tomorrow night) One of the quickly multiplying side projects of members of the Canadian indie-arty band Wolf Parade (see also Handsome Furs, below), Frog Eyes sets Carey Mercer's frantic, David Bowie-like vocals against even more frantic keyboards and guitars, creating the melody-overload soundtrack to life in fast-forward. With Alex Delivery and Chris Garneau. Tonight at 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12.

(Sisario) * BEBEL GILBERTO (Tuesday and Wednesday) Bossa nova becomes a cool drink of electronics-infused bubbly in the songs of Ms. Gilberto, who, like her father, Joao Gilberto, makes her music as weightless as it is delicious. With Federico Aubele. At 7:30 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $25. (Sisario) * HANDSOME FURS (Wednesday and Thursday) ''What we had don't mean a thing'' may not be the kind of lyric you'd expect from an engaged couple. But as Handsome Furs, Dan Boeckner of Wolf Parade and his fiancee, Alexei Perry, play bleak, hollow dirges propped up by bluesy guitar and spare electronics. It's darkly beautiful and has a ring of honesty, but still, can you imagine the honeymoon? With TK Webb on Wednesday and Sam Jayne on Thursday. At 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) HEAVEN AND HELL (Tomorrow) Black Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio in place of Ozzy Osbourne. Again. Which means it's effectively 1980 and not very exciting. Again. Come early for the opening acts: Megadeath and Machinehead. At 7 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 203-2500, artscenter.com; $29.25 to $59.25. (Sisario) * JESUS AND MARY CHAIN (Monday and Tuesday) In the mid-'80s, William and Jim Reid of this Scottish band proved that to make so-called revolutionary rock all you need is a Beach Boys chord progression, dark waves of feedback and a whole lot of slouch. But to have a legacy -- the kind that makes people buy pricey tickets to a reunion concert, like this one -- you also need durable songs, and if the Reids' nihilistic bonbons (''Just Like Honey,'' ''Darklands'') were never hits exactly, they remain paragons of melodic economy, disfigured by noise. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) JUCIFER (Tuesday) For a two-member group -- Amber Valentine on guitar and vocals, Edgar Livengood on drums -- Jucifer makes a mighty noise with its songs about death and desolation. It blasts its way through power-chorded mayhem, slow or at punk speeds, topped by Ms. Valentine's airy voice. With Object and Skeleton Breath. At 7 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $10. (Jon Pareles) TALIB KWELI (Tonight) This socially conscious Brooklyn rapper, the former partner of Mos Def in the seminal '90s group Black Star, is interested in much more than bling. With a hard-nosed, staccato style, he rhymes about ghetto entropy and geopolitics: ''I wanna write the songs to right the wrongs.'' At 11, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $35. (Sisario) MARTINA McBRIDE (Tonight) Nobody delivers a heavy-handed ''social issue'' song like Ms. McBride, whose soaring country-rock can make numbers about battered women (''Independence Day''), abused children (''Concrete Angel'') and teenage pregnancy (''Beautiful Again'') sound upbeat. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $35 to $90. (Sisario) 'MOUNTAIN STAGE' (Tomorrow) Sooner or later every old-fashioned country radio program comes to New York for a broadcast from the big city. This West Virginia performance show, begun in 1983, is on a short tour of the Northeast, and guests at the Town Hall stop tomorrow include Joan Osborne, Nellie McKay, David Bromberg, the Roches and Toby Lightman. At 8 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $35 to $65. (Sisario) NO FUN FEST (Tonight through Sunday) Now something of a spring tradition, this four-day festival of noise-rock -- and any other kind of avant-garde music, as long as it's clamorous and loud -- concludes this weekend. Tonight are Incapacitants, Mouthus with Axolotl, Sissy Spacek and Carlos Giffoni, the festival's organizer. Tomorrow's bill has the most potential, with the veteran Japanese noisemongers Merzbow and Keiji Haino, as well as Demons, Religious Knives, Tom Recchion and Oblivia. Sunday's closing show is headlined by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, and also features Aaron Dilloway (formerly of Wolf Eyes), Burning Star Core with Zaimph, and Leslie Keffer with Rodger Stella. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 6 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Richards Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007, thehookmusic.com or nofunfest.com; $18 (sold out tomorrow). (Sisario) JENNIFER O'CONNOR (Wednesday) Ms. O'Connor's portraits of the lovelorn and depressed, sung with the guileless vulnerability of a 2 a.m. phone confession, are dry but not unsympathetic: ''Maybe she's on her lunch break thinking of you.'' She has a Wednesday residency this month at the Living Room. At 11 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario) OLLABELLE (Tonight) This local quintet of two women and three men worships blues, country and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes, playing traditional songs like ''John the Revelator'' and originals that connect them to classic roots-rock. At 7:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) OXFORD COLLAPSE (Thursday) Drawing from the tense jangle of 1970s and early-'80s American groups like Television and the Feelies -- a refreshing shift from the Gang of Four-Joy Division axis that has defined New York retro-rock for years -- Oxford Collapse beefs up its anxious, speedy songs with cathartic smashes and unison chants. With Centipede E'est and Excellent. At 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $8. (Sisario) * JOHN PIZZARELLI AND JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) These married musicians have been called ''the Nick and Nora of cabaret,'' a sobriquet that only begins to describe their upbeat sophistication. They fuse two distantly related musical worlds into a larger whole in which Stephen Sondheim, Dave Frishberg, Paul Simon, and Lambert, Hendricks and Ross join hands. (Through May 26.)

(Sisario) ANNIE ROSS (Tuesday) When this jazz legend barks out ''I Got Rhythm,'' she turns this great Gershwin standard into a hipster's credo. If you've got as much rhythm in your body and music in your head as Ms. Ross does at 76, who indeed could ask for anything more? At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Flatiron district, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; $25 cover, two-drink minimum. (Holden) SECRET MACHINES (Tomorrow) The slowly unfolding, keyboard-driven compositions of Secret Machines have a stark, minimalist side; a glimmer of country; some pulsating; and a streak of Pink Floyd grandeur that swells to fill the room. There's a haunted undercurrent amid the pomp. The band plays with the Bellmer Dolls and Dragons of Zynth as part of the High Line Festival. At 9 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com or highlinefestival.com; $26.50. (Pareles) * BEANIE SIGEL (Tuesday) Recently this gruff Philadelphia rapper has been in and out of jail, been shot in the arm and found himself caught in the middle of a big-league rap feud. But fans of Beanie Sigel, whose rhymes detail life on the lam and the sad minutiae of prison life (''You hearing grown men moan at night''), will mob this club show not only for the rare chance to see him perform -- you never know when he'll be back -- but also for a preview of his eagerly awaited new album, ''The Solution.'' At 8:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario) STEELY DAN (Monday and Tuesday) In 2000 Steely Dan released its first new songs in 20 years on ''Two Against Nature,'' and its members, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, crammed them full of musical subterfuges. The band once hated touring but has become quite proficient at it, especially now that Mr. Becker has accepted his inevitable role as lead guitarist. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Pareles) * GWEN STEFANI, AKON, LADY SOVEREIGN (Tonight and Sunday) She may sing about morning sickness and motherhood on her latest album, ''The Sweet Escape'' (Interscope), but Gwen Stefani has not slowed down; for her latest tour expect a full-fledged pop circus, with sexed-up cheerleader routines and costumes garish enough to rival Madonna's. With Akon, the ubiquitous Senegalese-American crooner, whose amorous songs are explicit without seeming nasty. (Some disagree: Verizon withdrew its sponsorship for this tour because of Akon's onstage behavior at a recent club appearance.) Also on the bill is the spark plug of British rap, Lady Sovereign. Tonight at 8, PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 203-2500, artscenter.com; sold out.

(Sisario) ROD STEWART (Tomorrow) His four Great American Songbook albums may not represent the most distinguished readings of those songs -- ditto the Bob Seger and Creedence Clearwater Revival covers on his recent ''Still the Same Great Rock Classics of Our Time'' (J) -- but when Rod Stewart lets go of his smugness, that whiskey tenor of his can be a powerful interpretive instrument. Doesn't happen often, though. At 8 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (516) 794-9303, nassaucoliseum.com; $52 to $125.

(Chinen) DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this one, led by his former trombonist Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ, like the saxophonists James Moody and Jimmy Heath. The trumpeter Roy Hargrove is a fine choice to fill Gillespie's shoes. (Through May 27.)

(Chinen) * BRUCE HORNSBY, CHRISTIAN MCBRIDE, JACK DEJOHNETTE (Wednesday) An unlikely but not unpromising summit of Mr. Hornsby, whose identity as a singer-songwriter often overshadows his lithe abilities as a pianist; Mr. McBride, a jazz bassist who has also worked prominently in pop; and Mr. DeJohnette, a drummer whose elastic propulsion creates its own stylistic world. They are preparing for the release of an album together, and raising funds for an arts education initiative called JazzReach. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., B. B.

Giving singers opportunities to perform is the mission of the company.

(Kozinn) * SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY (Tonight) Michael Tilson Thomas and the players of the San Francisco Symphony have been winning accolades and awards for their bracing and insightful performances of the Mahler symphonies. For the second of two concerts with the symphony at Carnegie Hall, Mr. Thomas performs a group of Mahler songs with a distinguished Mahler interpreter, the baritone Thomas Hampson. The concert ends with Strauss's walloping ''Also Sprach Zarathustra.'' Mr. Thomas, a superb Copland conductor, opens the program with that composer's audacious and unabashedly modern ''Short Symphony,'' composed in the early 1930s. At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $98. (Tommasini) JOHN SCOTT (Tomorrow) Mr. Scott, the organist and music director at St. Thomas Church, plays the second-to-last concert in his 10-part series exploring the organ works of Buxtehude, in honor of the 300th anniversary of that composer's death. Built in a style similar to that seen in northern Germany and the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries, St. Thomas's Taylor & Boody organ is ideal for this venture. At 4 p.m., Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org; free. (Schweitzer) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

 Museums BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Roberta Smith) * International Center of Photography: 'Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Holland Cotter) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Cotter) * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'Apocalypse Then: Medieval Illuminations From the Morgan,' through June 17. The symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * Neue Galerie: 'Van Gogh and Expressionism,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious homage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) The Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Philosophy of Time Travel,' through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world's latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi's ''Endless Column'' as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody) WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: Matthew Brannon, 'Where Were We,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein's brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Taryn Simon,' through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America's underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for ''The Innocents,'' a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from ''Return of the Jedi,'' at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody) Galleries: Uptown CLAUDE MONET (1840-1926): A TRIBUTE TO DANIEL WILDENSTEIN AND KATIA GRANOFF This exhibition of nearly 60 paintings by one of the most beloved painters in the world feels a little like having dinner with a celebrity. The gallery setting eliminates the usual distance; the startling intimacy allows you to experience afresh the momentum and innovations of Monet's astounding trajectory in the span of three small galleries. Basically, it is a chance to encounter, up close and in detail, the evolving ways of seeing and painting that established the originality, historical importance and continuing irresistibility of Monet's art. It should not be missed. Wildenstein & Company, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, through June 15. (Smith) Galleries: SoHo * 'Gego, Between Transparency and the Invisible' The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called ''drawings without paper'': semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they're out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego's art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * 'Rebel, Rebel: Remembering Karlheinz Weinberger (1921-2006)' The self-taught Swiss photographer Karlheinz Weinberger, who died last year at 81, began his career taking pictures for a gay club in Zurich, but found his true subject in rebellious, working-class teenagers who dressed to shock in the 1960s and '70s. The Weinberger pictures in this show are fairly tame, as if chosen to complement the cooled-out work of the three younger artists -- Ryan McGinley, Walter Pfeiffer and Collier Schorr -- who surround him. But at his best, he's in a class by himself. Anna Kustera, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, kusteratiltongallery.com, through next Friday. (Cotter) Last Chance * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE' Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound, is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Katrin Sigurdardottir: High Plane V' Cut into a space between two levels of P.S. 1 is the Icelandic artist Katrin Sigurdardottir's ''High Plane V,'' a miniature artificial landscape of glacial mountains arranged in a naturalistic, faux-snow-covered setting against a painted white background. Visitors climb ladders and peer into one of two holes in the ceiling to view the work. The installation works best when two people mount the ladders and poke their heads in at the same time: then they can both see a disembodied head floating in the middle of the icy landscape. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org.; closes on Monday. (Benjamin Genocchio) * JOHN ZURIER: PAINTINGS It may be a bit late in the game for sincere monochrome paintings, but this San Francisco artist, who made a wan impression at the 2002 Whitney Biennial and is now having his solo debut, often pulls it off. Mainly, he refuses to be programmatic. His colors range from black to bright. The proportions of his canvases are constantly shifting. And his brushwork is an active, varied ingredient, free of bombast. To some extent he reiterates the monochrome the way James McNeill Whistler foretold it, with a bit too much misty preciousness, perhaps, but with genuine feeling. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0441, www.peterblumgallery.com/soho.html; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Mexico: Economic Growth Rate Slips in Quarter

BYLINE: BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Mexico's economy grew in the first quarter at its slowest rate in more than a year as construction fell and automobile output declined on slumping demand in the United States. Gross domestic product grew 2.6 percent from a year earlier, the government reported. A growth rate of less than 3 percent suggests Mexico is failing to reduce dependence on exports to the United States, the destination for about 80 percent of the country's sales abroad. Last year's 4.8 percent growth, Mexico's fastest in six years, was driven by strong United States demand, while the weakening economy last quarter similarly tracked the United States slowdown.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Slight Increase In Unemployment

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN; Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate edged up to 4.4 percent in April, from 4.3 percent in March, the state's Department of Labor reported yesterday. The city's jobless rate, which is adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, was lower than the national rate of 4.5 percent but higher than the rate for the rest of the state, which was 4.1 percent. Statewide, the number of private-sector jobs declined for the first time since July, dipping by 7,900, or 0.1 percent, to 7.18 million. PATRICK McGEEHAN

HEADLINE: Shares Slip as Hopes for Rate Cuts Fade

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks edged lower yesterday as an upbeat report on business conditions in the mid-Atlantic region, coupled with data suggesting strength in the job market, signaled a reduced chance of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
 Shares of companies sensitive to higher interest rates, like banks, declined. But energy shares rose and led advancers in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index after oil prices rose more than $2 a barrel.
''To increase expectations that the Fed will be ready to cut rates, you really have to see the job market weakening, and with today's figures that doesn't appear to be the case,'' said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist for Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.81 points, or 0.08 percent, to 13,476.72. The S.& P. 500 dipped 1.39 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,512.75, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 8.04 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,539.38.
 After the close, shares of Intuit rose 3.5 percent, to $28.68, in extended trade after the maker of tax preparation software reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street expectations and said it would buy back up to $800 million of its shares over the next three years.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia gave a reading on May business activity that was generally optimistic. Before the bell, the Labor Department said weekly first-time claims for unemployment insurance benefits were lower than expected.
 Investors had been eager for signs of economic weakness, pointing to a possible cut in rates by the Fed. A rate cut could lead to more business investment and improved corporate profits.
 Shares of JPMorgan Chase dropped 0.8 percent, to $52.56. An S.& P. index of financial stocks slipped 0.3 percent.
 In other economic news, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said in a speech on the subprime mortgage market that a rash of mortgage delinquencies was not expected to harm the broader economy.
 Crude oil for June delivery rose $2.31, to $64.86 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange as refinery problems in the United States fanned concerns about potential gasoline supply bottlenecks just before the summer-driving season begins.
 Exxon Mobil rose 0.4 percent, to end at $81.80. Chevron climbed 0.9 percent, to $81.46. The American Stock Exchange index of oil companies gained 1.5 percent.
 ''Energy shares continue to be the area that's in play, and part of that is because there's nothing else to replace it,'' said Jim Fehrenbach, head of Nasdaq trading at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. ''It's a market that lacks leadership.''
 But shares of industrial companies with big energy appetites, including General Electric and Caterpillar, fell. G.E. fell 0.8 percent, to $36.53, and was the biggest decliner in the S.& P. 500 index.
 Caterpillar, which was the biggest loser among the Dow industrials, slid 1.5 percent, to $74.84.
 In Nasdaq trading, shares of Sun Microsystems rose 3.5 percent, to $5.30, after the company announced plans for a $3 billion share buyback.
 J. C. Penney shares advanced 5.3 percent, to $79.74, after the company posted a 13 percent rise in quarterly profit, helped by sales of higher-margin private-label brands, and raised its full-year earnings forecast. 
 The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 11/32, to 98. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.75 percent from 4.71 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Senators in Bipartisan Deal On Broad Immigration Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and JIM RUTENBERG; Reporting was contributed by Michael Cooper, Michael Luo and Marc Santora from New York, and Jeff Zeleny from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
Senate negotiators from both parties announced Thursday that they had reached agreement on a comprehensive immigration bill that would offer legal status to most of the nation's 12 million illegal immigrants while also toughening border security.
 If the bill becomes law, it would result in the biggest changes in immigration law and policy in more than 20 years. That would provide President Bush with a political lift and a tangible accomplishment for his second term. It would also be a legislative achievement for the new Democratic leaders in Congress, though they said they would seek changes in the measure.
At the heart of the bill is a significant political trade-off. Democrats got a legalization program, which they have sought for many years. Republicans got a new ''merit-based system of immigration,'' intended to make the United States more competitive in a global economy.
 But the politics of the deal are precarious. Democrats are already trying to tamp down concerns of Hispanic groups, who fear that the bill would make it more difficult for immigrants to bring relatives from abroad. At the same time, Republican negotiators face blistering criticism from some conservatives, who say the bill would grant a virtual amnesty to people who had broken the law. 
 Mr. Bush praised the Senate measure, which incorporates many of his ideas, saying, ''I really am anxious to sign a comprehensive immigration bill as soon as I possibly can.''
 The bill goes next week to the Senate floor, where negotiators predicted that it would receive overwhelming support. One reason for that optimism was the partnership in evidence at the news conference where the package was announced by 10 senators, including Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, a liberal Democrat, and Jon Kyl of Arizona, a conservative who is chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.
 Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, came off the presidential campaign trail to embrace the compromise, a potentially risky step because the proposal is unpopular with many conservatives, who are expected to play a large role in choosing the party's presidential candidate.
 The measure's prospects are less clear in the House, which plans to take up immigration in July. 
 Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said, ''Unless the White House produces 60 or 70 Republican votes in the House, it will be difficult to pass an immigration bill similar to the Senate proposal.''
 Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California and a former chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said he had grave concerns about the Senate bill.
 ''It's a pretty radical shift to go to an employment-based visa system as opposed to a family system,'' Mr. Becerra said in an interview. ''You will continue to have close family members separated from their loved ones because of this policy.'' 
 The bill includes a temporary-worker program, under which 400,000 to 600,000 foreign workers could be admitted to the country each year.
 Mr. Becerra said the proposal would create ''a permanent underclass of imported workers to fill American jobs.''
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, offered cautionary words as well, saying: ''I have serious concerns about some aspects of this proposal, including the structure of its temporary-worker program and undue limitations on family immigration. We need to improve the bill as it moves through the legislative process.''
 Mr. Kennedy has acknowledged that the agreement is not the immigration bill he would have written in another political environment. But on Thursday he said, ''The agreement is the best possible chance we will have in years to secure our borders and bring millions of people out of the shadows and into the sunshine of America.'' 
 Besides creating a path toward legalization for illegal immigrants, the bill would strengthen the border through the addition of more fencing and other security measures and an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents.
 The deal sets the stage for a rare victory for Mr. Bush, who set a goal of establishing a new immigration system at the start of his presidency but saw it stymied by his own party.
 As the governor of Texas, Mr. Bush had seen firsthand the challenges of border security and the lengths to which impoverished Mexicans were willing to go to enter this country illegally. What he depicted as ''a rational immigration system'' -- one that would offer a temporary-worker program and a way for those who have set up working lives here illegally to become citizens -- was a major part of his ''compassionate conservative'' agenda.
 But the Sept. 11 attacks derailed his plan, and by the time he set out to enact it in his second term conservatives were livid over what they called deplorably inadequate efforts to secure the border. That anger, repeated nightly on talk radio and by the CNN host Lou Dobbs, remains, and is seen within the Republican Party as a motivating force for conservative voters in the next presidential election.
 As soon as the agreement was announced, players on both sides of the immigration issue rolled out their defense and their offense. 
 Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, defended the proposal in a television appearance on ''Lou Dobbs Tonight,'' whose host has become one of the most vocal critics of Mr. Bush's immigration policy.
 Mr. Dobbs opened the program by calling the deal an apparent victory for ''the pro-illegal-alien lobby.'' The administration was ''hellbent on creating a North American union without the consent of the American people,'' he said, and the plan could ''threaten national sovereignty and security as well.''
 John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., denounced the bill from a different angle, saying it would create ''a massive guest worker program.''
 ''All workers will suffer because employers will have available a ready pool of labor they can exploit to drive down wages, benefits, health and safety protections and other workplace standards,'' Mr. Sweeney said.
 Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said he would offer an amendment to eliminate the guest worker program from the bill.
 Under the merit-based system envisioned in the bill, the government would adopt a point system to evaluate the qualifications of many people seeking permission to immigrate. Points would be awarded for job skills, education and English language proficiency.
 Negotiators emphasized that foreign-born spouses and minor children of American citizens would continue to receive preference in the allocation of visas.
 Moreover, they said, family ties would be an advantage in the proposed point system. If two applicants had the same skills and the same educational credentials, but one also had relatives in the United States, that person would receive the visa.
 The negotiators insisted that the legalization program was different from amnesty because illegal immigrants would have to pay fines and go through background checks. They could work in the United States under probationary status and could receive renewable four-year ''Z visas.'' Heads of households would have to return to their home countries to apply for green cards if they wanted to become lawful permanent residents and then citizens.
 Many of the presidential candidates reacted cautiously to the agreement. 
 Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, said he ''did not want to prejudge the deal'' before he had an opportunity to study the legislation. Mr. Obama said that he favored strengthening border security and creating a pathway to citizenship, but that he was troubled by the temporary-worker system and the proposed point system.
 ''Those two things represent significant changes,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Whether they work to stabilize the immigration system and whether they are just and human is something that I'm still concerned about.''
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, said she had not had an opportunity to review the proposal.
 Mrs. Clinton said she would examine the proposal ''to see if it honors our nation's principles and proud immigrant heritage while also respecting the rule of law.''
 John Edwards, another Democratic candidate, said he had concerns about parts of the proposal, including a ''poorly conceived guest worker program.''
 Among the major Republican contenders, immigration has been a potentially troubling issue for Mr. McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani because of their previous stances. 
 Another Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, issued a blistering denunciation of the proposal, saying it was ''unfair to the millions of people who have applied to legally immigrate to the U.S.''

A20) Chart: ''Immigration Legislation in Recent Years'' Proposed new Senate bill would: U.S.-MEXICO BORDER SECURITY: Construct 370 miles of fencing and 200 miles of vehicle barriers. Place 70 groundbased radar and camera towers. Deploy four unmanned aerial vehicles. BORDER PATROL: Hire 18,000 Border Patrol agents with additional field and investigative agents. Deploy ''resources to detain up to 27,500 aliens per day on an annual basis.'' End the practice of ''catch and release.'' WORKSITE ENFORCEMENT: Require employers to electronically verify new hires within 18 months and all existing employees within three years. Benchmarks above must be met before elements below are begun. GUEST WORKER PROGRAM: Create program for 400,000 to 600,000 temporary workers per year to fill jobs for which American workers cannot be found. Workers can be admitted for two years and renew twice, provided they spend one year outside the U.S. between admissions. LEGALIZATION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS: Allow illegal immigrants to work in the U.S. while applying for renewable four-year visas. Visa holders could apply for green cards but would have to pay fines. Head of household would have to return to the home country to file application. Senate Bill, May 2006, would have: U.S.-MEXICO BORDER SECURITY: Called for limited ''double- or triple-layered fencing.'' Provisions were added for 350 miles of border fencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers between the two countries. BORDER PATROL: Increased the number of Border Patrol agents by 2,400 each year through 2011. Hired at least 500 port-of-entry inspectors over three years. WORKSITE ENFORCEMENT: Required employers to electronically verify new hires within 18 months. GUEST WORKER PROGRAM: Created a temporary worker program for up to 200,000 per year, with a path to legal residence for those outside the U.S. Employers who sought to hire foreign workers would have been required to seek an American worker first. LEGALIZATION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS: Given illegal immigrants who had lived in the U.S. for two years or more a path to citizenship. Illegal immigrants who had been here less than two years would have been required to leave the country. They could have applied for the guest worker program, but they would not have been guaranteed acceptance. House Bill, Dec. 2005, would have: U.S.-MEXICO BORDER SECURITY: Constructed ''at least two layers of reinforced fencing'' as well as ''physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras and sensors'' along about 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. BORDER PATROL: Hired more Border Patrol agents ''as expeditiously as possible,'' adding to the current force of nearly 12,000 agents. Hired at least 250 port-of-entry inspectors for each of the next three years. WORKSITE ENFORCEMENT: Required employers to electronically verify new hires within two years and all existing employees within six years. GUEST WORKER PROGRAM: No such provisions. Eliminated the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, which makes 50,000 visas available in a lottery to people from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S. LEGALIZATION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS: No such provisions.

HEADLINE: The Reclusive Rich Neighbor And Her Report of Intruders

BYLINE: By ERIC KONIGSBERG; Cara Buckley contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SOUTH KENT, Conn. 

 BODY:
The road to Anne Bass's country estate here in the northwest corner of Connecticut overlooks spectacular vistas of clear ponds, rolling hills and fields of wildflowers. It is as picturesque and unspoiled a setting as one is likely to find within two hours' drive from Manhattan.
 But on the morning of April 16, the Connecticut State Police responded to an emergency call from Mrs. Bass's retreat that painted a picture anything but tranquil. Mrs. Bass and her companion, Julian Lethbridge, told investigators that the night before, three armed intruders had broken into the main house on the property and, in an attempted robbery, threatened their lives and put them through a strange and terrifying ordeal.
Mrs. Bass, who is 65, is the ex-wife of Sid Bass, one of four billionaire brothers from Texas whose family fortune was initially made in the oil business. She and Mr. Bass divorced in 1988, and she received an estimated $200 million in the settlement. She lives much of the year on Fifth Avenue in New York. Mr. Lethbridge, 59, is an artist. 
 Mrs. Bass and Mr. Lethbridge said that they had been tied up, with hoods pulled over their heads, and injected with a mysterious blue liquid that the intruders said was poison, the antidote to which would be provided only in exchange for $8 million, according to reports in the local newspapers and New York tabloids.
 Around 10 a.m., the police -- and then the National Guard, and the F.B.I. -- were alerted and arrived on the scene. A Kent ambulance took them to the emergency room in New Milford, where doctors found nothing poisonous in their systems, the authorities said. No arrests have been made. 
 Although she is active on the charity and fashion circuits, with board memberships and causes too numerous to list, friends and family members describe the diminutive Mrs. Bass as intensely private. She did not respond to a request to discuss the case. In 1980, she and Mr. Bass were robbed at gunpoint in their home in Fort Worth. 
 Kent, a town of about 3,000 that includes South Kent, has a determinedly low-key atmosphere compared with, say, the Hamptons. And in Litchfield County, property values are still at such a level that a person of Mrs. Bass's means can buy enough land to live far from the unwelcome presence of neighbors. 
 Mrs. Bass first bought a house in Kent in 1998, and has since bought at least five adjacent properties. She now owns more than 1,000 acres.
 ''She buys up everything that's in her view,'' said Ruth Epstein, the first selectwoman of Kent.
 In the process, she has managed to create physical isolation for herself, but also seems to have ruffled the feathers of many people -- including those whom she bought out of their homes.
 Perhaps because of this isolation, and because relatively few here seem to know Mrs. Bass, the events of April 16 created much less hubbub than her series of real estate transactions. 
 ''I haven't heard that great hue and cry that Kent is forever changed or something,'' said Mrs. Epstein, who sat at her desk in Town Hall wearing striped pants and a sweatshirt. ''It's not as if people are running around saying 'Oh my God, lock your doors. We have to get more police. What are we going to do until we find the culprits?' ''
 Litchfield County has its share of rich and famous part-time residents. Oscar and Annette de la Renta live not far from Mrs. Bass; Henry and Nancy Kissinger are also in Kent; Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick are in Sharon; Meryl Streep is in Salisbury. But they tend to be more in public view than Mrs. Bass.
 ''In my line of work, I come across all kinds of people, from plumbers to people I can't even tell you I know because they're so famous, and until that day, I'd never met Anne Bass,'' said Jean Speck, who, as the ambulance chief of Kent's volunteer fire department, was part of the first response call to Mrs. Bass's house after the break-in was reported. ''We're a very tight-knit community, and some of the well-known people are seen around town. Henry Kissinger comes to the firemen's fair every year. But she seems to keep a low profile.''
 The details of what happened that night have yet to fully emerge, but certain common elements in the accounts of the press and local officials tell a story of a robbery gone wrong -- and ending without physical harm to the victims.
 It is unclear whether the thieves made off with anything from the Bass estate besides the black 2006 Jeep Cherokee in which at least one of them fled. It was recovered by the police a week later somewhere in New York City, according to the Connecticut State Police. Two other things that are unclear are whether one of Mrs. Bass's young grandchildren was in the house, and whether or not Mrs. Bass and Mr. Lethbridge reported also being forced to ingest some kind of bitter liquid.
 In another strange turn in the case, a briefcase washed ashore in Far Rockaway, Queens, and was promptly turned over to the police. The police said that it contained a gun, a knife, a crowbar, syringes and tubes containing blue liquid, and several telephone numbers, and they determined that the briefcase might be related to the invasion of Mrs. Bass's house in Connecticut.
 John Rochovansky, a former state police officer in Litchfield County, said the details suggested both that the case might be an inside job of some sort -- committed by someone who may have worked in one of Mrs. Bass's houses in the past -- and also something that had its origins away from Kent.
 ''My guess is that it's something that followed her up here, somebody she knows from somewhere else,'' said Mr. Rochovansky, who now owns a Laundromat and a restaurant in Kent. ''It's not your normal home invasion for up here. Whoever they were, or whoever hired them, seemed to know a lot about her. They had to think that she had cash on her that night, or access to it, to ask for $8 million.''
 One property Mrs. Bass has acquired formerly belonged to Vilma Kurzer, a 94-year-old sculptor and toy designer who fled Vienna before the Holocaust and went on to create the original stuffed doll for Kay Thompson's Eloise character. Under the conditions of the sale, Mrs. Kurzer has been permitted to remain in her house, which was built in 1741.
 Sitting in the parlor, Mrs. Kurzer said that she agreed to sell all 300 acres of her land to Mrs. Bass for $4 million after a long courtship: ''She wooed me. I found roses on the front door.'' She added, ''But she's barely said a word to me since I gave in.''
 Carolyn Chase, another neighboring landowner Mrs. Bass bought out, said she was unhappy about selling but couldn't afford to stay after her husband died.
 ''I was born in Kent, and my husband's family was there at least 200 years,'' Mrs. Chase said from Tennessee, where she and her daughter now live. ''Anne Bass tore down the houses and destroyed all the history. The only time I'm going back is to be buried on Skiff Mountain.''
 A relative, Karen Chase, who still lives in Kent, said there was one positive aspect of arrivals like Mrs. Bass.
 ''Without people like this coming here, there'd be no jobs for any of us,'' she added, mentioning Kent's large service economy. ''Then again, Mrs. Bass doesn't hire many locals.''
 Townspeople are quick to note all the staff she has imported from elsewhere: a full-time caretaker from South Africa; a French housekeeper; a chef from New York. ''I think that even her landscapers come in from New York,'' Mrs. Chase said.
 Mrs. Bass has declared that she would like to restore her land to the condition it was in during the 18th century. In 2005, she acquired about 130 Randall cattle, a rare breed that was in danger of extinction. This makes her the owner of the largest herd of Randalls in the world, according to the Randall Cattle Registry. Mrs. Bass acquired the herd from a farm manager in Virginia, then moved the cattle, as well as the manager, to live on her property in South Kent.
 Randalls are medium-size cattle that have been bred to provide both milk and beef, but Mrs. Bass is said to have reluctance about slaughtering them. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 28, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 18 about a reported robbery attempt at the country estate in South Kent, Conn., owned by the socialite Anne Bass, misstated the year that she arranged for a herd of 130 Randall cattle to live on her land. It was 2004, not 2005. The article also referred imprecisely to the herd's ownership. Of the roughly 180 cattle that are now in the herd, Mrs. Bass owns about 40 -- not the entire herd -- according to the cattle manager, Cynthia Creech, who owns the rest.

HEADLINE: In West Oakland, a Second Freeway Collapse Threatens a Fragile Recovery

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., May 17 

 BODY:
To get a sens0e of the problems in West Oakland, a rough-and-tumble corner of a city known for having a few, you need look no farther than places like 14th Street, where a house floats in midair.
 One of dozens of Victorian-style houses that dot the neighborhood, the house sits on six makeshift wooden pilings. It has broken windows, peeling paint and a front yard strewn with garbage. A sign announces, ''House Moving,'' but the inhabitants are nowhere to be seen.
It has been nearly two decades since the Loma Prieta earthquake caused the collapse of a freeway here, killing 41 people and drawing the spotlight to a long-neglected neighborhood. Now another freeway collapse, precipitated last month by a gasoline tanker explosion, has exposed how desperate things remain.
 ''It's not like an atom bomb; its more like a neutron bomb,'' said Brian Beveridge, co-chairman of the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, which monitors conditions in the neighborhood. ''The people are gone, but the buildings are still there.'' 
 An angry and sometimes profane Web site, BeautifulWestOakland.com, tracks the neighborhood's various maladies, with photographs of unseemly images like used syringes, graffiti and unclean streets. Recently, photos of diverted traffic from the damaged freeway were added to its list of annoyances as something that has destroyed ''what quality of life we have been able to piece together.''
 If there was a silver lining to the Loma Prieta quake in 1989, it was the decision to rebuild the Cypress Freeway in a more industrialized area to the west. That freeway had long been blamed for dividing the neighborhood and choking its air. 
 In 2005, a small park opened at the point of the Cypress Freeway collapse, its memorial plaque emblazoned with this hopeful slogan -- ''With the collapse of the freeway, a neighborhood divided was reunited'' -- and the freeway's former path was converted to a manicured boulevard, lined with high grass and flowers.
 But for large swaths of the neighborhood, that is by and large all that has bloomed.
 Drugs, unemployment and poverty remain pervasive in much of West Oakland, longtime residents and community advocates say. Killings and violence are too common occurrences, they say, and health problems -- mental and physical -- remain a part of the landscape.
 ''People who had problems still have problems,'' Mr. Beveridge said.
 Last month, after the gasoline tanker set off a fire that disabled a pair of Interstates here, Margaret Gordon went down to the detour route, West Grand Avenue, to check the progress of the traffic being diverted through her neighborhood.
 It was not a happy experience.
 ''My throat got scratchy almost immediately,'' said Ms. Gordon, a longtime resident who serves with Mr. Beveridge on the environmental indicators group. ''And I had my inhaler out before I got home.''
 One of the principal concerns is asthma. Health officials say that nearly two out of every five Oakland adults suffer from it, as well as one out of every five children, a situation that some fear may worsen with the influx of cars detouring around the current collapse.
 The April accident, which took place in a nearby jumble of roadways known as the MacArthur Maze near the Bay Bridge to San Francisco, has sent tens of thousands more vehicles down West Grand Avenue each day. That additional traffic comes on top of thousands of trucks that already travel through West Oakland, heading to the nearby port.
 Dr. Washington Burns, a retired pathologist who is the executive director of the Prescott-Joseph Center, a community center in West Oakland, said the exhaust from trucks and idling boats in the port had worsened longstanding problems in poor households. 
 ''Ten thousand diesel trucks a day go through the port,'' said Dr. Burns, who is also the director of West Oakland Asthma Coalition. ''Then there's the shipping, also diesel. There's a lot of smoking, a lot of mold and a lot of pests in the households. All these factors contribute.'' 
 The entrenched poverty and occasional flashes of violence have also contributed to many people's malaise, Dr. Burns said, even in the elementary school across the same street from his center. 
 ''We went over there and found that there were three kids who were suicidal,'' he said. ''In one case, the kid's brother was killed, and he was scared for his life. It's that sort of thing that worries me.''
 All of which is frustrating for those who remember West Oakland's heyday. Queen E. Thurston, 75, has lived in West Oakland since 1942, part of several generations of African-Americans who gravitated to the area to fill good jobs available in the ports or along the railroads. Ms. Thurston recalls a different place, one where Count Basie played in local nightclubs and where streets were safer and more vibrant. 
 ''When I was growing up, you could skate on the street,'' said Ms. Thurston, who raised six children in the neighborhood. ''You can't do that now because the attitude of the drivers. They'll run you down.'' 
 Also populating the streets, Ms. Thurston said, are drug dealers who are periodically arrested or chased off by police crackdowns. ''But they are still there,'' Ms. Thurston said. ''In the night, we can hear them in their cars, playing their radios.'' 
 The relationship between the Oakland police and residents of West Oakland has also been uneasy for a long time, highlighted in 2000, when four officers assigned to the neighborhood's late-night shift were indicted on corruption charges, accused of assaulting and falsely arresting suspects, and sometimes planting drugs on them. 
 The four officers, known as the Riders, were later acquitted, but the city paid nearly $11 million in a civil suit and the police department agreed to institute reforms. 
 Mayor Ron V. Dellums, a former congressman who took office in January, grew up in West Oakland, has toured his old neighborhood and has promised to attack joblessness, lack of heath care, and crime, including a soaring rate for murders, some of them in West Oakland.
 Still, for all the problems, there are signs of progress throughout the neighborhood, especially in the eastern parts, which lie nearer downtown. There, several stretches of elegant houses are near renovated low-income housing tracts, and children play in a pair of handsome parks.
 The area to the east, known as the Bottoms, is less picturesque, but also has pockets of life, including Esther's Orbit Room, a famed nightclub that is one of the last vestiges of the area's entertainment past. 
 Residents are also dealing with what many view as the pernicious influence of gentrification in a neighborhood whose train station is only one stop, or about seven minutes, from downtown San Francisco. New market-rate housing is being built along the westernmost stretches of the neighborhood, and some residents complain that opportunistic developers have pushed out longtime residents.
 ''Since 2000, there's definitely been a surge of investment in the community,'' said Adam Gold, the administrative director of Just Cause, a nonprofit housing organization based in Oakland. ''But that investment has caused a new set of problems.'' 
 The neighborhood, Mr. Gold said, ''is finally getting attention, but it's not necessarily the attention it needs.''

HEADLINE: How Battles at Bank Ended 'Second Chance' at a Career

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz was ready to move on from the Pentagon in early 2005. He had been thwarted in his effort to become defense secretary or national security adviser. And the war in Iraq had deteriorated. So when the World Bank presidency came open, he jumped at the opportunity. 
 It offered him a ''second chance'' to redeem his reputation and realize his ambitions, says a friend who has known him for decades.
Months later, another friend ran into the new bank president and asked how he was enjoying the job. Mr. Wolfowitz unleashed a torrent of bitter complaints about the bank's bureaucracy, saying it was the worst he had ever seen -- worse than at the Pentagon.
 Now, as friends and critics sort through the wreckage of Mr. Wolfowitz's bank career, they wonder if it was doomed from the outset. Supporters say he arrived at the bank, a citadel of liberalism, from a four-year stint at the Pentagon, where he was an early champion of going to war with Iraq and left bearing its stigma. He was determined to shake up the status quo by rooting out what he saw as corruption and waste, and demanding measurable results from the bank's many aid programs. 
 ''The bank leadership didn't like Paul challenging their assumptions,'' said Robert B. Holland III, a Texas businessman who represented the Bush administration on the bank board until last year. ''They have all been there a long time, and they are used to promoting each other's interests and scratching each other's back.''
 But others say Mr. Wolfowitz repeated the mistakes he had made at the Pentagon: adopting a single-minded position on certain matters, refusing to entertain alternative views, marginalizing dissenters.
 ''Wolfowitz unsettled people from the outset,'' said Manish Bapna, executive director of the Bank Information Center, an independent watchdog group. ''His style was seen as an ad hoc subjective approach to punishing enemies and rewarding friends.''
 At the Pentagon, Mr. Wolfowitz began advocating going to war with Iraq just a few days after Sept. 11, 2001, and continued pressing over the next year to oust Saddam Hussein.
 His time at the Pentagon was characterized by infighting, especially with the Central Intelligence Agency, which he thought underestimated Iraq as a threat to the United States. He clashed with Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, and others who warned -- correctly, it turned out -- that the United States would need more forces in Iraq. His vision of democracy in the Arab world also ran aground in Baghdad.
 Despite the administration's aversion to multilateral institutions, many at the World Bank had initially hoped that Mr. Wolfowitz -- a neoconservative intellectual, former academic dean and ambassador to Indonesia -- could help forge a new consensus with liberals on ways to aid poor countries more effectively.
 But his low-key intellectual approach to subjects belied a determination to get his way, bank officials say. 
 These accounts, which came as Mr. Wolfowitz was negotiating the terms of his departure, are from friends and current and former colleagues who have remained in contact with him. 
 The friend who saw Mr. Wolfowitz's term at the bank as a second chance said: ''It was not that he was looking for a redemption from Iraq per se. But he was certainly looking for something to do as a great man in foreign policy, which is how he has always seen himself.''
 Once Mr. Wolfowitz leaves the bank, friends say, he may join the legions of former colleagues, from George J. Tenet of the C.I.A. to L. Paul Bremer III, who led the post-invasion government in Iraq, who have written books and op-ed articles to defend their actions on the war.
 Bank officials say, in fact, that when he arrived there in 2005, Mr. Wolfowitz wanted to write a book about Iraq and accept fees for speeches. That set off his first fight with ethics officers, who told him he could not do so.
 When these proposals were rejected, he soured on the office of the general counsel, Roberto Danino, a former prime minister of Peru and the first official who suggested to him that Shaha Ali Riza, his companion and a bank employee, could not remain at the bank because Mr. Wolfowitz would be supervising her. 
 Recently released bank documents show that Mr. Wolfowitz rejected Mr. Danino's advice on Ms. Riza and went directly to the bank board's ethics committee in search of a different ruling. He also refused to deal with the general counsel on all other matters. 
 Mr. Danino, who was forced to resign last year, told a reporter at the time, ''He presumes that anyone who opposes him is incompetent or corrupt.''
 That battle laid the groundwork for battles with Ad Melkert, the chairman of the ethics committee, and Xavier Coll, a vice president for human resources, over the handling of Ms. Riza's case. The three men became Mr. Wolfowitz's main accusers, charging that he acted unethically in arranging pay raises, a promotion and a transfer for his companion. 
 Mr. Coll testified that Mr. Wolfowitz told him to keep the terms of Ms. Riza's pay package secret from Mr. Melkert and Mr. Danino. Mr. Wolfowitz disputed that contention. 
 Those disagreements might have faded into irrelevance if Mr. Wolfowitz had not waged other battles with the staff, many bank officials say.
 At an institution obsessed with process, consensus and respect for its civil servants, Mr. Wolfowitz rankled people by bringing in two close aides from the Bush administration, Robin Cleveland and Kevin Kellems, and used them not only as advisers but as managers who issued directives to senior officers.
 Among those with whom he tangled were Christiaan Poortman, a vice president for the Middle East, over Mr. Wolfowitz's demand that the bank establish a greater presence in Iraq. Mr. Poortman, ordered to transfer to Kazakhstan, resigned instead.
 Gobind Nankani, a vice president for Africa, also resigned after disputes with Mr. Wolfowitz over the size of his staff, according to several bank officials.
 One official recalled Mr. Wolfowitz's dressing down several top employees in the Africa division because they could not tell him whether the incidence of malaria among children had declined as a result of the bank's program distributing bed nets to families.
 Another official who left was Shengman Zhang, the top deputy to James D. Wolfensohn, Mr. Wolfowitz's predecessor. Mr. Wolfowitz charged that it was hypocritical for bank officials to allow Mr. Zhang's wife to work at the bank but to banish Ms. Riza. 
 Mr. Zhang, now a senior vice president at Citigroup in Hong Kong, was furious, several associates say, because bank rules permit husbands and wives to work at the bank under circumscribed conditions, which Mr. Zhang said he followed, but they bar bank employees from having a sexual relationship with a top bank official outside of marriage. A Bush administration official said Mr. Wolfowitz did not understand that a World bank president can be successful only if he can form alliances with the bank's many fiefs, something he failed to do.
 Ms. Cleveland, a former budget official who handled military matters when Mr. Wolfowitz was deputy defense secretary, sometimes delivered the news on major decisions to suspend aid to countries charged with corruption. 
 In a dispute with Chad over its use of money from a bank-financed oil pipeline, Ms. Cleveland ordered a suspension of financing, according to several officials, who said it produced unpleasant negotiations and made people angry.
 A similar decision to suspend financing for a health program in India last year rankled the British, a partner in the program.It caused the British development minister, Hilary Benn, to retaliate last fall by withdrawing a nominal amount of funds from another bank program.
 That matter was eventually resolved, but it helped ensure that Mr. Benn and his ally, Gordon Brown, chancellor of the Exchequer and the future prime minister of Britain, would not be in Mr. Wolfowitz's corner in the fight over his future.
 Though Mr. Wolfowitz's order to suspend financing for some countries alienated officials in Chad, Kenya, Congo and many other African nations, South Africa, Liberia and other African nations supported his advocacy of honesty in bank activities. 
 But suspension of aid to Uzbekistan, which Mr. Wolfowitz said was on grounds of corruption, angered some at the bank who charged that the real motive was Uzbekistan's decision to suspend air rights for United States military operations in Afghanistan.
 In his final appeal to the board to save his job, Mr. Wolfowitz promised to change his management style. Mr. Kellems had quit, and Ms. Cleveland had moved out of her office next to Mr. Wolfowitz's. 
 In the end, however, his supporters said his willingness to resign came not because he had violated bank rules over the handling of his companion's compensation, but because his leadership style had impeded progress on world poverty and climate change. Whether or not the denouement was inevitable, Mr. Wolfowitz and his supporters came to see it as a result of the war within the bank, not the one in Iraq. 

GRAPHIC: Photo: Outside the World Bank at midday yesterday, a protester suggested what Paul D. Wolfowitz should do. (Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times) Chart: ''Events Leading to the Resignation'' Paul D. Wolfowitz announced his resignation yesterday after an investigation regarding the raise and promotion he helped to arrange for his companion, a World Bank employee. The bank board found that Mr. Wolfowitz acted in good faith but that a number of people, including Mr. Wolfowitz, made mistakes in handling the matter. REGARDING CONFLICT OF INTEREST June 1, 2005 Mr. Wolfowitz becomes the 10th president of the World Bank. He has previously disclosed a personal relationship with a bank employee, Shaha Ali Riza, and has proposed recusing himself from personnel matters concerning her. July 27, 2005 The bank's ethics committee advises that Ms. Riza be relocated and, in recognition of the disruption of her career, given a promotion. Aug. 8, 2005 The ethics committee tells Mr. Wolfowitz to instruct Xavier Coll, the bank's vice president for human resources, to meet with Ms. Riza to inform her of the committee's findings and discuss options. Aug. 11, 2005 Mr. Wolfowitz directs Mr. Coll to agree to a proposal in which Ms. Riza is assigned outside of the bank. Her pay, tax-free because of her status as a diplomat, is to rise from $132,660 to $180,000. A path for future raises and promotions is also outlined. THE INVESTIGATION April 6, 2007 Following disclosures of Ms. Riza's salary, an ad hoc committee, made up of seven of the bank's 24 board members, is formed to investigate the matter. May 6, 2007 The committee informs Mr. Wolfowitz that it has found him guilty of breaking rules barring conflicts of interest. May 7, 2007 European officials signal that they are willing to let the United States choose the bank's next chief if Mr. Wolfowitz steps down soon. May 14, 2007 The committee reports that Mr. Wolfowitz broke bank rules and ethical obligations in his contract when he became involved in the terms of Ms. Riza's assignment. The committee also reports that he tried to hide Ms. Riza's salary and promotion package from the bank's legal and ethics officials. Yesterday Mr. Wolfowitz resigns as of June 30.

HEADLINE: In Japan, When Word Was Wed to Image

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
The 18th-century painter and calligrapher Ike Taiga was something like the Pablo Picasso of Japan. The comparison, while superficial, is hard to resist as you wade into the dazzling, almost daunting retrospective of Taiga's work at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and begin to absorb the many sides of his achievement.
 The show is the first major survey of Taiga's work in the United States, and it is exhilarating in its profusion, range and almost ferocious vitality. Spanning four decades with nearly 200 works, it vividly conveys the trajectory of an artist who, like Picasso, began as a child prodigy and never paused or stopped experimenting. Taiga became a central figure in the art of 18th-century Japan, as an innovative proponent of nanga painting -- which was patterned after the work of the self-taught literati painters of southern China and nearly always depicted landscapes -- and as a synthesizer of Japanese traditions. 
 The exhibition, organized by Felice Fischer, the Philadelphia museum's longtime curator of Japanese art, with Kyoko Kinoshita, assistant curator, includes many important loans from Japanese museums -- among them several works designated as national treasures -- and is accompanied by an excellent and hefty catalog. Taiga's renown, along with the record-keeping traditions of Japan and the affectionate esteem in which he was held by his fellow artists and students, means that a lot is known about his life, travels, friendships and dealings.
 Versed in Chinese painting and poetry of all periods, but especially that of the literati artists of the Ming and Qing dynasties; familiar with the reigning schools of official Japanese art; inculcated with Neo-Confucian thought and interested in Daoism and Buddhism, Taiga was exceptionally erudite but not an aesthete; his work often has a visceral directness. He infused his copies of Chinese landscape paintings with a sense of reality gained from extensive wanderings through Japan, including climbing mountains to see what he could see. Extremely productive, he worked effortlessly, shifting styles and scales and working dense and spare, raw and refined, with irrepressible assurance and often quite a bit of humor.
 Beginning with a sheet of calligraphy he made at age 11 and continuing through hanging scrolls painted in his teens -- including several astoundingly adroit ones done with his fingertips and fingernails -- the show gallops off in several directions. It is all here: painted screens; fans and hand scrolls; calligraphy in several forms and sizes; Japanese sumi ink painting; and of course his increasingly distinctive brand of Chinese-style landscape painting, which reaches its zenith in several series of hanging scrolls that depict the seasons month by month. Like his Chinese predecessors, he also published painting manuals that were used for generations. Taiga's achievement has a nearly epochal sweep that is all the more impressive when you realize that he lived to be only 53. 
 But Taiga was not alone. He was married to Tokuyama Gyokuran, a talented calligrapher, poet and painter in her own right. They shared a small, cluttered studio and were proto-Bohemians, living an art-centered, economically straitened, culturally rich existence. Both were celebrated during their lives and have been since, at least in Japan. Taiga was so prominent that his works were being forged even before he died. 
 While ''Ike Taiga and Tokuyama Gyokuran: Japanese Masters of the Brush'' is not exactly a joint retrospective, it includes a number of works by Gyokuran, as well as a handful of collaborations between husband and wife. The catalog includes an essay by Ms. Kinoshita detailing Gyokuran's life, and judging by the Gyokuran works that it reproduces but that are not on view, the show could have been a bit more balanced.
 Still, you glimpse some stylistic give-and-take between the two: he taught her painting; she expanded his knowledge of Japanese poetry and calligraphy, which finds its most seductive expression in haiga, the uniquely Japanese integration of script and imagery that yields some of the show's most irresistible moments. Seek out Taiga's ''Man Eating Sweet Potatoes,'' above whose greedy, comically beastlike subject calligraphy dances as if expressing the sheer joy of eating. Or Gyokuran's exquisite fans, like the one in which soft clusters of plummy strokes, depicting small islands diminishing in the distance, are seen through a delicate scrim of lace or hanging moss.
 Both Taiga and Gyokuran were of relatively humble birth and raised by strong, far-sighted mothers. Born in 1723, Taiga was the son of a farmer who came to Kyoto and worked in a silver mint but died young, when his only child was 3. At the time the Tokugawa shogunate was solidifying its power by extending the teaching of Chinese Neo-Confucian thought and calligraphy to greater numbers of Japanese children. Taiga's mother saw to it that he had an exceptionally thorough education. By 11 he was adept enough at Japanese and Chinese calligraphy to impress the priests at the Mampuku-ji Zen temple in Kyoto. He began to study painting and, while in his teens, opened a shop selling his painted fans.
 Gyokuran was born out of wedlock around 1728, and was thought to be the daughter of a samurai. She was raised by her mother, Yuri, and grandmother Kaji, both respected poets in the waka form who ran a popular tea shop. Yuri, who always reminded her daughter of her samurai blood, might have chosen Taiga as her daughter's husband, but it is possible that the match was made by Yanagisawa Kien, a noted artist of the time with whom they both studied. 
 This exhibition has two overriding themes. The first, of course, is the deeply spiritual reverence for nature that is the essence of much Japanese art, but especially the nanga style. The second is material; in a way that borders on the profound, this show is all about ink. Each of its many galleries tells a chapter about the Japanese expansion of ink into a magnificently expressive medium that could summon panoramic landscapes or grace small, intimate haiga, and either way convey a strong sense of the artist's gesture and personality. 
 There are moments of dramatic jumps, as in a series of five works in which Taiga enlarges his calligraphy into big, brusque flourishes on two hanging scrolls and alternates them with three that depict bamboo in similar broad, brusque, yet impeccably controlled strokes. And there is the grandeur of the second half of the show, where Taiga concentrates on a range of Chinese-style landscapes -- in part because that's what his patrons wanted -- but gives them a new pictorial vitality and unity. This culminates in 8 of 12 hanging scrolls, reunited here, that depict the months of the year, each in different styles and brush techniques. It subsides in the final gallery of late work, where a wall of shadowy, wonderfully awkward works on silk provide a serene yet majestic fade-out.
 Throughout, there is the sense of Taiga, especially, turning to Chinese models and making them his own. Like most nanga artists, Taiga and Gyokuran departed from the amateur status so valued by the Chinese literati, who were often court officials who painted in their leisure time to please themselves and their friends. The couple struggled throughout their lives to support themselves, making works for temples and private patrons, while also occasionally selling smaller works out of the cramped studio where they lived and worked. The first Who's Who in Kyoto, in 1768, listed them and their address. People would drop by, sometimes to Taiga's irritation.
 This tantalizing tidbit of information is one of many in the catalog that help bring Taiga and Gyokuran to life. But the scope of the Philadelphia museum's effort is such that it almost transcends individuals. It expands exponentially, and gloriously, our entire grasp of the melding of indigenous and outside influences so basic to Japanese art. May the deluge continue. ''Ike Taiga and Tokuyama Gyokuran: Japanese Masters of the Brush'' continues through July 22 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Benjamin Franklin Parkway at 26th Street; (215) 763-8100.

HEADLINE: In Deal for Chrysler, Snow's Role Extends a Trend

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
At a news conference this week in Stuttgart, Germany, the usually secretive private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management was in the spotlight, announcing an agreement to take control of Chrysler. 
 Yet the executive representing Cerberus in its most prominent deal to date was not its founder and chief executive, Stephen A. Feinberg, who was intimately involved in the negotiations. Instead, sitting between Daimler's chairman, Dieter Zetsche, and Chrysler's chief executive, Thomas W. LaSorda, was John W. Snow, who had joined the firm just seven months ago.
The former Treasury secretary, Mr. Snow, 67, is one of the latest politicians hired by private equity for the connections and skills that are honed while working in the upper echelons of government. And as private equity expands, attracting more attention with headline-grabbing deals like that for Chrysler, buyout firms may find that having known quantities like Mr. Snow, who was also chief executive of the railroad company CSX, an invaluable asset.
 ''I bring a unique point of view,'' Mr. Snow said in an interview yesterday. ''I have expertise in an industry and running a global business. I also have a certain feel for the world, for risks and people.'' 
 Most politicians turned private equity professionals fall more into the mold of former President George H. W. Bush or John Major, the onetime British prime minister. That is to say, those people are sought more for their ability to open doors than for making what lies behind those doors work. Both former leaders punched their tickets at the Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private equity firm with a history of scooping up government officials.
 By hiring such figures, buyout firms are certainly hoping to impress the executives of potential acquisitions across the bargaining table, according to Morton A. Pierce, who is chairman of the mergers and acquisitions practice at the law firm Dewey Ballantine. But former politicians can also offer regulatory expertise, as well as fat Rolodexes.
 ''I don't think these are just decoration,'' he said. ''Private equity firms aren't just spending money to have people sitting around as figureheads.''
 Yet private equity firms have also shown an increasing willingness to offer huge compensation to get who they want, whether as chairmen, advisers or as chief executives of the companies they control. David Calhoun, for example, a former top General Electric executive, was offered a compensation package worth more than $100 million to run VNU, the media company that was taken private last year and is now known as the Nielsen Company, according to executives who were involved in the negotiations. 
 Awash with cash and pursuing new and bigger targets, private equity has also hired executives to serve as guides to industries like media -- Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc., has been hired by Carlyle. Cerberus, meanwhile, hired Wolfgang Bernhard, a former DaimlerChrysler executive.
 And the post of Treasury secretary can be a revolving door between Washington and Wall Street. Robert E. Rubin, a former Goldman Sachs co-chairman, was the Treasury secretary for President Bill Clinton and is now chairman of the executive committee at Citigroup. Mr. Rubin's successor, Lawrence H. Summers, is now a part-time managing director at the hedge fund D. E. Shaw after a rocky tenure as president of Harvard. 
 After he resigned from the Treasury last June, Mr. Snow said that he had received many job offers. But the one from Cerberus stood out: The mission of the firm to turn around ailing companies, he said, meshed with his own philosophy that the private sector created the greatest wealth, one borne out by his efforts to deregulate the railroads.
 Among his duties as Cerberus chairman, Mr. Snow said, was helping to map the firm's overall strategy. Though he declined to comment on his specific role in the Chrysler deal, he insists that he plays a highly active part in guiding the Cerberus, one both similar and different from his time at CSX.
 ''My job here is different from CSX because there I was focused on just one thing, a transportation company,'' Mr. Snow said in the interview. ''Cerberus has 55 companies that run the book from A to Z.''
 Timothy F. Price, a managing director at Cerberus, recalled that during a trip through Asia early this year, Mr. Snow did not go two days without teleconferencing with Mr. Feinberg. 
 ''We try to keep him focused on the highest level, because that's the chairman's job,'' Mr. Price said. ''But he can't resist -- and we can't resist -- drawing him in to the individual strategic decisions.''
 But some who dealt with Mr. Snow during his days as a railroad executive, described a smart and affable man whose vision exceeded his interest in the nuts and bolts of running a railroad company. 
 A native of Ohio, Mr. Snow graduated from the University of Virginia in 1965 with a Ph.D. in economics; a law degree at George Washington University followed. He spent time on the economics faculties at the University of Maryland and the University of Virginia and taught law at George Washington.
 After he joined the Transportation Department during the Ford administration, Mr. Snow gained a reputation as an operator, a creative type who loved playing the part of salesman. Perhaps his crowning achievement before becoming Treasury secretary was helping to deregulate the railroad industry while a lobbyist at the Chessie System, a precursor to CSX.
 His actions drew the attention of Hays T. Watkins, then the chairman and chief executive of Chessie, who was seeking a protege. By 1991, Mr. Snow had succeeded Mr. Watkins as chairman, taking charge of a company that at the time had a global transportation network, spanning railroads and shipping.
 But as Mr. Snow focused on deal making -- acquiring nearly half of a rival, Conrail, selling off much of its liner business -- some began to complain that he was long on ideas but short on execution, a railroad executive who failed to spend the money necessary to keep the company's trains running on time.
 ''John was never an operations guy and never pretended to be,'' said Rush Loving Jr., a former Fortune reporter who wrote ''The Men Who Loved Trains,'' a book published last year that criticized Mr. Snow's performance at CSX.
 According to Mr. Loving, Mr. Snow's tenure had its positives, like cultural changes he tried to institute at the company. But he made it clear that his goal was to become Treasury secretary, not to run a railroad. 
 Upon ascending to that post in 2003, Mr. Snow earned a reputation as salesman in chief for the Bush administration's economic policy. Critics said that Mr. Snow, a professed deficit hawk while at the Business Roundtable, had quickly and wholeheartedly assumed the president's tax cut plans.
 Robert S. Nichols, a former Treasury spokesman who worked closely with Mr. Snow, disagreed, calling him a consensus builder and a superb diplomat who fulfilled his job's requirements. 
 Mr. Nichols, who said he remained close to Mr. Snow, added that under his tenure, the former secretary helped persuade the Chinese to loosen their currency -- albeit within a narrow range -- as well as working to persuade countries to cancel the debt of Iraq and other third world nations. ''He was the ultimate team player,'' Mr. Nichols said.

HEADLINE: North and South Send Trains Across the Korean Frontier

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: MUNSAN, South Korea, May 17 

 BODY:
Trains crossed the border between North and South Korea on Thursday for the first time in 56 years, an event both sides described as a milestone for reconciliation on the divided Korean Peninsula. 
 As white balloons soared into a blue sky, soldiers swung open gates topped with barbed wire shortly after noon to let the five cars of the South Korean train cross the 2.5-mile-wide demilitarized zone, the world's most heavily armed border, and enter North Korea.
 At the same time, about 144 miles east, a North Korean train trundled down the coast. 
 Although these were technically just one-time test runs on two short stretches of railroad that were linked through the demilitarized zone several years ago, their symbolic importance was unmistakable. The last trains that crossed the border carried refugees and wounded soldiers to South Korea from the North during the Korean War in 1951. 
 Photographs of the bullet-scarred, rusting hulks of wartime locomotives trapped in the demilitarized zone have symbolized a divided Korea and a conflict that has never been formally resolved, because the war ended in a truce, not a treaty. 
 ''These are not just test runs,'' said South Korea's unification minister, Lee Jae-joung. ''They mean reconnecting the severed bloodline of the Korean nation.'' He spoke during a ceremony at Munsan Station, about seven miles south of the demilitarized zone. ''The trains carry our dream of peace.''
 His North Korean counterpart, Kwon Ho-ung, who was also in Munsan, said the trains represented the ''Korean nation's wish to gallop to the destination of reunification,'' despite what he called outside forces -- apparently a reference to the United States -- that are ''not happy with reconciliation among Koreans.'' 
 The South Korean train, carrying 150 people from both sides of the border, pulled out of Munsan around 11:30 a.m. as fireworks exploded overhead. It traveled about 15 miles to Kaesong, a North Korean border town where South Korea runs factories employing less-costly labor from the North. The North Korean train had a similar journey, from the Mount Kumgang resort to Jejin, 15 miles to the south. 
 South Korea has long dreamed of building a trans-Korea railroad that would connect its trains to China and to the Trans-Siberian Railway. A route through North Korea would provide overland access to the rest of Asia.
 A trans-Korea railroad would offer a faster and cheaper way for South Korea to send exports that are now shipped by sea to China and Europe. It would also provide a shortcut for Russian oil and other natural resources transported to South Korea. Such a rail system would save South Korea $34 to $50 a ton in shipping costs, said Lim Jae-kyung, a researcher at the Korea Transport Institute.
 But creating such a system, transportation analysts and government officials say, would require years of confidence-building talks and billions of dollars in investment in North Korea's decrepit rail system. 
 Officials acknowledge that North Korea will probably have to give up its nuclear weapons and improve its human rights record before it could attract significant investment from South Korea or international development aid. Six-nation talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear weapons programs have been stalled for months. 
 ''I cannot understand why we should give rice, flour, fertilizer and everything else the North Koreans want when they don't do anything for us,'' said Hong Moo-sun, 71, one of a dozen South Koreans protesting just outside Munsan Station on Thursday.
 The protesters were calling for North Korea to return their relatives, among the hundreds of people taken to North Korea after the war and believed to be held there against their will. 
 Members of the Grand National Party, part of the conservative opposition, called the event on Thursday a ''train of illusion'' organized to draw voters' attention in an election year. 
 South Korean officials say a trans-Korea railroad would invigorate inter-Korean trade, which tripled to $1.35 billion last year from $430 million in 2000. It would also bring cash to North Korea, which could collect an estimated $150 million a year in transit fees from trains that pass through its territory, Mr. Lim, the researcher, said. 
 But procuring international aid to renovate the rail network and letting trains from one of Asia's most vibrant economies, carrying exports and tourists, rumble through its isolated territory could threaten the North Korean government, experts say. They say North Korea now relies on keeping its people ignorant of the outside world to maintain its totalitarian grip on power.
 Both Koreas agreed in 2000 to reconnect their rail systems, which had been severed by aerial bombing during the war. It took three years to relink the tracks on the west and east ends of the border. After four more years of haggling and delays, the North Korean military agreed this month to allow the one-time test runs.
 The agreement came after South Korea promised to send North Korea 400,000 tons of rice, as well as $80 million worth of raw materials for shoes, soap and textiles.
 South Korea has spent $589 million on reconnecting the rail system, including $195 million worth of equipment, tracks and other material lent to North Korea. 
 South Korean policy makers have called for patience in working toward reconciliation with the North. They have often been accused by conservative politicians and civic groups of giving in to North Korea's strategy of extracting economic aid for every step toward reconciliation. 
 ''This is a precious first step for a 1,000-mile journey,'' Mr. Lee, the unification minister, said Thursday.

HEADLINE: Wolfowitz Resigns, Ending Long Fight at World Bank

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz, ending a furor over favoritism that blew up into a global fight over American leadership, announced his resignation as president of the World Bank Thursday evening after the bank's board accepted his claim that his mistakes at the bank were made in good faith.
 The decision came four days after a special investigative committee of the bank concluded that he had violated his contract by breaking ethical and governing rules in arranging the generous pay and promotion package for Shaha Ali Riza, his companion, in 2005.
 The resignation, effective June 30, brought a dramatic conclusion to two days of negotiations between Mr. Wolfowitz and the bank board after weeks of turmoil.
 ''He assured us that he acted ethically and in good faith in what he believed were the best interests of the institution, and we accept that,'' said the board's directors in a statement issued Thursday night. ''We also accept that others involved acted ethically and in good faith.'' 
 In the carefully negotiated statement, the bank board praised Mr. Wolfowitz for his two years of service, particularly for his work in arranging debt relief and pressing for more assistance to poor countries, especially in Africa. They also cited Mr. Wolfowitz's work in combating corruption, his signature issue.
 Mr. Wolfowitz said he was grateful for the directors' decision and, referring to the bank's mission of helping the world's poor, added: ''Now it is necessary to find a way to move forward. To do that I have concluded that it is in the best interests of those whom this institution serves for that mission to be carried forward under new leadership.''
 Mr. Wolfowitz's negotiated departure averted what threatened to become a bitter rupture between the United States and its economic partners at an institution established after World War II. The World Bank channels $22 billion in loans and grants a year to poor countries. 
 But he left behind a place that must heal its divisions and overhaul a flawed, cumbersome structure that had allowed the controversy over Mr. Wolfowitz to spread out of control.
 People close to the negotiations said that Mr. Wolfowitz had agreed not to make major personnel or policy decisions between now and June 30. Some bank officials said he might go on an administrative leave and cede day-to-day functions to an acting leader, but that might not be decided until Friday.
 President Bush earlier in the day praised Mr. Wolfowitz at a news conference but signaled that the end was near by saying he regretted ''that it's come to this.'' A White House spokesman, Tony Fratto, said, ''We would have preferred that he stay at the bank, but the president reluctantly accepts his decision.''
 More important for the bank's future, Mr. Fratto said, President Bush will soon announce a candidate to succeed Mr. Wolfowitz, quashing speculation that the United States would end the custom, in effect since the 1940s, of the American president picking the bank president. 
 Many European officials previously indicated that they would go along with the United States' picking a successor if Mr. Wolfowitz would resign voluntarily, as he now has. 
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said Thursday that he would ''consult my colleagues around the world'' before recommending a choice to Mr. Bush, in what seemed to be an effort to assure allies that the United States would not repeat what happened in 2005 when Mr. Bush surprised them by selecting Mr. Wolfowitz, then a deputy secretary of defense and an architect of the Iraq war.
 Leaders of Germany and France objected but decided not to make a fight over the choice and risk reopening wounds from their opposition to the war two years earlier. Some also argued that Mr. Wolfowitz, as a conservative seeking to write a new chapter in a career that had been focused on national security, might bring new support to aiding the world's poor.
 Soon after Mr. Wolfowitz took office, however, he engaged in fights in various quarters at the bank over issues including his campaign against corruption, in which he suspended aid to several countries without consulting board members, and his reliance on a small group of aides.
 Mr. Wolfowitz's resignation, while ending the turmoil that erupted in early April over the disclosure of his role in arranging Ms. Riza's pay and promotion package, will not by itself repair the divisions at the bank over his leadership, bank officials said Thursday evening.
 By all accounts, the terms of Mr. Wolfowitz's exoneration left a bitter taste with most of the 24 board members, who represent major donor countries, as well as clusters of smaller donor and recipient countries. Most had wanted to adopt the findings of the special board committee that determined he had acted unethically on the matter of Ms. Riza.
 But the closest the board came to criticizing Mr. Wolfowitz was saying in that ''a number of mistakes were made by a number of individuals in handling the matter under consideration and that the bank's systems did not prove robust to the strain under which they were placed.''
 Also angered was the bank's staff association, which had called for Mr. Wolfowitz's resignation in early April. The bank's internal blogs were filled with denunciations of the action on Thursday evening.
 Late in the evening, the association issued a statement saying, ''Welcome though it is, the president's resignation is not acceptable under the present arrangement,'' and that it ''completely undermines the principles of good governance and the principles that the staff fight to uphold.''
 The association represents most of the 7,000 full-time employees at the bank in Washington. Their unhappiness could be a crucial factor in the bank board's ability to heal the wounds left by the fight over Mr. Wolfowitz. It appeared likely that after Mr. Wolfowitz's departure there would be a departure of several top aides, including Robin Cleveland, who officials said was involved in the negotiations over the statements accompanying his departure.
 During the day, as word spread throughout the institution that Mr. Wolfowitz was close to a deal, some officials said that one of the obstacles was his compensation package. But there was no information Thursday night on whether he would receive any sort of severance package or pension, or be reimbursed for legal fees from his long battle.
 Mr. Wolfowitz's pay package was $302,470 in salary as of 2004 -- the bank pays any of the taxes on that sum -- and $141,290 in expenses. His contract calls for him to be paid a year's salary if he is terminated, but it was unclear whether his resignation would be considered a termination as defined by the contract.
 Mr. Wolfowitz's fight for vindication was led by his lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, and negotiated at the bank by the British director, Thomas Scholar, a close associate of Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer who is to become prime minister this summer. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 22, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Friday about the resignation of Paul D. Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank referred incorrectly to the pay package for the job. It was the previous World Bank president -- not Mr. Wolfowitz -- who was paid a salary of $302,470 and expenses of $141,290 in 2004. (Mr. Wolfowitz, who did not arrive at the bank until 2005, was paid an after-tax salary of $391,440 beginning July 1, 2005. )

HEADLINE: Customers Worldwide Pressing Beijing to Act After Tainted-Food Case

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, May 17 

 BODY:
Weeks after tainted Chinese pet food ingredients killed and sickened thousands of dogs and cats in the United States, this country is facing growing international pressure to prove that its food exports are safe to eat.
 But simmering beneath the surface is a thornier problem that worries Chinese officials: how to assure the world that this is not a nation of counterfeits and that ''Made in China'' means well made.
 Already, the contamination has produced one of the largest pet food recalls in American history, heightening global fears about the quality and safety of China's agricultural products. And evidence has also shown that China exported fake drug ingredients, threatening to undermine the credibility of another booming export. 
 ''This isn't an international crisis yet, but if they don't do something about it quickly, it will be,'' said David Zweig, a China specialist who teaches at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ''The question is whether it spills over and 'Made in China' becomes known as 'Buyer Beware.' '' 
 With contamination known to have spread to feed for livestock and fish, some of America's biggest food companies, like Kraft Foods, are lobbying the United States government to press China to improve its food safety measures. 
 Kraft, Kellogg and other food companies have said they are reviewing their food safety procedures and upgrading equipment. These executives worry that another scare involving China could set off a consumer backlash against Chinese or foreign imports and reverse a trend that has made large food makers increasingly dependent on processed ingredients from developing countries. 
 Experts also say doubts about the quality of China's food shipments and worries about its fake drugs could affect other exports if buyers begin to find safety problems or other product flaws.
 Indeed, the frequency of recalls of Chinese imports has risen in recent years, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
 For instance, two weeks ago, Wal-Mart Stores announced a nationwide recall of baby bibs made in China after some of those bibs tested positive for high levels of lead.
 Just this week, the Cardinal Distributing Company recalled 300,000 children's rings with dice or horseshoes, and Spandrel Sales and Marketing recalled about 200,000 necklaces, bracelets and rings. In both cases, the jewelry, which was made in China and sold in American vending machines, had high levels of lead.
 Many consumers have also told pet food makers that they want goods that are free of any ingredients from China, according to the Pet Food Institute.
 At stake for China is more than $30 billion a year in agricultural and drug exports to Asia, Europe and North America. For multinationals, not to mention the smaller American importers, the stakes are much higher. 
 The current scare may prompt changes in China. The former head of the nation's food and drug safety watchdog is now on trial in Beijing, accused of accepting bribes and failing to curb the growing market in fake and dangerous medicines. 
 Still, few trade experts believe that China's export boom is going to slow anytime soon. China's shipments of vegetables and seafood have been soaring in recent years. And many importers say they would rather work with Chinese companies to raise safety levels than switch suppliers. China is also negotiating with the United States and the European Union to have them accept Chinese poultry products. That move is opposed by American and European poultry farmers, who are using the pet food scandal to press their case.
 ''If you bring chicken in here from China, you don't know what that chicken ate, and I think that's dangerous,'' said Lucius Adkins, president of the United Poultry Growers Association.
 Indeed, certain industries will face greater challenges, starting with feed processing, where two Chinese companies were found to have intentionally mixed an industrial chemical called melamine with wheat flour to heighten protein readings artificially.
 Pharmaceuticals need to overcome even higher hurdles, particularly since last year when 100 people died in Panama after ingesting fake ingredients used in cough syrup. 
 ''We're now learning some of the dirty secrets behind this fast-growing economy,'' said Wang Fei-ling, a professor of international affairs at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ''And the dirty secret is they're cutting corners in making things.''
 In some places around the world, reaction has been swift. In Europe, food safety authorities are testing all Chinese protein imports for melamine. In South Korea, the CJ Corporation, one of the country's largest food and feed makers, said last week that it was recalling 42 tons of wheat gluten from China even though the products had not tested positive for melamine.
 ''The major effect of this seems to me that the Chinese have been alerted that they should get their house in order,'' says Dr. M. D. Merbis, an economist at the Center for World Food Studies in Amsterdam. 
 Some Chinese exports are feeling the pinch. 
 ''A Spanish company came to visit us and was planning to buy our product,'' said Sun Hong, chief executive of the Sanfu Biochemical Company, a rice protein maker in Hangzhou. 
 ''We were going to strike a deal at the end of the month. But after what happened in the U.S. they haven't even replied to our e-mail yet.'' 
 Experts say that to restore confidence, China needs to confront the issue and not be seen as covering up or delaying the release of information, which seemed to be the case during recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and bird flu.
 In similar fashion, after the initial news about melamine came out, China denied having shipped any wheat gluten to the United States and one official said melamine could not have harmed pets.
 Only after an international storm surrounded the case in mid-April, and Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, publicly rebuked China for its response to the investigation did China fully cooperate with American regulators.
 Now, in a turnabout, China has banned melamine from food and feed proteins and announced nationwide inspections.
 ''You have to realize,'' said Professor Wenran Jiang at the University of Alberta, ''China is going through a radical transformation and it's hard to manage. The state just doesn't have the expertise to keep up with these things.''
 The problems here are compounded by strict controls over the media that keep the public in the dark about food and drug safety violations, experts say.
 Most Chinese are still unaware of the pet food scandal in the United States because the story has largely been ignored by the Chinese news media. Several Chinese editors contacted in recent weeks said they were ordered by the government propaganda department not to report on the case.
 ''This has been a key,'' says Steve Tsang, who teaches at Oxford. ''The government has the ability to censor and manage the flow of the news.''
 Hoping to investigate why melamine contaminated so much pet food, investigators from the Food and Drug Administration spent two weeks in China this month. They said the Chinese government was cooperative.
 But last week F.D.A. officials acknowledged that agency investigators had no opportunity to carry out their own work here. The Chinese government had already done it.
 ''We visited the two facilities but there's essentially nothing to be found in that they are currently closed down, not operating,'' Walter Batts, an F.D.A. official, said during a recent news conference. 
 United States investigators were not allowed to interview the managers of the Chinese pet feed companies accused of violations, even though they were being held in detention centers.
 After United States investigators left, China issued a statement asking the United States not to punish other exporters of food ingredients for the misdeeds of a few rogue companies, and not to let this become a trade quarrel.
 Experts say China would like to close the door on the episode. And so would America's biggest food companies like Kraft, which is supporting an organization that is pushing to strengthen the F.D.A.
 In a statement issued this week, Kraft Foods said, ''We're also lending our support to the Coalition for a Stronger F.D.A. and industry colleagues in urging Congress for substantial funding increases to the F.D.A. for the agency's food oversight functions.''
 But many experts say the real challenge lies in China -- in ensuring that its aggressive entrepreneurs are tamed and that its inspectors can better monitor the contents of exports now valued at more than $1 trillion a year.
 If they cannot, some analysts say there could be a shift in consumer attitudes toward products ''Made in China.''
 ''This kind of thing is like leaves settling on the forest floor,'' said Robert A. Kapp, a longtime China specialist and former president of the U.S.-China Business Council. ''They gradually accumulate and change one's impression over time.'' F.D.A. Says Fish Are Untainted (By The Associated Press) 
 Farmed fish that may have eaten food with imported Chinese ingredients show no traces of contamination and should be safe to eat, the Food and Drug Administration said yesterday.
 The two fish farms that used the feed kept their fish off the market until the tests could be completed.
 Dr. David W. K. Acheson, assistant commissioner for food protection, said fish being raised at Kona Blue in Hawaii and American Gold Seafoods in Washington State tested negative for the chemical melamine.
 The questionable feed was also sold to 196 fish hatcheries. Because those fish are small and the feed has been recalled, Dr. Acheson said the F.D.A. believed that there was no longer any public health concern.
 On Tuesday, the F.D.A. cleared for market 56,000 pigs given feed that included scraps of pet food contaminated with melamine.

'KING KONG' ''Why, in a few months, it'll be up in lights on Broadway: 'Kong -- the Eighth Wonder of the World,' '' Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) said in the 1933 film. King Kong did go on to make a Broadway debut in the movie, before he grabbed Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) and bolted to the top of the Empire State Building. 
 Now the big lug, reincarnated yet again, is returning to the stage, in the East Village this time, when ''King Kong'' opens on Thursday at the Red Room Theater. Don't expect to see a sweaty actor in a furry suit: this ''King Kong'' is a production of Horse Trade and RadioTheater, the three-year-old company run by Dan Bianchi. Some of the company's earlier endeavors, like the pulp fiction takeoff ''Hard Boiled'' and another version of ''King Kong,'' strived to recreate the real atmosphere of a 1940s radio station and perhaps went too far. Mr. Bianchi, the group's founder and director, had set out to create something new, inspired by the golden age of radio, but the period costumes and entrances and exits of past productions made the shows too much like regular plays, he said. ''We were creating a museum piece. If you're going to go that far, where is the big King Kong?''
The new version, adapted and directed by Mr. Bianchi, is a bare-bones presentation meant to focus on the aural experience of the audience. ''I looked to sound as being the one element that is often neglected or relegated to last on the list of priorities,'' said Mr. Bianchi, who also did the score and sound design. Expect a good yarn with plenty of music and sound effects from a cast of plainly clad actors creating characters with just their voices (above, from left, Tom Lacey, Karyn Plonsky and Mark Vance). The audience members' imaginations provide the set and the giant ape costume. (Thursday through June 10, Red Room Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village, 212-868-4444, smarttix.com; $20.)

 Broadway
 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 
 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'CORAM BOY' Set in 18th-century England, this melodrama about imperiled orphans is big and broad but not particularly deep. With a cast of 40, an orchestra in the pit and bursts of choral music (Handel, mostly) decorating the proceedings, it is tastefully splashy and certainly impressive, but less emotionally engaging than you might hope (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)
 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'FROST/NIXON'Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'GREY GARDENS'Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)
 'LES MISERABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN'Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 
 '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Miserables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 
 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. 
 (Brantley)
 Off Broadway
 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 
 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. 
 (Jason Zinoman) 
 'BEAUTY ON THE VINE' Zak Berkman presents muddled politics and distorted anxieties in his quasi science-fiction play about the influence of plastic surgery on young women who start modeling themselves after a right-wing radio host. Adding to the atmosphere of hysteria is the inability of the actors to render a single subtle or nuanced moment (2:10). Harold Clurman Theater, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante)
 'BETROTHED' Rachel Dickstein weds dance and spoken drama in a distinctive theatrical language. The marriages in this lovely and uneven work are less convincing: aiming to depict women's views about matrimony, this piece, based on three dissimilar short stories, actually depicts marriage as an imprisoning convention from which all three heroines escape. It's no accident that the first part of this triptych, based on Jhumpa Lahiri's story ''The Treatment of Bibi Haldar,'' provides the defining image of the work as a whole: wreathed in a haze of (implied) incense and saffron, this lovely sequence is the strongest of the evening (1:20). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette) 
 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Bellafante) 
 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)
 'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side, www.livingtheatre.org. (Isherwood) 
 'DAUGHTER OF A CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY' A standard-issue solo play about a fascinating Cuban family (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)
 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'GOD'S EAR' Jenny Schwartz's formally inventive and brilliantly performed drama about how the death of a child affects a family is more interested in language than in narrative (1:20). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 
 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 
 'THE J.A.P. SHOW: JEWISH AMERICAN PRINCESSES OF COMEDY' Laughs along with longueurs (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 
 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates)
 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly cliched territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 
 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)
 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 
 'THE RECEIPT' A lost bar receipt provides a one-way ticket to bedlam in a clever and diverting show that mirrors the idiosyncrasies of modern life as two young archaeologists study a ''lost'' city and postulate on a day in the life of one of its inhabitants (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.
 (Wilborn Hampton) 
 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 Off Off Broadway
 'HAMLET' Gorilla Rep specializes in outdoor performances of Shakespeare; this workshop is an indoor performance of an outdoor performance, which removes the gimmick and leaves, simply, good theater. The strong cast revolves around note-perfect portrayals of Claudius and Gertrude (Elizabeth McGuire is particularly fine); of the Polonius family (Al Twanmo plays the patriarch as a kind of insurance salesman battling forgetfulness); and, finally, of Hamlet, which Jacob H. Knoll pulls off as an angry young Dane. Christopher Carter Sanderson, the director, shows that the play's the thing, indoors or out (3:00). Roy Arias Theater Center at Times Square Arts Center, 300 West 43rd Street, Clinton. (Midgette) 
 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 
 Long-Running Shows
 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. 
 (Brantley)

 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen(1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 
 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

 'AMERICAN FIESTA' The economist, consultant, preacher and playwright Steven Tomlinson makes his New York stage debut with a one-man show about how it was that he came to collect Fiestaware, the colorful china of the Depression years, which he deploys as a metaphor for just about everything. An astute observer of consumer obsession, Mr. Tomlinson ultimately subordinates much of his clever writing to a tepid and trite political message: that American civic life is a fractured bowl that needs to be put back together. American Fiesta is also about gay marriage, eBay and neuroscience, which is to say that it is about much too much (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303; closes on Sunday.

 'BAD BLOOD (MALASANGRE)' A wife is offered a lucrative job in Texas; her husband moves with her from Puerto Rico but rails against the condition of being a Latino in the United States. Presented in Spanish and English on different nights, this play by Roberto Ramos Perea is full of ideas and anger, but the political fury of the husband is not, in the English version, completely borne out by his characterization, and you can see the charting of the play a little too clearly between the lines (2:30). Puerto Rican Traveling Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 354-1293; closes on Sunday. (Midgette) 
 'BEYOND THERAPY' This Christopher Durang play is still pretty funny, and all the more interesting because it is performed in American Sign Language by New York Deaf Theater. Unobtrusive speaking actors provide the dialogue for the benefit of nonsigners, but in the production's best moments they're hardly needed, so animated are the actors and their hands (1:45.) Actors Theater Workshop, 145 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. 
 (Neil Genzlinger) 
 'BIOGRAPHY' A revival of S. N. Behrman's hoary 1932 comedy about a society portraitist and the men who keep trying to reign her in feels as slight as a needlepoint pillow. As the play's supposedly beguiling heroine, Marion Froude, Carolyn McCormick never beguiles (2:15). The Pearl Theater, 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 
 'COUPLES' An evening of eight one-acts offers an update on the battle of the sexes. Some skits work better than others, but each has a kernel of conflict and flashes of humor. Likewise, some characters are more fully drawn, while others border on stereotype. The best of the two-handers, however, is both funny and poignant (1:40). WorkShop Theater Company, 312 West 36th Street, fourth floor, (212) 695-4173; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) 
 'OCTOPUS LOVE STORY' Gay marriage is a theme of this sitcomlike drama about a political protest turned unlikely romance (1:30). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 
 'ON THE VERGE' An amusing revival of Eric Overmyer's play about three Victoria-era ladies who set out, armed with parasols and machetes, to explore a terra incognita. As they ''whack the bushes'' into virgin territory, they soon discover they are traveling into the future (2:00).

 'WEST MOON STREET' Rob Urbinati's adaptation of Oscar Wilde's short story ''Lord Arthur Savile's Crime'' delightfully mines a comedy of manners, a meditation on premarital fear, out of a clever mystery of fate. The performances, one and all, are first-rate (2:00). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante)

HEADLINE: Rudeness, Realism and Russia

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, held back-to-back meetings with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to try to calm overheated East-West tensions. The Russians obliged with soothing pronouncements, including an agreement that mutual recriminations should be toned down. 
 That's good to hear after Mr. Putin's latest rude outburst, an implied comparison of the United States to Nazi Germany. But if the rhetoric has been lowered a notch, all the conflicts remain intact.
There was no visible bridging of sharp differences on volatile strategic issues like independence for Kosovo, sanctions on Iran, or new American missiles in Europe. Nor was there any resolution of the multiple economic disputes hanging over this week's two-day European-Russian summit meeting on the Volga River, ranging from Moscow's exclusion of Polish meat to Lithuania's complaints about unreliable Russian oil deliveries. 
 The problem for the West is that it is dependent on Russian energy, yet must deal with a country that subjects its customers to mercurial policy changes and is enormously sensitive to anything it perceives as an insult to its dignity, particularly if it involves countries it once dominated.
 One result is that the debate about how to deal with Russia is often couched as a choice between humoring it or confronting it. Instead, Western leaders must work with Russia to differentiate between the issues on which cooperation is of mutual importance and benefit -- energy, Iran, Kosovo, terrorism -- and irritants more suitable to quiet diplomacy. 
 For the European Union, part of the challenge is to convince former Soviet satellites like Poland that their justified dislike of Russia cannot become a permanent veto on dealings with Moscow. For Washington, it means learning to act like a partner on matters where Russia really does have interests and clout. The greatest challenge is for Russians to get over their debilitating rancor and responsibly engage the world they are so keen to join.

HEADLINE: Unlikely Comrades Share Parting Moment

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
There was a moment, as Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and President Bush stood together in the bright sunshine on Thursday for their last joint appearance in the Rose Garden, when the shouts of antiwar protesters gathered outside the gates of the White House threatened to drown out their words.
 Mr. Bush ignored the uproar. But Mr. Blair, whose support of the American president and the war in Iraq has brought him derision at home, addressed the dissent head on.
''I can't make out the words that they're shouting over there, but I bet they're not totally complimentary to us,'' Mr. Blair said, easing the tension before he began an impassioned defense arguing that ''history will make a judgment'' about Iraq. 
 Moments earlier, Mr. Bush had offered his own parting embrace of the British prime minister, who steps down next month after 10 years in power.
 ''Trying to do a tap dance on his political grave, aren't you?'' the president said, upbraiding a British reporter who suggested that Mr. Blair should move on. ''You don't understand how effective Blair is, I guess, because when we're in a room with world leaders and he speaks, people listen.''
 It was a revealing and at times emotional scene for the two world leaders, unlikely partners -- the British social liberal and the Texas conservative -- who began clinging to one another even before Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Bush insisted that their meeting was a working policy visit, not ''a farewell deal,'' but it certainly had that air.
 Reginald Dale, an expert in British-American relations at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, assessed the verbal repartee this way: ''They were giving each other gifts the whole time.''
 Mr. Blair, for instance, issued a veiled message to Congress not to mess with war financing, warning, as has Mr. Bush, that ''our enemy takes heart'' from any perception that political will is weakening. Mr. Bush said he and Mr. Blair shared ''common ground'' on global warming, an issue of utmost importance to Mr. Blair. 
 There were gifts in private as well. The president and the prime minister shared an intimate dinner in the White House residence on Wednesday -- just the two of them, dining on she-crab soup and Wagyu beef. And Mr. Blair received the ultimate Bush perk, even bigger than an invitation to the president's Texas ranch: an offer to spend the night at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, ordinarily reserved only for family or friends. Mr. Blair accepted, sleeping in the Queen's Bedroom, of course -- the very same room where Winston Churchill stayed after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.
 From the start, theirs was an unexpected bond. Mr. Blair had been especially close with Bill Clinton -- the two shared a vision of a ''third way'' in domestic politics and would spend hours bandying about ideas -- but few expected the same from Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair. At their first meeting at Camp David, in February 2001, they were asked what they had in common.
 ''Well, we both use Colgate toothpaste,'' Mr. Bush said wryly, prompting Mr. Blair to interject, ''They're going to wonder how you know that, George.''
 Irwin M. Stelzer, an economist and a columnist for The Sunday Times of London who is a close friend of Mr. Blair's, said the two found themselves to be foreign policy soul mates, even before the Sept. 11 attacks. At that first Camp David meeting, they talked about how to contain Saddam Hussein. 
 ''When they first met,'' Mr. Stelzer said, ''Tony came away with almost an exalted impression of the president, and he's told me this.'' He said Mr. Blair liked Mr. Bush's directness, and felt confident that with Mr. Bush, ''he would never get zapped'' by a president who went back on his word. Mr. Blair, he said, felt strongly that the role of Britain in the world would be enhanced by a close relationship with the United States.
 ''He saw himself as a bridge between the United States and Europe,'' Mr. Stelzer said, ''and I always used to joke with him that a bridge is something people walk on, so you'd better be careful.'' 
 Indeed, by the time Mr. Blair announced that he would leave office in June, he had been assailed for years in the British press as ''Bush's poodle.'' The prime minister was so sensitive to the criticism that he never collected the Congressional Medal of Honor he was awarded in 2003. 
 ''It would have been politically dangerous for him to be seen getting a medal draped around his neck by President Bush,'' Mr. Stelzer said.
 Thursday's news that Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, would succeed Mr. Blair brought more tough questions. One British reporter asked the prime minister whether he should step down earlier than next month, while another asked Mr. Bush if Mr. Blair was ''really still the right man to be talking to.'' 
 The president, clearly irritated, shot back, ''That's a lovely question.''
 Mr. Bush praised Mr. Brown as '''a good fellow,'' but the consensus on both sides of the Atlantic is that the bond will not be nearly as tight. ''The chemistry is unlikely to be the same,'' Mr. Dale said, ''because Brown is a much more introverted, less affable type. And he's calculating; he doesn't have a very good reputation for people skills.''
 Mr. Blair's people skills were in rare form on Thursday, as he held forth with a poignant soliloquy -- an echo of the '''hand on heart, I did what I thought was right'' speech the prime minister delivered in London last week to a roomful of tearful Labor Party supporters. 
 As the protesters shouted in the distance, Mr. Blair spoke with characteristic eloquence, winding up to a big finish: ''One thing I know is that what we represent coming here today, speaking in the Rose Garden to you people and getting your questions and being under your pressure, that is a finer and better way of life than either a brutal, secular dictatorship or religious extremism. It's a better way of life and it's the way of life, actually, people anytime they are given the choice, choose to have.''
 When Mr. Bush opened his mouth, he chose not to step on Mr. Blair's moment. Instead, the president uttered two sentences praising the prime minister as ''a courageous man,'' following up with a quick, ''Thanks for coming.'' 
 At that, the two leaders turned their back and, for the last time together, exited the Washington stage.

 CORRECTION:
A White House Memo article on Friday, about the last joint appearance by President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain at the White House, misstated the name of the medal Mr. Blair was awarded in 2003. It was the Congressional Gold Medal, not the Congressional Medal of Honor.

HEADLINE: Stalemate Appears Broken in Dispute Over Dredging Delaware

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., May 17 

 BODY:
Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania announced on Thursday that he and Gov. Jon S. Corzine had agreed on a plan to deepen the Delaware River shipping channel in a $300 million effort to rejuvenate the once-thriving maritime industry in Philadelphia and South Jersey. The agreement would end a contentious stalemate that had lasted more than 16 months.
 Mr. Rendell said that Pennsylvania had agreed to dispose of the 26 million cubic yards of mud and silt, called dredge spoils, in Pennsylvania rather than dump it in three landfills in Gloucester County, N.J., as the Army Corps of Engineers had originally proposed. 
He also said his state would assume all local costs of the project, which could take about 12 years, to deepen 100 miles of the shipping lane, to 45 feet from 40 feet, in an effort to remain competitive with the ports in New York, Baltimore and Norfolk, Va.
 ''This will make Philadelphia the fastest-growing and most economically charged port on the East Coast,'' said an ebullient Mr. Rendell, who estimated that the project would generate 175,000 jobs and spur economic development in southern New Jersey and Delaware. ''To the extent that we can mitigate the environmental problems, we will. But there has to be a balance.''
 Five New Jersey governors over the last decade have vigorously opposed the project for fear of the harm it could do to the steadily improving quality of the river. 
 That opposition had in the last year and a half led a frustrated Governor Rendell to block any board meetings by the bistate agency that controls shipping on the river, the Delaware River Port Authority.
 But later in the day, Governor Corzine issued a statement that said the agreement did not amount to final consent from New Jersey, which retained its ability to review, grant or not grant permits for the project in the future.
 ''My position on dredging itself has not changed,'' he said. ''I still have serious environmental and economic concerns about the wisdom and propriety of dredging. The burden of proof falls on those who believe this project should go forward.'' 
 A host of environmental groups that have long opposed the dredging, and had counted on Mr. Corzine's opposition to kill the project, vowed to continue their efforts to block it.
 Maya K. van Rossum, the Delaware Riverkeeper, a government-financed environmental advocate, said that in addition to concerns that the dredging would stir up toxic sediment that would pose a threat to a variety of fish and newly returned oyster beds, there were studies that suggested that the economic expectations were ''a pipe dream.''
 ''We will be there every step of the way to oppose this,'' Ms. van Rossum said. ''And we will fight it in court if we have to.''
 The first step will be an updated environmental impact statement by the Army Corps of Engineers.
 In addition, questions remain about whether Delaware will grant its approval to dredge a portion of the channel. In the past, officials there have questioned the amount of toxic materials the dredging would stir up, especially in the shallower areas, where studies had found undisturbed heavy metals and PCBs.
 In a case that is currently before the United States Supreme Court, Delaware has asserted its right to deny environmental approvals for a New Jersey-based liquefied natural gas terminal on the river.
 The Port of Philadelphia, the second-busiest cargo port on the East Coast after New York, and the Port of Wilmington are destination points for crude oil for refineries near the river: More than 80 percent of the oil and gas in the Northeast is processed by refineries on the Delaware. There are also large quantities of refrigerated fruits and vegetables from South America, cocoa from Africa, and steel. 
 Paul Bingham, a principal with Global Insights, a firm in Waltham, Mass., that tracks shipping trends, said that deepening the channel would make Philadelphia more accessible for a new generation of larger ships that are emerging as imports to the United States rise.
 The refineries will probably also benefit, Mr. Bingham said, but only if they were committed to deepening their own berths to accommodate the new large vessels.
 Still, some environmentalists contend that the benefits to be derived from the dredging are not as great as Pennsylvania officials assert.
 The determination by environmental groups to continue to oppose the project was matched by their disappointment in Mr. Corzine. 
 Tim Dillingham, executive director of the American Littoral Society, said: ''In the past, as a senator and as a candidate, Mr. Corzine made no bones about his opposition to the dredging, and now he's stepping aside. This is going to raise deep concerns among environmentalists about the integrity of his positions.''
 But Jeffrey Nash, chairman of the Gloucester County freeholders and vice chairman of the Delaware River Port Authority, who had long been an opponent of the dredging plan, said on Thursday that Pennsylvania's willingness to take the dredged material and assume the local costs made the project more appealing.
 Pennsylvania officials said that of the $300 million cost of the project, Pennsylvania would pay $118 million, and the federal government would pay the rest.

HEADLINE: Rose Garden Charade

 BODY:
Confronted with soaring gasoline prices, a Congress growing more restless by the day about oil dependency and a Supreme Court demanding executive action on global warming emissions, President Bush stepped before the cameras in the Rose Garden the other day and said, essentially, nothing. 
 He announced that he had ordered four federal agencies to ''work together'' to devise regulations reducing greenhouse gases. He also renewed his call for greater investments in alternative fuels. But neither he nor the cadre of designated briefers who followed him provided any detail, so nobody knows whether he will in fact end up asking for more efficient cars or what sort of alternative fuels he has in mind or, more broadly, what sort of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions he hopes to achieve.
What we did learn was that he has chosen to make the process as cumbersome and time-consuming as possible. We also learned that nothing concrete will happen until the regulatory process is completed at the end of 2008 -- a mere three weeks before Mr. Bush walks out the White House door. As Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, aptly noted, this ''will leave motor vehicle fuel economy stuck in neutral until Bush's successor takes office.'' 
 This is, in short, yet another of Mr. Bush's faith-based energy strategies, in which the operative words are ''trust me.'' The White House says that good regulations need time to develop. That is true, but we would be more inclined to cut Mr. Bush some slack if not for the fact that speedier routes are readily available. 
 For one thing, he could have simplified matters by letting the Environmental Protection Agency run the whole regulatory show, which is what the Supreme Court had in mind. He could also have ordered the E.P.A. to grant California the permission it has been seeking for more than two years to impose its own emissions standards on cars and light trucks, which it can do under the Clean Air Act once it gets a federal waiver. But the automakers desperately do not want California or the 11 other states that plan to imitate California to get that authority, and Mr. Bush is obviously in no hurry to grant it.
 What we are seeing is the obligatory response of a president who finds himself boxed into a corner by Congress and the court and forced to appear to be doing something. At bottom, his administration doubts the urgency of the climate change issue and remains deeply averse to mandates and regulatory timetables. 
 Nowhere has this been more clear than in Germany, where administration officials have spent the last few weeks trying to water down commitments for next month's Group of 8 meeting. 
 Specifically, it has objected to any treatment of global warming as an urgent problem and rejected long-term emissions targets backed by other nations and, increasingly, by many of Mr. Bush's natural allies in the business community. For a clear view of administration policy, one must turn not to the Rose Garden but to Europe.

HEADLINE: For Fairer Trade Deals

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman is right that dealing with the negative impact of trade on American workers requires universal health care and a wide variety of pro-worker policies (''Divided Over Trade,'' column, May 14). The reason we do not have such policies is of course the opposition of American business and its Republican allies. 
Yet for 20 years Democratic leaders from Bill Clinton to Charles B. Rangel have continued to collaborate with Republicans in passing new trade pacts. The predictable result is more off-shoring of jobs and stagnant wages. 
 If Democratic leaders are serious about helping the working people who voted for them, they will stop approving any more such deals -- starting with those now pending for Peru, Panama and Colombia -- until enough Republicans agree to support policies that will allow a broader sharing of the benefits of international trade.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Addresses Foreclosures

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve does not foresee a broader economic impact from the growing number of mortgage defaults and home foreclosures, its chairman said yesterday. And he cautioned that heavy-handed regulation of lenders could have the unintended effect of adding to the strain on the troubled housing market.
 With Congress preparing to take up legislation that would more closely monitor mortgage lending, Ben S. Bernanke argued that any new rules must be narrowly written. 
Speaking before the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in his most comprehensive remarks yet on the mortgage market's recent problems, Mr. Bernanke said regulation must ''walk a fine line'' between protecting consumers and making sure that people who deserve credit can get it.
 ''Rules are useful if they can be drawn sharply, with bright lines,'' he said. ''Sometimes, however, specific lending practices that may be viewed as inappropriate in some circumstances are appropriate in others.''
 Mr. Bernanke said the primary role of regulators in preventing abuse should be to make sure that lenders properly disclose all the conditions and risks associated with mortgages. Beyond that, he said, the Fed can offer guidance to financial institutions as they write loan practices and prohibit clear abuse. But he said regulators should be cautious about issuing any new rules.
 ''We must be careful not to inadvertently suppress responsible lending or eliminate refinancing opportunities for subprime borrowers,'' he said.
 The push for more scrutiny of lenders comes as the number of foreclosures and defaults is rising -- particularly among homeowners with weak, or subprime, credit.
 Three Democratic senators introduced a bill this month that would hold lenders more accountable and require them to determine the likelihood of a borrower to repay a loan. The bill is awaiting a hearing by the Senate banking committee. 
 Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, is drafting a similar bill that focuses on abusive lending practices. He plans to introduce the legislation this summer.
 But the proposals have met resistance from the mortgage industry and from some economists, who have argued that any clamping down on lending practices could cut off credit and hurt the economy. Mr. Bernanke seemed to express some sympathy for that view yesterday.
 ''I believe that in the long run, markets are better than regulators at allocating credit,'' he said.
 But Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, one of the Senate bill's sponsors, said yesterday that Congress could not afford to wait as defaults and foreclosures keep rising. ''The bottom line is that we have a responsibility to act soon,'' he said, ''not just wait and see what the market decides while families lose their homes.''
 The issue of how far to go in regulating lenders is a particularly tricky one given the perilous state of the housing market, economists said.
 ''You don't want to go too far,'' said Michelle Meyer of Lehman Brothers. She said that overly ambitious regulations could have the unintended consequence of cutting off credit, hurting home sales and adding to the already high levels of unsold properties on the market. ''You don't want to impose too strict of standards where people can't get loans.''
 The problem for federal regulators and the mortgage industry is how to strike a balance. As the housing market exploded, lenders relaxed their standards and gave mortgages -- at higher rates -- to people with incomes and credit ratings that would ordinarily have disqualified them for loans. The result, advocates of tighter regulation have argued, was that credit became too easy to obtain.
 Then, as subprime borrowers started defaulting in large numbers, more and more subprime lenders felt squeezed. Some filed for bankruptcy. Others stopped issuing loans or were more strict about doing so.
 Some economists fear this belt-tightening by mortgage lenders could spread beyond the subprime market and into the prime mortgage area, making it more difficult for people with average credit to get loans. Mr. Bernanke did not appear to share this view.
 ''The vast majority of mortgages, including even subprime mortgages, continue to perform well,'' he said. ''We believe the effect of the troubles in the subprime sector on the broader housing market will likely be limited, and we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy.''

HEADLINE: The Insurgent Advantage

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The war on terror has shredded the reputation of the Bush administration. It's destroyed the reputation of Tony Blair's government in Britain, Ehud Olmert's government in Israel and Nuri al-Maliki's government in Iraq. And here's a prediction: It will destroy future American administrations, and future Israeli, European and world governments as well. 
 That's because setbacks in the war on terror don't only flow from the mistakes of individual leaders and generals. They're structural. Thanks to a series of organizational technological innovations, guerrilla insurgencies are increasingly able to take on and defeat nation-states. 
Over the past few years, John Robb has been dissecting the behavior of these groups on his blog, Global Guerrillas. Robb is a graduate of the Air Force Academy and Yale University, and he has worked both as a special ops counterterrorism officer and as a successful software executive.
 In other words, he's had personal experience both with modern warfare and the sort of information management that is the key to winning it. He's collected his thoughts in a fast, thought-sparking book, ''Brave New War'' that, astonishingly, has received only one print review -- distributed by U.P.I. -- in the month since it's been published.
 Robb observes that today's extremist organizations are not like the P.L.O. under Yasir Arafat. They're not liberation armies. Instead, modern terror groups are open-source, decentralized conglomerations of small, quasi-independent groups.
 There are between 70 and 100 groups that make up the Iraqi insurgency, and they are organized, Robb says, like a bazaar. It's pointless to decapitate the head of the insurgency or disrupt its command structure, because the insurgency doesn't have these things. Instead, it is a swarm of disparate companies that share information, learn from each other's experiments and respond quickly to environmental signals.
 For example, the U.S. has spent billions trying to disrupt attacks from improvised explosive devices, but the I.E.D. manufacturing stream has transmogrified and now includes sophisticated metallurgy, outsourcing and fast innovation cycles. The number of I.E.D. attacks has remained pretty constant throughout the war.
 Superempowered global guerrillas -- whether it's Al Qaeda, Iraqi insurgents, Nigerian oil fighters or the Brazilian gang P.C.C. -- specialize in what Robb calls systems disruption. They attack the networks that support modern life. In one case, Iraqi insurgents spent roughly $2,000 to blow up an oil pipeline in Southeast Iraq. It cost the Iraqi government $500 million in lost revenue. For the insurgents, that was a return on investment of 25 million percent.
 The 9/11 attacks, the Madrid bombings, the Niger Delta oil well attacks and even the Samarra mosque bombing were all attempts to disrupt the economic and social systems of target nations.
 But, Robb continues, these new groups are not seeking to take over their countries the way 20th-century guerrillas did. They have a prenational, feudal mind-set to go along with their postnational Silicon Valley-style organizational methods. They merely seek to weaken states, so they can prosper in the lawless space created by collapse of law and order. That way the groups don't have to construct anything or assume responsibility for anything. 
 In fact they've learned, as Lawrence of Arabia learned decades ago, that it's better to weaken target governments, but not actually destroy them. When nations don't feel existentially threatened, they don't mobilize all their resources to defeat their foes. They try to fight wars on the cheap, and end up in a feckless semibelligerent state somewhere between real war and nonwar.
 Robb is pessimistic (excessively so) that top-heavy, pork-driven institutions like the Defense Department or the Department of Homeland Security can ever keep up with open-source insurgencies. Since 9/11, he believes, big government institutions have engaged in a process of hindsight re-engineering designed to reduce future risk, when in fact, the very nature of the threat is that it's random and cannot be anticipated.
 He thinks democratic nations need to build their own decentralized counterinsurgency networks, though he goes over the top in imagining local squads of grass-roots terror fighters.
 But time and again, he hints at the core issue, which is that nation-states are inefficient learning organizations, at least compared to their feudal and postnational foes. If the Iraqi insurgents defeat the U.S. then every bad guy on earth will study and learn their techniques. The people now running for president will find themselves in bigger heaps of trouble than the current one now is -- trouble that this presidential campaign hasn't even dealt with.

HEADLINE: You Want A Simple Life? It'll Cost You

BYLINE: By M. P. DUNLEAVEY

 BODY:
WHEN my family and I moved full time to a small village in the Catskills a few months ago, I was amazed by how cheap everything seemed to be. 
 As weekenders, my husband and I were familiar with some local bargains. Breakfast for two at the local diner rarely strayed above 10 bucks. You could quaff a top-shelf martini at a nearby pub for $5-- or get a glass of Genesee draft beer for $1.50 -- prices I hadn't seen in the last decade living in New York City.
Now as full-time rural residents we found even more evidence that country life was not only better but cheaper: yoga classes were $5, an emergency trip to a doctor not covered by our insurance was $50. But the price that really captured the cost-of-living decrease -- especially considering the scorching price of urban child care -- was the amount that our lovely, compassionate and fully licensed day care provider charged: $4 an hour. 
 We thought we had struck it rich, in effect, by how much money we were saving. It would be only a slight exaggeration to say my husband and I danced a little jig of fiscal joy in those early months. But it wasn't long before I realized that the economics of country living were quite deceptive.
 I anticipated that we'd spend more on gas, because we would be driving more. I knew it would be more expensive to heat our house compared with our old apartment in Brooklyn. But as other city transplants have also discovered, you'll pay a premium for services you once considered basic. Erica Nance and Antony Katz, who moved to Stamford, N.Y., two years ago, were shocked by what it cost to get Internet access. According to Mr. Katz, their satellite dish alone was $400, ''and the service costs us $70 a month,'' he said. 
 Even worse than the high price of certain modern conveniences, though, is the sticker shock you'll face when buying anything that might increase the authentic rustic look of your home. You might mistakenly assume that a tottering old dresser, aged mixing bowls or decorative rusty farm implements couldn't possibly cost much -- only to be blown sideways by the price. 
 I fell into that trap recently, while eyeing a pair of weather-beaten Adirondack chairs. I bet I can afford those, I said to myself-- until I learned that those graying seats were going for $250 apiece, more than double what a new chair would cost, without the splinters. Why? Because they were made -- ''crafted'' -- out of ''rescued lumber'' from a local barn.
 ''Local'' is now a term that makes my wallet shriek and run for the hills. At first I frequented the local farm stands and looked for local produce in the shops, thinking the food would be fresher and less expensive. In fact, it is much cheaper to shop at the A.& P. -- a fact I finally surrendered to when I went to buy potatoes at the small general store in my town, and all they had were preciously labeled organic blue spuds for $3.59 a pound.
 J. Sterling, a makeup artist who lives in New York City but hails from DeGraff, Ohio, said he had seen a similar transformation in the tiny town where he grew up. ''People from the city drive out to the sticks and scavenge for furniture and even old clothes,'' he said. ''Now everyone knows they can charge ridiculous prices. You can't even find anything in the Salvation Army anymore.''
 PERHAPS the country cottage chic made so popular by Martha Stewart in recent years is artificially inflating certain prices in rural areas. Or maybe it's just what happens when otherwise poorer towns draw well-heeled weekenders and visitors. The outcome is a strangely divided economy. 
 As someone who did migrate from the city, but doesn't count herself among the wealthy landowners, I'm still stunned by the number of art galleries up here -- with many of them carrying paintings and sculptures that cost multiples of my monthly $741 mortgage.
 Being a small Mecca for urban tourists does offer advantages. There are a growing number of restaurants that offer sophisticated cuisine of a quality you might otherwise have to take a three-hour drive back to SoHo to find. But if you're thinking you might pay a little less for a top-notch meal, I'd bet a plate full of spring-harvested hand-tilled bio-copacetic greens that you're wrong.

HEADLINE: Eviction Notice Is Latest Russian Move Against Journalists

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 18 

 BODY:
The largest society of independent journalists in Russia, long critical of the Kremlin's curtailment of the independent news media, defied a government eviction notice on Friday, saying it would try to remain in its offices in spite of state pressure.
 The refusal by the society, the Russian Union of Journalists, to follow the government's order punctuated a day of resistance to a fresh round of crackdowns on the independent news media here. 
All four of the radio correspondents for the Russian News Service, a network that provides broadcasts heard at the top of every hour on radio stations across the country, have announced their resignations to protest new network policies that censor news and require the dissemination of pro-Kremlin material.
 Independent news reporting on themes like corruption, poverty, public health and the wars in Chechnya flourished after the Soviet Union's collapse but has sharply declined under President Vladimir V. Putin. Critics of the Kremlin say that opposition views are now at risk of disappearing from the public discourse.
 In place of diverse opinions and perspectives, the three national television networks have been brought under the state's influence or outright control, and Russia Today, a state-run global television channel, was created in 2005 to promote pro-Kremlin views in formats that resemble modern news broadcasts.
 A few news Web sites, a shrinking pool of independent newspapers, all with limited circulations, and a sole radio station, Ekho Moskvy, are almost the only remaining outlets for independent news and public dissent. 
 Foreign radio material has been restricted or blocked from most frequencies across the country. Parliament, at the request of the country's top prosecutor and law enforcement arm, is considering restrictions on the Internet, which could further limit choices for audiences seeking uncensored content.
 The latest crackdowns have taken a range of forms, including direct police action, the policy at Russian News Service requiring journalists to broadcast content deemed ''positive'' by managers friendly to the Kremlin and the eviction notice to the journalists' union, which occupies space in a state-owned building. 
 The eviction order, presented Tuesday by the Federal Property Management Agency, the union said, ordered the offices vacated by Friday -- 10 days before the 26th World Congress of Journalists is to gather in Moscow. 
 Restrictions on press freedoms in Russia are expected to be high on the journalist's agenda; the union has been helping to coordinate the gathering and trying to find donors for it.
 Igor A. Yakovenko, the union's general secretary, said that Russian officials had told the union's lawyer that its space was needed for Russia Today, the state-owned channel. 
 ''This action and its timing are clearly political and send a distressing message,'' said Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based organization. ''The government is ousting an independent press group in favor of an outlet dedicated to propaganda.''
 The dispute centers on the validity of a presidential decree, issued in the 1990s by President Boris N. Yeltsin, that ordered the transfer of former Soviet office space to the union for ''infinite and free-of-charge use.'' 
 The property agency contended in its eviction notice that the language was no longer binding because of amendments to Russian law. Mr. Yakovenko said he hopes to prevail, but left open the possibility that the union could be forcibly evicted before a resolution in court.
 There have been signs already, he said, that the property agency operates by its own rules. According to the law, the union was entitled to a 30-day eviction notice. Instead, Mr. Yakovenko said, the property agency gave a three-day notice, but its letter was backdated to last month.
 A statement by R.I.A. Novosti, the official Russian news agency, saying that the property agency had inspected the office, accused the union of using ''a third of their floor space not for its intended purpose'' and of keeping wild animals without permission. (Mr. Yakovenko has several pets in his office, including a raccoon, a ferret and a mongoose.)
 The use of a past presidential decree to justify the union's tenancy is ''purely an escape from the realities of today's life,'' the statement said. 
 The eviction notice followed several other actions that restricted alternative views from circulation.
 On May 11 the police confiscated three journalists' computers at the offices of the Samara regional edition in Novaya Gazeta, an opposition newspaper, ostensibly in a search for illegal software. Samara, on the Volga River, is the site of a meeting that began Friday between Mr. Putin and European Union leaders.
 This month, the four correspondents at the Russian News Service submitted letters of resignation in protest of policies issued by the service's new pro-Kremlin management
 The policies forbid perceived opponents of the government from the airwaves, and require journalists to focus on the pro-Kremlin United Russia party and dedicate at least half of their broadcasts to so-called ''positive news,'' two of the resigning journalists said. 
 Vsevolod Neroznak, a former state television official who is now the service's editor in chief, said that the resignations had not prevented the network from working according to its new plan. New journalists were being hired, he said.
 He denied details of the resigning journalist's allegations, saying that there was no formula for positive news, but that positive news was part of the network's new philosophy. ''Our country is growing, our economy is developing, and there is a lot of positive news,'' he said. ''I cannot see any problem with this.''
 He also said that there was no blacklist of sources but that the network would not cover ''extremist items.'' Asked what constituted an extremist item, he said, ''There are Russian laws, and everything is written there.''
 Although it was not possible to evaluate listener reaction in full, comments posted on the news service's Web site suggested that some were angry, bored or disgusted.
 ''Down with Kremlin censorship!'' a listener wrote. ''Yesterday elevators were discussed. Today, buckwheat. Are not there any other topics?''
 Another, who identified himself as Stanislav, recalled the dull formats of the Communist past. ''I suggest we change the name to 'Putin News Service' or 'Soviet News Service,' '' he wrote. ''Such templates I heard only in the 70s and 80s -- extreme nonprofessionalism and surprisingly visible censorship. It's a disgrace.''

HEADLINE: Immigration Deal: A Step Forward?

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Senators in Bipartisan Deal on Broad Immigration Bill'' (front page, May 18):
While I applaud the effort in the Senate to end the illegal immigration stalemate, it is far too early to expect the measure to become law. 
 A year ago, the Senate passed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 to much fanfare. That bill also represented bipartisan compromise and promised a realistic resolution to the chaotic situation, but failed in the House. 
 With a Democratic Congress, this latest attempt might survive opponents' doomsday warnings of amnesty and the end of American culture. The danger is that politicians, skittish about next year's partisan primaries in both presidential and Congressional races, will bypass another opportunity for comprehensive immigration reform. 
 Until the politicians emerge from the shadows of silence and indecision, the American dream will resemble a pipe dream to millions of illegal immigrants. Wayne Trujillo Lakewood, Colo., May 18, 2007 The writer is the editor of Latino Suave. To the Editor:
 The immigration reform negotiators in the Senate announced an unworkable deal. Our elected leaders, in their politically expedient maneuvering, excluded from the dialogue the millions of working-class, undocumented immigrants who came out and marched all across the United States demanding a real, comprehensive reform. 
 Republicans and Democrats wanted to cater to both the conservative and liberal voters, and thus paid more attention to the 2008 elections than the lives and suffering of the immigrants who do not have a vote. 
 The so-called bipartisan move is a huge disappointment, because among other flaws the proposal takes away a family-based immigration path, prevents temporary workers from earning legalization, thereby perpetuating an indentured servitude, and links national security with immigration reform, rationalizing an increased border militarization, interior enforcement and national ID system. Partha Banerjee Brooklyn, May 18, 2007 To the Editor:
 It is commendable that the Senate finally seems to have reached a consensus on a bipartisan proposal for immigration reform. But it is disheartening to see that illegal immigrants would be given a path to citizenship, while people who have gone through the impossible to stay here legally are not being offered a naturalization program. 
 I have lived here for almost nine years. Four on a student visa that I duly renewed every year, one on Optional Practical Training permit, two more years doing my M.B.A. on yet another student visa and now on a H-1B working visa, for which my company shelled out more than $1,500 in government fees and much more in attorney fees. 
 In addition to paying all visa-related fees, I have dutifully paid government, state and local taxes (even on a portion of my university scholarship), as well as Social Security and Medicare while working. Am I not as entitled as an illegal immigrant to a green card, senators? Issidor Iliev-Wollitzer New York, May 18, 2007 To the Editor:
 The new immigration law smells, looks and walks a lot like the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.
 That act did not stop the flow of undocumented migration; rather, it created a black market for false Social Security cards, hence shifting the burden and criminal activity from business to the immigrant. In addition, the bureaucratic hoops that immigrants would have to jump through for residency are out of reach for many undocumented migrants since it requires time, money and information to maneuver through our complicated system. 
 As immigrants have adapted to the Immigration Reform and Control Act, newcomers and potential immigrants will do the same. It is naive to think that border control and sanctions, which have not worked in the past, will change the deeply embedded social and economic conditions that drive immigration in this country. Sang Lee Oakland, Calif., May 18, 2007 To the Editor:
 The new immigration bill misses the point entirely. It will not stop the flow of illegal immigrants across our borders with Mexico. All the money spent so far to build fences and hire new border agents has not stopped the flow of unemployed poor people coming to a country that welcomes their lawbreaking with a job. 
 Employers get major advantages by hiring illegal workers. They don't have to pay minimum wage, overtime pay, benefits and in many cases taxes because they pay cash. This country needs to punish the real lawbreakers: employers who hire illegal workers. 
 If the penalties were high enough and if repeat offenders were sent to jail, the illegal workers would stop coming because no employer would hire them; then and only then will the flow stop. 
 Most illegal immigrants are honest, hard-working people. As long as there are jobs for them here, they will continue to come. Mike Mitte Edmonds, Wash., May 18, 2007

HEADLINE: Couple Learn The High Price Of Easy Credit

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

DATELINE: YPSILANTI, Mich. 

 BODY:
On a recent evening, Christine Moellering, 40, sorted through the plastic laundry basket where she keeps the family bills, statements and coupons.
 ''The Sears one is 32.24 percent,'' Ms. Moellering said, reading a credit card statement with a balance of $5,955, including $155 in monthly finance charges. The high interest rate took her by surprise. ''That's nice,'' she said sarcastically.
Ms. Moellering, and her husband, Mark, 39, earn average salaries for their age (together about $66,000 a year), live in an average-priced home and have an average cost of living. But like many other households these days, they have found that their day-to-day economic life has come to depend not just on how much they earn or spend, but also on how well they shuffle what they owe among a broad array of credit cards, home equity loans and other lines of credit. 
 Americans spent one in seven of their take-home dollars on debt payments last year, up from one in nine in 1980. Experts say few consumers are able to calculate the true costs of such payments. 
 Behind closed doors, the decisions families like the Moellerings make about their debt -- when to pay it off, when to shuffle it to lower-interest sources and when to let it revolve and build -- can determine how much their salaries are worth. Like many others, the Moellerings have run up avoidable penalties and occasionally spent themselves into more debt or higher interest rates, even as they have tried to juggle other balances to bring down their monthly payments. 
 This spring they allowed a reporter to see how they struggled with these choices. Ms. Moellering's basket recently included more unwelcome news: $2,693 due on a Visa card through her credit union, including finance charges of $25, and $13,680 on a CashBuilder Elite Visa, including a monthly finance charge of $200. 
 Their credit card debt came to $22,228, including $380 in monthly finance charges. Interest varied from 12.1 percent to 32.24 percent. The Moellerings also have a mortgage of $93,000 and a home equity loan balance of $68,574, at 8 percent interest. 
 ''We have friends in the same position,'' said Ms. Moellering, who earns $30,000 a year as an administrative assistant. ''One was off his insurance for a couple weeks and he broke his arm, and they're out 25 or 30 thousand. We've talked to them about it. It doesn't matter what you do, you always have that credit card debt.'' 
 Just a generation ago, financial profiles like the Moellerings' would have been unusual. But changes in federal regulations since the 1980s, along with consolidation in the banking industry and changed consumer attitudes toward borrowing and saving, have made credit more widespread, more heavily marketed and more confusing, with offers of more credit -- at low rates -- extending to even the least reliable risk. In 2006, the industry mailed out nearly 8 billion credit card offers, up from 3.5 billion in 2000. 
 Credit card debt, less than $8 billion in 1968 (in current dollars), now exceeds $880 billion, more than tripling since 1988, adjusting for inflation, according to the Federal Reserve Bank. Penalty fees alone cost consumers $17.1 billion in 2006 -- up from $12.8 billion in 2003, adjusted for inflation, according to R. K. Hammer, a bank card advisory firm. In part because of the debt burden, the consumer savings rate fell below zero percent in 2005 and has stayed there.
 At the same time, as banks have moved from fixed interest rates to variable rates, the ability of borrowers like the Moellerings to move balances from one card to another, or from credit cards to lower-interest home equity loans, can have as much impact on their finances as whether they get a raise or trim household expenses, said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com. Especially since 2001, Mr. McBride said, as home values have increased and interest rates have dropped, home equity loans have enabled families to carry more debt -- to buy more things -- at lower cost. 
 ''It's a whole change in what we consider normal now,'' said Vanessa G. Perry, an assistant professor of marketing at the George Washington University School of Business. ''Not only has the total amount people borrow increased, but the number of instruments we borrow on has increased. An average family has a mortgage, home equity loan, various credit cards, a car loan, maybe a student loan.'' 
 The growth of easy credit has its upside, helping some families buy a first home or get through a temporary hardship. But the array of loans has become so complicated that many consumers fail to understand the different interest rates, financing charges and penalties they now face, Ms. Perry said. 
 For the Moellerings, juggling balances and interest rates has enabled them to pay for things they could not otherwise afford, like their 2004 wedding and house renovation, or to eat out occasionally, when ''we've both had a bad day at work,'' Mr. Moellering said. He earns $36,000 a year as a software applications designer. 
 As foster parents of two children they also receive about $1,200 a month in reimbursement from the State Department of Human Services, which goes toward ''food, general living and ballet lessons,'' Ms. Moellering said.
 When the Moellerings pay a bill late or exceed their credit limit, interest rates have shot up, increasing the monthly cost of transactions and heaping penalty fees on top. 
 The bills in Ms. Moellering's basket described an uneven track record of managing balances and interest rates. 
 On March 27, Mr. Moellering used a debit card rather than a credit card to make nine purchases, ranging from $5.38 to $48, hoping to avoid finance charges. But he miscalculated their checking account balance. Each purchase incurred an overdraft charge of $32, or a total of $288 in penalties, more than the $221.82 cost of the purchases. (After some pleading, the bank, National City, forgave four of the charges, leaving the Moellerings with $160 in penalties, plus interest on both the fees and the principal.) 
 Every two or three months they send in a payment late, running up a late fee of $30 or more. 
 Until a court ruling in 1996, most credit cards charged everyone the same fixed rate of interest, around 16 percent, and fees for late payments averaged about $14. But since then, rates have diverged wildly. Late fees typically run $30 to $39. 
 In their home, with the dishes from a dinner of spaghetti and diced vegetables on the table, the couple discussed their relationship with debt. A 42-inch television, an $800 Christmas gift from Mr. Moellering to his wife, occupied the older child, 4, in the living room. The baby slept.
 When the couple met through Yahoo personal ads in 2003, they did not discuss debt. She wrote that she liked snow; he said he looked like Babe Ruth. She had about $6,000 in credit card debt at the time, mostly from paying for books and living expenses after a return to college. She used credit cards rather than applying for lower-interest student loans. ''I never tried to get student loans,'' Ms. Moellering said. ''I was working full time and taking care of my sick mom and trying to go to school, so I never had time, so I just ad hoc'd.''
 Their debt escalated when they decided to get married. They paid for rings, a reception, a honeymoon and a new bathroom -- about $50,000 in a seven-month stretch. 
 ''In such a short period of time, there's no way to do it other than credit card debt,'' Mr. Moellering said.
 He paid for some of the expenses through a home equity loan, and paid contractors with promotional checks that came with low interest forthe first year. When money gets low, the Moellerings skip paying credit card companies rather than miss a mortgage payment. 
 ''And if the cat gets sick or something, then suddenly we're trying to figure out, what kind of card can we use to pay this $500 vet bill,'' he said. 
 In the last two years they have managed to cut their credit card debt by $20,000, Ms. Moellering said, and have built a savings of about $5,000, thanks to a Christmas gift from a relative. Ms. Moellering contributes to her retirement account at work. Both say they could manage better if they only had the time. 
 ''It's been almost two weeks since we've had time to sit down and go over the bills,'' Ms. Moellering said. ''You can't do it every day because we both work full time. I've got two kids; they want all our attention; they haven't seen us all day. We're trying to cook dinner. We have to do the dishes, fold the laundry. We're exhausted. And on the weekends the kids want our attention, and we want to spend time with them; we don't want to spend time going through the bills.''

HEADLINE: New Routes And New Risk To Flee Haiti

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: PROVIDENCIALES, Turks and Caicos, May 16 

 BODY:
There is no conceivable way to get from this island to Miami by bus. But the traffickers who ply Haiti's northern coastline in search of those willing to risk their bleak lives for better ones abroad tell some tall tales to fill their rickety boats.
 They describe this island chain, 150 miles off Haiti's northern coast, as being an easy hop to Miami, the ultimate goal of most migrating Haitians. Sometimes they tell migrants from Haiti's interior that the United States is a bus ride away as they talk of the big paychecks and full stomachs that await them.
The reality is different, of course, as was made clear when an overloaded Haitian sloop capsized off the coast of Turks and Caicos recently. As many as 90 migrants may have died in that episode, which passengers on the vessel blamed on the aggressive tactics of the local police.
 They were part of a swelling number of Haitians abandoning their country this year, apparently disillusioned with the slow pace of change coming from Haiti's year-old government. But with patrols along the Florida coastline making it increasingly difficult to land there, desperate Haitians are ''island hopping,'' as the United States Coast Guard calls it, looking for alternative routes and badly straining relations with their neighbors. 
 Turks and Caicos is hop No. 1, and it is not altogether happy about it. Local Haitians charge that authorities' efforts to combat illegal migrants have become so aggressive that they believe accusations that a police boat may have caused the capsizing of the Haitian vessel on May 4, despite official denials.
 Haitians now make up a huge percentage of the population here, exceeding the number of other residents, according to government estimates. With migrant boats landing regularly, authorities here and across the Caribbean are struggling to contain them. 
 ''It's a tremendous strain on the government, and we'd appreciate international assistance,'' said Lee Penn, who runs the detention center for illegal migrants in Providenciales, the financial capital of Turks and Caicos. ''We're feeding them and housing them and repatriating them -- and it's costing us.''
 What exactly happened at sea on May 4 remains uncertain, and is still under investigation by maritime authorities from Britain, which administers the territory.
 But it is clear that the voyage was hellish. After a day and a half packed together in a tiny craft, with nothing but water all around, the migrants finally saw lights on the horizon as they approached Turks and Caicos. Excitement grew, and then dreams turned to nightmares.
 With a police boat on the scene in rough waters, the Haitian boat went over on its side. Screams filled the air and bodies hit the water. In all, 61 dead Haitians were plucked from the sea, some of them with shark bites. Twenty or so others were never found. 
 ''The closest thing I could compare it to was Katrina, with that many people floating in the water,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Jennifer Arko, a Coast Guard helicopter pilot who responded to the scene and who had done search-and-rescue work over post-hurricane New Orleans. 
 Of the 69 men and nine women who survived, none would succeed in escaping their desperate lives back home. All were flown back to Cap Haitien, a city on Haiti's northern coast and a major departure point for migrants. 
 Inspector Hilton Duncan of the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force said it was a fierce storm, not the police, that forced the Haitian sloop to capsize. He acknowledged that the crowded boat was being towed to shore by the police when it went over. Immediately, he said, a rescue effort ensued, involving the police, other government boats, good Samaritans and the Coast Guard.
 ''For five officers on a boat, at that time of morning, with that type of weather, rescuing 78 people ought to bring a commendation,'' said Inspector Duncan. ''But people don't see it that way.''
 But before they were returned home, the surviving Haitian migrants charged that the Turks and Caicos police boat had not responded to their capsized vessel, as the police originally said. 
 The migrants charged that the police had rammed them in the rough waters and that the overloaded sloop went over when it was being hauled farther out to sea by the police boat.
 ''We fell into the water and many people drowned,'' Marcelin Charles, 37, one of the passengers, told The Associated Press. ''I was swimming past dead bodies left and right.''
 The tragedy focused attention on the growing exodus of Haitians in recent months and the increasing enforcement efforts to thwart them. In April alone, the United States Coast Guard picked up 704 Haitians at sea, almost as many as the 769 migrants interdicted during all of last year. 
 President Rene Preval took office last May amid high expectations that he would end a long bout of violence and economic stagnation. But reversing course has proved challenging: after a spike in kidnappings at the end of 2006 that terrorized residents of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, the United Nations peacekeeping force in Haiti has only recently begun to make headway in controlling the insecurity there. Meanwhile, hunger and joblessness linger.
 The Haitian migrants follow the wind to the Bahamas, to Bermuda, or here in Turks and Caicos, any place that might offer a way to make a living or might take them closer to the United States.
 It is a pattern similar to that of other Caribbean migrants. Cubans, for instance, are trying alternative routes to escape that island. The emerging route: west to the Mexican coast and then overland to the United States border.
 But Haitians have it harder than others. They are not allowed to stay if they reach American soil, like the Cubans. They are not granted temporary protected status while their countries recover from war and natural disasters, like those who have fled Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.
 And if they make it ashore on Turks and Caicos, their efforts at escape have just begun.
 Immigration agents are on the lookout for illegal Haitians throughout the eight inhabited islands that make up Turks and Caicos, demanding proof of legal residency from everyone they stop.
 ''We're a small country, and if these people are continuing to come, it causes problems for us,'' Mr. Penn said. ''We've become a stepping stone.''
 Residents here speak of the need to maintain their identity. A British territory, the islands have a governor appointed by Queen Elizabeth as well as a local premier. One government survey estimated the population at 33,000, only a third of whom are longtime residents. Haitians make up the bulk of the foreigners. 
 In recent months, immigration agents in search of illegal Haitians have waited outside Haitian churches on the island to grab parishioners without papers. In one case, they barged inside All Saints Baptist Church and took five migrants out. Legal Haitians who hire or house a migrant -- or even allow one into their homes -- face legal jeopardy, local Haitians say.
 Residents recall that back in 1998 another boatload of escaping Haitians died off the shore here, after the police fired at the boat. Authorities say they were firing warning shots and did not cause that vessel to capsize.
 ''We're still human and ought to be treated that way,'' said James Prosper, a Haitian-born pastor who has lived in Turks and Caicos for 24 years and who complained to the government recently about the rough treatment endured by those caught without papers.
 ''If a Haitian is mistreated, I feel it, because it's in my blood,'' said Ronald Gardiner, a Haitian-born businessman who is now a ''Belonger,'' as citizens of Turks and Caicos are called.
 On Turks and Caicos, Haitians pick up trash and sweep the streets. They make the hotel beds and pour the concrete.
 The tourism industry here is booming, a far cry from the 1990s when a Gallup poll found the islands had the lowest name recognition in the world. Now, Hollywood stars vacation in hidden bungalows. Other well-heeled sun worshipers fly in on tickets that can cost less than the several thousand dollars some Haitians pay to get a spot on a sloop.
 The police here say some migrants smuggle drugs and guns, which means every sloop is considered a security threat. In fact, the recent deaths revived a call among local officials to create a defense force to better patrol the surrounding waters.
 ''These are poor people seeking a better life but among them are criminals,'' Inspector Duncan said in an interview. ''We believe some of them may be former members of the Tontons Macoute,'' a reference to the armed thugs who ruled the Haitian countryside during the long years of the Duvalier dictatorships.
 The Haitian authorities hope the tragedy may help keep more Haitians home. They are considering using photos of the latest overturned vessel and the resulting bodies thrown into the sea as part of a public education campaign to discourage others from making the trip.
 ''The answer to migration is economic development and, as you know, that won't happen overnight,'' said Louis Joseph, who is Haiti's ambassador to the Bahamas. ''When you don't have money to eat or to send your children to school, you don't know what to do. So you leave -- or you try, like these people did.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Sentiment Registers an Upturn

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Consumer sentiment took a surprise upturn in early May, as a favorable job outlook and a strong stock market muted the impact of record gasoline prices, according to a poll published yesterday. 
 Moreover, rising gasoline prices did not intensify consumers' inflation fears, as some analysts had predicted.
The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its preliminary May consumer sentiment index rose to 88.7, from 87.1 at the end of April. The latest figure was above the median forecast of 86.5 among 65 analysts polled by Reuters.
 Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said that after ''the repeated increases over the past few years, it is hardly surprising'' that $3-a-gallon gasoline has lost its shock value.
 The survey's gauge of current consumer conditions was 103.8 in early May, down from a final April reading of 104.6, but its measure of consumer expectations rose to 79.0, from 75.9.
 ''The full impact of higher gas prices may have been masked by increases in stock prices as well as a stronger outlook for employment,'' Mr. Curtin said in a statement.
 The unexpected improvement in the index helped soothe worries about the economy and corporate profits, extending the upswing in stocks, although bond prices stayed in negative territory.
 The current stock market rally, fueled by a surge in mergers and acquisitions and better-than-expected earnings, has cushioned household wealth, which had been crimped by a slowdown in the housing market.
 While job growth has slowed, the labor market remains tight and income has been growing at a steady clip.
 The preliminary May figures showed that consumers by and large were not rattled by the recent surge in gasoline prices, which broke above $3 a gallon in recent weeks, the survey said.
 The survey's one-year inflation-expectations index edged down to 3.2 percent in early May, from a seven-month high of 3.3 percent in late April, while its 5- to 10-year inflation-expectations index held steady at 3.1 percent.
 The national price for regular unleaded gasoline averaged $3.10 a gallon, a record, up 5 cents from last week and up 16 cents from a year earlier, the Energy Information Administration said Monday.
 The factory sector also showed modest growth in March. The Commerce Department said yesterday that it did not adjust its March readings on factory orders, which grew 3.1 percent, as part of its annual benchmark revisions.
 A drop in jobless claims and booming stock prices put a weekly gauge of future economic growth at a three-year high.
 The Economic Cycle Research Institute's weekly leading index edged up to 142.7 in the week that ended May 11, increasing its annualized growth rate to 6.1 percent. The rate reached its highest since the week ended May 21, 2004.

HEADLINE: Work, Money and Regret

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
HERE'S something to think about the next time you find yourself staring at the office clock waiting for the workday to end: a survey of 1,500 British retirees found that a substantial amount of the regret they had about their life revolved around work and finances.
 According to the results published in Men's Health: 
 33 percent said they wished they had stood up to the boss at least once.
 40 percent said they did not save enough. 
 45 percent said they stayed at one job too long.
 ''To avoid similar grief, write out your current regrets and what you wish you had done instead,'' the magazine says, quoting Joseph J. Luciani, author of ''Self-Coaching.'' ''Consider any common themes on your list in making future decisions.''
 PERFECT JOBS -- Given the focus of the magazine -- it is, after all, called Outside -- most of the attention is paid to employment that requires a bit of strenuous exercise. That said, the magazine's cover article -- ''37 Dream Jobs'' --does list some pretty cool occupations.
 There are the people who are paid to surf -- they are either on the professional surfing tour (yep, there is one), design surf gear and accessories, or both. There are charter boat captains, heli-ski pilots (''a recent pilot shortage has made being a chop jock more lucrative'') and ''enviro-crusaders'' like James Gustave Speth, dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and others. 
 And then there is the common fantasy of becoming a winemaker. Ames Morison, who used to teach school in the South Bronx, bought (with the help of a friend, Christopher Medlock James, ''a money manager'') a 320-acre property in Sonoma County, California, in 1998. 
 Three years later, they bottled their first merlot. They have subsequently added a cabernet sauvignon and a chardonnay to the Medlock Ames label. 
 POSITIVE SPIN -- It probably won't surprise you to learn that Google, which is famous for catering to its workers, offers employees on-site bicycle-repair kits, loaner bikes and bike racks on company shuttle vans (with the promise of an emergency lift home, should you need it.) 
 But what is unexpected, according to Bicycling Magazine, is how many other companies are offering incentives to pedal to work. For example, the Calvert Group, which sells mutual funds, offers a ''one-time $350 reimbursement toward purchase of a bicycle for commuting.'' 
 Stark Mountain Woodworking in Vermont goes further, offering $500 to buy a bike and another $500 ''for logging 650 annual bike-commuting miles.''
 ''If your workplace doesn't offer similar benefits, slip this list onto the boss's desk -- or use it to plan your next career move,'' the author, Alan Cote, suggests.
 If he gets cranky, we guess you can always pedal to the unemployment line.
 THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS -- If you want to be more creative, have more fun. That is the conclusion Prevention draws from a University of Toronto study that showed that ''volunteers were better able to solve challenging word puzzles after thinking happy thoughts and listening to upbeat music.'' 
 Conversely, Amanda MacMillan writes, serious moods and sad music ''limited their ability to think outside the box.''
 ''If you're upset,'' she writes, ''your brain focuses only on what you're anxious about -- like peering through a narrow porthole.'' 
 PERSUASIVE COFFEE -- ''Having trouble convincing a colleague that you're right? Slip her a couple of iced cappuccinos,'' Working Mother writes. A moderate dose of caffeine (about two cups of coffee) might make her see your side, according to research published in The European Journal of Social Psychology.
 The study found that in addition to increasing alertness, caffeine increases the ability to be influenced.
 ''It's most effective in the morning, so for the sake of argument, deliver that java early.''
 FINAL TAKE -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, according to Entrepreneur magazine, reports that 15.4 percent -- that is more than one in seven -- sexual harassment cases last year were filed by men. PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: Collins & Aikman Sues David Stockman, Its Former Chief

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Collins & Aikman Corporation, the auto parts maker reorganizing in bankruptcy, has sued its former chief executive, David A. Stockman, and 13 others connected with the company and a private equity firm, accusing them of using fraudulent schemes that worsened its financial troubles. 
 Collins & Aikman also sued two former auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG, saying that they violated professional standards and acted with lack of care.
The lawsuit comes as Mr. Stockman and other former executives face criminal charges that accuse them of similar conduct. Mr. Stockman and three others have pleaded not guilty.
 In the suit, filed this week in Federal District Court in Delaware, the company said that ''defendants concealed the true financial results of operations and condition of the company, embarking on a fraudulent accounting scheme which hastened the demise of the company and left it unable to right itself.''
 PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a statement that it ''believes its work complied with all professional standards and intends to defend this case vigorously.'' A KPMG spokesman, Dan Ginsburg, said his firm had not yet seen the complaint.
 The private equity firm Heartland Industrial Partners, which took a controlling stake in Collins & Aikman in 2001, intends to defend itself against the accusations, a spokeswoman said.
 Mr. Stockman's lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz, could not be reached for comment.
 Mr. Stockman, the former Michigan congressman and budget director for President Ronald Reagan, became a private equity investor after leaving government and helped found Heartland in 1999. He became a Collins & Aikman director in 2001 and served as its chief from August 2003 to May 2005.
 Collins & Aikman filed for bankruptcy protection five days after Mr. Stockman's departure. It plans to liquidate its remaining businesses and other assets.
 Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have accused Mr. Stockman and three other former executives of orchestrating a scheme to hide the company's true financial condition when it was on the brink of collapse.
 Four other former company officials, including its treasurer, have pleaded guilty to related charges. The investigation in that case was conducted by the Postal Inspection Service.
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has also brought civil charges against Mr. Stockman and eight others.

HEADLINE: Internet Giants Vie to Snap Up Web Ad Firms

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT; Matt Richtel, Steve Lohr and Eric Pfanner contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It's a good time to be an Internet advertising company. 
 In the struggle for advantage in the digital advertising boom, companies like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and AOL are rapidly acquiring once-obscure firms, sometimes for eye-popping prices. The payoff, they hope, will be in the relationships and technology that can deliver the right ad to the right person at the right time across myriad online sites.
The struggle reached new heights yesterday when Microsoft agreed to buy the online advertising company aQuantive for about $6 billion. It is Microsoft's largest acquisition ever and a sign of its struggle to build an Internet ad business on its own.
 The purchase caps a month of intense deal making, ignited when Google agreed to buy DoubleClick, a competitor of aQuantive, for $3.1 billion, outbidding Microsoft. Since then, all of Google's main competitors have snapped up online advertising specialists. 
 Underlying the deals, which total more than $10.5 billion, is a transformation of the advertising world away from traditional media like television, radio and print.
 ''We've reached a tipping point,'' said Bryan Wiener, chief executive of 360i, a search marketing company based in New York. ''It's not just talk anymore. The flood of dollars online is starting to accelerate to match the amount of time we spend online.''
 Online ads accounted for 5.8 percent of the $285 billion spent on advertising in the United States in 2006, according to eMarketer, a research firm. It estimates that the online share will rise to 10.2 percent by 2010.
 In the first quarter of this year, AT&T spent $79 million on online image-based advertising, compared with $55.6 million in the quarter a year ago, according to Nielsen/NetRatings Ad Relevance. The Ford Motor Company increased its purchases to $29 million in the period, from $7 million a year earlier.
 As those dollars move online, the big Internet companies see a chance to capture an ever-larger portion of the ad business, and they are seeking to expand. 
 Until recently, for instance, Google was largely focused on selling small text ads that appear alongside its search results and on other Web sites. Microsoft and Yahoo have sought a piece of that business and have sold ads on their own Web portals, which attract hundreds of millions of users each month.
 Now, the large Internet companies all want to become intermediaries between advertisers and the millions of Web sites that have fragmented the online audience. And they are hoping to help deliver ads to online video games, cellphones and Internet television services. 
 ''This is about the opportunity,'' said Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's platforms and services division. ''We believe that there are tens of billions of dollars in economic value that can be generated in this industry, and we are committed to getting a bigger share of it.''
 Analysts say that strengthening its online advertising business is particularly critical for Microsoft, not only because the company has lagged behind competitors like Google and Yahoo, but also because a major technological shift risks eroding the company's core software business. 
 Google, which leads the online advertising world, is among those trying to make inroads into Microsoft's traditional software business by offering word processing, spreadsheets and other software free.
 Microsoft has ''a strategic need to get into advertising in a big way and to protect the castle against the Google onslaught,'' said Todd Dagres, founder and general partner of Spark Capital, a venture capital firm in Boston. 
 So far, Microsoft's online advertising efforts have been a mixed bag. Seeking to compete more effectively with Google and Yahoo, Microsoft made a major investment in building a search engine and a technology system to deliver ads on it. Despite that effort, Microsoft's share of the online search audience has declined steadily, making it harder to persuade advertisers to use the system.
 ''To effectively compete with the likes of Google and Yahoo, Microsoft needs to have a large base of advertisers,'' said Anthony Noto, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. Mr. Noto said that Google had more than 500,000 advertisers and Yahoo about 300,000, while Microsoft has only a small fraction of that. ''As long as that gap exists, they will have an inferior ability to monetize their own product,'' Mr. Noto said.
 Now aQuantive, which is based in Seattle, will bring many advertisers to Microsoft -- and more. 
 The company has three business units, including Atlas, which like DoubleClick sells tools to advertisers and Web publishers that select and deliver the ads that appear on any given Web page when a user clicks on it. The so-called ad-serving technology, for which aQuantive charges a fee, uses data collected across the Web to figure out which ads are likely to be relevant to a particular user.
 For example, when a user visits a news Web site, an ad server might deliver an ad from a marketer that is trying to reach the typical reader of the site. Even more valuable, it might make a match between the marketer's target audience and typical readers of a news article on a particular subject. 
 The technology also uses the data to help Web publishers earn the most for the ad space available on their sites. That could also help Microsoft get more from the ads that appear on its own Internet portal. 
 Additionally, the DRIVEpm unit of aQuantive brings to Microsoft an advertising network that buys ad space from online publishers and sells it to advertisers. Both units would give Microsoft a greater role in brokering and selling ads outside of its own Web portal, MSN. 
 It is that same ambition that explains the recent wave of deals by other Internet companies. In addition to Google's purchase of DoubleClick, Yahoo recently bought the 80 percent of Right Media that it did not already own for $680 million. The company operates an auction marketplace in which advertisers and publishers buy and sell online advertising space in real time. 
 This week, AOL bought Third Screen Media, which operates an ad network for mobile phones, and Adtech, an online advertising firm in Germany. AOL was the first Internet portal to buy a major advertising network, Advertising.com, in 2004.
 ''We early on saw the value of a big owned and operated portal, plus a large third-party network,'' said Michael J. Kelly, president of AOL Media Networks. 
 The recent deals are also blurring the lines between the big Internet companies and traditional advertising companies like the Omnicom Group, WPP Group and Publicis Groupe, potentially bringing them into conflict. 
 On Thursday, the WPP Group bought 24/7 Real Media, another DoubleClick competitor, for $649 million, to compete better with Internet companies.
 And in aQuantive, Microsoft is also getting the Avenue A/Razorfish unit, a leading interactive agency that helps marketers plan advertising campaigns, design ads and place those ads on Web sites either directly or by taking part in ad networks and exchanges. 
 This is ''a watershed week for advertising in general,'' said Rich LeFurgy, a former Madison Avenue executive who is an online advertising consultant and investor. ''The boundary between ad agencies and ad media has been breached at the highest level. That's never happened before.'' 
 To understand how hot the market for online advertising technology has become, consider aQuantive's stock price, which opened the year at about $25 a share. The company's shares jumped when Google said it would buy DoubleClick for what many analysts thought was a steep price. Microsoft ultimately offered $66.50 a share in cash for aQuantive, an 85 percent premium over its closing price Thursday. Shares of aQuantive soared 78 percent yesterday, to $63.79.
 Microsoft said the bidding for aQuantive was competitive, but would not say which other companies were interested in acquiring it. But having been outbid by Google for DoubleClick, Microsoft may have believed it could not afford to let this deal get away.
 ''They weren't going to lose this process,'' said a person close to the transaction. ''That's why they paid the price they did.'' The conversations between Microsoft and aQuantive ''got serious after the Google-DoubleClick deal was announced,'' this person said.
 Microsoft said the acquisition would require antitrust review.
 The software giant has asked regulators to scrutinize the Google-DoubleClick deal, which it said would reduce competition. But Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said during a conference call with analysts that Microsoft and aQuantive were complementary businesses and that their union would promote competition. 
 The pursuit of online advertising businesses has not gone unnoticed by venture capitalists, who are financing a new generation of ad-focused start-up companies.
 In 2006, these investors put $372 million into companies involved in Internet marketing services, according to the National Venture Capital Association, an industry trade group. That was the highest annual figure since 2000.
 Carl Eibl, a managing director at Enterprise Partners Venture Capital, a San Diego firm, said there was a sense of urgency among entrepreneurs and investors to start companies based on Internet advertising and marketing and to develop them quickly. ''There's a race to critical mass and a race to position,'' he said. 
 In that respect, he said investors view the recent spate of acquisitions as ''heartening but also sobering.''
 ''The key acquisitions are happening right now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Picking a World Bank President

 BODY:
For decades, the World Bank has lectured borrowers on the virtues of competitive bidding, merit selection and transparent procedures. Yet when it has come to choosing the bank's leadership, Washington has never accepted those principles. 
 Custom gives United States presidents the power to award the World Bank presidency to any American -- whether or not they have appropriate managerial skills or development credentials. European leaders exercise patronage authority over the top job at the International Monetary Fund.
That deeply flawed selection process produced the Paul Wolfowitz debacle. It is offensive not only for its hypocrisy, but because it has long made the bank a less effective and credible vehicle for financing international development than it should be. It ought to be reformed now, before Mr. Wolfowitz's successor is chosen. The ground rules should be changed to require merit selection and open up the job to highly qualified applicants worldwide.
 Unfortunately, that is not likely to happen. As part of the backroom negotiations that won over the White House and Mr. Wolfowitz to the idea of a resignation, the bank's directors signaled that they would let President Bush decide who would fill out the three years left in the current presidential term. 
 Mr. Bush needs to choose more carefully than he did last time. He needs a high-quality nominee to raise the funds the bank will soon need from Congress and European donor nations, to rebuild battered staff morale, and, most important, to pursue a coherent development and anticorruption agenda. 
 Two plausible candidates now reportedly under consideration are Robert Zoellick, the former deputy secretary of state who is now a Goldman Sachs managing director, and Robert Kimmitt, deputy secretary of the Treasury. 
 A bolder choice would be Ashraf Ghani, a former World Bank official who holds American, as well as Afghan citizenship. Mr. Ghani did an impressive job as Afghanistan's finance minister a few years back. That would allow Mr. Bush to choose an American while also getting someone with firsthand experience in the developing world.

HEADLINE: A Return to the Land, for Fuel

BYLINE: By MATT VILLANO

DATELINE: LAHAINA, Hawaii 

 BODY:
Here on the West Side of Maui, where lush mountainsides and the warm waters of the Alalakeiki Channel juxtapose increasingly crowded roadways and a spate of new luxury hotels, the push for renewable energy has found an unlikely advocate: the chief executive of one of the most aggressive developers on the island.
 The real estate maven, David Cole, has used his position as head of Maui Land and Pineapple, a land holding and operating company, to promote sustainable development. The effort harks back to Hawaii's past, with plans to return some farmland to production -- this time for energy rather than food -- after so many years in which the state turned its back on its agricultural history in a headlong rush into tourism and real estate.
Perhaps the most notable effort is Hawaii BioEnergy, an international consortium that includes two other local landowners, Tarpon Investimentos, an investment company in Bermuda, and Brasil Bioenergia, an energy company in Sao Paulo. 
 The consortium, which also involves the co-founder of America Online, Stephen M. Case, and the venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, took form last July with the goal to make Hawaii, which has long had to pay high prices for imported fuel, largely energy-independent.
 ''As islanders, we've had to provide for our own survival for hundreds and hundreds of years,'' said Mr. Cole, 55, who was raised on Oahu but spent most of his adult life on the mainland before coming to Maui in 2003.
 ''Now that the technology exists to turn some of our natural resources into energy, there's no reason we should be getting energy from anywhere else,'' he said.
 While companies on the mainland are subsidized to produce ethanol from corn, Hawaiian companies and Hawaii BioEnergy are turning to other materials, particularly sugar cane, which are potentially far more efficient sources of ethanol per input of energy and raw material than corn.
 Statistics from the Department of Energy, the Renewable Fuels Association in Washington and evidence from Brazil's experience indicate that ethanol from sugar cane is considerably cheaper to produce than ethanol from corn, a savings that potentially could trickle down to consumers in the form of lower energy bills.
 Even without these numbers, the business case for investing in alternative energy in Hawaii is compelling. The Hawaiian archipelago relies on imported oil for nearly 90 percent of its energy needs, making it one of the most expensive places in the nation to buy gasoline and pay for electricity and heat.
 In May 2006, Hawaii passed a bill requiring that 20 percent of all highway fuel demand by 2020 must be provided by renewable fuels like ethanol, biodiesel or hydrogen. Another bill under consideration in the State Legislature would allow biofuel processing centers to be permitted in agriculture districts and would develop a baseline percentage of energy feedstock to be grown in the state.
 Charmaine Tavares, mayor of Maui County, which includes the islands of Maui, Lanai, Molokai and Kahoolawe, said the goals were ''admirable,'' but noted that more immediate changes were necessary as well.
 ''Every time we pay our energy bills, we're all aware of the need for renewable energy,'' Ms. Tavares said. ''The year 2020 just seems pretty far away.''
 Mr. Cole, whose company is one of the largest landowners on Maui, agreed. Last summer, after an eye-opening trip to Brazil, he took matters into his own hands.
 With the help of Mr. Case, whom he met during a stint at America Online in the 1990s, Mr. Cole signed up Hawaiian landowners like Kamehameha Schools, an independent school system and the largest landowner in the state, and the Grove Farm Company, a 22,000-acre sugar cane plantation in eastern Kauai that is owned by Mr. Case.
 The pair also enlisted help from companies overseas, and recruited Mr. Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems in 1982 who has become one of the biggest backers of renewable energy in the world. Hawaii BioEnergy was born.
 Since then, these founding partners and Maui Land and Pineapple have invested nearly $1 million in cash and put a number of full-time employees to work running the business. They expect other investors to help raise an additional $50 million to $80 million to get the operation off the ground.
 ''When you consider the tropical weather and all the sun Hawaii gets, it is a perfect place to prove that fuels made from biomass can be cost-competitive,'' Mr. Khosla said of the project.
 Still, the real heart of this consortium is land. The three landowners own about 10 percent of the arable soil in the state: 450,000 acres in all.
 Though most of this soil is fallow today, Mr. Case wrote in a recent e-mail exchange that the partners plan to combine contiguous parcels, coordinate planting, harvesting and processing operations, and maximize economies of scale.
 ''These efforts are not without risk, but anything important has risks,'' he wrote of the Hawaii BioEnergy plan. ''Hawaii's first act was agriculture, and the second act was tourism. Now it is time for the third act, Hawaii 3.0.''
 By some accounts, this new era is already under way. From a conference room at the understated Maui Land and Pineapple headquarters in Kahalui, Mr. Cole recently reviewed a new Hawaii BioEnergy feasibility study for producing ethanol from sugar cane on Maui, noting that the consortium could begin plant construction as soon as 2010.
 Ultimately, he said, the plant would produce 27 million to 28 million gallons of ethanol a year, and would use the fuel to defray its own energy costs and to sell elsewhere in the state. He added that the group has explored other potential sources for ethanol, including soybeans, switch grass and a type of elephant grass called miscanthus.
 Mr. Cole noted that the consortium also looked into producing ethanol from potential ''co-products'' of the fuel-making process, including electricity from bagasse (the residue produced after crushing sugar cane), biodiesel from algae nourished by carbon dioxide off-take in the distillation process and animal feeds from the residual algae stream. All together, burning this additional ethanol could add another 25 to 30 megawatts of sustainable power capacity, Mr. Cole said.
 ''Part of our conception is that we get the most out of the project by making all waste streams into food streams for something else,'' Mr. Cole explained. ''Before we invest in a particular technology, we want to be sure we're investing in the technology that will give us the biggest and broadest return.''
 To be sure, Hawaii BioEnergy is not the only partnership interested in renewable energy; elsewhere, the state's two remaining sugar cane companies are exploring renewable energy efforts of their own.
 On Kauai, for example, the cane producer Gay & Robinson recently received a state permit to build a $36 million ethanol plant in the town of Pakala as part of a joint venture with a local energy company. The other concern, the Maui-based Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar, is also investigating renewable fuels.
 Because these companies currently combine to harvest 270,000 tons of sugar cane each year, they may be closer to actually producing renewable energy than Hawaii BioEnergy is. Alan Kennett, president and general manager of Gay & Robinson, suggested that his company could begin ethanol production as early as next year.
 David Pimentel, professor of ecology and agricultural sciences at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., said the fact that there would soon be various options for renewable energy in Hawaii was a step in the right direction.
 ''Any investment in renewable energy is a good investment,'' he said. ''Beyond that, Hawaii should be practicing general conservation with smaller cars, less air-conditioning and decreased consumption over all.''
 If anybody understands the need for conservation in Hawaii, Mr. Cole does. A stocky man with a graying goatee, he grew up in Kailua, a suburb of Honolulu, hiking through tropical forests and hanging out on beaches with friends. His first job on the island was delivering copies of The Honolulu Advertiser. He attended the University of Hawaii as an undergraduate.
 Mr. Cole left Maui for law school on the mainland in the 1970s. Though he spent almost 30 years there before returning to head Maui Land and Pineapple in 2003, his love for the local environment still runs deep; he regularly rhapsodizes about the beauty of dawn, the sweet sounds of birds and the annual migration of humpback whales.
 He also serves as chairman of the Hawaii Nature Conservancy.
 Mr. Cole has extended these pro-environment ideals to many of his business decisions. This year, when construction crews dismantled the former Kapalua Bay Hotel, which is owned by a subsidiary of Maui Land and Pineapple, Mr. Cole required them to reuse 97 percent of the material in the company's new offices.
 Instead of recycling, he called the process ''upcycling,'' and noted that his desk was a door in its former life.
 Planning the next development -- an upscale neighborhood on the slopes of Mount Haleakala called Haliimaile (pronounced hah-lee-ee-my-lee) -- Mr. Cole has commissioned architects to design the enclave to minimize vehicle use, create a natural water filtration system, and incorporate solar and wind energy so residents generate more power than they consume.
 Though the neighborhood is still in the permitting process and probably years away, Mr. Cole said he hoped this kind of forward thinking, together with the efforts of Hawaii BioEnergy, would eventually inspire outsiders to look to Hawaii for ideas about responsible and sustainable development.
 ''The whole world is looking for models,'' he said. ''Years from now, when people think about renewable energy, I want them to look here and say, 'If it worked for Hawaii, it can work for us.' '' The Energy Challenge

HEADLINE: China Slightly Loosens the Reins on Its Currency's Market Fluctuation

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 18 

 BODY:
China's central bank announced Friday that it would begin allowing the country's currency to fluctuate more during each day's foreign exchange trading, but again rebuffed demands from the United States and Europe for a sustained rise in the currency.
 The central bank also raised interest rates and demanded that commercial banks set aside more of their assets as reserves that cannot be lent. Both of the moves are aimed at reducing the risk of overheating in an economy that is growing at more than 11 percent and at taming speculation in domestic stock markets that have more than tripled since the beginning of last year.
The announcement came as top American and Chinese economic policy makers prepared to meet next week in Washington in an effort to head off growing pressures from Congress to confront China over the widening American trade deficit.
 But economists said that the latest policy moves, which take effect on Saturday, were unlikely to have any practical effect on China's soaring exports, while the initial reaction from Washington was cautious. 
 The People's Bank of China said in a statement posted on its Web site (http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english/detail.asp?col=6400&id=837) that it would allow the country's currency, known as the yuan, to rise or fall up to 0.5 percent in each day's trading. The current daily limit is 0.3 percent.
 But the central bank gave a clear signal in its statement that the policy should not be interpreted as Chinese willingness to allow a run-up in the value of the yuan. The bank said it would continue to ''keep the exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies.''
 The bank issued a separate statement quoting an unidentified spokesman as saying that the decision did not mean that the exchange rate ''will see large ups and downs, nor large appreciations.''
 The People's Bank has not allowed the yuan to move the maximum allowed percentage on any day since it broke the yuan's peg to the dollar on July 21, 2005. The Chinese government allowed the yuan to rise 2.1 percent then, and has let it inch up by only another 5 percent over the nearly two years since.
 In contrast, members of Congress from manufacturing states that have lost jobs during China's export boom have been calling for China to revalue by 25 percent or more. If China did allow the yuan to rise more quickly, Chinese exports would become more expensive in foreign markets and foreign goods would be more competitive in China.
 Liang Hong, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Goldman Sachs, said in a research note that the wider trading band represented ''a symbolic but laudable development in China's foreign exchange reform.''
 The initial reaction from Congress was chilly. ''To widen the band is well and good, but if they don't use the band, nothing will happen,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who has called for steep tariffs on goods from China unless Beijing lets the yuan rise.
 The Bush administration was also cautious but a little more welcoming. ''This is a useful step towards greater flexibility and an eventual float of the currency,'' said Brookly McLaughlin, a Treasury spokeswoman. ''It's important now that Chinese authorities use the wider band and allow greater currency movement within each day and over time.''
 Stephen Green, an economist in the Shanghai office of Standard Chartered Bank, said that China was likely to allow slightly faster appreciation in the next few days but that the long-term rate of appreciation would not change. There have been just two single-day rises of 0.16 percent and two single-day drops of 0.17 percent in two years, while the rest of the trading has fallen within an even narrower range, he added.
 Widening the daily trading band is nonetheless the latest and most noticeable in a long series of steps by Chinese officials to gently awaken businesses to the risks that fluctuating currencies can pose. China pegged the yuan at 8.28 to the dollar from 1997 to 2005, lulling some businesses into ignoring currency risk.
 In interviews last month at the Canton Fair, exporters from all over China said that they were paying closer attention to exchange rates. While Chinese export contracts are still denominated mainly in dollars, Chinese companies increasingly demand that their foreign customers agree to provisions requiring the buyer to pay extra if the dollar starts falling faster against the yuan. 
 Chinese officials acknowledge that there are arguments for faster appreciation of the yuan, but contend that this could threaten ''social stability.'' Chinese workers making goods like textiles that compete with exports from even lower-wage countries could protest if currency appreciation makes their products uncompetitive and costs them their jobs. 
 Two-thirds of China's population still lives in rural areas and the agricultural sector is barely competitive with imports at current currency levels, raising the prospect of increased rural unemployment if the yuan rose sharply and food imports surged.
 The People's Bank of China also announced on Friday that it was raising the benchmark regulated rate for one-year bank deposits by 0.27 percentage point, to 3.06 percent, and increasing the benchmark rate for one-year bank loans by 0.18 percentage point, to 6.57 percent.
 By raising deposit rates more than lending rates, the government showed confidence that the banks had put enough of their bad-loan problems behind them to survive on slightly narrower profit margins. Higher deposit rates also make it a little more attractive for Chinese families to put their savings in banks, instead of risking them in China's feverish stock markets.
 But raising domestic lending rates could make it harder for China to allow further appreciation of the yuan.
 That is because the central bank is itself a borrower. It borrows yuan, by issuing bonds, to pay for its extensive interventions in currency markets, where it has accumulated $1.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, mainly dollars.
 The central bank earns a higher interest rate on American Treasury securities than it pays on yuan-denominated bonds at home. The authorities use this profit from the difference in interest rates to cover losses on the foreign exchange reserves, which are worth less and less in yuan as the yuan appreciates.
 The semiofficial China Business News newspaper reported on Friday that the government had entrusted $3 billion to the Blackstone Group, the private equity firm, to invest abroad. Blackstone declined to comment; the company is in a ''quiet'' period before a planned initial offering on the New York Stock Exchange.
 The central bank also ordered banks to hold 11.5 percent of assets as reserves effective Saturday, up from 11 percent. Many banks already have even larger reserves, however, as they have been swamped with deposits from China's brisk economic growth and large trade surplus, and have had trouble finding ways to lend this money.

HEADLINE: The World Bank After Wolfowitz

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Wolfowitz Resigns, Ending Long Fight at World Bank'' (front page, May 18): 
The acceptance of the terms requested by Paul D. Wolfowitz by the board of directors of the World Bank underscores the lack of backbone of this institution and the need for urgent change in its governance system. 
 If Mr. Wolfowitz was not guilty of the charges, he should have remained in his post, but if not, the dismissal should have been crystal clear as to his ethical shortcomings. Unfortunately, this did not happen. 
 Once more, the board of directors' actions show a double standard where the rich and the powerful are above the law and the people whom the bank should be protecting are judged by different standards. Saul Malozowski Rockville, Md., May 18, 2007 To the Editor: 
 As a fitting testimony to George W. Bush's administration and an immortal reminder of the scandal-ridden appointees he stuck with to the very end, the president might consider having the following accountability escape clause -- a favorite fallback of many a former acolyte -- inscribed above the portal to his new presidential library:

HEADLINE: '08 Candidates Weighing Consequences as They Take Sides on Immigration Plan

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA; Michael Cooper, Steven Greenhouse, Patrick Healy and Michael Luo contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The bipartisan immigration proposal being taken up by Congress is putting pressure on the leading presidential candidates to take a position on the issue, which could set them up for confrontations with influential constituencies within the two parties.
 After the announcement of the bipartisan plan on Thursday, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the New York Democrat, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor who is one of the Republican frontrunners, were initially noncommittal. Both suggested on Friday that they were open to supporting it, but only with major revisions to some of its main components.
Reflecting the complexity of the issue and the political caution surrounding it, neither of them matched the embrace of the legislation on Thursday by Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican. 
 Mr. McCain already faces a direct clash with another of the Republican candidates, Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who has come out against the bill as he intensifies his efforts to win the support of conservatives who are wary of Mr. McCain and Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Romney's opponents said his position had shifted from more moderate views that he voiced a few years ago.
 On Friday, the Romney campaign unveiled a television commercial about illegal immigration that it said would run starting this weekend in New Hampshire and Iowa.
 Mr. McCain's position was also assailed on Friday by conservative commentators, who object in particular to the provisions of the legislation that could ultimately grant legal status to many of the estimated 12 million immigrants who are in the United States illegally. 
 Mr. Giuliani's emphasis has been on whether the legislation would adequately protect the nation from terrorists who might enter the United States illegally. 
 In an appearance on Friday in Orlando, Fla., he supported the idea of compromise as long as it included a system for registering the people who are currently in America illegally and issuing them identification cards.
 ''I think this idea of working things out between the Democrats and the Republicans -- and each side has to make some compromises in order to get there -- then I can see a lot of flexibility there to get that accomplished,'' he said. 
 Mrs. Clinton, an aide in her Senate office said, will focus on the provision that would de-emphasize family ties in granting visas, an element of the bill that has drawn fierce objections from many groups and elected officials representing Hispanics. 
 Mrs. Clinton will try to limit the impact on Hispanic immigrants by offering an amendment to reunite lawful permanent residents with their spouses and minor children by exempting those family members from the visa cap in the bill, the aide said.
 When Mrs. Clinton was asked about the bill in New Orleans on Friday, however, she avoided stating any precise position and instead highlighted her support for both toughening border security and providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.
 Democrats face a complicated nest of competing interests, including the outcry of some labor unions about the proposed guest worker program and concerns among Hispanic voters that the legislation will severely curtail the ability of families in poorer Latin American countries to settle legally in the United States.
 Major labor unions are split on the issue, but there is widespread labor concern about the provision that would set up a temporary guest worker system with no chance of citizenship. 
 Not only could those workers take away jobs from Americans, these opponents said, but they could also become a permanent underclass.
 ''The proposal unveiled today includes a massive guest worker program that would allow employers to import hundreds of thousands'' of temporary workers every year to perform permanent jobs throughout the economy, John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, said in a statement.
 John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina whose campaign has focused on trying to rally traditional union workers with a populist message, said he was pleased to see movement on immigration reform. But, in a statement, Mr. Edwards added, ''I have some real concerns about parts of this bill, including the poorly conceived guest worker program.''
 Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, was similarly cautious.
 ''Without modifications, the proposed bill could devalue the importance of family reunification, replace the current group of undocumented immigrants with a new undocumented population consisting of guest workers who will overstay their visas, and potentially drive down wages of American workers,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement.
 Democrats and Republicans must calculate how their choices will affect them politically, not just in early states like Iowa but also in states like New York, Florida, California and Texas that have large immigrant populations.
 Muzaffar Chishti, the director of the Migration Policy Institute's office at the New York University law school, said that the pressure was going to quickly build for everyone to declare firm positions.
 ''Next week is going to be very, very critical,'' Mr. Chishti said. ''The pressure on the senators between now and Monday is going to be intense.''

HEADLINE: Would a Sing Sing Museum Be in Bad Taste?

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI. 
E-mail: westweek@nytimes.com

DATELINE: OSSINING 

 BODY:
IN the time it has taken for the proposed Sing Sing Historic Prison Museum to get off the drawing board, you could have served a sentence for a violent felony inside the prison's walls. It has been more than a decade since the idea was first floated to build a museum inside this town's most infamous institution.
 Since then, there have been multiple market studies, grant applications, meetings, news releases and a foundation established to raise money for the proposed museum. But amid plenty of political support, there has also been sharp criticism from local residents. 
Now momentum has picked up again. The village has applied for $12.5 million in federal money for the museum, which is expected to cost $14 million. On May 8, Mayor William R. Hanauer of Ossining held a community meeting, this time to present the results of the latest feasibility study, done by a group of students from the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University. 
 It came as little surprise to supporters and foes alike that the new study concluded that the museum ''will be a strong tourist attraction with real economic benefits for the Village of Ossining, the Hudson Valley and New York State.'' Supporters have dollar signs dancing in their eyes at the thought of how the sordid, secretly thrilling, Hollywood-pumped image of Sing Sing (''The Big House,'' ''Up the River,'' ''The House of Fear'') would draw visitors from all over the world. 
 ''All that data we have indicates that this will be the most popular place in the metropolitan area,'' said the county executive, Andrew J. Spano, adding that Westchester County was ''100 percent'' behind the prison museum.
 The N.Y.U. students' PowerPoint presentation emphasized the jobs that would be created through the construction and operation of the museum, along with the money that would flow into the village through tourism. They suggested that tour promoters could package different historic sites in the area together.
 The design for the project has changed surprisingly little over time. The original 1825 cellblock wall still stands, and plans call for a connecting corridor that would lead to a re-creation of the original cells. The self-guided tour would review Sing Sing's history, examining how it reflects American opinion on penology, which has tended to swing between reform movements and periods of harsh punishment. 
 Famous prisoners -- like Willie Sutton and Lucky Luciano -- will be highlighted. Books and movies featuring Sing Sing will be on display. The death house will be recreated and will house the prison's original electric chair, in which 614 people were executed. There will also be an examination of prison life at Sing Sing today.
 While there is some local concern about traffic, parking and tour buses rumbling through Ossining's steep streets, the main objection is to the concept of a prison museum itself. This would not be the first prison museum -- planners point to the huge success of the Alcatraz museum as inspiration -- but it would be one of only a handful of museums about a working prison. The Sing Sing Correctional Facility is a maximum-security institution that holds about 1,800 men. 
 Residents at the May 8 meeting complained that the money could be better spent educating inmates and providing after-school programs to help prevent youngsters from turning to crime. They also said they found the idea of a prison museum repugnant.
 ''Ossining residents should look at this as a morality issue,'' said Marie Gagliardi, 70, who has lived in Ossining for 50 years. 
 Mr. Hanauer maintains that the project is not exploitive, but educational. He said there would be no contact between visitors and inmates. Moreover, he said he believed that some prisoners would be glad to have their stories told. The state Department of Corrections also supports the museum.
 ''This will be a powerful venue for focusing serious examination of incarceration, the treatment of prisoners, their rehabilitation and punishment, the very emotional questions of racism and capital punishment, even the development of democracy as seen through the filter of penology,'' Mr. Hanauer said.
 I'll admit to being fascinated by Sing Sing. I have been inside its walls several times as a reporter, and there is a prurient thrill every time. 
 But listening to the earnest N.Y.U. students talk about tour packaging, I couldn't help imagining tourists stepping off buses to visit Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate, sporting their ''I Served My Sentence at the Sing Sing Historic Prison Museum'' T-shirts. Nor could I shake the image of visitors leaving the death house and presenting their admission tickets to local restaurants for meal discounts -- another promotional idea.
 For years, Ossining tried to shake off its image as a prison town. Now the mayor describes the prison as ''one of Ossining's greatest underutilized resources.'' The history of Sing Sing is rich indeed, but if the museum proceeds, critics need their own sense of maximum security that the project won't strain the bounds of taste and decency.

HEADLINE: A Great Idea Lives Forever. Shouldn't Its Copyright?

BYLINE: By Mark Helprin. 
Mark Helprin, a fellow at the Claremont Institute, is the author of, among other works, ''Winter's Tale.''

DATELINE: Charlottesville, Va. 

 BODY:
WHAT if, after you had paid the taxes on earnings with which you built a house, sales taxes on the materials, real estate taxes during your life, and inheritance taxes at your death, the government would eventually commandeer it entirely? This does not happen in our society to houses. Or to businesses. Were you to have ushered through the many gates of taxation a flour mill, travel agency or newspaper, they would not suffer total confiscation.
 Once the state has dipped its enormous beak into the stream of your wealth and possessions they are allowed to flow from one generation to the next. Though they may be divided and diminished by inflation, imperfect investment, a proliferation of descendants and the government taking its share, they are not simply expropriated. 
That is, unless you own a copyright. Were I tomorrow to write the great American novel (again?), 70 years after my death the rights to it, though taxed at inheritance, would be stripped from my children and grandchildren. To the claim that this provision strikes malefactors of great wealth, one might ask, first, where the heirs of Sylvia Plath berth their 200-foot yachts. And, second, why, when such a stiff penalty is not applied to the owners of Rockefeller Center or Wal-Mart, it is brought to bear against legions of harmless drudges who, other than a handful of literary plutocrats (manufacturers, really), are destined by the nature of things to be no more financially secure than a seal in the Central Park Zoo.
 The answer is that the Constitution states unambiguously that Congress shall have the power ''to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.'' (The italics are mine, the capitalization was likely James Madison's.)
 It is, then, for the public good. But it might also be for the public good were Congress to allow the enslavement of foreign captives and their descendants (this was tried); the seizure of Bill Gates's bankbook; or the ruthless suppression of Alec Baldwin. You can always make a case for the public interest if you are willing to exclude from common equity those whose rights you seek to abridge. But we don't operate that way, mostly.
 Furthermore, one should not envy the perpetrators of sensationalist trash, but rather admire them, in the hope that someday, somehow, without prostituting, debasing and degrading oneself while recklessly destroying what is left of the literary culture, one might enjoy a fraction of their wealth. They represent, however, only a small fraction of writers, and their good fortune is a poor excuse for seizing either their property or that of their leaner colleagues.
 And Barnes & Noble is able to publish price-reduced non-copyrighted works not so much because it saves the 10 percent to 15 percent of revenue that would go to the gruel-eating authors, but because it saves the 50 percent that would go to the publishers. Booksellers that publish their own titles benefit not from escaping the author's copyright, but the previous publisher's exercise of a grant of rights (limited, authors take note, to 35 years). ''Freeing'' a literary work into the public domain is less a public benefit than a transfer of wealth from the families of American writers to the executives and stockholders of various businesses who will continue to profit from, for example, ''The Garden Party,'' while the descendants of Katherine Mansfield will not. 
 Absent the government's decree, copyright holders would have no exclusivity of right at all. Does not then the government's giveth support its taketh? By that logic, should other classes of property not subject to total confiscation therefore be denied the protection of regulatory agencies, courts, police and the law itself lest they be subject to expropriation as payment for the considerable and necessary protections they too enjoy? Should automobile manufacturers be nationalized after 70 years because they depend on publicly financed roads? Should Goldman Sachs be impounded because of the existence of the Securities and Exchange Commission?
 Why would the framers, whose political genius has not been exceeded, have countenanced such an unfair exception? Jefferson objected that ideas are, ''like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density at any point, and, like the air in which we breathe, move and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation.'' 
 But ideas are immaterial to the question of copyright. Mozart and Neil Diamond may have begun with the same idea, but that a work of art is more than an idea is confirmed by the difference between the ''Soave sia il vento'' and ''Kentucky Woman.'' We have different words for art and idea because they are two different things. The flow and proportion of the elements of a work of art, its subtle engineering, even its surface glosses, combine substance and style indistinguishably in a creation for which the right of property is natural and becoming. 
 And in Jefferson's era 95 percent of the population drew its living from the land. Writers and inventors were largely those who obtained their sustenance from their patrimony or their mills; their writings or improvements to craft were secondary. No one except perhaps Hamilton or Franklin might have imagined that services and intellectual property would become primary fields of endeavor and the chief engines of the economy. Now they are, and it is no more rational to deny them equal status than it would have been to confiscate farms, ropewalks and other forms of property in the 18th century.
 Still, it is the express order of the Constitution, long imprinted without catastrophe upon the fabric of our history. But given the grace of the Constitution it is not surprising to find the remedy within it, in the very words that prohibit the holding of patents or copyrights in perpetuity: ''for limited Times.''
 The genius of the framers in making this provision is that it allows for infinite adjustment. Congress is free to extend at will the term of copyright. It last did so in 1998, and should do so again, as far as it can throw. Would it not be just and fair for those who try to extract a living from the uncertain arts of writing and composing to be freed from a form of confiscation not visited upon anyone else? The answer is obvious, and transcends even justice. No good case exists for the inequality of real and intellectual property, because no good case can exist for treating with special disfavor the work of the spirit and the mind.

HEADLINE: '03 Marlin Pitchers: Ones That Got Away

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
As the major leagues began their first round of interleague play this weekend, the pitching leaders in each league offered an interesting snapshot. Josh Beckett led the American League with a 7-0 record; Brad Penny had the most impressive record in the National League at 5-0.
 Beckett pitches for the Boston Red Sox, Penny for the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 2003, they each pitched for the Florida Marlins and helped them win the World Series for the second time in seven years, defeating the Yankees in six games.
Beckett and Penny, who incurred his first loss Friday night, are not the only members of the Marlins' 2003 staff who are working elsewhere. Dontrelle Willis, in fact, is the only pitcher from the staff still in a Marlins uniform. 
 The other most active starters that season were Carl Pavano and Mark Redman. Pavano is with the Yankees and Redman with Atlanta. Pavano, like Beckett, is on the disabled list. Since joining the Yankees as a free agent in 2005, he has spent more time on the D.L. than he has pitching. Redmond came off the disabled list yesterday and pitched in relief against the Red Sox.
 Two other members of the 2003 staff are starting for other teams. A. J. Burnett, who started four games and won none that season before having Tommy John surgery, starts for Toronto when he isn't hurt. Braden Looper, who as the Marlins' closer had 28 saves, starts for St. Louis and has the third-best record (5-3, 3.27 earned run average) among the former Marlins.
 Ugueth Urbina, who saved six games for the Marlins after they acquired him from Texas in July, has a record but not the wins-and-losses kind. He is serving a 14-year prison sentence in Venezuela after being convicted of attempted murder.
 While the Marlins retained Willis, they let the other pitchers go in trades or as free agents.
 ''The economics of baseball dictate what they dictate,'' Jeffrey Loria, the Marlins' owner, said. ''There's so much flux and movement because of the economics of the game. It's almost like nothing is guaranteed. There are a number of other teams from that year who don't have the same pitchers on their staffs.''
 The Marlins, however, were the only team that won the World Series that year.
 ''Certainly it's a credit to our scouts and our development people,'' Loria said, speaking of the pitching staff the Marlins assembled. ''We work very hard at it.''
 The Marlins have been more successful at finding and developing young pitchers and other players than they have at solving the economics of the game. Their inability to figure that out stems from their inability to get a new park built. The Florida Legislature has repeatedly rebuffed their efforts. 
 As a result, the Marlins have given up a succession of good players. 
 They traded Penny, whom they had acquired as a minor leaguer, to the Dodgers in 2004 in a six-player trade that had Paul Lo Duca going to Florida. They traded Beckett to Boston in 2005 in a seven-player swap that gave the Marlins shortstop Hanley Ramirez, who became last season's N.L. rookie of the year, and Anibal Sanchez, who pitched a no-hitter last September.
 Redman was traded to Oakland two months after the 2003 World Series and is now with his seventh team in seven seasons.
 Pavano, the winning pitcher in relief in two of the Marlins' three first-round playoff victories, left as a free agent a year later and signed a four-year, $39.5 million contract with the Yankees. He has started two games since June 2005. 
 Looper was not tendered a contract after the 2003 season and moved to the Mets. He is now in the second year of a three-year, $13.5 million contract with St. Louis. 
 Burnett, with a healthier elbow than he had in 2003, left as a free agent after the 2005 season and signed a five-year, $55 million contract with the Blue Jays. But he missed nearly half of last season with elbow problems. This season he has a 3-3 record and a 4.56 E.R.A.
 In 2003, Willis was a catalyst for the Marlins' wild-card drive. The manager, Jeff Torborg, had urged the front office to bring up Willis, but the Marlins kept him in the minors to delay his salary arbitration eligibility for a year. Torborg was fired after the May 10 game, and Willis made his first start four days later.
 Willis did not start in the World Series but relieved three times and allowed no runs in three and two-thirds innings. Penny won both of his Series starts, and Beckett, whose two-hit shutout of the Cubs in Game 5 turned the league series around, started Game 6 of the Series on short rest and sent the Yankees home with a five-hit shutout.
 ''I wish every one of those guys well,'' Loria said. ''They're all friends.''
 But don't ask him about trading Willis, whom he obtained as a minor leaguer in 2002.
 ''I'm tired of people talking about it,'' Loria said. ''I don't care what other people think. He's pitching for us and we're happy to have him. I have no interest in discussing other people's interest in our players.'' Cooling Off, Heating Up 
 Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa have much in common, including the suspicion that they used steroids in their late-in-life assault on home run records. At the moment, though, they are going in opposite directions.
 On April 29, after 21 games, Bonds was hitting .362 and had hit 8 home runs and driven in 12 runs. In his next 16 games, though, Bonds batted .220 with three home runs and six runs batted in, lowering his season average to .292 by Thursday. (Bonds was up to .303 after going 2 for 3 on Friday night.) 
 Sosa, on the other hand, batted .186 in his first 16 games while hitting 4 home runs and driving in 12 runs. In his next 21 games, he hit .329 with 5 homers and 20 R.B.I., raising his season average to .268 by Thursday. (He was hitting .259 after last night's game.) Efficient, Inefficient 
 Greg Maddux, who has 336 victories, doesn't often pitch complete games -- he had none last season -- but he went the whole nine innings Monday night against Cincinnati and in doing so he put on a dazzling demonstration of efficient performance. Maddux, a 41-year-old right-hander, dispatched the Reds with only 96 pitches.
 That same night, Nate Robertson of Detroit threw 115 pitches in five innings, Dan Haren of Oakland 117 in eight innings, Dontrelle Willis of Florida 95 in six, Tomo Ohka of Toronto 91 in five, Matt Belisle of Cincinnati 81 in five, Brett Tomko of Los Angeles 56 in two and a third and Kevin Millwood of Texas 45 in one and two-thirds. Rookies Make Themselves Known 
 Hunter Pence of Houston and Fred Lewis of San Francisco have not come into the National League unnoticed. Rookie center fielders, they called attention to themselves last week in a prominent way.
 Pence, a 24-year-old right-handed batter, had played a couple of weeks when he erupted for seven hits in seven times at bat over two games. In a five-game span, Pence collected 12 hits, with 3 home runs in 18 at-bats and drove in 7 runs, leaving him with a .348 season average.
 Lewis, a 26-year-old left-handed hitter, played in 13 games for the Giants last September and had five hits. Against Colorado last Sunday, he rapped five hits, adding a second single to his cycle. 
 He led off the game with a double, struck out in the second inning, slugged a three-run homer in the fourth, lashed a run-scoring triple in the fifth and stroked two singles in the seventh, the first and last hits of a six-run, eight-hit inning. He was batting .375 through Friday night. Pitcher Gives Himself an Edge 
 Greg Maddux began his career with the Chicago Cubs, returned to them as a free agent 18 years later and now has left a legacy that has been one of the Cubs' few bright spots this season. Jason Marquis, who has been one of the National League's best pitchers, joined the Cubs primarily because of a tip from Maddux.
 ''He said he had talked to Maddux and Maddux recommended that he call me,'' Larry Rothschild, the Cubs' pitching coach, said. 
 Rothschild said Marquis called him a week or two after the World Series, which was a low point in Marquis's career. He had been a member of the St. Louis Cardinals' starting rotation, but his ineffective pitching late in the season prompted the Cardinals to drop him from the postseason roster. 
 ''He asked me to watch him throw,'' Rothschild said. ''He came down to Tampa and threw for 45 minutes to an hour. I watched him and made some recommendations to him.''
 At the time, Rothschild said, the Cubs hadn't expressed interest in Marquis, a 28-year-old free agent. ''We hadn't even met about what we were going to do in the off-season,'' he said. When they did discuss their pitching needs, though, because Rothschild had seen Marquis throw, the Cubs were ahead of the game.
 ''I saw that his arm was fine, that he was healthy,'' Rothschild said. ''That's important when you see a guy have a half-year like he did. You want to make sure he's healthy. I could tell the way he threw he was healthy because of the amount he threw and the velocity and intensity he had. If he hadn't come down, there would have been more questions about that.''
 Rothschild also sensed Marquis was ready for a strong comeback. ''You could tell from talking to him he had something he wanted to prove,'' he said, ''and was going to go about it in the right way and do whatever he had to to prove he's a good major league pitcher. I think the circumstances worked out and hopefully he can keep this up.''
 Marquis entered his scheduled start yesterday (a no-decision against the White Sox) with a 5-1 record and a 2.22 earned run average, the league's fifth lowest. Opponents were batting .183 against him, second lowest in the league.

HEADLINE: A Wildcatter Pounces

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
JOSEPH H. BRYANT, still boyish-looking at 51, jostles with glee among tens of thousands of people here at the Offshore Technology Conference, one of the energy industry's biggest trade fairs. He is surrounded by newfangled technologies occupying more than half a million square feet of display space: drills stuffed with electronic sensors, underwater wells shaped like Christmas trees, mini-submarines and pipes, pumps, tubes, gauges, valves and gadgets galore. 
 ''There is every little gizmo you need to make this business work,'' Mr. Bryant says, joyously. He stops at a plastic model of an offshore oil rig, an exact replica of a huge platform he commissioned while running BP's business in Angola a few years ago. ''I love this stuff.''
Like the pieces of a giant puzzle, the parts showcased here could fit together and build an oil company -- and that's exactly what Mr. Bryant set out to do two years ago after a 30-year career directing energy projects for the likes of Amoco, Unocal and BP. With a team composed largely of retired energy executives, he wants to hunt for oil in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico or offshore West Africa, challenging Big Oil in its own backyard. 
 The American oil patch, once left to languish during an extended period of low oil prices, is on the rebound. Wildcatters like Mr. Bryant are ready to pounce. With oil prices now hovering around $60 a barrel -- three times higher than they were throughout the 1990s -- the industry is expanding at a pace last seen decades ago.
 ''The oil industry has changed dramatically in the last 20 years,'' Mr. Bryant says. ''Barriers to entry have dropped significantly. It doesn't matter if you've been in the business 100 years or 100 days.''
 Easily available capital and technology, once the preserve of traditional oil companies, are reordering the business. Investors are lining up to finance energy projects while leaps in computing power, imaging technology and collaborative online networks now allow the smallest entities to compete on an equal footing with the biggest players.
 ''There's a lot of money out there looking for opportunities,'' said John Schaeffer, the head of the oil and gas unit at GE Energy Financial Services. ''It seems like everyone wants to own an oil well now.'' 
 Still, oil exploration remains a costly business fraught with peril. While the odds have improved, success is elusive; three-quarters of all exploration wells come up dry, either because there is no oil or because geologists miss its exact location. All of which means that Mr. Bryant's start-up, Cobalt International Energy, which plans to begin drilling next year, faces formidable hurdles.
 ''There's no sugar-coating this -- at the end of the day, it's a high risk venture,'' Mr. Bryant says. ''Financially, we're definitely wildcatting. It's either all or nothing.''
 OTHER challenges face Mr. Bryant as well. Despite the excitement and money flowing around the energy business these days, not every site is open to small wildcatters. Deepwater exploration, for example, remains far beyond their reach. 
 The logistics of deep-water drilling are daunting. On Sept. 5, 2006, Chevron tested a well in 7,000 feet of water in an underwater valley called Walker Ridge, about 175 miles off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. With a total drilled depth exceeding five miles, it was the deepest well ever tested in the gulf and marked a new milestone in offshore exploration. It cost about $100 million.
 Yet even with big oil finds in the deepwater recently, most major oil companies have been retreating from exploration, choosing instead to focus on developing large projects and exploiting existing discoveries. 
 In the mid-1990s, oil companies spent about 30 percent of their capital investments on exploration; last year, that share was closer to 18 percent, according to Arthur L. Smith, chairman of John S. Herold Inc., a consulting firm. And over the last two years, the cost of hiring deepwater drill ships has doubled because of their limited availability. The cost now runs about $500,000 a day -- or $21,000 an hour. On average, drilling a well can cost $1 million a day and take months to complete.
 Instead of looking for new petroleum sources, the big oil companies now spend more money on strategic and financial maneuvers like acquisitions and share buybacks, according to analysts. Many have also bolstered dividend payments in order to please their shareholders. A decade ago, oil companies spent $2 on exploration for every $1 spent on acquisitions; today, it's the other way around. Exploration, which once took a place of pride among major oil companies, now takes a back seat. 
 But analysts warn that the industry should be expanding exploration, because much more energy will be needed in coming years. According to the International Energy Agency, the world will be consuming 115 million barrels of oil a day by 2030, up from 85 million today.
 ''It's hard to explain why exploration isn't getting more attention,'' Mr. Smith said. Oil companies, he said, ''have become more risk-averse.''
 For whatever reasons Big Oil is forgoing exploration, that reluctance has opened a door to entrepreneurs like Mr. Bryant. Cobalt, taking advantage of the lush financing available to energy start-ups, has secured $600 million from investors like Goldman Sachs and Carlyle/Riverstone, a private equity firm. It is about to secure an additional $600 million to $900 million from its investors. 
 Cobalt, based here, has 35 employees, owns few assets, uses off-the-shelf technology and outsources most of its functions, including its human resources department. What's left is the inner core of an oil company: a small team of experienced geologists looking around the world for hydrocarbon sources. 
 And lean and mean, Mr. Bryant says, is the right business model. ''It's clear to me the industry has not taken the efficient form of a virtual oil company,'' he says. ''This is a niche whose time has come.''
 Unlike traditional wildcatters, Cobalt is hedging its risks by focusing on regions with proven track records, like the Gulf of Mexico, Angola and Gabon. ''What successful explorers do is try to explore where there is known oil, where there is the highest probability of being successful,'' says Robert Heinemann, the chief executive of Berry Petroleum, a small oil company based in Bakersfield, Calif. (Mr. Bryant is a member of Berry's board.)
 ''One of the unique things about Joe is that he knows his way around the drill bit and he knows his way around the balance sheet,'' Mr. Heinemann says, ''and that's the magic combination you need.''
 MR. BRYANT was born in Kansas City, Kan., in 1955. His father was an engineer who helped build the federal highway system. After graduating with an engineering degree from the University of Nebraska in 1977, Mr. Bryant wanted a job that allowed him to be outdoors. Shunning offers from the likes of Ford and Procter & Gamble, he says, he went to work for Amoco in Wyoming. 
 ''All I wanted to do was live in the mountains,'' he recalls. 
 A 22-year-old with a bachelor's degree, he had no knowledge of the petroleum industry. Amoco gave him basic training in petroleum engineering and geology in Tulsa, Okla. After that, he worked for the company in various positions and by 1988 was running Amoco's exploration and production unit for the Gulf of Mexico.
 It was a much different industry then. The oil business was entering a period of transformation, with oil-producing countries nationalizing their industries. 
 Mr. Bryant says Big Oil lost its focus in the 1980s, when, faced with a loss of access, low prices and pressure from Wall Street, it cut costs, sharply reducing the size of its work force, and shrank most of the in-house research teams.
 The period traumatized an entire generation of engineers and left a long-lasting wound in the industry, leading to a brain drain of experienced engineers and geologists that can still be felt today. From a high of 800,000 employees in the early 1980s, the work force in the American oil industry had withered to 285,000 by 2005 -- leaving the companies leaner and more willing to rely on technological innovation, but also grayer.
 Most oil executives now say that the biggest problem facing their industry is finding enough young people to replace employees who retire. From 1985 to 2005, the average age of petroleum geologists rose to 55 from 35, according to industry groups. 
 Against this backdrop, Big Oil became even bigger. During the 1990s, oil companies stopped looking for riches through exploration and turned instead to Wall Street to expand. What resulted was a wave of megamergers -- Exxon bought Mobil, Chevron bought Texaco, BP bought Amoco. While greater size might have allowed the new behemoths to take greater exploratory risks, the opposite occurred: exploration fell off. 
 In the summer of 2005, Mr. Bryant was at his ranch in Whitefish, Mont., a small, scenic mountain town, pondering his next career move. He had left BP the previous year to become president of Unocal, a struggling independent producer described in industry circles as ''the best-looking girl that never got a date.'' But within a year, Unocal was acquired by Chevron for $18 billion after a fierce takeover battle with a Chinese company.
 Newly unemployed after the takeover, Mr. Bryant retreated to Whitefish and put together a plans for a new oil company, which he gave the code name ''Montana.'' Several former Unocal managers joined him, including Samuel H. Gillespie, a former general counsel at Unocal and Mobil, and James H. Painter, the ex-head of exploration. James W. Farnsworth, in charge of global exploration at BP, also took early retirement and joined the group.
 They decided to name their company Cobalt, in homage to the midnight blue hue of the ocean's deep waters, where they plan to focus their operations.
 ''It was serendipity,'' Mr. Gillespie says. ''A lot of things were coming together: high oil prices, consolidation in the industry, technology was becoming available. Five years ago, Cobalt could not have happened.''
 It was the strength of Cobalt's management team, and its ability to lure top geologists, that persuaded investors to back Cobalt's project -- to put together a crack team of experts who focus exclusively on looking for oil, while every other function of the company is subcontracted. Even once it finds oil, Cobalt will consider bringing in other companies to help shoulder its drilling and development costs.
 Finding, developing and operating costs in the Gulf of Mexico run below $20 a barrel. With oil prices at $65 a barrel, if the company finds a field that flows at 50,000 barrels a day, it can potentially earn more than $2 million a day -- or $800 million a year -- from a single field. ''The whole game is to put a string of those together,'' Mr. Bryant says. 
 After securing financing, Cobalt spent about $35 million on 30 offshore blocks in the Gulf of Mexico; it expects to drill its first well next year. That is a breakneck pace for what can generally be a slow-moving industry.
 Cobalt's offices are on the 12th floor of a modern office tower in a fashionable part of Houston, close to the Galleria shopping mall. There are few indications of the type of work done here, other than a few geological maps pinned on walls. There are no replicas of tankers or offshore platforms in the lobby; no photographs of drill ships. 
 Cobalt says it has spent ''tens of millions'' of dollars acquiring and analyzing seismic data, the heart of any exploration business. Specialized companies sell the data, which they collect by surveying the world's oceans, sending sound waves into the bottom of the sea and then recording the reflection they make. 
 Geologists spend months, sometime years, with that raw material, trying to read the results. They refine the information by running unpolished data through complex mathematical algorithms that require huge computing power to try drawing a clearer picture of subsoil -- which they hope will lead them to oil deposits. 
 Cobalt now has about 25 geologists and geophysicists who spend their days staring at their dual-screen workstations or locking themselves in conference rooms to stare at large projections of seismic data on the wall. A lot of information is analyzed here, with nary a well ever drilled.
 Subcontractors oversee the number-crunching, using computer servers located in a hardened bunker north of town, which was built to resist chemical and nuclear attacks. The atmosphere is collegial and relaxed, and everyone on Cobalt's team, owners and geologists alike, stands to benefit handsomely from any discovery the company makes. 
 AT the heart of the project lies a simple realization, said Mr. Farnsworth, the company's president: When it comes to pure exploration, only a handful of people find most of the oil. At BP, where he spent 23 years, only about 25 people were responsible for finding one billion barrels of oil each year. 
 ''There's a great deal of science in exploration,'' Mr. Farnsworth said. ''But it's also an art. It's interpretation.''
 Cobalt is looking for oil reserves ranging from 100 million to 300 million barrels. While a big discovery can instantly earn the company billions, there is no guarantee that the company will find oil at all. ''How are you successful in oil and gas exploration? It doesn't need a whole committee,'' said Mike Lentini, a 49-year-old geologist who spent 25 years looking for oil at Shell and recently moved to Cobalt. ''If you go the consensus path, you get the average result rather than what is truly path-breaking.''
 On a recent afternoon here, Mr. Byrant, who had just returned from a visit to the Middle East, said Cobalt would never be able to compete with Big Oil everywhere. But he said independent companies now had more than a fighting chance. 
 ''Exploration has become a game of super technology,'' he says. ''That's a lot different from the early days of the industry when wildcatters would just drill a well, cross their fingers and hope for the best.''
 He adds: ''What I would like is for people to look back in 10 years and say, 'Yeah, these guys got it right.' ''

HEADLINE: The Bull Market That's Missing Something

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SO far, this bull market has benefited from several tailwinds, including the resilient economy, reasonably low interest rates, better-than-expected corporate profits and, most recently, a flurry of merger-and-acquisition activity. But one missing ingredient has been the willingness of investors to pay higher prices for earnings.
 ''So far, it's been an untapped driver of returns,'' said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services in Boston.
In every bull market since 1942, investors gradually gave higher price-to-earnings ratios to stocks as those rallies unfolded. Indeed, the average P/E ratio for the S.& P. 500 has typically grown from 13.5 at the start of new bull markets to 17.3 by their fourth birthdays. 
 But the same can't be said for this rally -- at least not yet. 
 The current bull, which was born on Oct. 10, 2002, started with a P/E ratio of 27.1, according to S.& P. Four years later, the ratio was actually much lower, at 16.3. (All of these figures are based on trailing 12-month earnings, using generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.)
 Why are investors stingier with their investment dollars this time around?
 Part of the explanation may simply be the hangover from the bear market of 2000 to 2002, said Tobias M. Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup Investment Research. He argues that investors may be hesitant to push P/E ratios higher after getting burned so badly for doing so at the start of the decade.
 The lack of a P/E expansion could also be tied to the surprising strength in corporate earnings growth. At the start of April, the consensus forecast for first-quarter S.& P. 500 earnings growth was a modest 3.7 percent. But now, it looks as if first-quarter profits will jump 8.1 percent when all is said and done, according to Thomson Financial. 
 And when the ''E'' -- the earnings -- in the P/E ratio grows at a faster-than-expected rate, it's not so surprising when the ''P'' doesn't keep pace.
 Of course, ''as earnings slow from here, the markets will need an extra boost,'' Mr. Kleintop said. And there are some early indications that investors may be willing to pay slightly higher prices for stocks in coming months. 
 Sam Stovall, S.& P.'s chief market strategist, noted that at the end of March, the P/E ratio of the S.& P. 500 was 16.8 (again, based on trailing 12-month GAAP earnings). The multiple grew to more than 17 by mid-May. And if the S.& P. 500 breaks its all-time high of 1,527.46 within the next few days, the market's P/E will rise to around 18.
 Yet this is only a short-term move. And few are expecting the type of P/E expansion that the market enjoyed in the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s.
 From 1984 to 1986, for example, the P/E of the S.& P. grew to about 14 from around 8. The move was even bigger from 1996 to 1998. Investors started that period paying 14 times trailing 12-month earnings. But by the end of it, the multiple had grown to 24.
 Market strategists note, however, that those periods were marked by significant declines in long-term interest rates and inflation -- both of which have an inverse relationship with market P/E ratios.
 Given that 10-year Treasury notes are already yielding less than 5 percent -- and given that core consumer inflation is running about 2.3 percent, according to the Labor Department -- it's hard to imagine a huge kicker from similar trends this time around.
 As a result, Jim Dunnigan, chief investment officer at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia, argues that while P/E ratios are likely to expand, ''it should be more muted than it was in the past.'' 
 Mr. Kleintop agrees. Instead of a 6- to 10-point surge in P/E ratios, he says, we're more likely to see a bump-up of about 3 or 4 points. Still, based on trailing 12-month earnings of nearly $90 a share for the S.& P. 500, a climb to a P/E of 19 -- about 3 points above the level of last October -- would bring the index to a record level of about 1,700. 
 That, of course, is based on a lot of ifs. Whether market P/E's will climb this high in this bull market will depend on several factors, including these: THE INFLATION OUTLOOK -- Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, says that there is ''a perfect inverse correlation of inflation and P/E ratios.'' Since 1960, whenever the annual inflation rate (as measured by core personal consumption expenditures) has been 2 to 3 percent -- as it is today -- the average P/E for the S.& P. has been 19.7. But when inflation edges just above 3 percent, that average P/E has dropped to 17.6, close to the current number. THE BUYOUT BINGE -- Though P/E expansion isn't likely to be aided by big drops in bond yields, the recent flurry of mergers and acquisitions could spur the market to bid stock prices higher -- at least to better reflect recent earnings growth, Mr. Dunnigan said. According to Thomson Financial, global merger-and-acquisition activity is on pace to shatter last year's record of $3.6 trillion of deals. If that holds true, there could be an uptick in P/E multiples. THE PATH OF TECH AND HEALTH CARE STOCKS -- Historically, these stocks have had high P/E's, but both of these sectors have generally been out of favor since the start of the decade. That is one reason the P/E ratio of the S.& P. hasn't greatly expanded, Mr. Kleintop says. But now that tech and health care companies are again among the market's earnings leaders, the ratio could be driven higher.
 Of course, the multiple could surge for another reason: if earnings fall off a cliff, as they did at the start of this decade. That would be about the worst type of P/E expansion imaginable, but, fortunately, few are predicting it. In fact, though earnings are slowing, the consensus is that earnings for the S.& P. will still grow 7.1 percent this year. 

GRAPHIC: Chart: ''The Price of Earnings'' Historically, the stock market's price-to-earnings ratio has had an inverse relationship with inflation. Figures are based on data from January 1960 to March 2007.

HEADLINE: Living Larger, and Drawing Fire

BYLINE: By DAN ZEGART

 BODY:
LIKE the many Eskimo words for snow, a multitude of nicknames exist for the oversize houses commonly referred to as McMansions, and they mirror the uneasiness over the spread of the homes.
 ''You hear them called starter castles, beltway baronials, mini Taj Mahals, but my favorite is parachute homes, because of the disregard for local styles -- like they were dropped from the sky,'' said Edward J. Trawinski, a lawyer and land-use expert from Morristown, N.J.
 Although the names may be amusing, many owners of smaller homes, especially in older communities dominated by more traditional architecture, find it anything but funny when one goes up in their neighborhood. With the proliferation of mammoth residences throughout the suburbs of New York City and beyond, some towns are trying to restrict the size and, sometimes, the look of new homes. 
 Mr. Trawinski has helped municipalities in northern New Jersey, including Wayne, Montclair and Bergenfield, write such laws, which commonly set maximums for height and square footage on a sliding scale that varies with the lot size. The laws may also dictate the slope of roofs and require side yards to be large enough so the new home does not loom over its neighbors.
 Such laws draw sharp dividing lines between some residents and builders. The debate is particularly fierce in towns like Westport, Conn., where builders say smallish lots and high land values make tearing down existing homes and replacing them, often with much larger houses, necessary to provide a reasonable profit. 
 ''I live with these regulations all the time, and they're so complicated and so hard to understand,'' said Rick Benson, a Westport resident and builder. ''And now they're not only getting more complicated, they're actually regulating taste.'' He estimated that he had six houses in various stages of completion; two of them were teardowns. All will be much bigger than those they replaced. 
 Mr. Benson said builders respond to market demands and contended that Westport's standards for size were arbitrary. ''I just did a 13,000-square-foot house on six to nine acres smack in the middle of town,'' he said. ''It's massive. It looks like a hotel in the Adirondacks. Not a peep about that one.''
 But the issue of large new houses is so contentious, said Gordon Joseloff, Westport's first selectman, that two previous efforts to pass a home-size ordinance in Westport were voted down. ''The attitude of a lot of people here is, 'You're messing with my nest egg,' '' he said.
 The Town of New Castle, N.Y., is grappling with a similar problem as it pushes ahead with a new law based on floor-area ratio that adjusts the allowable size of a house depending on the lot size. It is an approach sanctioned by courts in several states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and is based on what Mr. Trawinski called a recognition ''that it's not size per se but the perception of size.''
 ''A big house on a little postage stamp of land just looks terrible,'' he said.
 But the main goal of such ordinances is not to mandate smaller homes, but to preserve a community's ''streetscape'' by preventing houses that are so much larger than the prevailing architecture as to be jarring, said Virginia Kurshan, chairwoman of the Maplewood, N.J., Historic Preservation Commission. 
 At one extreme, she said, nearby Glen Ridge declared the entire borough a historic district, putting tight restrictions on any building allowed. Maplewood, she said, is considering a less drastic law that might apply to new construction and additions.
 Like Maplewood, New Castle has little undeveloped land left, said Frank Annunziata, the town engineer. ''Like a lot of towns that are almost completely built out, we're worried about older, maybe historic houses being knocked down and replaced with something that's inappropriate and much bigger,'' he said. Proposed zoning changes would permit a house of up to 10,391 square feet on four acres; quarter-acre lots would be capped at 4,100 square feet.
 Aesthetics are less of a factor in Sagaponack, near East Hampton, on Long Island, with its expanses of open acreage. Nevertheless, critics have little trouble finding examples for their cause in this newly created village, which is writing its first zoning ordinance. 
 There is the 66,000-square-foot mansion on 63 beachfront acres, for example, or the structure called ''the Great Wall of Sagaponack,'' a sprawling residence protected by a wall more than 100 feet long and 20 feet high. 
 ''We have generally large lots, most at least three acres, but there's still concern over really large houses,'' Mayor Bill Tillotson of Sagaponack said. ''They still stick out.'' 
 Builders argue that large-scale homes are an inevitable result of skyrocketing land values and changes in home-buying habits.
 ''You never used to have 9-, 10-foot ceilings with cathedral space,'' said Stuart R. Koenig, a lawyer and land-use consultant to the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, who estimates that half of New Jersey's towns have tried to regulate housing size. ''And once you do that, if you want to still have living area, you need a bigger building.''
 Mr. Benson, the Westport builder, also said that modern tastes dictate larger houses. ''Older houses have low ceilings and out-of-date kitchens,'' he said. ''People don't want to live in houses built in the '40s, '50s and '60s. So they tear them down.''
 Mr. Benson said he finds ordinances restricting large houses infuriating because they take aim at a problem that is disappearing on its own. ''We've had three years of an economic slowdown, and market conditions and energy costs are causing builders to build smaller houses,'' he said.
 As an example, he cited two houses he built on adjoining lots in Westport: one a 6,500-square-foot home on one and a half acres, which was purchased well before completion, the second a 9,600-square-foot residence on two acres, which took two years to sell. 
 ''I had to keep dropping the price,'' he said. ''It was just too big.''

HEADLINE: The President's Tax Cuts And the Growing Economy

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Pop Quiz: Did the Tax Cuts Bolster Growth?'' (Economic View, May 13), in which economists were asked to choose reasons for the expansion of the United States economy since mid-2003: 
 A better question might be whether tax cuts limited growth, rather than bolstering it. The cuts' bias toward wealthier taxpayers placed more money in the pockets of people whose less frequent transactions reduced money's velocity, the speed with which it moves from one economy-spurring transaction to the next.
So the cuts, independent of other influences like monetary policy, productivity growth, deficit spending and cyclical phenomena, could only dampen growth, not contribute to it.
 One need look no further than ''Assorted Mysteries of Economic Life'' (Everybody's Business, May 13) for the factor that counteracted tax cuts' damage: other countries' purchases of our Treasury bonds. The purchases fueled growth by helping the Federal Reserve keep interest rates low without igniting inflation. Stan Kurzban Chappaqua, N.Y., May 13 To the Editor:
 What about deficit spending as a reason for recent economic growth? Such spending can and does stimulate the economy, just as Americans learn in first-year economics class. But Americans should also have learned that deficit spending should not go on forever, lest the national debt balloon and interest on that debt start to consume an ever-increasing portion of government expenditures.
 Our children and grandchildren will be paying for these mistakes for years and years. Shaun Breidbart Pelham, N.Y., May 14

HEADLINE: At the Mall, Mariachi Instead of Muzak

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE

 BODY:
ON a sunny day in early May, more than 12,000 people descended on the Plaza Fiesta Mall in Atlanta for a Cinco de Mayo festival celebrating Mexican heritage. Fourteen bands played mariachi; reggaeton, a sort of Latino rap; and banda, which is traditional Mexican brass music. There were carnival rides, and tortillas sizzled on grills. 
 The celebration was one of the ways that Plaza Fiesta caters to Atlanta's fast-growing Mexican population. The shopping center is anchored by a Burlington Coat Factory store and a Marshall's, but it also features Hispanic retailers like the Discolandia music store, as well as a sprawling mercado, or market, where 287 vendors in booths sell everything from quinceanera dresses to Western wear to religious statues.
With its open-air center, reminiscent of a Mexican zocalo, or town square, the mall has become a focal point of immigrant life in the region -- not only among the 500,000 Hispanics who live within 10 miles of the center, but others from the Southeast 
 ''It's like you've been transported to Mexico,'' said Julio Penaranda, the general manager of Plaza Fiesta. ''Pretty much anything you can find in Mexico you can find here.'' 
 Centers like Plaza Fiesta are cropping up across the country as developers and retailers begin to grasp the large opportunities presented by the Latino market.
 According to a census report released last week, Hispanics are the country's largest and fastest-growing minority group, at 44.3 million, or nearly 15 percent of the total population.
 And their purchasing power has surged. Last year, Hispanics pulled even with African-Americans in total purchasing power, or disposable income, and this year are expected to surpass them, according to the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia. From 1990 to 2006, Hispanics' disposable income rose by 832 percent, to $798 billion, compared with 154 percent for the rest of the population. The Hispanic total is projected to grow to almost $1.2 trillion in 2011, according to the center. 
 In addition, the Hispanic population is young, with 34 percent under the age of 18 in 2004, the latest year for which figures were available from the center, compared with 25 percent for the total population. That means more Hispanics will soon be entering the work force, said Jeffrey M. Humphreys, the director of the Selig Center.
 A 2004 survey by the International Council of Shopping Centers of 23,600 shoppers at 52 malls found that Hispanics spent more time at the mall and more money per visit than the general population -- 91.5 minutes, on average, compared with 80.6 minutes, and $96.70 a visit, versus an aggregate of $86.30.
 ''To survive in retailing, you have to market to Hispanics and Asians,'' Dr. Humphreys said. ''Hispanics are now the nation's largest target market.'' 
 New Latin-themed shopping centers are being built around the country, and old shopping centers of any kind are being repositioned. The centers typically have a mix of national and Hispanic-focused retailers, and plenty of outdoor space and seating. Often the centers are situated in dense urban areas, where parks are scarce, so the mall stands in for the town square.
 ''Twenty years ago, no one cared whatsoever about the Latino market,'' said Arturo Sneider, a native of Mexico and a partner at Primestor Development, a Hispanic-focused developer based in Los Angeles. Projects in heavily Hispanic areas were hard to fund, he said, but that has changed. 
 In Walnut Park, an area in Los Angeles County where Hispanics make up more than 90 percent of the population, Primestor is developing La Alameda, a $70 million, 225,000-square-foot shopping center and plaza that is scheduled to open next February. Located on the site of a vacant factory, the project was funded by $15 million in economic development assistance from federal and municipal agencies, as well as by private capital. It has attracted tenants like Starbucks and Bank of America. 
 Mr. Sneider's company also recently completed the $12 million Los Jardines, an 80,000-square-foot center in Bell Gardens, also in Los Angeles County. It is anchored by Famsa, the Mexican electronics and home furnishings giant, and includes tenants like AT&T, Cold Stone Creamery and Taco Bell. 
 In Texas, Grupo Zocalo, a partnership between local real estate investors and the Legaspi Company, a developer based in Los Angeles that specializes in Hispanic markets, has converted the Fort Worth Town Center into a Latino-themed mall called La Gran Plaza de Fort Worth. Built in the 1960s, the Fort Worth Town Center once drew plenty of shoppers to its stores, which included Sears, Dillard's and J. C. Penney. But it lost business over the years to newer malls and, one by one, the anchor stores left. At the same time, an increasing number of Hispanics moved into the area. 
 La Gran Plaza, which opened two years ago, will capitalize on that population shift with new tenants like Fiesta Supermarket and Cinema Latino, and a rodeo arena that will hold 5,000 people will be added in the next two years. There is also a family lounge with a large-screen TV.
 '' 'Mi casa es tu casa' is a cliche, but we really take that to heart,'' said Jose de Jesus Legaspi, the president of the Legaspi Company, referring to the Spanish phrase for ''my house is your house.'' 
 Retailers are also following Hispanics into the Midwest and Southeast. Mr. Sneider's firm, Primestor, has two major retail development projects in Chicago, and is looking at the Southeast and other markets. 
 In Charlotte, N.C., the Crossroads Mall is being converted into a Hispanic shopping center by Capital City Development. Rhee Brothers, a company based in Columbia, Md., with 20 specialty supermarkets nationwide, is turning a former Wal-Mart in Duluth, Ga., into a giant Latino and Asian grocery store set to open by year-end. 
 Serving the Hispanic market requires more than bilingual signs and staff, and many of the needs may be subtle, real estate professionals say. For example, some Hispanic shoppers tend to bring the whole family along on an outing to the mall, so accommodations like extra seating and larger restrooms with changing areas are important. There are also significant cultural differences among Hispanic groups, depending on the region they are from. Many retailers still face a steep learning curve, especially those that cling to a one-size-fits-all format. 
 But successful retail developments are beginning to make a convincing case. At Plaza Fiesta in Atlanta, there is a six-month wait for spots in the mercado, and management is considering expanding the space to accommodate more vendors.
 INSTITUTIONAL investors are becoming interested in this sector as well. The California State Teachers' Retirement System is a partner in Hispania Real Estate Investors, a development group that includes Legaspi and operates Plaza Fiesta. 
 Mr. Sneider of Primestor, meanwhile, says that he is fielding four to five phone calls a month from retailers, city officials and urban planners trying to understand the Hispanic market. ''People understand now that this is a very significant market they need to get educated on,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Plane With More Leg Room, and It's All Yours

BYLINE: By DIANA MARSZALEK

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
NO longer the purview of the ultra-elite, private jets have surged in popularity at the Westchester County Airport, turning it into one of the country's busiest hubs for private flights.
 Private jet traffic has increased so rapidly that it now accounts for about half of all activity at the airport, up from 25 percent five years ago, said Lawrence C. Sally, the county transportation commissioner. Commercial and light aircraft, like the two- and four-seat planes hobbyists fly, account for about 50 percent of the approximately 191,000 departures and arrivals at the airport expected this year, he said.
That makes Westchester one of the three busiest private general aviation airports in the country, Mr. Sally said. (Teterboro in northern New Jersey and Van Nuys in suburban Los Angeles are the other two, he said.) 
 That activity is good news for the airport, which all told generates more than $700 million a year in revenue in the county, Mr. Sally said. 
 ''The growth has really been meteoric,'' said Michael W. Dolphin, the president and chief executive of Avitat Westchester, one of several fixed-based operators that lease hangar and tarmac space at the airport and provide maintenance and other services to private aircraft owners.
 ''It's been beyond anyone's expectations,'' he said.
 Security concerns after 9/11 and growing interest from big business have fueled the increase in private flying, which includes chartered flights and privately owned jets. Fractionally owned planes, which work like a time share, are particularly popular, Mr. Sally said. 
 Private flying costs from several thousand dollars to charter a flight to $10 million to $40 million to buy a jet. While some may envy what others consider excessive, there is an undoubtable appeal in going from car to airborne in 10 minutes flat. 
 Geoffrey Kalish, 43, an investment manager from Larchmont, recently chartered a flight to take him to meetings in Montana, Oregon and California in a single day. That would be impossible on commercial airliners, he said.
 And then there's the time-honored idea that time is money -- and both are too precious to waste in long airport lines, he said.
 ''Flying privately is never economically feasible if you compare it to commercial flights, but you have to value different components,'' Mr. Kalish said. ''You save so many hours, and if you value your time appropriately, that adds up.''
 The bulk of today's private flyers are like Mr. Kalish, men and women with high-stakes jobs who need to get places fast, said Mr. Dolphin, 61, who has worked in private aviation for 40 years and opened Avitat in 1993.
 And while private flying is out of the realm of possibility for most travelers, circumstances often require it, Mr. Dolphin said, particularly when business requires commuting to hard-to-reach destinations. Only 200 of the 5,000 airports open to private planes are also served by commercial airlines, he said. 
 ''I am not only seeing the elite,'' Mr. Dolphin said. ''A lot of day-to-day managers and sales teams are going on these airplanes as well.''
 In turn, several area businesses, including Morgan Stanley, McGraw Hill and Paul Newman, have planes in Avitat's hangar, which reopened in December after a $9 million expansion. Companies that do not own planes, Mr. Dolphin said, are chartering them more readily than they used to, especially since the fractional-ownership jet business emerged. 
 ''Fifty years ago, when this industry started, having an airplane was almost viewed as an embarrassment by companies,'' Mr. Dolphin said. ''Now I don't think they could attract the top talent without them.''
 Of course, there will always be a side to private aviation that is seen as either elitist or eccentric, depending on perspective.
 One Westchester Airport regular, for example, travels alone from Geneva, the only person aboard a private Boeing 737, Mr. Dolphin said. With the price of that plane ringing in about $50 million, and the cost of flying it about $3,000 an hour, there is no way to compare costs even with the priciest commercial ticket, Mr. Dolphin said.
 And then there are the flights engineered by individuals like George A. Stone, 67, a former corporate pilot who now works as the director of management sales for Executive Flightways, a boutiquelike charter company housed at Avitat.
 Mr. Stone recently orchestrated a round-trip flight from Westchester to North Carolina for a client picking up a new dog. That three-hour trip on a Learjet -- complete with dog training manuals and bones for the pooch -- cost about $10,000, Mr. Stone said. 
 Still, even the most stoic traveler would be hard pressed to argue with the basic premise that flying is simply better when you can eliminate the hassles of mainstream travel, regardless of cost.
 ''It's just difficult to get through an airport if you have to get somewhere quickly,'' Mr. Kalish said. ''Having to battle long lines, and waiting and waiting, is really hard.''

HEADLINE: Reaping Results: Data-Mining Goes Mainstream

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
RODNEY MONROE, the police chief in Richmond, Va., describes himself as a lifelong cop whose expertise is in fighting street crime, not in software. His own Web browsing, he says, mostly involves checking golf scores.
 But shortly after he became chief in 2005, a crime analyst who had retired from the force convinced him to try some clever software. The programs cull through information that the department already collects, like ''911'' and police reports, but add new streams of data -- about neighborhood demographics and payday schedules, for example, or about weather, traffic patterns and sports events -- to try to predict where crimes might occur.
''It sounded nutty at first,'' Mr. Monroe recalled, ''but the more and more you get into it, the more sense it makes.''
 The technology, for example, pointed to a high rate of robberies on paydays in Hispanic neighborhoods, where fewer people use banks and where customers leaving check-cashing stores were easy targets for robbers. Elsewhere, there were clusters of random-gunfire incidents at certain times of night. So extra police were deployed in those areas when crimes were predicted. 
 The crime rate in Richmond declined about 20 percent last year, and it is down again this year.
 The Richmond experience is part of a wave of sophisticated computing and mathematical analytics that is moving into the mainstream. Fueling the trend are the digitization of information, ever faster and cheaper computing, and the explosion of online networks and data collection.
 The results, says Jon M. Kleinberg, a computer scientist at Cornell University, are a ''revolution in measurement'' and the ''introduction of computing and algorithmic processes into the social sciences in a big way.'' The phenomenon is strikingly evident in economics, business and crime prevention.
 Productivity research has traditionally focused on manufacturing, because the output of widgets and the headcount of factory workers were easy to measure, notes Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 The productivity of information workers -- much of the nation's work force -- was shunted into a category that economists labeled ''difficult to measure'' and given short shrift.
 But the digital age, he says, has opened the door to detailed measurement of the labor of professionals and office workers who handle ideas and information from customers, suppliers, colleagues and marketers.
 ''My thinking on productivity has completely changed,'' says Mr. Brynjolfsson, who is also a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research.
 By tracking e-mail traffic, instant messages and other digital communications -- stripped of personally identifiable information -- he and other researchers are beginning to study the flow of work and ideas through the social networks inside companies -- minute by minute, bit by bit. 
 ''We're really on the cusp of being able to understand what goes on inside corporations in a much more scientific way than ever before,'' he said. ''It's similar to the way that the microscope opened up biology in the 17th century, so that you could see blood cells. Now, we can start to see bits of information as they flow through the organism of the corporation.''
 The desire to exploit computing and mathematical analytics is by no means new. In the 1960s and '70s, ''operations research'' combined computing and math mainly to make factory production work more efficient. And in that period, ''decision support'' software was intended to help managers more intelligently use information in the big computing file cabinets -- databases -- that were becoming common in corporations.
 But the earlier efforts were limited mainly to information access and reporting systems, says Thomas H. Davenport, a professor at Babson College. The quantity and quality of data were typically inadequate, he notes, and the software could not do the advanced optimization and predictive calculations of today's programs.
 Faster and cheaper computing and ample sources of information in digital form -- plucked from enterprise resource planning systems, point-of-sale devices and Web sites -- mean that most companies now have the tools to do the kind of competitive analytics that only a relative handful of elite companies could do in the past. ''It's really starting to become mainstream,'' says Mr. Davenport, co-author with Jeanne G. Harris of ''Competing on Analytics: The New Science of Winning'' (Harvard Business School Press, 2007). The entry barrier, he says, ''is no longer technology, but whether you have executives who understand this.'' 
 There are plenty who do. Big retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and Kohl's use today's advanced computing and math to more accurately predict what sizes of clothes should go to what stores. Harrah's and other casinos decipher slot-machine results to optimize customer traffic and profits, and they use face-recognition software to identify people with criminal records. And Stockholm and other cities use traffic data and patterns to determine ''congestion pricing.'' 
 In the financial industry, Capital One and other banks mine all kinds of transaction data to identify, and stop, fraudulent transactions. And Cemex, the big cement company, uses global positioning satellite locators and traffic and weather data to improve delivery-time performance in Mexico. 
 In the last year or so, Whirlpool, the appliance maker, has begun using new analytics software to automatically scan warranty reports as well as manufacturing, supplier, sales and service data to try to further trim its warranty costs and improve quality. That is no small task, since it sells an average of 25,000 washing machines a day, for example. ''A human being cannot see and detect all those trends,'' says John Kerr, the general manager for global quality.
 With the new computing tools, Whirlpool has trimmed by 30 to 90 days the time required to detect and fix parts or manufacturing problems that cause defects. ''The math is astounding,'' Mr. Kerr says.
 The results help explain why business-intelligence software is one of the hot markets in technology, supplied by companies like SAS, Business Objects, Cognos, MicroStrategy and Information Builders. In March, Oracle offered a hefty $3.3 billion for Hyperion, a maker of business intelligence software. Microsoft has entered the field as well. 
 But packaged software is not the only way to combine powerful computing with deep math tools. The major technology services companies, like I.B.M., Accenture and Hewlett-Packard, have researchers, programmers and industry specialists doing this kind of work for clients.
 Internet marketing and advertising is a social market made for the use of heavy-duty computing and sophisticated mathematics. Investment and start-up money is pouring into the market, and so are many high-powered computing brains. 
 Basem Nayfeh has a Ph.D. from Stanford, where he did his graduate research down the hall from one of Google's founders, Sergey Brin. Mr. Nayfeh's thesis was on multiprocessor chips, and he has worked in corporate labs in Silicon Valley on things as diverse as climate and computer design.
 Today Mr. Nayfeh, 37, is the chief technology officer of Revenue Science, which tracks, analyzes and predicts online behavior to help advertisers find people most likely to buy their products. Many of his fellow computer wizards are in online marketing. 
 ''If you asked any of us 5 or 10 years ago if we would be in advertising,'' he says, ''none of us would have said yes.''

 BODY:
THE ATOMIC BAZAAR 
 The Rise of the Nuclear Poor. By William Langewiesche. 
 179 pp. Farrar, Straus & 
 Giroux. $22.
ONE need read only the first three pages of ''The Atomic Bazaar'' to be reminded of William Langewiesche's formidable talent as a journalist whose cool, precise and economical reporting is harnessed to an invigorating moral and intellectual perspective on the world he describes. In a single paragraph, he lucidly explains the basic physics of the uranium-based atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Once a professional pilot, and the author of ''Inside the Sky,'' Langewiesche then leads the reader inside the ''pressurized, well-heated'' cockpit of the Enola Gay, flying at 31,000 feet in ''smooth air,'' piloted by the young Colonel Paul Tibbets, and vividly reconstructs the evasive maneuver taken by the B-29 as it banks steeply to minimize the coming shockwaves, while the bomb, named Little Boy, falls for 43 seconds before igniting several miles below, lighting the sky with ''the prettiest blues and pinks that Tibbets had ever seen.'' Tibbets's subsequent career, from Air Force general to Internet purveyor of autographed souvenirs of that momentous flight, is adroitly sketched. The bombing of Nagasaki three days after Hiroshima, with a plutonium device, is handled in brisk but sufficient detail. Langewiesche counts the total killed in the two attacks (around 220,000), then delivers his own one-sentence bomb: ''The intent was to terrorize a nation to the maximum extent, and there is nothing like nuking civilians to achieve that effect.'' 
 There's no missing the incendiary effect of the word ''terrorize,'' slyly linking the American attacks on Japanese cities in 1945 and Al Qaeda's attacks on Manhattan and the Pentagon in 2001. Terrorism as a means of warfare is not confined to so-called nonstate actors like Mohamed Atta and his colleagues, but is habitually employed by nation states, including the United States. In 1958, Albert Wohlstetter, the cold war strategist (and guru to many current players on the scene, including Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle), published an influential article whose title, ''The Delicate Balance of Terror,'' succinctly characterized the cold war itself. The chief purpose of nuclear weapons is to terrorize: ''mutual deterrence'' is simply a euphemism for mutual terror. 
 On our comprehensively terrorized globe, almost everybody, from covert, stateless bands of jihadists to accredited members of the United Nations, believes himself in need of either ready-made atomic bombs or the technology and expertise with which to manufacture them. ''The nuclearization of the world,'' Langewiesche writes, ''has become the human condition, and it cannot be changed.'' It is with that grim but realistic assumption in mind that he sets out on a long expedition, from Washington to Holland, Pakistan, Russia, Georgia and Turkey, in order to discover just how hard or easy it now is for a nuclear aspirant, private or national, to gain possession of such weapons or technology. 
 First, he adopts the mindset of an imaginative and resourceful jihadist in search of a single device, powerful enough to devastate a city's downtown. The famed black market in Soviet-era ''loose nukes'' and ''suitcase bombs'' turns out to be probably a myth, so Langewiesche, in terrorist disguise, has to shop elsewhere. Plutonium won't work, for reasons that Langewiesche explains with his usual fluent grasp of technical detail; what's needed are two small but immensely heavy brick-shaped or hemispherical pieces of highly enriched uranium (H.E.U.), huge numbers of which are stored in Russia's closed nuclear cities in the southern Urals. 
 He flies to Ekaterinburg (often spelled with an initial Y in atlases) and from there scouts out one such closed city, Ozersk (population 85,000), a relatively prosperous enclave in a hardscrabble landscape of decrepit farms and toxic lakes and rivers. The 50 square miles of Ozersk and its nuclear facility, Mayak, are contained within a continuous double fence of chain-link and barbed wire. The guards who protect this atomic treasury have a reputation for drinking and taking drugs on the job, and for sometimes killing one another in brawls. Moreover, the United States-supplied radiation detectors are usually switched off, because they're too sensitive for Ozersk's radioactive environment, where a fish from the lake, carried in a worker's bag, is enough to trigger a full-scale nuclear alert. All of this is good news for someone planning an armed raid, but Langewiesche rejects that option: the hue and cry raised after the theft would make escape from Russia with the precious bricks of H.E.U., though not impossible, uncomfortably hazardous.
 He falls in with a garrulous American technician, who is escorted daily under guard into the nuclear cities but forbidden to live in them -- a rich source of human intelligence and just the kind of contact a prospective terrorist would need. The technician describes the ramshackle security arrangements in the facility, how and where H.E.U. is kept and transported from building to building by truck. When he talks of a strange recent flood of money -- the supermarket, transformed from Soviet-style bare shelves to a cornucopia of luxury goods, the sudden appearance of large houses with swimming pools, said to be owned by ''plant managers'' on government salaries -- Langeweische scents his opportunity. ''A culture of wealth without explanation'' signals the ''related culture of corruption.'' So he imagines an inside job, with $5 million apiece to two workers eager to join the new gravy train. 
 With his blocks of H.E.U. in hand, as it were (and they have to be kept at least three feet apart), Langewiesche looks for an escape route. Kazakhstan, though temptingly close, is out for political reasons. He explores other likely crossing points, in Georgia (''one of the most corrupt nations on earth'') and at the Turkish border with Iran. Both frontiers are promisingly porous. In Georgia, the United States Department of Homeland Security has built a state-of-the-art port of entry, complete with a new six-lane highway, which smugglers cheerfully bypass, taking paths so well marked that they are almost roads. The Turkish border is controlled not by the government but by Kurdish tribal chiefs. One way or another, it will be no great feat to transport the stolen H.E.U. to Istanbul, where assembling it into a workable bomb will require a machine shop, a nuclear scientist, several technicians and up to four months of work. Then comes the problem of delivering the device to its target, either in a shipping container or aboard a chartered plane with a dedicated, suicidal pilot.
 The most alarming thing about ''The Atomic Bazaar'' is its utter lack of alarmism. At every point, Langewiesche stresses the difficulties that confront the determined nuclear terrorist. Between Ozersk and an explosion in an American city lies an epic string of daunting obstacles. The terrorist would need to be gifted with an extraordinary run of luck. But none of these obstacles are, in themselves, insurmountable and, in the nearly lawless parts of the world described by Langewiesche, luck comes easily to anyone with millions in his pocket.
 For nation states, it's a different matter. The second half of the book is mainly devoted to the career of A. Q. Khan and his successful manufacture of the H.E.U.-based Pakistani bomb. Khan, a metallurgist, not a nuclear scientist, just happened to find employment at a Dutch consortium where uranium is enriched for peaceful purposes in a ''cascade'' of linked centrifuges, each spinning at a dizzying 70,000 r.p.m. With shocking ease, Khan copied the plans for centrifuges and bought parts for them mostly on the open market in Europe, marvelously unhindered by either nuclear proliferation treaties or export controls.
 A vain man, with a taste for extravagant vacations and large houses, as well as an ambition to be known as a lavish philanthropist, Khan then set himself up as the Sears Roebuck-style supplier of packaged bomb-programs to the world. For sums of around $100 million (assembly required) Khan offered his wares to Libya, North Korea, Iran, either Syria or Saudi Arabia and probably other nations. As the result of a British and American interception, in 2003, of a shipload of centrifuge parts bound for Libya, bearing the clear signature of Khan's operation, he is now under benign house arrest in Islamabad. But, as Langewiesche writes, there is a ''likelihood that much of the network he established remains alive worldwide, and that by its very nature -- loose, unstructured, technically specialized, determinedly amoral -- it is both resilient and mutable and can resume its activities when the opportunity arises, as inevitably it will.'' To quote the title and refrain of Tom Lehrer's unfortunately evergreen 1965 song about nuclear proliferation: ''Who's next? Who's next? Who's next?'' Lehrer's prediction was Luxembourg, Monaco and Alabama. He was not far wrong. A Russian nuclear bureaucrat tells Langewiesche: ''At some point this change occurred. The great powers were stuck with arsenals they could not use, and nuclear weapons became the weapons of the poor.''
 The Atomic Bazaar'' is an important book, but not a perfect one. The best nonfiction books, like good novels, have their own organic structure: chapter flows naturally into chapter, the architecture of the whole sustained by a multitude of subtle foreshadowings of what's to come and subtle echoes of what has gone before. That is not how any book by Langewiesche works. Like its predecessors, ''The Atomic Bazaar'' comes with the curse of The Atlantic Monthly all too visible on its pages, its chapters like free-standing boxcars, loosely coupled by a large general theme -- much as they appeared in separate issues of the magazine between November 2005 and December 2006. Too little work has gone into its translation from journalism to book. Though short, it's littered with clunky repetitions and recapitulations, as when we're repeatedly told what H.E.U. is and does, and A. Q. Khan twice falls from public grace. Again and again I found myself scribbling ''Been there, done that'' in the margins. This is a serious pity, for Langewiesche is such an outstandingly able writer that he owes the world a proper book, and not another piece of bookmaking whose individual parts are splendid but ultimately fail to compose a shapely, aesthetically satisfying and conclusive whole

Michael Kimmelman is the chief art critic for The New York Times.

 BODY:
2. One late evening in March, Shigeru Ban, dressed as always in black, left his office, a large recycled-paper tube structure about the size of a subway car temporarily wedged onto the top floor of the Pompidou Center in Paris. Mimicking the shape of the glass escalator tubes on the building's outside, the office blends imperceptibly enough into the architecture that nobody on staff at Georges, the trendy rooftop restaurant with a big glass window facing Ban's studio, even knew it was there.
Called the Paper Tube Studio, it feels, inside, a little like a zeppelin, with porthole windows and simple white curtains for dividers. A dozen or so assistants sat at plain sawhorse tables silently gazing into computers or constructing models, working on Ban's various projects: a housing complex in Dijon; the headquarters for a cosmetics company in Parma; a luxury villa in the Caribbean; and the Pompidou's satellite museum in Metz, the commission for which explains what Ban's office is doing on the roof of the Pompidou in Paris. Elsa Neufrille, a slender young woman in Converse sneakers with a mop of dark hair, who oversaw the studio's construction by a volunteer crew of Ban's students, slugged water from a Contrex bottle and contemplated a paper bridge Ban is designing for Avignon. She nodded as he left. He nodded back. 
 Taking the elevator down, Ban led me several blocks through a light spring rain to a small, smoky restaurant crowded with students, then half-listened as a Japanese friend of his translated the chalkboard menu. After some years here, he still hasn't seemed to master French. He hasn't had much time. Every two weeks, he leaves for Tokyo to spend several days teaching and checking in at his office there, where he oversees a different set of projects, including the last stage of a large office building for Swatch on the main shopping street in Ginza (it opens this week). Every month he flies to New York, where he has another office. With his New York partner, Dean Maltz, Ban is designing a condominium tower next to Frank Gehry's new IAC headquarters building beside the West Side Highway in Manhattan. 
 Judith Turner, an architectural photographer who has known Ban for years, told me that Ban used to live on Russian time because it was easier than readjusting his body clock. By now he's accustomed to the nomad's life -- it goes with architectural stardom, which, at 49, still young in the profession, he has acquired not least for projects of a sustainable or green variety. Ban isn't comfortable with the word ''green,'' which he finds vague, not to mention fashionable, although his projects are often described as such. These include the (fittingly named) Nomadic Museum.
 Made out of cargo containers, stacked in a grid like a giant children's toy block set, the museum is a temporary structure that can be put together almost anywhere, shipping containers being ubiquitous, and as easily taken apart. A Nomadic Museum took over Pier 54 in Manhattan a couple of years ago. The latest and largest version, with 153 blue, gray, red, orange and green containers, many stenciled with COSTCO in big white capital letters, now squats on reclaimed landfill near the port in Tokyo. Peaked colonnades of recycled paper tubes create the equivalent of twin church naves inside, where immense hanging curtains, like banners of exquisite Indian silk, decorate the entrance and exit. They're made from recycled tea bags.
 Ban's interest in simple, easily transported, reusable materials surfaced in another project that made him famous and particularly admired. In a field where humanitarian relief work isn't exactly commonplace, Ban devised shelters for refugees in Rwanda made of slender paper tubes. This led him to do temporary housing -- log cabins with paper-tube walls for disaster victims -- first in response to the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan, where he also built a paper church, and later in Turkey and India. Having put up some of the money himself, he persuaded local companies to donate materials. In Kobe, he used yellow plastic Kirin beer crates filled with sandbags as foundations. The average cost per house was $2,000, though it is the elegance as much as the economy of the architecture that has distinguished Ban. His works are airy, curvaceous, balletic. An heir to Buckminster Fuller and Oscar Niemeyer, to Japanese traditional architecture and to Alvar Aalto, he is an old-school Modernist with a poet's touch and an engineer's inventiveness. 
 If his works seem to be split between two very different sorts of endeavors, luxury and temporary, they're actually of a piece, the through-line a kind of minimal leanness. It's an aesthetic and also a strategy -- to make the most out of whatever is available. This means using shipping containers but also turning bookshelves into supporting walls and devising barrel-vaulted ceilings out of recycled plywood. Ban is resourceful and thrifty, whether he's building a glass villa for a fashion-company executive in a suburb outside Tokyo or a paper-tube house in India. 
 ''Every architect talks about sustainable design now,'' Ban said to me over clattering dinner dishes at the restaurant, ''but it's hard to define. Solar panels, for example, are interesting, but they lack durability, which can make them costlier than electricity, and the panels require lots of energy to make, then lots more to recycle. 
 ''Anything can be recycled except maybe concrete,'' he continued. For Ban, green or sustainable architecture is therefore about more than saving energy or using recycled materials. It's about people's emotional connection to the buildings they occupy, and about making buildings that may have different identities at different times. Some buildings, he says, should be built as disposable. They can still be green so long as they don't require more energy to take down than they did to put up. 
 To the objection that paper buildings are wasteful or too fragile, Ban has a ready response: ''A concrete-and-steel building can be temporary. It can be taken down or destroyed by an earthquake. But paper can last. It's a question of love. My paper church was still around after 10 years. If a building is loved, it becomes permanent, although buildings don't always need to be permanent. People are more nomadic today. Factories move to find cheap labor. People don't go to offices the way they used to. Families grow, they need to move, then children leave, and they move again. It's always about designing for the particular situation.'' 
 In a proposal for a museum and condominium tower in Southern California, Ban told me, he exploited natural light and ventilation so as to rely less on air-conditioning. At the same time, he realized that a tall building next to the museum would block the sun part of the day. Ban saw this not just as a problem but also as an opportunity. Calculating how the sun moved, he shaped the tower with a kind of ski-slope facade and glass handrails on the balconies to reflect light down into the museum. ''I never start with an arbitrary shape,'' Ban told me. ''I always start with the problem.''
 When I went in April to meet Ban in Tokyo, a young Japanese woman nodded at the mention of his name then asked me in all seriousness whether it was true, as she had heard, that he had been the model for the cartoon character Super Mario. I winced but knew what she meant. Ban has black hair and a black mustache and a soft face. He is a deeply serious, strong-willed man with a wry sense of humor that can take awhile to reveal itself. ''He has a silly side, but the one word that would sum him up is 'chutzpah,' '' says Laurie Hawkinson, the New York architect who is an old friend of Ban's from their student days at Cooper Union in the 1980s. She laughs.
 ''I mean he's forceful and incredibly persistent,'' she adds. ''He got into the relief work by calling up the United Nations and just not taking no for an answer. He's different from other high-design architects who don't get into the mud. He's on a different track generally. Architects today talk about surface, articulation, skin, glazing, and he deals with all those issues, of course. But the trajectory of his career is through structural engineering, so that's how he approaches all problems, including sustainability.''
 I went one morning to see a feat of engineering by Ban, his library for Seikei University, in the west of Tokyo. It shares a grassy quadrangle on campus with several plain brick buildings. From the outside, the library, with its alternating bands of glass and brick, fits unexceptionally into the Beaux-Arts milieu, but inside is another universe. Cantilevered stacks for books seem to float. A huge glass wall opens onto a grove of zelkova trees. Timber beams of recycled strandboard arch over an atrium of flying bridges and immense, mushroom-shaped pods that rise from a sunken floor. It's a cross between Jules Verne's ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' and Frank Lloyd Wright's Johnson Wax Building, with a spiral glass staircase, mimicking the one at Niemeyer's foreign ministry in BrasAlia, that underscores the otherworldly, quasi-nautical motif.
 With Niemeyer, curvy, fantastical shapes have come from pushing materials like reinforced concrete to new limits and not incidentally from the desire to make architecture for the masses. Niemeyer put the samba in Le Corbusier and Mies. You might say Ban is trying to do something similar, only with manga. 
 Mayu Inoue, who works for Ban in Tokyo, met me that morning under one of the library's pods and told me that his office wasn't far away. We started walking, then boarded a train, then another. Not quite an hour later we debarked on the outskirts of the city. The familiar crowds, office towers and traffic gave way to an older Japan, a cluster of hilly lanes and shops in modest two-story buildings with few cars and no sidewalks, petering out into streets of private houses. This is near to where Ban grew up. He lives and works here now. His office occupies a storefront across from a rice merchant, next to an old hardware store. Ban's mother's workshop is upstairs. She designs custom women's clothing and runs Atelier Ban, a tiny boutique at the corner. 
 From the town center, through a leafy residential stretch, we reached the apartment building where Ban lives, in Hanegi Forest, which is not so much a forest as a patch of slender trees surrounded by houses. A decade ago, Ban designed the place: it has 11 triplexes, with a sleek, white exterior, raised, like Le Corbusier's Villa Savoie, on slender columns, or pilotis. He didn't cut or move a single tree. Replacing the usual steel-frame grid with a triangular grid system, he was able to remove beams and make way for trees to grow through gaps he designed in the building. 
 The place looked a tad dingy in the way that aging white buildings sometimes do, and the dirt forest floor, interrupted by pilotis, felt less weightless and open than dark, but it wasn't a sunny day, and clearly the layout was ingenious in its incorporation of nature. In the way Ban's work often does, the architecture replaced typically cramped Japanese conditions with lofty, modern spaces. On my way back into town, I noticed just how much unlike everything else in the neighborhood it was -- nearly as startling as the library.
 Ban's mother was in the store when we passed. Mayu waved. Ban told me that as a boy, he ''loved watching the women who sewed for my mother. She used to go to Paris every year to see the shows,'' he added. ''She would come back with souvenirs. I envied her. I wanted to go abroad.''
 It was his mother who paid for him to study architecture at Cooper Union in New York. His father, a businessman working for Toyota, thought the name didn't sound like a proper university. ''He doesn't like to take any risks,'' Ban told me.
 In high school Ban studied design after class. Weekly projects in wood, paper and bamboo piqued his interest in materials and construction. A classmate was the daughter of Kiyoshi Ikebe, the architect, a disciple of Corbu's. Ban realized, looking back years later, that Ikebe had shaped his way of thinking. In 1975 he came across an architecture magazine dedicated to John Hejduk. 
 ''His works shocked me,'' he recalled about Hejduk, a former Cooper Union dean whose brightly colored exercises with cubes, grids and diagonals mixed functionalism with a savvy kind of childlike ebullience. ''They looked like toys, with simple colors and geometry, totally different from what I saw in Tokyo.'' It would lead him to consider ways to merge East and West: ''I decided I had to go to Cooper Union. So I studied English for three months. Then when I arrived in the United States I learned that I couldn't go to Cooper yet, so I visited a few schools in California and enrolled at SCI-Arc, the Southern California Institute of Architecture. It was a terrific experience because we had case studies, which included Raymond Kappe and Wright and Neutra, who mixed Modernism with Japanese influences. Then when I did enroll at Cooper, I learned history: Corbu, Mies, Palladio, Schinkel. I started with Hejduk's geometry, and Mies and Corbu became my gods.'' 
 Not everyone at Cooper did. Peter Eisenman, one of his teachers, ''hated me and called me Sugar Bear because he said my name was too complicated to pronounce.'' Ban, who speaks in a quiet, steady, matter-of-fact way, sometimes pauses when he wants to emphasize a point. ''About five years ago I saw him by chance; we were seated at the same table at an award ceremony in Berlin, and he told his little boy to call me Sugar Bear,'' Ban said. He paused, then smiled. 
 Ban took a year off in 1982 and worked in the Tokyo office of the famous Japanese architect Arata Isozaki, then graduated in 1984. While with Isozaki, he started curating shows at the Axis gallery in Tokyo. When he opened his own practice in 1985, he did a show about Emilio Ambasz. Ban came up with honeycombed paper panels, used like Japanese folding screens, as display units. ''I learned a great deal from Ambasz,'' he told me, recalling a design Ambasz proposed for the Seville Expo in 1992, which celebrated Christopher Columbus (it was never built). The site was near a river. The plan entailed piers and a new manmade lake with pavilions on ships docked at the piers; nations would design their own ships. After the expo, the ships would return to the countries that made them and Seville would be left with a lake and park. For Ban, it was (though he wouldn't have put it this way then) a thrifty, green idea. 
 He followed the Ambasz show with one borrowed from the Museum of Modern Art in New York about Alvar Aalto. The Finnish master of organic, undulating Modernism, Aalto was grounded in Nordic culture. He experimented with and reimagined basic materials like brick, glass and wood; he pioneered designs in bentwood furniture, and he planned communities of A-frame houses. ''As a student,'' Ban said, ''I didn't understand Aalto, but I went to Finland after school and was astonished. The real buildings were so different from what I saw in books. The context was crucial. International architects taught that local materials didn't matter. But I saw that was not true.'' For the Axis show, Ban didn't have the budget to use wood, which he thought would have been wasteful anyway, so he made partition walls, S-shaped in the vein of Aalto's bentwood designs, from cheap, recycled paper tubes (''they were much stronger than I expected paper to be, which got me thinking,'' he said), and the tubes also functioned as supports for display stands. He reprised this same design for ''Alvar Aalto Through the Eyes of Shigeru Ban,'' a show at the Barbican Art Gallery in London this spring, which also included his own works. There it was clear how much Ban's designs owed to Aalto's, aesthetically, materially, ethically -- to what Ban calls ''Aalto's compassionate approach to architecture.'' 
 Ban's first Aalto exhibition was the beginning of what came to be called his ''paper architecture.'' After that, he experimented with various paper-tube designs. The engineering fascinated him. Meanwhile, friends commissioned houses -- paper and otherwise (''they didn't know I had no working experience,'' he said). For the library of a poet outside Tokyo, he devised a gate-shaped paper-tube frame, with bookshelves as supporting walls. He looked at new ways of using other materials too. In the PC Pile House, near Mount Fuji, he exposed precast concrete piles as supports for a glass pavilion that floated from the side of a steep hill. ''I always try to understand and reinterpret the fundamental meaning of each element,'' he said. ''In that case I like that there's nothing hidden. Each element has its own clear function.''
 Mies's Farnsworth House became a model. Ban thought it dovetailed with traditional Japanese houses that used translucent shoji screens to expose and enclose space; but Mies used glass walls that were immobile. Ban came up with the Curtain Wall House -- a cheeky, steel-frame structure with a two-story deck that juts over the sidewalk like the prow of a ship. A white sliding curtain, 20 or so feet high, could be pulled to enclose the interior. It was the building's theatrical flourish, the whole design, albeit minimal, like a stage set.
 The Curtain Wall House was picked for a 1999 show at MoMA, which earned Ban attention, as did the paper-tube arch that he then devised for the museum's sculpture garden. It was around this same time that Ban collaborated with Frei Otto on the Japan Pavilion at the Hanover Expo in 2000. ''My dream had always been to work with Otto,'' Ban recalled of the German architect and engineer. ''The expo's theme was the environment, so our goal became to recycle or reuse all our materials and to keep everything as low-tech as possible.'' They came up with an all-paper tube structure, but German authorities, having never seen such a thing before, insisted it be paper and wood. What resulted was a broad, soaring, wavy roof, 242 feet long, 82 feet wide, 52 feet high. It was a paper tube shell held in place by cables like the strings of a tennis racquet. Ban expanded on this idea when he devised a roof for a gymnasium in Odate, in northeast Japan (a graceful, elliptical space inspired by Bernini). For a park in St. Louis, he overcame bamboo's inherent structural flaws to conceive a latticework pavilion of laminated bamboo, a kind of undulating canopy that reinforced itself like the folded end of a cardboard box. It's related to his proposal for the Pompidou in Metz (the roof resembles a Chinese hat). 
 He also takes much of the credit for the latticework design that Think Design, a team of architects of which Ban was a part, proposed in 2003 to replace the World Trade Center towers. The idea was for steel lattices straddling the footprints of the fallen towers. It was poetic, a ladder to the sky. Ban says he was thinking about the Japanese tradition of paper boxes with candles, set afloat as memorials to heal the dead. He measured how light from the towers would cast onto the Hudson River at night. ''I was very happy we came in second at ground zero,'' he told me. ''Because ultimately I knew it would be a political mess.'' 
 Meanwhile Ban was, as his friend Laurie Hawkinson put it, getting into the mud. In 1994, he saw photographs of the refugee camps in Rwanda: two million people in miserable shelters. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees supplied them with plastic sheets and aluminum poles to prop up the sheets. The aluminum replaced trees, which the refugees had been told to cut down but were also using for firewood. Deforestation was causing floods. The refugees simply sold the aluminum and cut down more trees. Ban proposed a paper-tube structure.
 ''I had no experience with this sort of problem, but I went to Rwanda and went to see the high commissioner,'' he told me. ''My timing was good. Many companies had been trying to sell him their products, to make money. With my proposal, the tubes could be made cheaply and simply and by the people on site, if they got a little training with equipment that even Rwanda had.'' 
 When the Kobe earthquake hit in 1995, Ban proposed temporary but more elaborate housing out of paper, and his paper church. He was met with skepticism. ''The priest didn't believe me,'' Ban said. ''So I went to service every week. Finally he said O.K., if I raised the money. At the same time, I was going to the park in Kobe where Vietnamese refugees, who had lost their homes in the quake, were living in a kind of shantytown. It was horrible, but they didn't want to move to government housing outside the city because then they couldn't get to their jobs back in town. I built the first temporary house at my own expense. The priest saw it and then he gave me money for more houses but still not for his own church. We built 28 of them.'' Ban, of course, also eventually built the church. It stood for 10 years and was re-erected in Taiwan this spring.
 Waterproof sponge tape filled gaps between the paper tubes. Canvas roofs gave shade from the heat. Like the Rwandan shelters, the houses, akin to erector sets, could be assembled by anyone. When western Turkey was hit by its own quake, Ban adapted the log-cabin scheme. He persuaded a Japanese corporation to donate plastic sheeting with the company logo on it, good publicity for when the shelters were shown on television. Local Turkish companies donated the beer crates and paper tubes. A Turkish architect warned him that Turkish people accustomed to masonry houses wouldn't be open to paper ones. ''But the reaction was fascinating,'' Ban said. ''People said they felt more comfortable in the paper houses because the concrete and brick houses had collapsed and people were killed in their sleep. The paper houses wouldn't fall on them in the middle of the night.''
 In Sri Lanka, he changed the log-cabin design to mud-cement brick houses with wood furniture walls. They included rooms that opened onto the street, so that people could continue running their businesses out of the fronts of their homes; he divided interiors so that, as religious Muslims, the women could disappear when their husbands had male visitors. 
 ''And in India, I used woven cane mats for the roofs, because they were there, and because there were no beer crates we used mud floors with broken brick and the concrete from destroyed buildings,'' Ban went on to say. ''Fortunately, the local industry was textiles, and of course textiles are wrapped around paper tubes.
 ''There is no border between these projects and my other projects,'' he continued. ''I am always interested in developing new structural or material systems and adapting them to particular circumstances. That's what new architecture always comes out of. Otherwise it's just style and fashion. High-tech buildings, all these acrobatic buildings today, use overdesigned materials and methods. My impulse is always to simplify, clarify.''
 Before I left Tokyo, I stopped by to see Noriko Togo, who commissioned Ban to design a low-rise, multiuse building. Togo is an art dealer with a warren of a gallery on the ground floor, full of Picassos. Ban devised for it an ingenious system of sliding walls that hide floating shelves. There are two floor-through apartments upstairs. The building is a three-story glass cube that Ban calls Ivy Structure 2. Togo rolled her eyes when I inquired about the ivy. ''It didn't work out, and Shigeru proposed covering the walls with artificial ivy instead, but I said no, I'm an art dealer, I don't deal in fakes.'' Turned diagonally to the street, the building has triangular gaps that provide space for small gardens and balconies. 
 Well coiffed, in a business suit, Togo removed her shoes to show me the apartments: lofty, open spaces where trees planted on the terraces screened huge picture windows. ''I love this because when I'm inside I feel outside,'' she said. ''It's a modern interpretation of a Japanese way of thinking. Without nature, life is not sustainable, we believe. We write poems about that. Buddhist monks live in the mountains where they can open the door and let the wind whistle in. Ban does the same here in a way that's extremely practical.'' 
 That philosophy has guided other projects like the Paper Art Museum, two elegant glass-and-steel boxes linked by a thin glass membrane of a roof, the walls made of shuttered glass and opening to the outdoors. In the new Swatch tower, a similar device raises the whole facade and rear, transforming the tall first floor of the building into a through street with planted trees and a planted wall inside. At the Naked House, in the middle of a rice field, walls also slide open. Everything is flexible. Inside, four huge boxes on casters, open on two sides, function as movable rooms with tatami mat floors. They can be pushed together or hooked up to air-conditioners or shoved to face the windows.
 It's ''very Japanese,'' Ban told me, ''because the clients didn't care about privacy.'' I was reminded that there is no Japanese word for privacy. I found the apotheosis of this transparent approach in Ban's most recent and most extravagant house, Maison E, two hours north by train along the coast from Tokyo, through rice paddies and shopping malls. Home to the owner of a fashion company, it's a $5 million, 12,900-square-foot palace, with a swimming pool, bamboo garden, rock garden, moss garden, all inside a complex of spaces that open onto one another, with sliding glass walls, uniting nature and architecture, private and shared space. 
 All white and glass, softened by plantings and wood shutters and subtle geometries, it looked immaculate. When I was there, several employees in matching turquoise uniforms were vacuuming, clearly a Sisyphean task. A golf driving range on the second floor mitigated the aesthetic somewhat and stressed a conspicuous consumption that was partly redeemed by a housing complex next door. The fashion company's owner commissioned Ban to design it for the company's female workers -- an apartment building with breezy studios and large communal spaces to cook and watch television. Call it a socialist Hanegi Forest. 
 It felt a long way from the paper-tube log cabins, but also not. Ban returns to the same principles in all his work. Asked once what he had learned from Aalto, he said, ''to give comfort to people.'' 
 ''Architects create monuments to their egos or to help developers,'' he went on. ''That's part of what we do, and what I do -- make monuments. But they need to work more in the service of society. That's also the responsibility of the architect. I think we're responsible at all stages of the process.''

HEADLINE: What's Furry and Thirsty and Loves the Dark?

BYLINE: By SUSAN STEWART

 BODY:
IT'S spring: time to plant perennials, clean closets -- and call the microbial inspector. What does spring cleaning mean in the age of green? For many of us, it means fear. 
 Homeowners whose grandparents beat rugs and washed windows worry about more than dirt. So what if the baseboards are dusty? The lead in the paint could be lowering your toddler's future SAT scores. The air may be fragrant with the season's first blooms, but that doesn't make you safe from colorless, odorless gases like radon and carbon monoxide. And, by the way, you're sneezing. Is it a cold, or is it mold?
Household nightmares often capture the public imagination for a while and then fade away. Asbestos, lead and radon, riveting in the 1970s and 1980s, are still around, but they're old news. Mold, which started making headlines in the 1990s, is in. And with the recent flooding throughout the region, mold inspectors and remediators can barely handle the business. 
 ''People are really irritable right now,'' said Margaret Ann Furer, a contractor and mold mitigator in Katonah, N.Y. She was not referring to the hardest-hit victims of the recent northeaster and subsequent flooding; people who lose their homes to water have much more to worry about than mold. But mold is one of the most common and insidious aftereffects of even minor flooding, and when a wet spring season connects with a less than watertight house -- or when moisture is trapped in an airtight house made of mold-conducive materials -- it can make for a bumper crop.
 Mold is a furry, thirsty fungus. Outdoors, it earns its place in the ecosystem by breaking down wood, leaves and plant debris. Indoors, it breaks the hearts of homeowners, mostly by attacking their pocketbooks.
 ''Mold is the hot topic right now,'' said Robert Weitz, a certified microbial inspector and a principal in RTK Environmental Group, an environmental testing company in Connecticut.
 On a cloudy April day, Mr. Weitz is examining the entrance of Jay and Julia Bacal's multilevel contemporary house in northern Westchester County.
 ''This is Cladosporium mold,'' he says, pointing to grayish shadows near the front door. ''This is opportunistic, a dark area without much light. And this house is covered in a solid stain, and mold loves solid stain.''
 Loves? Mr. Weitz is creeping us out already, and we're not even inside the house. Is it . . . alive?
 ''Mold is not dead or alive,'' he says reassuringly. ''It is viable or nonviable.''
 But what if mold is merely dormant? That is another story. Mold feeds on organic materials and is brought to life by moisture. When a water source is removed but existing mold is left, according to Mr. Weitz, ''the spores, if you will, start to panic.''
 ''They go through the process of sporulation,'' he said. ''They throw themselves toward water sources.'' We feel like throwing ourselves back in the car, but instead we move indoors.
 The pale spring sun fills the high-ceilinged living room, illuminating the area where a trickle of water once made its way down the chimney wall. ''Water was leaking from a ceiling pipe in the lowest level of the house,'' Mr. Weitz says. ''They've already removed the carpet on that level and replaced it with tile.''
 WE head downstairs to a finished walk-out basement. At the foot of the steps, on the new tile, Mr. Weitz places a small white object atop a chest-high tripod. This is a monitoring device that can detect elevated levels of mold spores in the air, even in rooms where mold is not visible.
 Crouching, Mr. Weitz peers behind a heater against the back wall. ''There's a little bit of mold here,'' he says, in the calm, considered tone of a doctor reading the results of a blood test. ''All very typical.''
 Mr. Weitz spends two hours or so going through a residential property, checking for radon, asbestos, lead and, of course, mold. He takes baseline readings of air quality inside and out (some neighborhoods are naturally moldier than others). He charges $400 to $500, and a few hundred more for lab costs. But if you have a mold problem, that cost is only the beginning. Nightmare stories aside, a typical suburban remediation, according to several local remediators, runs from $2,000 to $4,000, though some reach $12,000.
 ''Mold is a health concern for a very limited population,'' said Charles Wiles, executive director of the American Indoor Air Quality Council, which certifies microbial inspectors like Mr. Weitz. ''However, mold is a financial issue for everyone, as it reduces the value of their assets.''
 Even if the mold in your house isn't causing discomfort to you, odds are that it will make potential buyers very queasy. Most mold isn't toxic to most people, but mold has had a toxic reputation since 1993, when a cluster of children in Cleveland suffered pulmonary hemorrhages linked, although inconclusively, to the presence of a mold called Stachybotrys in their homes.
 Then in 2001, a Texas jury awarded Melinda Ballard $32 million in a ''bad faith'' lawsuit against Farmers Insurance Group of Companies after mold was discovered throughout her 22-room house. (The award was lowered to $4 million two years later.)
 In 2003, Johnny Carson's former sidekick, Ed McMahon, and his wife, Pamela, were awarded $7.2 million from American Equity Insurance in a California court. Mold, the McMahons' lawsuit claimed, killed their sheepdog Muffin and caused health problems for them and their staff, forcing them to leave their six-bedroom home for six months.
 These and other cases helped to create a virtual industry around a fungus that has been among us forever.
 Five years ago, the air-quality council listed 1,000 certified microbial inspectors on its books. Today, there are 5,000. Is there more mold, or are we just more worried about it?
 Both, said Charles Bernzweig, owner of Spectrum, a remediation company in Scarsdale. 
 ''For one thing, houses are more tightly built, so moisture builds up,'' he said.
 Houses today are also made with materials like drywall that are mold-friendly and that are often left out in the rain and installed wet, Mr. Bernzweig said.
 In addition, he said, ''people want to be comfortable,'' so they put humidifiers in their heating systems. 
 ''It's a Catch-22,'' said Mary Lamielle, executive director of the National Center for Environmental and Health Strategies, a lobbying group for people with chemical sensitivities. ''You caulk your windows to save energy, and that leads to more toxin growth.''
 As a result of the environmental movement, recycling has also increased, which means that more and more organic materials are being used in construction. When damp, wallboard coated in recycled newspaper provides a delicious meal for mold, Mr. Weitz said.
 Thanks in no small part to the Ballard case and the attention it drew, mold-damage claims skyrocketed a few years ago. Insurers paid $1.4 billion in mold claims in 2001, and twice that the next year. The level of such payouts has not pleased the insurance industry, which has taken steps to limit coverage for mold damage.
 ''Mold has been around longer than humans,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, president and chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute. ''The entirety of our existence has been in the company of mold. Why had insurance adjusters never seen a mold claim before 2002? It wasn't because a new strain of mold had been unleashed upon the earth. It was the trial lawyers.''
 Most homeowners policies have caps for mold damage, but do cover water damage. ''It was never the intent of policies to cover mold,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''The vast majority of mold is failure to perform some kind of maintenance.''
 ''If a tree comes into your house and it takes a few weeks to repair the water damage, the mold resulting from that water damage would be covered,'' he said. ''But it has to be mold that happened just because of the water damage.''
 And the only way to prove that is to call your insurer quickly. ''It's incumbent on you as a homeowner to report damage as quickly as possible to the insurer,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''First, it helps to keep the damage from getting worse. Second, if you wait it becomes harder to see which damage was caused by the incident and which was not.''
 Mr. Hartwig was speaking from his son's Little League game in Elmsford, N.Y., where, he noted, the Saw Mill River had done some recent damage. He said this is the time to buy flood insurance, which is distinct from homeowner's insurance. ''Because it takes 30 days for a policy to go into effect,'' he explained, ''and most of the floods are from remnants of tropical storms. And we're coming up on tropical storm season.''
 Mr. Weitz makes his way slowly through the Bacals' house, from bottom to top. He notes a kitchen cabinet ''delaminated'' by a nail puncture in the dishwasher hose. He wields a digital moisture meter -- eerily reminiscent of the Geiger counters in old science fiction movies -- to see if a stain on the garage ceiling is a new leak or an old one.
 ''Every building shows a history,'' he says, ''and it's your job to find out if the history is ancient or recent.''
 Mr. Weitz started out as a contractor, but became absorbed in environmental issues. ''I've probably done 3,000 inspections,'' he says. His company, RTK, does not do remediation, just detection. Checking for mold and then charging to remove it would be a conflict of interest, he says.
 He developed his soothing manner out of necessity. ''We get some people who call who are literally in tears,'' he says. ''And that is really not the exception.''
 When Traci Ludwig, the owner, with her husband, Michael, of an 1884 house in Mamaroneck, called in the mold people a few years ago, she was only mildly hysterical.
 ''We had white and fuzzy mold, we had brown mottled mold, we had black mold,'' she said. ''It was a scientific study of mold.''
 It was all in the wine cellar -- the only room in the basement that had been redone by the previous owner.
 ''Sometime in the 1960s the previous owner had put in walls,'' Ms. Ludwig said. ''There were beautiful old wine casks and shelves.''
 There was also water, leaking from the terrace above and dampening the new plasterboard. 
 ''We moved in on Friday, the 13th of December, in 2002,'' Ms. Ludwig said. ''There was no mold smell. As the months got warmer, we were overcome by a very strong smell. The children were coughing. After some thinking we put it together and realized they and we were probably breathing in mold spores.''
 After testing, Ms. Ludwig called an environmental firm in Scarsdale. ''They put tarps in the yard, and men in white suits kept going in and out,'' she said.
 Today the mold is gone, and so is the wine cellar. ''It's just an empty room at the moment,'' Ms. Ludwig said. 
 In suburban Connecticut, the owner of a 10-year-old house with a 5,000-square-foot basement moved his 1,200-bottle wine collection to the garage when he found mold on the wallboard behind the basement paneling after some minor flooding. He estimated that he had spent more than $100,000 diagnosing and eradicating the mold problem and returning his basement to its original condition. But he's still not sure why he responded the way he did.
 ''I grew up on a farm, and mold was everywhere. I certainly didn't feel any side effects,'' he said. ''But the issue now is, if you're going to sell a house, you have to take care of these things. The industry has done a good job of marketing itself.''
 The homeowner spoke on condition of anonymity -- not a rare occurrence, in the murky world of mold.
 Gary Stone, a mold remediator whose company, Homeguard Environmental, operates out of Stamford, said he deals with privacy issues all the time. ''Last week a woman said, 'Do you have unmarked trucks? Because I saw a truck in front of my neighbor's house that said Toilet Doctor.' '' 
 You won't be seeing trucks with decorative spores painted on them anytime soon.
 ''It's hard,'' Mr. Weitz says. ''Mold is like a personal issue somehow. People don't want to share.''
 But Mr. Weitz loves to share. ''As much as a fungus can have a personality, I suppose mold does,'' he says. ''I'm fascinated by mold. I could bore you for hours with all things mold. My wife says, 'Bob, you're a lot of fun at a cocktail party.' ''
 NOW Mr. Weitz is in the yard of the Bacals' house, noting where shrubs are too close to the walls, where drainage away from the house is insufficient, where roof tiles are missing. With our mold consciousness raised, we notice some greenish scum around the deck. 
 ''Green is algae,'' Mr. Weitz says. ''Algae is O.K.''
 The Bacals learned the results of their testing within a week of Mr. Weitz's visit. Some spores found in the lower level were Stachybotrys, the scary mold. They're getting estimates from remediation companies. They're not terribly concerned.
 ''I did get down on my hands and knees, and I saw some black smutty stuff,'' said Mr. Bacal, who has been using an air filtration device he bought online to try to mitigate his acid reflux and sinus pain, symptoms he thinks could be environmental in origin. 
 Would he ever think of getting rid of his three cats?
 ''Oh, definitely I'm not getting rid of the cats,'' he said. ''They're family.''
 His doorbell rang.
 ''Oops, got to go,'' he said. ''That's the guys who're coming to take care of my mice.'' Getting to Know Mold 
 THERE are 800 to 1,000 identified molds, according to L. Claire Macdonald, laboratory manager at SanAir Technologies Laboratory, a microbial testing firm in Richmond, Va. ''When you actually see mold with the naked eye, it's just a bunch of spores stuck together,'' she said. ''It's kind of known in the industry that you can't tell by looking at it what species a particular mold is.''
 Ms. Macdonald's laboratory analyzes the spores trapped in the air-monitoring devices used by microbial inspectors in the buildings they check for mold. The most common genuses of mold in homes are Aspergillus, Penicillium and Cladosporum, she said. Each also manifests in various species, as in Aspergillus parasiticus. Rarer but scarier is Stachybotrys, the mold that is often called ''toxic.''
 But toxic is as toxic does, according to Ms. Macdonald. While Stachybotrys has been associated with illness, its presence says something else to mold experts. ''Stachy is considered a water indicator mold,'' Ms. Macdonald said. ''It requires higher levels of water to grow, so if you see it there must be a water problem.''
 Ultimately, if you have water where water shouldn't be, as a result of a flood, a leak, a sewage backup or a fire, you may need a mold inspection. Other reasons to check for mold, according to Robert Weitz, a microbial inspector: dampness in the basement, an odd odor, especially on the lower levels of your house, or water that has stayed behind a wall or under a floor for more than 24 hours -- the time it takes a well-hydrated mold colony to sprout.
 Increasingly, prospective home buyers want mold checkups. ''You want to know, 'Am I buying somebody's mold problem which I'm not seeing?' '' Mr. Weitz said.
 Mold likes to hide, which is one reason it makes such a stubborn adversary, whether it's toxic or just foul.
 ''People want to know, 'Do I have toxic mold or don't I?' '' Ms. Macdonald said. ''The issue is, does the mold produce mycotoxins? Mycotoxins are chemicals emitted by fungi.''
 Are mycotoxins dangerous to breathe? Despite a raft of court cases involving mold, nobody really knows.
 ''We have a lot to learn in this field,'' Ms. McDonald said. ''You can get sick from ingestion, but we're not so sure about inhalation.'' SUSAN STEWART

HEADLINE: What's Furry and Thirsty and Loves the Dark?

BYLINE: By SUSAN STEWART

 BODY:
IT'S spring: time to plant perennials, clean closets -- and call the microbial inspector. What does spring cleaning mean in the age of green? For many of us, it means fear. 
 Homeowners whose grandparents beat rugs and washed windows worry about more than dirt. So what if the baseboards are dusty? The lead in the paint could be lowering your toddler's future SAT scores. The air may be fragrant with the season's first blooms, but that doesn't make you safe from colorless, odorless gases like radon and carbon monoxide. And, by the way, you're sneezing. Is it a cold, or is it mold?
Household nightmares often capture the public imagination for a while and then fade away. Asbestos, lead and radon, riveting in the 1970s and 1980s, are still around, but they're old news. Mold, which started making headlines in the 1990s, is in. And with the recent flooding throughout the region, mold inspectors and remediators can barely handle the business. 
 ''People are really irritable right now,'' said Margaret Ann Furer, a contractor and mold mitigator in Katonah, N.Y. She was not referring to the hardest-hit victims of the recent northeaster and subsequent flooding; people who lose their homes to water have much more to worry about than mold. But mold is one of the most common and insidious aftereffects of even minor flooding, and when a wet spring season connects with a less than watertight house -- or when moisture is trapped in an airtight house made of mold-conducive materials -- it can make for a bumper crop.
 Mold is a furry, thirsty fungus. Outdoors, it earns its place in the ecosystem by breaking down wood, leaves and plant debris. Indoors, it breaks the hearts of homeowners, mostly by attacking their pocketbooks.
 ''Mold is the hot topic right now,'' said Robert Weitz, a certified microbial inspector and a principal in RTK Environmental Group, an environmental testing company in Connecticut.
 On a cloudy April day, Mr. Weitz is examining the entrance of Jay and Julia Bacal's multilevel contemporary house in northern Westchester County.
 ''This is Cladosporium mold,'' he says, pointing to grayish shadows near the front door. ''This is opportunistic, a dark area without much light. And this house is covered in a solid stain, and mold loves solid stain.''
 Loves? Mr. Weitz is creeping us out already, and we're not even inside the house. Is it . . . alive?
 ''Mold is not dead or alive,'' he says reassuringly. ''It is viable or nonviable.''
 But what if mold is merely dormant? That is another story. Mold feeds on organic materials and is brought to life by moisture. When a water source is removed but existing mold is left, according to Mr. Weitz, ''the spores, if you will, start to panic.''
 ''They go through the process of sporulation,'' he said. ''They throw themselves toward water sources.'' We feel like throwing ourselves back in the car, but instead we move indoors.
 The pale spring sun fills the high-ceilinged living room, illuminating the area where a trickle of water once made its way down the chimney wall. ''Water was leaking from a ceiling pipe in the lowest level of the house,'' Mr. Weitz says. ''They've already removed the carpet on that level and replaced it with tile.''
 WE head downstairs to a finished walk-out basement. At the foot of the steps, on the new tile, Mr. Weitz places a small white object atop a chest-high tripod. This is a monitoring device that can detect elevated levels of mold spores in the air, even in rooms where mold is not visible.
 Crouching, Mr. Weitz peers behind a heater against the back wall. ''There's a little bit of mold here,'' he says, in the calm, considered tone of a doctor reading the results of a blood test. ''All very typical.''
 Mr. Weitz spends two hours or so going through a residential property, checking for radon, asbestos, lead and, of course, mold. He takes baseline readings of air quality inside and out (some neighborhoods are naturally moldier than others). He charges $400 to $500, and a few hundred more for lab costs. But if you have a mold problem, that cost is only the beginning. Nightmare stories aside, a typical suburban remediation, according to several local remediators, runs from $2,000 to $4,000, though some reach $12,000.
 ''Mold is a health concern for a very limited population,'' said Charles Wiles, executive director of the American Indoor Air Quality Council, which certifies microbial inspectors like Mr. Weitz. ''However, mold is a financial issue for everyone, as it reduces the value of their assets.''
 Even if the mold in your house isn't causing discomfort to you, odds are that it will make potential buyers very queasy. Most mold isn't toxic to most people, but mold has had a toxic reputation since 1993, when a cluster of children in Cleveland suffered pulmonary hemorrhages linked, although inconclusively, to the presence of a mold called Stachybotrys in their homes.
 Then in 2001, a Texas jury awarded Melinda Ballard $32 million in a ''bad faith'' lawsuit against Farmers Insurance Group of Companies after mold was discovered throughout her 22-room house. (The award was lowered to $4 million two years later.)
 In 2003, Johnny Carson's former sidekick, Ed McMahon, and his wife, Pamela, were awarded $7.2 million from American Equity Insurance in a California court. Mold, the McMahons' lawsuit claimed, killed their sheepdog Muffin and caused health problems for them and their staff, forcing them to leave their six-bedroom home for six months.
 These and other cases helped to create a virtual industry around a fungus that has been among us forever.
 Five years ago, the air-quality council listed 1,000 certified microbial inspectors on its books. Today, there are 5,000. Is there more mold, or are we just more worried about it?
 Both, said Charles Bernzweig, owner of Spectrum, a remediation company in Scarsdale. 
 ''For one thing, houses are more tightly built, so moisture builds up,'' he said.
 Houses today are also made with materials like drywall that are mold-friendly and that are often left out in the rain and installed wet, Mr. Bernzweig said.
 In addition, he said, ''people want to be comfortable,'' so they put humidifiers in their heating systems. 
 ''It's a Catch-22,'' said Mary Lamielle, executive director of the National Center for Environmental and Health Strategies, a lobbying group for people with chemical sensitivities. ''You caulk your windows to save energy, and that leads to more toxin growth.''
 As a result of the environmental movement, recycling has also increased, which means that more and more organic materials are being used in construction. When damp, wallboard coated in recycled newspaper provides a delicious meal for mold, Mr. Weitz said.
 Thanks in no small part to the Ballard case and the attention it drew, mold-damage claims skyrocketed a few years ago. Insurers paid $1.4 billion in mold claims in 2001, and twice that the next year. The level of such payouts has not pleased the insurance industry, which has taken steps to limit coverage for mold damage.
 ''Mold has been around longer than humans,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, president and chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute. ''The entirety of our existence has been in the company of mold. Why had insurance adjusters never seen a mold claim before 2002? It wasn't because a new strain of mold had been unleashed upon the earth. It was the trial lawyers.''
 Most homeowners policies have caps for mold damage, but do cover water damage. ''It was never the intent of policies to cover mold,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''The vast majority of mold is failure to perform some kind of maintenance.''
 ''If a tree comes into your house and it takes a few weeks to repair the water damage, the mold resulting from that water damage would be covered,'' he said. ''But it has to be mold that happened just because of the water damage.''
 And the only way to prove that is to call your insurer quickly. ''It's incumbent on you as a homeowner to report damage as quickly as possible to the insurer,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''First, it helps to keep the damage from getting worse. Second, if you wait it becomes harder to see which damage was caused by the incident and which was not.''
 Mr. Hartwig was speaking from his son's Little League game in Elmsford where, he noted, the Saw Mill River had done some recent damage. He said this is the time to buy flood insurance, which is distinct from homeowner's insurance. ''Because it takes 30 days for a policy to go into effect,'' he explained, ''and most of the floods are from remnants of tropical storms. And we're coming up on tropical storm season.''
 Mr. Weitz makes his way slowly through the Bacals' house, from bottom to top. He notes a kitchen cabinet ''delaminated'' by a nail puncture in the dishwasher hose. He wields a digital moisture meter -- eerily reminiscent of the Geiger counters in old science fiction movies -- to see if a stain on the garage ceiling is a new leak or an old one.
 ''Every building shows a history,'' he says, ''and it's your job to find out if the history is ancient or recent.''
 Mr. Weitz started out as a contractor, but became absorbed in environmental issues. ''I've probably done 3,000 inspections,'' he says. His company, RTK, does not do remediation, just detection. Checking for mold and then charging to remove it would be a conflict of interest, he says.
 He developed his soothing manner out of necessity. ''We get some people who call who are literally in tears,'' he says. ''And that is really not the exception.''
 When Traci Ludwig, the owner, with her husband, Michael, of an 1884 house in Mamaroneck, called in the mold people a few years ago, she was only mildly hysterical.
 ''We had white and fuzzy mold, we had brown mottled mold, we had black mold,'' she said. ''It was a scientific study of mold.''
 It was all in the wine cellar -- the only room in the basement that had been redone by the previous owner.
 ''Sometime in the 1960s the previous owner had put in walls,'' Ms. Ludwig said. ''There were beautiful old wine casks and shelves.''
 There was also water, leaking from the terrace above and dampening the new plasterboard. 
 ''We moved in on Friday, the 13th of December, in 2002,'' Ms. Ludwig said. ''There was no mold smell. As the months got warmer, we were overcome by a very strong smell. The children were coughing. After some thinking we put it together and realized they and we were probably breathing in mold spores.''
 After testing, Ms. Ludwig called an environmental firm in Scarsdale. ''They put tarps in the yard, and men in white suits kept going in and out,'' she said.
 Today the mold is gone, and so is the wine cellar. ''It's just an empty room at the moment,'' Ms. Ludwig said. 
 In suburban Connecticut, the owner of a 10-year-old house with a 5,000-square-foot basement moved his 1,200-bottle wine collection to the garage when he found mold on the wallboard behind the basement paneling after some minor flooding. He estimated that he had spent more than $100,000 diagnosing and eradicating the mold problem and returning his basement to its original condition. But he's still not sure why he responded the way he did.
 ''I grew up on a farm, and mold was everywhere. I certainly didn't feel any side effects,'' he said. ''But the issue now is, if you're going to sell a house, you have to take care of these things. The industry has done a good job of marketing itself.''
 The homeowner spoke on condition of anonymity -- not a rare occurrence, in the murky world of mold.
 Gary Stone, a mold remediator whose company, Homeguard Environmental, operates out of Stamford, said he deals with privacy issues all the time. ''Last week a woman said, 'Do you have unmarked trucks? Because I saw a truck in front of my neighbor's house that said Toilet Doctor.' '' 
 You won't be seeing trucks with decorative spores painted on them anytime soon.
 ''It's hard,'' Mr. Weitz says. ''Mold is like a personal issue somehow. People don't want to share.''
 But Mr. Weitz loves to share. ''As much as a fungus can have a personality, I suppose mold does,'' he says. ''I'm fascinated by mold. I could bore you for hours with all things mold. My wife says, 'Bob, you're a lot of fun at a cocktail party.' ''
 NOW Mr. Weitz is in the yard of the Bacals' house, noting where shrubs are too close to the walls, where drainage away from the house is insufficient, where roof tiles are missing. With our mold consciousness raised, we notice some greenish scum around the deck. 
 ''Green is algae,'' Mr. Weitz says. ''Algae is O.K.''
 The Bacals learned the results of their testing within a week of Mr. Weitz's visit. Some spores found in the lower level were Stachybotrys, the scary mold. They're getting estimates from remediation companies. They're not terribly concerned.
 ''I did get down on my hands and knees, and I saw some black smutty stuff,'' said Mr. Bacal, who has been using an air filtration device he bought online to try to mitigate his acid reflux and sinus pain, symptoms he thinks could be environmental in origin. 
 Would he ever think of getting rid of his three cats?
 ''Oh, definitely I'm not getting rid of the cats,'' he said. ''They're family.''
 His doorbell rang.
 ''Oops, got to go,'' he said. ''That's the guys who're coming to take care of my mice.'' Getting to Know Mold 
 THERE are 800 to 1,000 identified molds, according to L. Claire Macdonald, laboratory manager at SanAir Technologies Laboratory, a microbial testing firm in Richmond, Va. ''When you actually see mold with the naked eye, it's just a bunch of spores stuck together,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Living Larger, and Drawing Fire

BYLINE: By DAN ZEGART

 BODY:
LIKE the many Eskimo words for snow, a multitude of nicknames exist for the oversize houses commonly referred to as McMansions, and they mirror the uneasiness over the spread of the homes.
 ''You hear them called starter castles, beltway baronials, mini Taj Mahals, but my favorite is parachute homes, because of the disregard for local styles -- like they were dropped from the sky,'' said Edward J. Trawinski, a lawyer and land-use expert from Morristown, N.J.
 Although the names may be amusing, many owners of smaller homes, especially in older communities dominated by more traditional architecture, find it anything but funny when one goes up in their neighborhood. With the proliferation of mammoth residences throughout the suburbs of New York City and beyond, some towns are trying to restrict the size and, sometimes, the look of new homes. 
 Mr. Trawinski has helped municipalities in northern New Jersey, including Wayne, Montclair and Bergenfield, write such laws, which commonly set maximums for height and square footage on a sliding scale that varies with the lot size. The laws may also dictate the slope of roofs and require side yards to be large enough so the new home does not loom over its neighbors.
 Such laws draw sharp dividing lines between some residents and builders. The debate is particularly fierce in towns like Westport, Conn., where builders say smallish lots and high land values make tearing down existing homes and replacing them, often with much larger houses, necessary to provide a reasonable profit. 
 ''I live with these regulations all the time, and they're so complicated and so hard to understand,'' said Rick Benson, a Westport resident and builder. ''And now they're not only getting more complicated, they're actually regulating taste.'' He estimated that he had six houses in various stages of completion; two of them were teardowns. All will be much bigger than those they replaced. 
 Mr. Benson said builders respond to market demands and contended that Westport's standards for size were arbitrary. ''I just did a 13,000-square-foot house on six to nine acres smack in the middle of town,'' he said. ''It's massive. It looks like a hotel in the Adirondacks. Not a peep about that one.''
 But the issue of large new houses is so contentious, said Gordon Joseloff, Westport's first selectman, that two previous efforts to pass a home-size ordinance in Westport were voted down. ''The attitude of a lot of people here is, 'You're messing with my nest egg,' '' he said.
 The Town of New Castle, N.Y., is grappling with a similar problem as it pushes ahead with a new law based on floor-area ratio that adjusts the allowable size of a house depending on the lot size. It is an approach sanctioned by courts in several states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and is based on what Mr. Trawinski called a recognition ''that it's not size per se but the perception of size.''
 ''A big house on a little postage stamp of land just looks terrible,'' he said.
 But the main goal of such ordinances is not to mandate smaller homes, but to preserve a community's ''streetscape'' by preventing houses that are so much larger than the prevailing architecture as to be jarring, said Virginia Kurshan, chairwoman of the Maplewood, N.J., Historic Preservation Commission. 
 At one extreme, she said, nearby Glen Ridge declared the entire borough a historic district, putting tight restrictions on any building allowed. Maplewood, she said, is considering a less drastic law that might apply to new construction and additions.
 Like Maplewood, New Castle has little undeveloped land left, said Frank Annunziata, the town engineer. ''Like a lot of towns that are almost completely built out, we're worried about older, maybe historic houses being knocked down and replaced with something that's inappropriate and much bigger,'' he said. Proposed zoning changes would permit a house of up to 10,391 square feet on four acres; quarter-acre lots would be capped at 4,100 square feet.
 Aesthetics are less of a factor in Sagaponack, near East Hampton, on Long Island, with its expanses of open acreage. Nevertheless, critics have little trouble finding examples for their cause in this newly created village, which is writing its first zoning ordinance. 
 There is the 66,000-square-foot mansion on 63 beachfront acres, for example, or the structure called ''the Great Wall of Sagaponack,'' a sprawling residence protected by a wall more than 100 feet long and 20 feet high. 
 ''We have generally large lots, most at least three acres, but there's still concern over really large houses,'' Mayor Bill Tillotson of Sagaponack said. ''They still stick out.'' 
 Builders argue that large-scale homes are an inevitable result of skyrocketing land values and changes in home-buying habits.
 ''You never used to have 9-, 10-foot ceilings with cathedral space,'' said Stuart R. Koenig, a lawyer and land-use consultant to the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, who estimates that half of New Jersey's towns have tried to regulate housing size. ''And once you do that, if you want to still have living area, you need a bigger building.''
 Mr. Benson, the Westport builder, also said that modern tastes dictate larger houses. ''Older houses have low ceilings and out-of-date kitchens,'' he said. ''People don't want to live in houses built in the '40s, '50s and '60s. So they tear them down.''
 Mr. Benson said he finds ordinances restricting large houses infuriating because they take aim at a problem that is disappearing on its own. ''We've had three years of an economic slowdown, and market conditions and energy costs are causing builders to build smaller houses,'' he said.
 As an example, he cited two houses he built on adjoining lots in Westport: one a 6,500-square-foot home on one and a half acres, which was purchased well before completion, the second a 9,600-square-foot residence on two acres, which took two years to sell. 
 ''I had to keep dropping the price,'' he said. ''It was just too big.''

HEADLINE: Tea Power: Giving the Poor A Window on the World

BYLINE: By JENNIFER V. HUGHES

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR 

 BODY:
ASK Wanja Michuki how she came to found the Highland Tea Company, which sells high-end tea from her native Kenya, and she mentions her childhood.
 As a girl, Ms. Michuki said, she spent school holidays with her father, a politician, as he campaigned in the countryside among tea farmers who produced some of the finest tea in the world -- Kenya is one of the world's largest exporters of black tea -- and yet lived in crushing poverty.
''That is what sparked my passion for economic development,'' she said. 
 That passion is reflected in a charitable program her company, which wholesales and retails tea out of her home in Montclair, has begun. Patrons of Ms. Michuki's business can pay for solar-powered hand-cranked radios that will be donated to sustenance tea farmers in Africa.
 Ms. Michuki, 32, sells kits that include her tea, a DVD on how to hold a proper high tea and information about the Freeplay Foundation, a nonprofit development and humanitarian group that provides the radios. Customers can sponsor the radios with a $65 donation to Freeplay.
 ''I want people to come together and enjoy each other's company, to enjoy my tea, but I also want them to think about the people who are responsible for that tea,'' she said. 
 The Kings Cooking Studio at the supermarket in Short Hills will conduct a tea tasting today at which patrons can pay for donated radios. Ms. Michuki has donated five radios and has persuaded others to donate about 50 more at afternoon tea events for social clubs and other groups. 
 The radios often provide the only communication with the outside world for sustenance farmers, said Michelle Riley, a senior consultant for the Freeplay Foundation, which has distributed 120,000 radios, mostly in Africa. The radios provide schooling for children, crop and weather information, and health and wellness programs.
 At a tea for the Women's Club of Glen Ridge in November, six radios were sponsored, said Anita Agarwal, a club trustee. ''People are aware of the need in other countries, and any chance they have to help out, they want to do it,'' she said. 
 During a visit to Kenya several months ago, Ms. Michuki took a Freeplay radio and turned it on for tea farmers in the field. While they worked with baskets on their backs, a program offered information on how to avoid H.I.V. infection. 
 ''That day was one of the best days of my life,'' she said. 
 Ms. Michuki said she began the radio program after she became frustrated that a fund to funnel proceeds from sale of her teas had not earned enough money to start a project for social, health or educational programs. 
 In Kenya, Ms. Michuki said, she grew up with Western-style comforts in Nairobi. She earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Bryn Mawr and an M.B.A. from Columbia. She went into investment banking, but ''there was no fulfillment for me,'' she said. 
 As a lark she drafted a business plan in 2002 to start a tea company, drawing from her childhood experiences and her family's investment, 40 acres for tea farming purchased in 1991. 
 With more research and investment from her family, she started her business in December 2003.
 Ms. Michuki created the six blends in her line of teas herself and chose a Kenyan artist's work to decorate the boxes. Her favorite tea is Sunshine Spice, which combines cardamom, cloves and cinnamon. 
 The teas are sold in more than 100 stores, including Whole Foods in the Mid-Atlantic and Zabar's and Fairway Market in New York City. Her tea is sold in several local markets and cafes, including Montclair's Terra Tea Salon and Fair Trade Eco-Market. 
 ''Her company really resonates with what we do,'' said Grace Grund, an owner of Terra Tea, whose store sells products from 40 countries. ''Using her company as a vehicle to help these tea farmers who really need a lot of help -- that's something we really support.''

HEADLINE: What's Furry and Thirsty and Loves the Dark?

BYLINE: By SUSAN STEWART

 BODY:
IT'S spring: time to plant perennials, clean closets -- and call the microbial inspector. What does spring cleaning mean in the age of green? For many of us, it means fear. 
 Homeowners whose grandparents beat rugs and washed windows worry about more than dirt. So what if the baseboards are dusty? The lead in the paint could be lowering your toddler's future SAT scores. The air may be fragrant with the season's first blooms, but that doesn't make you safe from colorless, odorless gases like radon and carbon monoxide. And, by the way, you're sneezing. Is it a cold, or is it mold?
Household nightmares often capture the public imagination for a while and then fade away. Asbestos, lead and radon, riveting in the 1970s and 1980s, are still around, but they're old news. Mold, which started making headlines in the 1990s, is in. And with the recent flooding throughout the region, mold inspectors and remediators can barely handle the business. 
 ''People are really irritable right now,'' said Margaret Ann Furer, a contractor and mold mitigator in Katonah, N.Y. She was not referring to the hardest-hit victims of the recent northeaster and subsequent flooding; people who lose their homes to water have much more to worry about than mold. But mold is one of the most common and insidious aftereffects of even minor flooding, and when a wet spring season connects with a less than watertight house -- or when moisture is trapped in an airtight house made of mold-conducive materials -- it can make for a bumper crop.
 Mold is a furry, thirsty fungus. Outdoors, it earns its place in the ecosystem by breaking down wood, leaves and plant debris. Indoors, it breaks the hearts of homeowners, mostly by attacking their pocketbooks.
 ''Mold is the hot topic right now,'' said Robert Weitz, a certified microbial inspector and a principal in RTK Environmental Group, an environmental testing company in Connecticut.
 On a cloudy April day, Mr. Weitz is examining the entrance of Jay and Julia Bacal's multilevel contemporary house in northern Westchester County.
 ''This is Cladosporium mold,'' he says, pointing to grayish shadows near the front door. ''This is opportunistic, a dark area without much light. And this house is covered in a solid stain, and mold loves solid stain.''
 Loves? Mr. Weitz is creeping us out already, and we're not even inside the house. Is it . . . alive?
 ''Mold is not dead or alive,'' he says reassuringly. ''It is viable or nonviable.''
 But what if mold is merely dormant? That is another story. Mold feeds on organic materials and is brought to life by moisture. When a water source is removed but existing mold is left, according to Mr. Weitz, ''the spores, if you will, start to panic.''
 ''They go through the process of sporulation,'' he said. ''They throw themselves toward water sources.'' We feel like throwing ourselves back in the car, but instead we move indoors.
 The pale spring sun fills the high-ceilinged living room, illuminating the area where a trickle of water once made its way down the chimney wall. ''Water was leaking from a ceiling pipe in the lowest level of the house,'' Mr. Weitz says. ''They've already removed the carpet on that level and replaced it with tile.''
 WE head downstairs to a finished walk-out basement. At the foot of the steps, on the new tile, Mr. Weitz places a small white object atop a chest-high tripod. This is a monitoring device that can detect elevated levels of mold spores in the air, even in rooms where mold is not visible.
 Crouching, Mr. Weitz peers behind a heater against the back wall. ''There's a little bit of mold here,'' he says, in the calm, considered tone of a doctor reading the results of a blood test. ''All very typical.''
 Mr. Weitz spends two hours or so going through a residential property, checking for radon, asbestos, lead and, of course, mold. He takes baseline readings of air quality inside and out (some neighborhoods are naturally moldier than others). He charges $400 to $500, and a few hundred more for lab costs. But if you have a mold problem, that cost is only the beginning. Nightmare stories aside, a typical suburban remediation, according to several local remediators, runs from $2,000 to $4,000, though some reach $12,000.
 ''Mold is a health concern for a very limited population,'' said Charles Wiles, executive director of the American Indoor Air Quality Council, which certifies microbial inspectors like Mr. Weitz. ''However, mold is a financial issue for everyone, as it reduces the value of their assets.''
 Even if the mold in your house isn't causing discomfort to you, odds are that it will make potential buyers very queasy. Most mold isn't toxic to most people, but mold has had a toxic reputation since 1993, when a cluster of children in Cleveland suffered pulmonary hemorrhages linked, although inconclusively, to the presence of a mold called Stachybotrys in their homes.
 Then in 2001, a Texas jury awarded Melinda Ballard $32 million in a ''bad faith'' lawsuit against Farmers Insurance Group of Companies after mold was discovered throughout her 22-room house. (The award was lowered to $4 million two years later.)
 In 2003, Johnny Carson's former sidekick, Ed McMahon, and his wife, Pamela, were awarded $7.2 million from American Equity Insurance in a California court. Mold, the McMahons' lawsuit claimed, killed their sheepdog Muffin and caused health problems for them and their staff, forcing them to leave their six-bedroom home for six months.
 These and other cases helped to create a virtual industry around a fungus that has been among us forever.
 Five years ago, the air-quality council listed 1,000 certified microbial inspectors on its books. Today, there are 5,000. Is there more mold, or are we just more worried about it?
 Both, said Charles Bernzweig, owner of Spectrum, a remediation company in Scarsdale. 
 ''For one thing, houses are more tightly built, so moisture builds up,'' he said.
 Houses today are also made with materials like drywall that are mold-friendly and that are often left out in the rain and installed wet, Mr. Bernzweig said.
 In addition, he said, ''people want to be comfortable,'' so they put humidifiers in their heating systems. 
 ''It's a Catch-22,'' said Mary Lamielle, executive director of the National Center for Environmental and Health Strategies, a lobbying group for people with chemical sensitivities. ''You caulk your windows to save energy, and that leads to more toxin growth.''
 As a result of the environmental movement, recycling has also increased, which means that more and more organic materials are being used in construction. When damp, wallboard coated in recycled newspaper provides a delicious meal for mold, Mr. Weitz said.
 Thanks in no small part to the Ballard case and the attention it drew, mold-damage claims skyrocketed a few years ago. Insurers paid $1.4 billion in mold claims in 2001, and twice that the next year. The level of such payouts has not pleased the insurance industry, which has taken steps to limit coverage for mold damage.
 ''Mold has been around longer than humans,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, president and chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute. ''The entirety of our existence has been in the company of mold. Why had insurance adjusters never seen a mold claim before 2002? It wasn't because a new strain of mold had been unleashed upon the earth. It was the trial lawyers.''
 Most homeowners policies have caps for mold damage, but do cover water damage. ''It was never the intent of policies to cover mold,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''The vast majority of mold is failure to perform some kind of maintenance.''
 ''If a tree comes into your house and it takes a few weeks to repair the water damage, the mold resulting from that water damage would be covered,'' he said. ''But it has to be mold that happened just because of the water damage.''
 And the only way to prove that is to call your insurer quickly. ''It's incumbent on you as a homeowner to report damage as quickly as possible to the insurer,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''First, it helps to keep the damage from getting worse. Second, if you wait it becomes harder to see which damage was caused by the incident and which was not.''
 Mr. Hartwig was speaking from his son's Little League game in Elmsford where, he noted, the Saw Mill River had done some recent damage. He said this is the time to buy flood insurance, which is distinct from homeowner's insurance. ''Because it takes 30 days for a policy to go into effect,'' he explained, ''and most of the floods are from remnants of tropical storms. And we're coming up on tropical storm season.''
 Mr. Weitz makes his way slowly through the Bacals' house, from bottom to top. He notes a kitchen cabinet ''delaminated'' by a nail puncture in the dishwasher hose. He wields a digital moisture meter -- eerily reminiscent of the Geiger counters in old science fiction movies -- to see if a stain on the garage ceiling is a new leak or an old one.
 ''Every building shows a history,'' he says, ''and it's your job to find out if the history is ancient or recent.''
 Mr. Weitz started out as a contractor, but became absorbed in environmental issues. ''I've probably done 3,000 inspections,'' he says. His company, RTK, does not do remediation, just detection. Checking for mold and then charging to remove it would be a conflict of interest, he says.
 He developed his soothing manner out of necessity. ''We get some people who call who are literally in tears,'' he says. ''And that is really not the exception.''
 When Traci Ludwig, the owner, with her husband, Michael, of an 1884 house in Mamaroneck, called in the mold people a few years ago, she was only mildly hysterical.
 ''We had white and fuzzy mold, we had brown mottled mold, we had black mold,'' she said. ''It was a scientific study of mold.''
 It was all in the wine cellar -- the only room in the basement that had been redone by the previous owner.
 ''Sometime in the 1960s the previous owner had put in walls,'' Ms. Ludwig said. ''There were beautiful old wine casks and shelves.''
 There was also water, leaking from the terrace above and dampening the new plasterboard. 
 ''We moved in on Friday, the 13th of December, in 2002,'' Ms. Ludwig said. ''There was no mold smell. As the months got warmer, we were overcome by a very strong smell. The children were coughing. After some thinking we put it together and realized they and we were probably breathing in mold spores.''
 After testing, Ms. Ludwig called an environmental firm in Scarsdale. ''They put tarps in the yard, and men in white suits kept going in and out,'' she said.
 Today the mold is gone, and so is the wine cellar. ''It's just an empty room at the moment,'' Ms. Ludwig said. 
 In suburban Connecticut, the owner of a 10-year-old house with a 5,000-square-foot basement moved his 1,200-bottle wine collection to the garage when he found mold on the wallboard behind the basement paneling after some minor flooding. He estimated that he had spent more than $100,000 diagnosing and eradicating the mold problem and returning his basement to its original condition. But he's still not sure why he responded the way he did.
 ''I grew up on a farm, and mold was everywhere. I certainly didn't feel any side effects,'' he said. ''But the issue now is, if you're going to sell a house, you have to take care of these things. The industry has done a good job of marketing itself.''
 The homeowner spoke on condition of anonymity -- not a rare occurrence, in the murky world of mold.
 Gary Stone, a mold remediator whose company, Homeguard Environmental, operates out of Stamford, said he deals with privacy issues all the time. ''Last week a woman said, 'Do you have unmarked trucks? Because I saw a truck in front of my neighbor's house that said Toilet Doctor.' '' 
 You won't be seeing trucks with decorative spores painted on them anytime soon.
 ''It's hard,'' Mr. Weitz says. ''Mold is like a personal issue somehow. People don't want to share.''
 But Mr. Weitz loves to share. ''As much as a fungus can have a personality, I suppose mold does,'' he says. ''I'm fascinated by mold. I could bore you for hours with all things mold. My wife says, 'Bob, you're a lot of fun at a cocktail party.' ''
 NOW Mr. Weitz is in the yard of the Bacals' house, noting where shrubs are too close to the walls, where drainage away from the house is insufficient, where roof tiles are missing. With our mold consciousness raised, we notice some greenish scum around the deck. 
 ''Green is algae,'' Mr. Weitz says. ''Algae is O.K.''
 The Bacals learned the results of their testing within a week of Mr. Weitz's visit. Some spores found in the lower level were Stachybotrys, the scary mold. They're getting estimates from remediation companies. They're not terribly concerned.
 ''I did get down on my hands and knees, and I saw some black smutty stuff,'' said Mr. Bacal, who has been using an air filtration device he bought online to try to mitigate his acid reflux and sinus pain, symptoms he thinks could be environmental in origin. 
 Would he ever think of getting rid of his three cats?
 ''Oh, definitely I'm not getting rid of the cats,'' he said. ''They're family.''
 His doorbell rang.
 ''Oops, got to go,'' he said. ''That's the guys who're coming to take care of my mice.'' Getting to Know Mold 
 THERE are 800 to 1,000 identified molds, according to L. Claire Macdonald, laboratory manager at SanAir Technologies Laboratory, a microbial testing firm in Richmond, Va. ''When you actually see mold with the naked eye, it's just a bunch of spores stuck together,'' she said. ''It's kind of known in the industry that you can't tell by looking at it what species a particular mold is.''
 Ms. Macdonald's laboratory analyzes the spores trapped in the air-monitoring devices used by microbial inspectors in the buildings they check for mold. The most common genuses of mold in homes are Aspergillus, Penicillium and Cladosporum, she said. Each also manifests in various species, as in Aspergillus parasiticus. Rarer but scarier is Stachybotrys, the mold that is often called ''toxic.''
 But toxic is as toxic does, according to Ms. Macdonald. While Stachybotrys has been associated with illness, its presence says something else to mold experts. ''Stachy is considered a water indicator mold,'' Ms. Macdonald said. ''It requires higher levels of water to grow, so if you see it there must be a water problem.''
 Ultimately, if you have water where water shouldn't be, as a result of a flood, a leak, a sewage backup or a fire, you may need a mold inspection. Other reasons to check for mold, according to Robert Weitz, a microbial inspector: dampness in the basement, an odd odor, especially on the lower levels of your house, or water that has stayed behind a wall or under a floor for more than 24 hours -- the time it takes a well-hydrated mold colony to sprout.
 Increasingly, prospective home buyers want mold checkups. ''You want to know, 'Am I buying somebody's mold problem which I'm not seeing?' '' Mr. Weitz said.
 Mold likes to hide, which is one reason it makes such a stubborn adversary, whether it's toxic or just foul.
 ''People want to know, 'Do I have toxic mold or don't I?' '' Ms. Macdonald said. ''The issue is, does the mold produce mycotoxins? Mycotoxins are chemicals emitted by fungi.''
 Are mycotoxins dangerous to breathe? Despite a raft of court cases involving mold, nobody really knows.
 ''We have a lot to learn in this field,'' Ms. McDonald said. ''You can get sick from ingestion, but we're not so sure about inhalation.'' SUSAN STEWART

HEADLINE: Resume Of Doom

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
Paul Wolfowitz may be out of a job soon, but think of what an amazing resume he'll be shopping around:
 Work Experience
 President of World Bank: 2005-2007
Responsibilities: Reining in European lefties, raining tax-free money on Arab girlfriend, and giving anti-corruption efforts a bad name.
 Achievements: Paralyzed the international lending apparatus to the point where small countries had to max out their Visa cards to pay for malaria medicine. Learned the traditions of many cultures, including those of Turkey, where you apparently are not supposed to take off your shoes at mosques to reveal socks so full of holes that both big toes poke blasphemously through. 
 Deputy Secretary of Defense for President George W. Bush: 2001-2005
 Responsibility: Starting a war.
 Achievements: Mismanaged the world's most powerful army. Shattered the system of international diplomacy that kept the peace for 50 years. Undermined the credibility of American intelligence operations. Needlessly brought humankind to the brink of nuclear war. Destroyed Iraq.
 Demented Visionary: 1993-2001
 Responsibility: Concocting a delusional plan for regime change in Iraq with pals like Shaha Riza, Ahmad Chalabi and his merry band of Iraqi exiles who conjured up phony intelligence about Saddam's W.M.D.
 Achievements: Imagining an Iraq that didn't exist.
 Having Wolfie back on the job market is a tremendous opportunity. What do we want destroyed next? Could this walking curse on the world run Halliburton into the ground?
 At the Pentagon, Wolfie tried to help Vice get rid of anything multi -- multilateral treaties, multilateral institutions, multilateral alliances, multiculturalism. Multi, to them, meant wobbly, caviling, bureaucratic and obstructionist. Why be multi when you could be uni? 
 In the end, the forces of multilateralism took their revenge: Old Europe got rid of Wolfie.
 But not before his gal pal played the multicultural victim card. In her statement to World Bank directors, Shaha complained that she had been denied promotions even before Wolfie got there. ''I can only attribute this to discrimination -- not because I am a woman, but because I am a Muslim Arab woman who dares to question the status quo both in the work of the institution and within the institution itself,'' Shaha wrote.
 She said that she had ''met a wonderful American woman who told me that I should fight back for 'us': WOMEN. It never occurred to me as an Arab and Muslim woman that one day I would be asked by an American woman to fight on her behalf.''
 Already aggrieved, Shaha got really furious when Wolfie came in 2005 and she was told she'd have to work out of the State Department.
 ''I was ready to pursue legal remedies,'' she wrote in her statement, adding, ''my life and career were torn asunder.''
 According to Xavier Coll, the bank's human resources vice president, Shaha outlined conditions for her departure that were ''unprecedented'' in terms of guarantees and rewards and way out of line with bank policy. Mr. Coll deemed it ''inappropriate and imprudent for the president to offer Ms. Riza these terms.'' 
 Bob Bennett, Wolfie's lawyer, told Michael Hirsh of Newsweek that it was Shaha who ''worked up the numbers'' on a $60,000 raise to a $193,590 salary and cushy new deal. ''She was outraged that she had to leave,'' Mr. Bennett said.
 The self-righteous Shaha played on Wolfie's guilt, becoming ''greedy in terms of power,'' as a friend of the couple told Newsweek. Even though she had been a mere flack a few years ago and then a gender coordinator at the bank, Shaha mau-maued her man into giving her a salary that topped the secretary of state's.
 It's like when Bill Clinton tells friends that he has to work hard to get Hillary elected president because he feels he owes her for bringing her to Arkansas in the 70s and interrupting her career. (But do we?)
 Or when Tony Soprano gets Carmela some fancy piece of jewelry after he strays. Indeed, Wolfie sounded Sopranoish when he agitatedly told Mr. Coll to warn those at the bank he believed were attacking him: ''If they #! with me or Shaha, I have enough on them to #! them, too.''
 Wolfie used public compensation for private contrition. Gilt for guilt -- not a good deal.

HEADLINE: Welcome Back, Starshine

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
THE Summer of Love, by most accounts, began on Jan. 14, 1967, with a gathering known as the Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, and ended on Oct. 6, with the Death of Hippie march, a mock funeral staged in Haight-Ashbury to tell aspiring flower children to stay home. 
 Forty years later the children are at it again, only older and more institutional this time. The Whitney Museum of American Art is noting the anniversary with ''Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,'' opening Thursday. The Public Theater, which formed that summer with ''Hair,'' is staging a hippie-friendly season of Shakespeare in the Park, with ''Romeo and Juliet'' and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' as well as a concert performance of ''Hair'' in September. Jefferson Starship, Quicksilver Messenger Service and other bands will renew the faith in July at the Monterey County Fairgrounds, where their younger selves performed at the 1967 Monterey International Pop Festival. 
But the wild cards are in places like Zieglersville, Pa., where a three-day Session Summer of Love beer celebration will feature a mini-firkin fest; or at the Palms Casino and Hotel in Las Vegas, where the Rain nightclub will hold a three-night rave event called Summer of Love, the Love-In, billed as an ''all-out sensory assault.'' If just thinking about these events leaves you tired, you can head to Starbucks for a 40th anniversary Monterey Pop CD set. (And if, like the squares of old, you need help with the lingo, a firkin is one sixth of a hogshead.)
 The flowers may have faded, and rents in the Haight may have gone through the roof, but the Summer of Love brand continues to extend. Instead of aging gracefully into kitsch, it has solidified into canon. 
 ''Why are we fascinated now?'' asked Jann Wenner, 61, the editor and publisher of Rolling Stone, which will publish a Summer of Love double issue in June. ''It's our youth for a great number of people, especially those of us who now control things.''
 In recent political campaigns, claim on the era's legacy has swung largely to conservative debunkers, who hold up the Summer of Love as an exercise in liberal self-absorption and a touchstone of moral decline. Now, with the nation again in an unpopular war, utopian voices are coming out again, softer in their politics but no less determined in their exceptionalism. 
 ''Much about that summer, looking back, seems incredibly foolish and narcissistic and grandiose,'' said Oskar Eustis, 48, the artistic director of the Public Theater who was 9 in 1967 and whose parents took him to a demonstration at which protesters tried to levitate the Pentagon. ''But it's not crazy to remember that we stopped the war, and we did.'' 
 In contrast to the first time around, this summer's activities will be spectator events, not participatory ones, replaying the Summer of Love as something you watch, not something you do. There will be comfortable seating and refreshments. And though there will likely be references to the current war, the art will still be fighting the last one, reflecting the songs and sensibilities not of the Iraq grunts' generation but of their parents'.
 Which raises some questions: Is it possible to extract the Summer of Love from the distorting filter of narcissism? Or is that narcissism the essence of the brand, as revisionists and advertisers would have it? Economists use the term ''survivorship bias'' to describe the recollection of past moments by what has survived into the present, filtering out whatever elements did not bear fruit. For the Summer of Love what has survived is the music and industry it created, the fascination with youth culture, the now generic images of gentle hippies and a swirl of pretty colors that has found its home in the language of advertising. Some of the less institutional elements, like the Haight's Free Store, voluntary sweep-ins, free food-ins, the free health clinic and the Death of Hippie, have receded from the narrative. 
 Without these the Summer of Love has survived as a simple story: For a magical few months tens of thousands of young people left home for San Francisco, where they gave the nation new sounds, new pleasures and new styles. In went adolescent idealism and creative energy; out came a lifetime of ads for cars, Pepsi and retirement plans. 
 This story has endured so tenaciously because it played out in the media in real time, with a level of stage management that was as forward-looking as the music. To ''drop out'' in 1967, as Timothy Leary urged the crowd at the Human Be-In, meant to emerge from obscurity and drop in -- into a media spectacle that fascinated the country and a media economy that would replace manufacturing as the heartbeat of America. 
 From the start the season had an official governing body, the Council for the Summer of Love; a hit theme song, Scott McKenzie's ''San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)'', written and produced by the organizers of the Monterey festival; and a television deal, when a young ABC executive named Barry Diller bought the rights to Monterey for a never-realized Movie of the Week. The council came up with the name Summer of Love to put a positive spin on events that were often portrayed negatively in the press. Almost as soon as the hippies hit Golden Gate Park, sightseeing companies offered guided bus tours of the Haight, providing tourists a look at the hairy new wrinkle in humanity. As a 1967 manifesto from the Death of Hippie proclaimed, ''Media created the hippie with your hungry consent.'' 
 In this year's Summer of Love it will be clear who are the performers and who the spectators, where art ends and life begins. Even if you sing along to ''Good Morning Starshine'' or crash on the sidewalk outside the Whitney, you're still there to honor someone else's show. It ends when you walk out the door. If the first Summer of Love was about the shared exploration of possibility, conducted in the public eye, the anniversary demonstrates the accrued authority of the institutions that make this watching possible. 
 These institutions have not always served the art, said Christoph Grunenberg, curator of the Whitney's ''Summer of Love'' exhibition for the Tate Liverpool gallery, where it began in 2005. Instead, he said, they've enabled ''a rather superficial consumption of a retro aesthetic, which doesn't take into consideration the motives behind it, the desire for liberation.
 ''The utopian impulse of the period is missing,'' he said.
 The exhibition includes underground magazines, psychedelic light shows, album covers and posters and films of concerts, as well as paintings and sculptures from the '60s and early '70s. It's ''the first serious art-historical evaluation, as opposed to something that has been looked at as quote unquote just popular culture,'' said Henriette Huldisch, the assistant curator in charge of installing the exhibition.
 Mr. Grunenberg, 44, said the art has been ''a victim of its own success at the time and tainted by its association to drug culture, music culture, fashion and design. 
 ''It was unusual in that it aspired to the level of mass culture,'' he added, ''and that's the cause of the suspicion that comes to psychedelic art. Can the light shows at a Jimi Hendrix show be art?'' 
 Yet there were other narratives within the Summer of Love. Once the masses started to arrive in the Haight, some pioneers left the city for greener pastures. By late summer LSD gave way to speed and utopian seekers to ill-prepared teenage runaways, children who could not take care of themselves. ''Most people see the Summer of Love in very happy terms,'' said Brad Abramson, vice president of production and programming for VH1 and an executive producer of the channel's ''Monterey 40,'' a documentary about the 1967 pop festival that will be broadcast beginning June 16. ''One thing that struck me was finding out what a mess it turns out to be. By the end of the summer speed freaks were catching and eating cats.'' 
 Mr. Wenner, who started Rolling Stone in San Francisco that fall, sees this narrative as a sideshow to the essence of the Summer of Love. For him the survivorship bias has allowed the substantive elements of the day to emerge from the confusion and hype. ''I was skeptical of this invasion of the Haight-Ashbury, wear-flowers-in-your-hair stuff,'' he said. ''The grungy, sleeping-on-the-floor-in-a-sleeping-bag lifestyle was not for me. The drugs were, and the music was, and the peace and love was. But the grungy lifestyle, which was very limited to kids coming in from out of town, was not for me.''
 The sunnier side will be on display at this year's Monterey Summer of Love Festival, where tribute bands, dressed up like Jimi Hendrix or the Byrds, will share the stage with some performers from the original festival, a three-day charity concert that included Hendrix, Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead and others. Concertgoers this year will get Big Brother and the Holding Company without Joplin, and Carlton Poward performing as Hendrix: proof that nostalgia can conquer even death. But the commercial and canonical imperatives will be familiar. 
 A goal for the first Monterey festival was to prove that rock music was ''an art form in the same way jazz was,'' said the record producer Lou Adler, 73, one of the organizers. ''It was still looked on as a trend, two and a half minutes and you're out. So the idea was to do a festival in the same place that there was a jazz festival and a folk festival; that seemed to validate it.''
 But from the start there was distrust between the organizers, who came from the Los Angeles music business, and the more underground groups, said Michelle Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas, who helped organize the event. ''There definitely was that feeling from the San Francisco musicians that the Los Angeles groups were the commercial groups, and they were the real heart and soul,'' she said. ''I think they were just jealous because we were making the money. The whole point, I thought, was to make hit records.''
 In the end of course both sides won: the industry because it sold the ethos of the underground and the hip bands through the growth of the business. The '60s culture blossomed not at the expense of its commercial tendencies but through them. The branding of the Summer of Love is not a corruption of the original moment but an impulse that was there all along.
 Like any brand, Summer of Love nostalgia champions its own brandedness, or exceptionalism, separating itself to an exaggerated extent from what came before or after. In this separation the past is seen as a purer image of the present, shorn of vulgarity and invested with possibility. The past points to a more utopian future than the one it actually became. 
 Mr. Eustis of the Public Theater said he hoped to invoke the utopianism of 1967 without simply playing to nostalgia that runs on the desire to forget, not to remember. ''Nostalgia is a corrupting emotion,'' he said. ''You're imagining a lack of contradiction in the past. You're imagining something that wasn't true. It's a longing to be a child again, to have magical thinking about the world.''
 But he added that nostalgia could also have a ''progressive aspect'' that pushes people to think forward rather than back, to ''remember that you can imagine a world that is different, where money didn't determine value, where competition wasn't the nature of human relations.
 ''That imagination can be powerful,'' he continued. ''The dream is real. The negative aspect of nostalgia is when we want that feeling that everything is possible, but we don't want to do anything about it. That's just narcissistic. That's longing to feel important again. Baby boomers are very good at that.'' 
 For Michael Hirschorn, 43, executive vice president for original programming and production at VH1, which has built a business on the synthesis of youth culture and branding, the first order of business is to recover the music from the trappings. The channel's Monterey documentary, he promised, will be about that music, not peace and love. ''The '60s always felt hokey and lame to me, so smug and self-important,'' he said. ''Seeing this footage now, maybe the '60s and the Summer of Love can be reclaimed from its own advocates.'' 
 In the meantime issues of the underground magazine Oracle will be in the Whitney, and Quicksilver Messenger Service will be back at Monterey. And of course mini-firkins will be in Zieglersville. But this year's pilgrims will find less reassessment, in the sense of discovering something new, than the impossible promise of recapturing the old. 
 And with luck they will find some good music and art, along with more kitsch than anyone seems to want to acknowledge. To celebrate that, there's Stanley Donen's 1967 classic ''Bedazzled,'' with Dudley Moore and Peter Cook. It's newly out on DVD, and it's a trip.

HEADLINE: The Road to Curitiba

 BODY:
3. On Saturday mornings, children gather to paint and draw in the main downtown shopping street of Curitiba, in southern Brazil. More than just a charming tradition, the child's play commemorates a key victory in a hard-fought, ongoing war. Back in 1972, the new mayor of the city, an architect and urban planner named Jaime Lerner, ordered a lightning transformation of six blocks of the street into a pedestrian zone. The change was recommended in a master plan for the city that was approved six years earlier, but fierce objections from the downtown merchants blocked its implementation. Lerner instructed his secretary of public works to institute the change quickly and asked how long it would take. 
''He said he needed four months,'' Lerner recalled recently. ''I said, 'Forty-eight hours.' He said, 'You're crazy.' I said, 'Yes, I'm crazy, but do it in 48 hours.' '' The municipal authorities were able to accomplish it in three days, beginning on a Friday night and installing paving, lighting, planters and furniture by the end of the day on Monday. ''Being a very weak mayor, if I start to do it and take too long, everyone could stop it through a juridical demand,'' Lerner went on to explain. ''If they stop the work, it's finished. I had to do it very fast, at least in part. Because we had discussed it a great deal. Sometimes they have to have a demonstration effect.''
The demonstration worked. Within days, impressed by the increase in their business, the once-recalcitrant shop owners were demanding an extension of the traffic-free district. Some diehard motorists, however, sulked. Lerner heard that a group of them were planning to disregard the prohibition and drive their cars into the street on a Saturday morning. So he contrived an unbreachable defense. With the cooperation of the city's teachers and a donation of rolls of newsprint and boxes of paint, on that morning he assembled several hundred children in the street, where they sat and drew pictures. ''It was to say, 'This is being done for children and their parents -- don't even think of putting cars there,' '' he told me. The sputtered-out protest was the last resistance to the pedestrianization of the shopping area, which has since expanded from the original 6 blocks to encompass about 15 today. ''Of course, this was very emblematic,'' Lerner recounted. ''We were trying to say, 'This city is not for cars.' When many mayors at the time were planning for individual cars, we were countervailing.'' He observed that it was emblematic in another way also: ''From that point, they said, 'If he could do this in 72 hours, he can do anything.' It was a good strategy.''
 An opening salvo, the creation of the pedestrian zone inaugurated a series of programs by Lerner and his colleagues that made Curitiba a famous model of late-20th-century urban planning. In the early 1970s, when Brazil was welcoming any industry, no matter how toxic its byproducts, Curitiba decided to admit only nonpolluters; to accommodate them, it constructed an industrial district that reserved so much land for green space that it was derided as a ''golf course'' until it succeeded in filling up with major businesses while its counterparts in other Latin American cities were flagging. Through the creation of two dozen recreational parks, many with lakes to catch runoff in low-lying areas that flood periodically, Curitiba managed, at a time of explosive population growth, to increase its green areas from 5 square feet per inhabitant to an astounding 560 square feet. The city promoted ''green'' policies before they were fashionable and called itself ''the ecological capital of Brazil'' in the 1980s, when there were no rivals for such a title. Today, Curitiba remains a pilgrimage destination for urbanists fascinated by its bus system, garbage-recycling program and network of parks. It is the answer to what might otherwise be a hypothetical question: How would cities look if urban planners, not politicians, took control?
 Although the children who paint on Saturday mornings are no longer needed to protect the downtown shopping street from cars, the battle to keep Curitiba green is never-ending. Indeed, some say it is going badly these days. The rivers, once crystalline, reek of untreated sewage. The bus system that has won admirers throughout the world appears to be nearing capacity; what's more, Curitiba, by some measures, has a higher per capita ownership of private cars than any city in Brazil -- even exceeding BrasAlia, a city that was designed for cars. Curitiba's garbage-recycling rate has been declining over the last six or seven years, and the only landfill in the municipal region will be full by the end of 2008. Jorge Wilheim, the Sao Paulo architect who drafted Curitiba's master plan in 1965, says: ''When we made the plan, the population was 350,000. We thought in a few years it would reach 500,000. But it has grown much bigger.'' The municipality of Curitiba today has 1.8 million people, and the population of the metropolitan region is 3.2 million. ''I know the plan of Curitiba is very famous, and I am the first to enjoy it, but that was in '65,'' Wilheim continues. ''The metropolitan region must have a new vision.''
 It is often said of Curitiba that it doesn't feel like Brazil. Depending on who's speaking, that can be intended as a compliment or a criticism. Populated by European immigrants in the 19th century, Curitiba has a demographic makeup that is largely more fair-skinned and well educated than that of Brazil's tropical north. It is also unusually affluent. Unlike Sao Paulo, with its startling extremes of wealth and poverty, much of Curitiba to an American eye looks familiarly middle class. Even the scruffy used-car lots have a seediness reminiscent of Los Angeles, not the Rio de Janeiro of ''City of God.'' The city, especially the large downtown, is very clean, thanks to municipal sanitation trucks and the freelance carrinheiros, or cart people, who pick up trash to sell at recycling centers.
 During my visit to Curitiba in March, the city was the host of an international biodiversity conference. While I hadn't known of it when I scheduled my trip, the coincidence was about as remarkable as finding a design show to greet you in Milan or a wine festival under way in Bordeaux. Environmentalism is the heart of Curitiba's self-identity, and the municipal government is always devising new schemes that showcase the brand. The rest of the world has caught on, if not yet caught up. Ecological awareness is architecturally trendy. This year's winner of the prestigious Pritzker Prize is Richard Rogers, a longtime proponent of mass transit, lower energy consumption and ecologically sensitive buildings. Commercially, real-estate developers from Beijing to Santa Monica are brandishing their LEED certificates (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) as they market condominiums and office suites to green-minded consumers. While it is unusually ambitious, the 25-year plan that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed last month for New York is part of an international wave of recognition that cities must live more responsibly, especially when it comes to their effusions of climate-warming gases and their excretions of mountains of solid waste. Bloomberg's most contentious idea -- a ''congestion tax'' on cars entering traffic-clogged districts during peak hours -- has been working for more than four years in London (and more than 30 years in Singapore) to increase the numbers of people using public transportation. Interestingly, Curitiba adopted an opposite approach, brandishing a carrot instead of a stick. The city planners suspected that public transportation would attract more users if it was more attractive. And that reasonable assumption turned out to be correct.
 The efficient buses that zip across the Curitiba metropolitan region are the most conspicuously un-Brazilian feature of the city. Instead of descending into subway stations, Curitibanos file into ribbed glass tubes that are boarding platforms for the rapid-transit buses. (The glass tubes resemble the ''fosteritos'' that Norman Foster later designed for the metro in Bilbao, Spain.) Curitiba has five express-bus avenues, with a sixth in development, to allow you to traverse the city with speedy dispatch. In the early 1970s, most cities investing in public transportation were building subways or light-rail networks. Curitiba lacked the resources and the time to install a train system. Lerner says that compared with the Curitiba bus network, a light rail system would have required 20 times the financial investment; a subway would have cost 100 times as much. ''We tried to understand, what is a subway?'' he recalls. ''It has to have speed, comfort, reliability and good frequency. But why does it have to be underground? Underground is very expensive. With dedicated lanes and not stopping on every corner, we could do it with buses.'' Because widening the avenues would have required a lengthy and costly expropriation process, the planners came up with a ''trinary'' system that embraced three parallel thoroughfares: a large central avenue dedicated to two-way rapid-bus traffic (flanked by slow lanes for cars making short local trips) and, a block over on each side, an avenue for fast one-way automobile traffic.
 When the bus system was inaugurated, it transported 54,000 passengers daily. That number has ballooned to 2.3 million, in large part because of innovations that permit passengers to board and exit rapidly. In 1992, Lerner and his team established the tubular boarding platforms with fare clerks and turnstiles, so that the mechanisms for paying and boarding are separated, as in a subway. To carry more people at a time, the city introduced flexible-hinged articulated buses that open their doors wide for rapid entry and egress; then, when the buses couldn't cope with the demand, the Lerner team called for bi-articulated buses of 88 feet with two hinges (and a 270-passenger capacity), which Volvo manufactured at Curitiba's request. Comparing the capacities of bus and subway systems, Lerner reels off numbers with a promoter's panache. ''A normal bus in a normal street conducts x passengers a day,'' he told me. ''With a dedicated lane, it can transport 2x a day. If you have an articulated bus in a dedicated lane, 2.7x passengers. If you add a boarding tube, you can achieve 3.4x passengers, and if you add double articulated buses, you can have four times as many passengers as a normal bus in a normal street.'' He says that with an arrival frequency of 30 seconds, you can transport 36,000 passengers every hour -- which is about the same load he would have achieved with a subway. 
 Unfortunately, the trends of bus usage are down. While the system has expanded to cover 13 of the cities in the metropolitan region, charging a flat fare that in practice subsidizes the trips of the mostly poorer workers who live in outlying areas, bus ridership within the Curitiba municipality has been declining. ''We are losing bus passengers and gaining cars,'' says Luis Fragomeni, a Curitiba urban planner. He observes that, like potential users of public transport everywhere, many Curitibanos view it as noisy, crowded and unsafe. Undermining the thinking behind the master plan, even those who live alongside the high-density rapid-bus corridors are buying cars. ''The licensing of cars in Curitiba is 2.5 times higher than babies being born in Curitiba,'' he says. ''Trouble.'' Because cars are status symbols, attempts to discourage people from buying them are probably futile. ''We say, 'Have your own car, but keep it in the garage and use it only on weekends,' '' Fragomeni remarks. And the public-transport system must be upgraded continuously to remain an appealing alternative to private vehicles. ''That competition is very hard,'' says Paulo Schmidt, the president of URBS, the rapid-bus system. During peak hours, buses on the main routes are already arriving at almost 30-second intervals; any more buses, and they would back up. While acknowledging his iconoclasm in questioning the sufficiency of Curitiba's trademark bus network, Schmidt nevertheless says a light-rail system is needed to complement it.
 When it comes to modifying human behavior, persuading urban dwellers to sort their garbage can be harder than coaxing them to garage their cars. Lerner and his allies have claimed that they have succeeded beyond the dreams of environmentalists in far more eco-friendly countries, including Japan and Sweden. Curitiba was a pioneer in separating recyclable materials, with its ''Garbage That Is Not Garbage'' program, inaugurated in 1989. (The city leaders have a flair for slogans.) Recycling has assumed a new urgency, because the entire metropolitan area contains only one landfill, and it will be exhausted by the end of next year. Jose Antonio Andreguetto, Curitiba's secretary for the environment, told me that 22 percent of the city's garbage is being separated for recycling, a rate that has been declining over the last half-dozen years; he says he hopes to bring the number up to 34 percent by the end of the current mayor's term in 2008. Lerner says the numbers have been eroding until recently because some recent mayors haven't emphasized the issue, but he maintains that the recycling rate in Curitiba is still the highest in the world.
 It is very hard to determine how accurate the estimates are for garbage separation. ''Curitiba began early to look at recycling garbage -- that is true, and it is good,'' says Teresa Urban, a local journalist and environmental activist. ''But the separation of recycled garbage is a little part of all the garbage we have here. There is no tradition of participation here. The mayor sold to the people the idea that this is a wonderful city. And the people think, This is wonderful, I don't have to do anything.''
 Like other left-wing critics, Urban traces the lack of participation to an original sin. The progressive urban planning of Curitiba was not initiated by a democratic process; it was set in motion by the military dictatorship that seized power in 1964 and ruled Brazil until the mid-'80s. Its environmentalism is rooted in authoritarianism. ''They didn't have to confront the public through public participation, and the decisions could be made by urban planners -- architects acting as politicians,'' says Clara IrazAbal, who has written a book comparing the urban planning experiences of Curitiba and Portland, Ore. The city that has been called the most forward-looking in the Western Hemisphere is an outgrowth of an era that many Brazilians prefer not to look back on. Jaime Lerner, the archangel of the Curitiba green movement, was anointed by the dragons of war.
 Always an anomaly, Curitiba became a model for our day by defying the spirit of the time. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, urban developers throughout the world, influenced by Le Corbusier and his followers, were remodeling cities to facilitate the easy circulation of people in automobiles. But in Curitiba, an informal group of young architects, urban planners and civil engineers at the city's Federal University of ParanA, which is the oldest university in Brazil, objected more effectively to the mayor's widening of streets and a proposed highway bypass that threatened the historic city center. As luck would have it, one of these outraged civil engineers, Fanchette Rischbieter, was married to the chairman of the government-controlled investment company that was financing the construction of roads in ParanA, the largely agricultural state of which Curitiba is the capital. ''I said, 'It doesn't make sense, my wife and her friends are against these people -- why don't we make a plan?' '' Karlos Rischbieter recalls. Selected by the city, Jorge Wilheim came up with a master plan that concentrated high-density construction along two long rapid-transit axes that skirted the center. At least as important as his transportation and zoning recommendations was Wilheim's request for an urban-planning institute to implement them. In retrospect, the enthusiastic and talented staff of the Institute of Urban Research and Planning of Curitiba, which is known by its Portuguese acronym, Ippuc, ensured the success of Curitiba's redevelopment. 
 Still, there was a lag of five years from the formal adoption of the master plan in 1966 until its implementation, which began with the governor's selection of Lerner, who was president of Ippuc, to be mayor in 1971. Wilheim the planner needed Lerner the doer to turn abstract ideas into inventive reality. Curitiba has been studied more than copied (one notable exception is a Curitiba-style bus system in BogotA, Colombia) because unlike Lerner, most mayors stumble over political obstacles. ''I always tell a story of the '80s,'' Rischbieter says. ''A friend from Sao Paulo came with his wife and son to visit Curitiba. He did not know this city. I took my car and showed him Curitiba for three hours. When I left him at the hotel, he said, 'What did you show people before Jaime Lerner?' ''
 A spark plug of ideas, Lerner, the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland, combines salesmanship and pragmatism. Following his mayoral terms, he won election twice as governor of ParanA State, retiring in 2002 at the age of 65 to devote himself to his architecture firm and to worldwide speaking engagements espousing green urban planning. He has a large head that seems to rest directly on wide shoulders; knowing his passion for recycling, you might almost believe that his thick-set body has been through a compactor. He radiates a highly compressed and infectious energy, with a can-do assertiveness that borders on arrogance. ''He never asked if something was good or not,'' Rischbieter remarks. ''He would say, 'I'll go do it.' I would say, 'You have to go ask people and get their opinions.' He would say, 'No, they won't agree with me, and it has to be done.' He is not a political animal, he is a dictator.'' Rischbieter admires Lerner; others, however, using the same descriptive terminology, do not. In the rough-and-tumble of Brazilian politics, it has become customary for supporters of populist parties to disparage Lerner (who personifies his talented team to allies and foes alike) as a creature of the dictatorship. According to this argument, the generals detested politicians; they admired technical experts. In Curitiba, they found a showplace to display their accomplishments to the world. ''The military are addicted to planning,'' says Fragomeni, who has an ambivalent attitude toward Lerner. ''If they don't plan, they don't go forward. They invested in Curitiba. Mr. Lerner may like it or not. His continuity was ensured by the military government.'' For his part, Lerner says that he had a far harder time with the military dictatorship than he did later, as an elected official. Under the military regime, he served at the pleasure of the governor and the state assembly. ''I could be fired the next day,'' he says. ''Being an elected mayor, I was stronger. Nobody could fire me.''
 In two terms (1971-75 and 1979-83) under the military regime, and then in an elected third term (1989-92) after the restoration of democracy, Lerner translated the master plan into concrete and leafy reality. Like an impatient muralist, he worked on a wide scope at high speed. ''I know cities that plant 10,000 trees, and they make a whole festival,'' he told me. ''We planted a million trees. I am obsessed with scale.'' He sought to make a livable city; over time that segued smoothly into an ecological city. Parks initially intended as recreational areas would also absorb floodwaters and extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Lerner used tax breaks to wheedle landowners into turning over portions of their property, which typically had little value at the time. In the rocky northern district, he converted one flooded quarry into the Wire Opera House, which has become a city icon, and another into the Free University of the Environment, a non-degree-granting institution that educates people on ecological issues. He transformed land that was serving as a refuse dump into a botanical garden; named for Fanchette Rischbieter, who died in 1989, it features a duck pond, French parterres and a classic Victorian greenhouse. The architecture in all three of these parks is less noteworthy for its formal design than for its building materials -- salvaged telephone poles, mesh grating, metal tubing -- and the speed of construction. From blueprint drafts to opening night, the Wire Opera House took about two months to complete. Lerner refers to such projects as ''urban acupuncture'' that energizes the development process.
 When I would ask people if they thought Lerner could have accomplished his reforms under a democracy, people sympathetic to both Lerner and the military (like Rischbieter) or critical of both (like Urban) would say no; but most, professing admiration for Lerner but distaste for the military, said the dictatorship was not a precondition for his success. Lerner and Wilheim were emphatic on this point. ''Not being a traditional politician helped me a lot,'' Lerner told me. Nonetheless, by entering public life, even a self-professed apolitical man becomes a political actor. What struck me was the way in which the return of democracy changed Lerner's core constituency. Under the generals, he was vulnerable mainly to the business community. That is why, for instance, he had to implement the pedestrian mall so quickly: if the business class lost confidence in him, the state assembly would have insisted that he be replaced. In a democratic Brazil, Lerner and his successors are threatened not just by the rich, but perhaps even more acutely by the poor -- politically, by populist parties, and demographically, by the inexorable population growth. In politics, the pendulum has swung, as it always does. For the first time in 15 years, the winning candidate in Curitiba's last mayoral election, in 2004, was not directly associated with the Lerner Group, the firm of 10 architects and planners that Lerner runs. Still, the new administration is continuing on the path that Lerner blazed. More worrisome for Curitiba's future is the demographic trend. Over the past half-century, the state of ParanA underwent a radical change, from a labor-intensive coffee economy to a mechanized agriculture of soybeans. Hundreds of thousands lost their jobs. Many of the dispossessed have relocated to the Curitiba metropolitan region, which in Brazil is famously livable. Every day, more keep coming.
 The ''invasions'' of homeless people onto unoccupied land spill like ink stains over the neatly outlined development maps of the urban planners, not only in Curitiba but across Brazil. One Saturday morning, I visited the neighborhood of Nossa Senhora da Luz, where a small group of people waited with sacks or improvised carts of garbage. The hardscrabble community dates from an early invasion of the 1970s. Today the streets are paved and the houses are solid cinder block, but unlike downtown Curitiba, here it is immediately apparent from the bleak, scrubby streetscape and the dark skins of the populace that you are in a third-world setting. I was there to observe one of 79 exchange centers that the municipality of Curitiba has established in communities where the streets are too narrow or too bumpy for large garbage trucks to circulate. Instead, people can carry their trash to biweekly collection sites and trade four pounds of garbage for one pound of vegetables. Mostly they bring plastic, paper and cardboard. At another site, run by the community council, more valuable aluminum cans are collected in return for money, and at yet another, organic material is traded for bus tokens. Compared with middle-class people, the residents of this neighborhood do not generate so much recyclable material; much of what they trade they prospect for around the city. Curitiba may be more successful in enlisting poor citizens to function as part-time carrinheiros than in enlightening better-off residents on their civic responsibilities.
 The largest working-class housing development within Curitiba is called Bairro Novo, or ''new neighborhood.'' It was developed hurriedly, you might say frantically, after a band of 3,000 people, at the start of a three-day holiday weekend in September 1992, invaded a nearby parcel of vacant land where a disused railroad line once operated. This was the same sort of stealth tactic that Lerner employed two decades earlier to pedestrianize the shopping street, but now it was being used against him -- coordinated, he maintains, by his political opponents, who controlled the governorship then as they do now. Since the security forces are directed by the state of ParanA and not the city, there was no way Lerner could stop the so-called Ferrovila (or railroad town) invasion. He says that he was especially infuriated because his administration had been researching the creation of a much larger development on the same land, housing 10 times as many people, as well as establishing schools and other social services. Instead, his team began planning the Bairro Novo on a parcel of land that was slated for development a decade or two later. There are 80,000 people living in Bairro Novo today. For a while, the illegal squats died off. ''If you have a good alternative, you can prevent the invasions,'' Lerner says.
 Recently, invasions have started up again. ''There is a feeling that it may be politically motivated,'' says Fragomeni, the urban planner, who served until March as president of Ippuc. He reports that in Curitiba today, there are 13,000 households in invasion settlements, 6,000 of them in ecologically fragile areas. Squatters often occupy land by rivers, both to obtain a water source and because, by law, the riverbanks can't be developed. ''The land is forbidden, and it is free at the same time,'' says Urban, the environmental activist. Raw sewage from these settlements flows directly into the rivers. Fragomeni says that fewer than 70 percent of Curitiba households have sewer connections. The current administration, led by Mayor Beto Richa (who was endorsed by Lerner but is not professionally associated with him), is trying to alleviate the problem with a new program to clean up the water basin of the sadly polluted BariguA River: relocating people to housing that is a little farther from the river, replanting vegetation on the banks and linking houses to the sewage system. 
 The program to reclaim the BariguA basin was galvanized by the most recent invasion in February, when 1,500 people seized land near Ferrovila in BariguA Park and hit a sensitive nerve. Their encampment is provocatively close to Ecoville, a controversial upper-middle-class development that arose in the mid-'90s along one of the rapid-bus corridors. As Lerner acidly observes of Ecoville, ''I don't like this project, because it is not 'eco' and it is not 'ville.' '' Ecoville is a self-contained development in which tall buildings loom over patches of vegetation and looping roads. It's an unconvincing version of the discredited Corbusian model of ''the city in the park,'' an idea that the developers self-consciously reference by naming one of these buildings ''Le Corbusier.'' Many buildings have been labeled for works by Picasso -- the Arlequin, the Pierrot, even the Guernica. One noteworthy Picasso-christened tower, the Suite Vollard, features 11 full-floor residences, each of which is supposed to be able to rotate independently. The Suite Vollard is 10 years overdue for occupancy. Its engineering is still unproved.
 Ferrovila and Ecoville: in close proximity, you can see the politicized landless and the profit-minded land developers who threaten Curitiba's status as an ecological city. A reputation can be as hard to uphold as to establish. Unlike his three immediate predecessors, Mayor Richa -- a boyish, blow-dried 41-year-old civil engineer from a prominent political family -- is not an urban planner. And Ippuc, while still powerful, no longer directs the show. Richa has discontinued the longstanding mayoral custom, established by Lerner, of attending a weekly meeting at Ippuc. Under Lerner and his successors, ''the mayor sat in Ippuc, and you felt what he wanted,'' Fragomeni says. ''It was a very verticalized government. Ippuc also planned the budget for the city. There's democracy now, which is good. But it is no longer a pyramid; it's a network. The mayor now expects you to propose what Curitiba should look like. He's not a town planner.''
 Nor is Curitiba a single town any longer. It's a conurbation. Planning must be for the metropolitan region, not just for the municipality. Does it matter that Curitiba bans polluting industries if the neighboring town of AraucAria has an oil refinery belching smoke on the city line? Similarly, if the new immigrants to the poor surrounding communities don't recycle, then Curitiba's landfill, the only such facility in the metropolitan region, will fill up even sooner. Like garbage, water does not respect city limits: Curitiba's water supply depends on reservoirs controlled by municipalities outside its borders. What was never simple has become even more complex. For a long time, the citizens of Curitiba were so proud of the city's reputation as an urban showplace that they kept re-electing urban planners -- self-styled technical experts who seemed to be above politics and who vaunted their expertise in running the buses, building the parks and recycling the garbage. But a mayor today must be able to negotiate successfully with other mayors if reform is to work. Mayors need to be politicians, even in Curitiba.

HEADLINE: Putting the Skinned Knees Back Into Playtime

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
JOSEPH GALLO, 10, of Santa Cruz, Calif., is well armed in the battle against childhood boredom, with a bedroom arsenal that includes a computer hooked to the Internet, a DVD player, two Game Boys, as well as an Xbox and a GameCube. 
 But in recent weeks, the hum of that war room of machinery has quieted because Joseph has acquired a new playtime obsession that would have seemed quaint even in his parents' day: marbles.
He can thank Michael Cohill, a toy designer and enthusiast, whose marble seminar Joseph attended at a youth fair a few weeks ago. Mr. Cohill considers himself something of a pied piper of the game, having taught it to thousands of children at schools, parks and scout meetings. ''They have the exact same experience kids did with marbles a hundred years ago,'' said Mr. Cohill, 52.
 Well, not exactly. Back then, children didn't need to take seminars to learn to play a no-tech, simple game. In the era of micromanaged play dates, overstuffed after-school schedules, cuts to recess and parents terrified of injuries, lawsuits and predators, many traditional childhood games have become lost arts, as antique as the concept of idle time itself. 
 But lately, a number of educators like Mr. Cohill, as well as parents and child-development specialists are trying to spur a revival of traditional outdoor pastimes, including marbles, hopscotch, red rover and kickball. They are attending play conferences, teaching courses on how to play, and starting leagues for the kinds of activities that didn't used to need leagues -- just, say, a stick and a ball. They are spurred by concerns that a decline in traditional play robs the imagination and inhibits social interaction, by personal nostalgia, and by a desire to create a new bridge to connect generations -- a bridge across both sides of the Nintendo gap.
 Although their efforts have mostly yielded modest results, a hint that they may be on to something comes with the success of an unlikely best seller, ''The Dangerous Book for Boys'' (Collins), a sepia-toned celebration of the lost arts of childhood, complete with information on how to make a tree house, fold paper airplanes and skip stones. Within days of its publication earlier this month, the book had soared to No. 2 on Amazon's sales ranking, right behind the latest Harry Potter installment. The book, by Conn Iggulden and Hal Iggulden, sells for $24.95 in hardcover and may be appealing as much to fathers who are nostalgic for a youth they never quite had as to children. 
 Conn Iggulden said in an e-mail message that he routinely received correspondence from parents who yearn for a ''return to simple pleasures,'' which seems to stem from ''potent forces, like the realisation that keeping your kids locked up in the house on PlayStations isn't actually that good for them; or the appalled reaction of many parents to a health-and-safety culture that prevents half the activities they took for granted as kids -- and that they know were important to their growth and confidence.''
 Nevertheless, such simple pleasures have not always been conspicuous in the lives of children over the last two decades. ''These kind of games, including tag, have practically died out,'' said Joan Almon, who is coordinator for the United States affiliate of the Alliance for Childhood, a play advocacy group in College Park, Md. 
 Ms. Almon bemoaned the fact that she often drives through leafy suburban streets on a sunny afternoon and sees no children playing, adding, ''We should be paying more attention to these classical children's games, which are almost lost now.'' 
 Joseph, in fact, compared the experience of indulging in this centuries-old activity to ''being inside a video game.'' 
 Jill Gallo, Joseph's mother, is thrilled to see her son turn away from violent video games and she thinks other parents should actively work to spread the outdated pastime among children. ''It won't come back naturally,'' said Ms. Gallo, 40. ''We have to introduce it. We have to support it.''
 Rhonda Clements, a professor of education at Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y., and a former president of the American Association for the Child's Right to Play, said that this was already happening. 
 ''There's a movement,'' she said of the effort to revive these games. Her department has been sponsoring marble tournaments at local schools and trying to encourage faculty members to teach games like Four Square.
 For many parents and educators, the burgeoning interest in old-fashioned games is an outgrowth of a broader campaign, spearheaded by a growing number of national and local advocacy and research organizations, like the Alliance for Childhood, or the National Institute for Play in Carmel Valley, Calif., to restore unstructured play in children's lives. They cite numerous studies that claim such play has many benefits, from helping children develop their imaginations to helping them learn to get along with others. 
 One group, New York Voices of Childhood, formed in 2005 in New York City, already counts more than 100 parents and educators as members. They are currently trying to persuade teachers to make old-fashioned play a priority within their curriculum, said Susan Ochshorn, a project coordinator for the group, who argued that games like tag and red light/green light are useful not only in alleviating stress, but helping combat obesity.
 Birgit Meade, an economist for the federal government who lives in College Park, doesn't allow her children -- Oliver, 10, and Anna, 7 -- to own a computer, and limits their DVD watching, she said. Instead, she encourages them to collect caterpillars or play jump rope in the front yard with friends. 
 Ms. Meade admits that her son runs the risk of looking like ''kind of an oddball'' to his friends for bouncing on a pogo stick while his friends blast away their afternoons playing video games. 
 Still, Oliver noted that he recently tallied 2,000 bounces in a single session. ''There's a lot more things to do outdoors,'' he said.
 Perhaps the adults' serious approach to playtime is paying off. 
 Kathy J. Spangler, the director of national partnerships for the National Recreation and Park Association in Ashburn, Va., which represent some 6,000 local parks departments, said she had witnessed an increase in children playing traditional games like four square, scavenger hunts and hopscotch at parks throughout the country in the last few years.
 Larry Betz, of Benton, Ark., founder of the Little Rock Kickball Association, said that his adult league was an instant hit when it started in 2004. Meanwhile, most of their children found this old playground staple as foreign as a mortgage application. ''The irony of adults playing a kids' game was lost on them,'' Mr. Betz said.
 But after spending a few seasons on the sideline, watching their parents have fun, many children are suddenly showing interest in the game, Mr. Betz said. This year, he expects at least 150 children to turn out for a new youth division.
 CORY ABATE-SHEN, 41, of Warren, N.J., cited a tinge of nostalgia as one reason she tried to teach the playmates of her twin 6-year-olds, David and Philip, to leap through hopscotch courts, shimmy in hula hoops, and chase each other around the lawn in games of tag. Most kids, she said, need her direction, but once taught, ''they can immediately adapt and get into it.''
 ''You're going to see a real revolution,'' she predicted, sounding a bit like a Thomas Paine of retro play. 
 Nevertheless, some critics believe that children best fire their imaginations and hone social skills when left alone to make their own fun.
 Dr. Geoffrey Godbey, a professor of recreation at Penn State University, said the idea that parents can revive old-fashioned play is contrary to the spirit of play. He blamed ''boomers who want to do it themselves again because they never grew up.''
 His advice? ''Let the kids go.''
 But Sara Boettrich doesn't want to. The Rochester, N.Y., mother has tried to exhume the old playground games of her own childhood, like seven up -- which involves bouncing a red rubber ball against a wall. ''I used to love that game!'' Ms. Boettrich said. ''My friends and I would play that for weeks.'' 
 But when she tried to pass it along to her daughter Lydia, 8, and Lydia's friends, she found that she was the one who was most spirited in bounding around on her driveway. The children followed along only as long as mom was there to supply the enthusiasm. Afterward, they tended to return to their video games. 
 Ms. Boettrich admitted that she hadn't seen the kids playing seven up, pickup sticks and jacks, and that she had since abandoned her attempts to spark a love of them in her daughter. She added, ''I think I had more fun than she did.''

 BODY:
6. Mike Strizki's house, the house of the future, the revolutionary house that might very well change our lives forever, is an unremarkable two-story, 3,000-square-foot, white colonial-style kit home in front of which, one rainy day last November, were parked no fewer than seven trucks and cars, a pair of Jet Skis, a speedboat on a trailer, several golf carts, a small tractor, a couple of vans and an old dump truck rusting in the middle of the woods, like a major reworking of a Robert Frost poem. There was nothing odd, or futuristic, or exotically ''eco'' about the house -- no solar panels to be seen, no giant arrays of thermopane windows passively drinking up light and heat; yet here, I'd been told, in the Sourland Mountains in New Jersey, an hour from Manhattan, was a house that had the potential -- not long from now, not 20 years from now, but maybe within 5 to 10 years -- to help turn millions of American homes into fully self-sustaining power plants, each one capable of producing hydrogen to fuel cars as well. 
A sign at the head of Strizki's long gravel driveway said, ''Welcome to the first solar-hydrogen residence in North America.'' Strizki, the 50-year-old director of residential and commercial systems for Advanced Solar Products, a solar installation company, designed a backyard power plant that provides all the house's energy, using a combination of solar panels and solar-generated hydrogen. Although he built the house 15 years ago, the power plant is a more recent addition, dedicated in October 2006. Strizki lives in the house with his wife, Ann, a 23-year-old son, two dogs and a cat. As it happens, there are several rival claimants to the title of first solar-hydrogen house, including the United States Merchant Marine Academy, which has an 800-square-foot, prefabricated solar-hydrogen-powered house on display at its campus in Kings Point, N.Y.; now occupied by a professor, it was dedicated as ''America's First Solar-Hydrogen Home'' in June 2006. But Strizki maintains that his system was the first to fuel an average-size American home in which a real American family actually lives. 
 Strizki gave me a tour. Outside, the sky was the color of hammered steel. There was a patch of lawn the size of a small putting green, a brick walkway leading to the door and, inside, the proverbial expansive American-home interior -- a cozy kitchen with all the usual appliances, a spacious living room with an enormous L-shaped leather couch, a big-screen television, a stereo, an office upstairs, washers and dryers downstairs: the full-on, living-large ensemble of modern comfort and convenience on display. If this was part of a revolution in green architecture, of an America still hopeful about its chances for a sustainable future -- a renewable America -- it was one that came equipped with a La-Z-Boy. 
 Back outside, Strizki, who is built like a bowling ball closing in on a strike, began a well-practiced patter that sprang readily from the microparticulars of photovoltaic cells and proton-exchange membranes to what he sees as the macro-, going-to-hell-in-a-handbasket range of problems that beset the globe: staggering energy demand in the face of diminishing resources; global warming; peaking fossil-fuel production; energy insecurity; and the specter of economic collapse as the world makes the painful shift from petroleum to whatever must, of necessity, come next. Strizki, whom many have described as a natural-born mechanical genius, has worked in obscurity on renewable-energy technology for most of his adult life. Lately, it seems, people have started to pay attention. 
 We walked from the house about 50 yards through maple and oak trees to a large metal outbuilding roughly the size of a barn and stopped in front of two key elements of the solar-hydrogen system. To my left, a 10-kilowatt array of solar panels completely covered the south-facing roof of the metal shed, the business end of his system, dully transforming the gauzy, rain-soaked sunlight into electricity. To my right, 10 large propane tanks sat filled with hydrogen. Almost everything I saw, Strizki explained, was overengineered and bigger than necessary for the job: the electrolyzer, used in industrial laboratories to generate hydrogen; the fuel cell, used by telecom companies to power remote cellphone towers; and, most conspicuously, the 10 hydrogen tanks. If patching together these disparate and cumbersome elements from heavy industry for a home seemed a little like hooking up a jet engine to run a scooter, it was just a natural stage, he said, in the development of a commercial product that would be streamlined and form-fitted for domestic use. ''When they build a computer chip,'' he explained, ''they build a big one.'' They call it a breadboard, ''and once they get the components the way they want it, they miniaturize it and then mass-produce it. This,'' Strizki said of his prototype solar-hydrogen system, ''this is our breadboard.'' 
 Here's how the solar-hydrogen house works. The solar panels above Strizki's garage generate electricity, which goes directly to power his house. For about seven months of the year, the panels are designed to make more electricity than the house needs, as much as 60 percent more during the summertime. Strizki's system takes this extra electricity and runs it through an electrolyzer, which uses technology invented in the mid-19th century to convert electricity and water into a modest quantity of hydrogen -- the energy equivalent of about a gallon of gasoline each summer day -- which is then sent to the tanks outside. In this inaugural shakedown year, Strizki had to purchase his hydrogen (19,000 cubic feet of it, at a total cost of about $2,000) to prime his empty tanks. According to Strizki, that's the last fuel bill he will ever have. Though he will continue to monitor the system, measuring the amount of hydrogen produced, the hydrogen should act like a natural battery bank that never dies or degrades. During the winter months, the solar panels should still provide about 60 percent of the power to the house, he said. It's then that the accumulated hydrogen will be siphoned from the storage tanks to a fuel cell, which will simply reverse the process of the electrolyzer, reconfiguring the hydrogen back to water and electricity. 
 Although it can stand alone completely off the main power grid, Strizki's system is ''grid-tied,'' which means that with the flick of a switch in his basement, he can connect to the grid for backup power or to sell electricity to the local power company. As a final touch, there is a geothermal component to the scheme. Six feet beneath the lawn, freon gas circulates through a radiatorlike grill of copper tubes, bringing the ground temperature -- at that depth it remains a constant 56 degrees -- into the house. In winter, some of the stored hydrogen powers a heat pump that steps up the temperature in the Strizkis' house another 12 degrees. During the 90-degree days of a New Jersey summer, they use that steady 56-degree ground temperature to stay cool and comfortable. 
 Solar power, of course, in one form or another has been around for thousands of years. The Anasazi Indians of the American Southwest incorporated passive solar design into their cliff dwellings. Leonardo da Vinci drew up plans (never materialized) for a kind of solar-concentrating industrial furnace. The basic properties of active solar photovoltaics were described in the 19th century; photovoltaic solar panels have been around since the 1950s. There is nothing new, in short, in Mike Strizki's backyard. Even his method of using hydrogen to store solar-generated electricity was studied more than 120 years earlier by the French inventor Augustin Mouchot, who once made ice with a solar-powered steam engine. Strizki's principal achievement lies in inventing a clever system from components that were already at hand. 
 Although 19,000 cubic feet of hydrogen may sound like a lot, it really isn't. It is, Strizki explained, the energy equivalent of only about a single tank of gasoline in a large S.U.V., yet this would be more than enough hydrogen to provide the house with all the heating, cooking, hot water and additional electrical power needed to last through the dark winter months. Soon, he said, the same amount of hydrogen could be stored in a single tank at high pressure, substantially reducing the ''storage footprint.'' But for now he chose 10 tanks at low pressure, in part to avoid alarming New Jersey's building inspectors with the prospect of pressurized hydrogen.
 Above us, the clouds seemed to have dropped a few feet closer to our heads. A light rain began to fall.
 ''The thing is,'' Strizki told me, ''dark days like this don't affect me.''
 ''Because of the hydrogen?'' I asked.
 ''Because of the hydrogen,'' he said.
 The implications of the solar-hydrogen house are immense. Eventually, it seems, for the price of a home-improvement loan, millions of homeowners could install solar-hydrogen systems, with zero emissions, generating 100-percent clean renewable energy. It is all part of a new trend toward ''distributed generation,'' whereby homes, businesses, schools, factories and retail outlets might one day produce their own electricity while remaining tied to the grid -- capable, that is, of reducing the load on the grid when it really needs it, such as during peak summer months, when demand for air-conditioning skyrockets. This potential for ''peak shaving,'' as it's called, remains one of the most attractive features of the growing solar movement. A recent M.I.T. study, for instance, found that adding a gigawatt of solar power -- the equivalent of 100,000 10-kilowatt solar panels like the one that powers the Strizki house -- to the New England region would shave peak pricing and thus lower utility rates for all of the area's customers by 2 to 5 percent. The solar-hydrogen home can also generate fuel for transportation. Strizki's house has a hydrogen fueling station that he uses to fill an experimental hydrogen car, the New Jersey Genesis, which has a range of 300 miles. Since Americans, it turns out, drive on average no more than 33 miles per day, theoretically the home hydrogen-fueling station could in the future satisfy the commuting needs of millions. 
 Perhaps most important, Strizki's system can be adapted to existing homes. The system, in other words, doesn't dictate a radical change in architectural style. If you don't have a house that incorporates passive solar design -- banks of south-facing windows for collecting heat and light, heat-retaining stone flooring -- no matter. By installing a solar-hydrogen system, almost any house, it seems, could go seriously green -- and without a whiff of the sacrifice or changes in lifestyle that sometimes come from the more puritanical quarters of the environmental movement. The Strizki home offers a greener world and the continued pursuit of happiness. Indeed, its premise and secret promise is to recommend two things that are dear to many Americans anyway: energy independence and the permission to keep all one's toys. 
 Is all of this too good to be true? Well, yes, according to Howard C. Hayden, a solar skeptic, a nuclear-power advocate and the author of ''The Solar Fraud: Why Solar Energy Won't Run the World.'' Hayden says he believes that Strizki couldn't possibly generate enough hydrogen from his solar panels to last him through the winter -- particularly not without the help of the geothermal system installed back when the house was built. Hayden doubts Strizki's claim that he will generate the energy equivalent of about a gallon of gasoline in stored hydrogen per day; even if he does, Hayden says, when you allow for an efficiency loss of 50 percent, Strizki will be able to store only 17 kilowatt-hours per day. ''He's not going to get enough energy out of his 10-kilowatt system'' to power the house and car year round. ''It's not going to happen.'' 
 But according to Scott Samuelsen, director of the National Fuel Cell Research Center at the University of California at Irvine, the technology works. Samuelsen and a team of engineers fed several months of data from two conventional California homes into a computer model that simulated a solar-hydrogen system very much like Strizki's and found that it could provide enough energy for the houses throughout the year. The comparison is skewed, of course, because in the temperate Pacific climate, homes generally consume about 60 percent of what mid-Atlantic homes do, according to Department of Energy statistics. Still, the results were robust enough to prompt Samuelsen, who is characteristically measured in his statements, to declare that solar hydrogen ''is the means by which residential homes will be powered in the future and probably small-to-medium commercial buildings as well.''
 In a year of unprecedented ''green'' awareness -- green advertising campaigns, a green issue of Sports Illustrated -- the big promise of renewables, from biofuels to wind and solar, is their capacity to generate another kind of green, a fact that has not been lost on Wall Street. Though solar is just a tiny fraction of the United States' $1.2 trillion energy market, and less than .05 percent of the world's share of generated electricity, demand for solar power is so off the charts in America, Japan and Europe (cold, cloudy Germany is a dominant force in the world market) that there is currently a worldwide shortage in the basic substrate used to manufacture photovoltaic cells -- processed silicon -- which has pushed up its price. 
 ''The stars are aligned right now,'' Jean-Marc E. O'Brien of Ardour Capital Investments told me. The high prices of oil, gasoline and natural gas have concentrated more private-sector investment into R&D. So have concerns about energy security, an increasing corporate awareness that global warming affects the bottom line and a legislative push at the state level to subsidize renewable energy. Big investment houses have moved into solar- and wind-power project financing. According to The Economist, total investments of all kinds in renewable energy rose to an estimated $63 billion in 2006, from $30 billion in 2004. The smart money, as they say, is positioning itself toward a new energy paradigm. 
 In the spring of last year, as Mike Strizki was midway through the four-year, red-tape-delayed process of installing the solar-hydrogen system for his house, things ground to a halt. One of the key hurdles came in the form of officials enforcing the New Jersey building code, who balked at storing hydrogen in used propane tanks. Help came in the form of Gian-Paolo Caminiti, a former psychotherapist who branched off into management training and human resources, and had gotten to know Strizki after he'd installed a solar-power system in Caminiti's home. ''There were no rules and regulations for building a hydrogen system in a residential environment,'' said Caminiti, who set up a meeting with state officials and got everyone talking again. Soon both sides hammered out an agreement that would bring the solar-hydrogen house up to code. Caminiti now works for Strizki as his chief operations officer at Renewable Energy International, the company that Strizki set up to bring his solar-hydrogen system to market. Others have joined in the effort. They include an inventor-entrepreneur named Steven Amendola, and Lyle Rawlings, Strizki's boss at Advanced Solar Products, whom many regard as the founding father of renewable-energy legislation in New Jersey -- now the fastest-growing solar market in the country. 
 With all the venture capital flying around, you'd think these men would have been flush with office suites and spanking new laboratories, but they operated out of bedroom offices and borrowed garage space, printing their business cards on home computers. Meanwhile, Strizki regaled me with stories about energy-saving technologies -- from the electric trolley to the electric car -- that had been quietly withheld, removed or in some way derailed from production. He is particularly wary of big investors wresting control of his invention. ''We're not going to sell anything out,'' he told me. ''We're not running the risk of someone coming in as a front company and buying our technology off the market and shelving it.'' He prefers, he said, to run a little lean and wait for an angel investor, someone who can afford $2 million to $5 million to help roll out a solar-hydrogen system as a retail product without asking for too much in return. 
 But even if Strizki's solar-hydrogen system were to hit the market intact, is it economically feasible? Would it simply cost too much for the average homeowner to install? Is hydrogen storage safe? Will solar power be competitive with fossil fuels? Then there is perhaps the more fundamental question of inertia. According to a recent study by the Shelton Group, which monitors consumer attitudes toward energy, 58 percent of Americans cannot name a single form of renewable energy. Are we ready to make the jump to something that most people can't even name? 
 The cost of solar power is a bedeviling problem, and 90 percent of it must be paid upfront at installation: Strizki's system, not including the geothermal component or hydrogen-fueled appliances, cost $500,000. Donations from others and a New Jersey Board of Public Utilities grant of $225,000 reduced his out-of-pocket costs to $100,000. As a unique, first instance of applied technology, it was, like all prototypes, expensive. But the ''experience curve'' -- the value of all the lessons learned in getting a bona fide, certified, code-approved working system up and running -- would soon bear fruit, Strizki claimed, reducing the total cost of the very next solar-hydrogen house to about $100,000, an 80 percent cost reduction just one generation beyond the prototype. According to Travis Bradford, author of ''Solar Revolution: The Economic Transformation of the Global Energy Industry,'' the cost of solar has been dropping by 5 or 6 percent a year, and as the popularity of solar increases, its costs will continue to go down.
 Still, as some have noted, $100,000, amortized over the life span of the system, works out to about $4,000 a year on energy, plus the costs of replacing parts. This is quite a bit more than the $1,800 a year average homeowners spend on all their home energy needs. That is true, Bradford says, only if you decide not to calculate all the ways that Strizki's system can save money. ''If you refuel your car at home with hydrogen,'' Bradford explains, ''you can add your annual gasoline costs'' -- about $3,400 per year for the average homeowner, according to Department of Energy figures -- ''to what you save on home energy. Then the savings easily approach $5,000 per year.'' Perhaps most important, Bradford observes, ''purchasing the solar-hydrogen system insulates you from any future price increases'' in home heating or transportation fuels. 
 Yes, these new technologies, as their opponents claim, are more expensive. But economies of scale coupled with the increased price of fossil fuel, Bradford says, will inevitably make solar competitive, as it already is in Japan and Germany, where energy costs are high. ''Let's do a thought experiment,'' he said. ''Let's say that 5 percent of homeowners in America would willingly pay more for a home with solar panels -- for reasons that have nothing to do with cost-effectiveness. Let's say there are 100 million homes in America. Five percent of that is five million homes. But right now there are only 50,000 solar homes in America, so you'd need to build or install 100 times the current number of solar homes in America before you'd exhaust the number of people who are willing to pay more for a solar home. And by the time you reach five million, the economies of scale really kick in, and you've solved the so-called cost-effectiveness problem.'' 
 ''And if my mother were a car,'' Howard Hayden retorts, ''she'd have wheels.'' There are too many ''ifs,'' according to Hayden, in Bradford's cost analysis to give it credence. Even a solar advocate like Lyle Rawlings considers Bradford's estimates overly optimistic. Still, Rawlings says, even some fraction of 1 percent -- a few hundred thousand homes -- might be enough to kick-start the economies of scale in favor of the solar-hydrogen house.
 But for Hayden, Strizki's system -- and solar power in general -- can never be cost-effective. Hayden doesn't buy the argument that the price of solar power will plummet. He agrees with Bradford that the price of solar panels has declined steadily, though not precipitously, by about 5 percent per year. So if this decline continues, and if energy prices continue to rise, won't solar power become affordable? ''Yes,'' Hayden says. ''And if you extrapolate your growth curve from when you were 12 to when you were 13, you'd be 64 feet tall.'' Hayden, in other words, doesn't think the price will continue to drop, mostly because of manufacturing costs. ''Eventually, even with the improvement in efficiencies,'' Hayden maintains, ''you will not be able to surmount the costs of silicon. You get down to an irreducible minimum -- the price of manufacturing the solar panels -- which will continue to be the main price-barrier.''
 It is one thing to extol or doubt the cost-effectiveness of solar panels, the primary component of the solar-hydrogen house, but what about the hydrogen? It is unfair, for instance, to mention the Hindenburg disaster, the fiery destruction of the hydrogen-filled dirigible over Lakehurst, N.J., in 1937. Although new evidence suggests that hydrogen was not the primary cause of the disaster, the Hindenburg's spectacularly filmed crash cast a long shadow in the public mind over hydrogen as a dangerous and tricky material to handle. Is adding hydrogen to solar power a complication of an already complex idea -- the technological equivalent of stuffing something tasty like a turkey with a duck and a chicken and adding, for good measure, a stick of dynamite? Arguments about efficiency losses, cost-benefit analyses and the like are more or less beside the point if hydrogen is a substance that might blow you to smithereens. 
 This is what Joseph J. Romm, who was acting assistant secretary of energy for energy efficiency and renewable energy during the Clinton administration, seems to suggest. Romm is an environmental pragmatist. He says he believes that the problems of global warming are urgent and that hydrogen technologies are too remote in time to be of any real help. The author of ''The Hype About Hydrogen: Fact and Fiction in the Race to Save the Climate,'' he has traveled the country speaking against hydrogen, arguing that as energy pathways, fuel cells and the like are extremely inefficient and expensive. He also mentions the safety issue, and the Hindenburg seems to float ominously into the debate. 
 ''Hydrogen is odorless,'' Romm says. ''And it's invisible. And it burns invisibly and it leaks through anything.'' Romm praises Strizki's use of solar and geothermal components, but has nothing good to say about hydrogen. ''I'm not going to dispute those who say you can work with hydrogen safely,'' Romm told me, ''but there's a big difference between hydrogen in an industrial setting and hydrogen being made by your next-door neighbor with his dogs and little kids.'' He says, ''The last thing you want is somebody making hydrogen in his garage. If there was a leak -- if you collected any amount of gas -- you would never know it, and any spark at all sets it off. So I would go to the local zoning board to stop my neighbor from putting in a hydrogen generation system.''
 John Turner, an electrochemist who has been working with fuel cells and hydrogen production for 28 years as a principal scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, disagrees. ''I think Romm greatly overstates hydrogen's risk,'' Turner says, explaining that it is very difficult, in fact, for hydrogen to accumulate anywhere because it diffuses so rapidly. ''All energy carriers,'' Turner adds, ''are by their very nature dangerous. Gasoline? Incredibly dangerous,'' he says. ''It's a poisonous, carcinogenic, flammable liquid. I'll bet that Romm sits on 20 gallons of it every day.'' 
 ''In terms of safety,'' Turner says, ''hydrogen is something we can deal with.''
 The fact is that Strizki's system has passed New Jersey's building code, one of the toughest in the nation. ''I want to put an exclamation point on that,'' Scott Samuelsen observes. ''Passing the code is the most important aspect of the story for the American homeowner and energy consumer.''
 The debate between hydrogen advocates and skeptics, the hands-on hydrogen-friendly inventors like Strizki and the pragmatists like Romm, is really a debate about what form a new energy paradigm will take. It resembles resource debates reaching back more than a hundred years, with coal giving way in the 20th century to petroleum, for instance, which then had to make room for natural gas. Rival technologies threaten what Romm calls ''incumbent energy regimes.'' 
 It made me think back to my first visit to Strizki's house. He was in his big metal garage, leaning over his fuel-cell car, the amazing aluminum-framed Genesis, and talking about ''greater truths,'' which is something he likes to do, at times with a kind of exasperated flourish, as if rehearsing for his own filibuster scene in ''Mr. Strizki Goes to Washington.'' ''The solar-hydrogen house,'' he told me, choosing his words carefully, ''is an incredibly disruptive technology.
 ''You can go out and buy an oil well,'' Strizki went on to say. ''You can buy a coal mine, but it's a little hard to buy a piece of the sun. It's like buying air. It's going to inspire some radical changes. And the people who have the monopolies are going to have a hard time giving that up.''

 Landscaped roofs are natural thermal insulators, regulating indoor air temperature and thus saving energy. Although the green-roof movement is largely an urban phenomenon -- Chicago initiated a popular green-roof grant program two years ago -- one of the more memorable examples is a home in Druidstone, Wales, built in 1996 by the British firm Future Systems. Perched on the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean, the house is covered almost entirely in ramped earth. (Drawing by +ISM)

HEADLINE: Living Larger, and Drawing Fire

BYLINE: By DAN ZEGART

 BODY:
LIKE the many Eskimo words for snow, a multitude of nicknames exist for the oversize houses commonly referred to as McMansions, and they mirror the uneasiness over the spread of the homes.
 ''You hear them called starter castles, beltway baronials, mini Taj Mahals, but my favorite is parachute homes, because of the disregard for local styles -- like they were dropped from the sky,'' said Edward J. Trawinski, a lawyer and land-use expert from Morristown, N.J.
 Although the names may be amusing, many owners of smaller homes, especially in older communities dominated by more traditional architecture, find it anything but funny when one goes up in their neighborhood. With the proliferation of mammoth residences throughout the suburbs of New York City and beyond, some towns are trying to restrict the size and, sometimes, the look of new homes. 
 Mr. Trawinski has helped municipalities in northern New Jersey, including Wayne, Montclair and Bergenfield, write such laws, which commonly set maximums for height and square footage on a sliding scale that varies with the lot size. The laws may also dictate the slope of roofs and require side yards to be large enough so the new home does not loom over its neighbors.
 Such laws draw sharp dividing lines between some residents and builders. The debate is particularly fierce in towns like Westport, Conn., where builders say smallish lots and high land values make tearing down existing homes and replacing them, often with much larger houses, necessary to provide a reasonable profit. 
 ''I live with these regulations all the time, and they're so complicated and so hard to understand,'' said Rick Benson, a Westport resident and builder. ''And now they're not only getting more complicated, they're actually regulating taste.'' He estimated that he had six houses in various stages of completion; two of them were teardowns. All will be much bigger than those they replaced. 
 Mr. Benson said builders respond to market demands and contended that Westport's standards for size were arbitrary. ''I just did a 13,000-square-foot house on six to nine acres smack in the middle of town,'' he said. ''It's massive. It looks like a hotel in the Adirondacks. Not a peep about that one.''
 But the issue of large new houses is so contentious, said Gordon Joseloff, Westport's first selectman, that two previous efforts to pass a home-size ordinance in Westport were voted down. ''The attitude of a lot of people here is, 'You're messing with my nest egg,' '' he said.
 The Town of New Castle, N.Y., is grappling with a similar problem as it pushes ahead with a new law based on floor-area ratio that adjusts the allowable size of a house depending on the lot size. It is an approach sanctioned by courts in several states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and is based on what Mr. Trawinski called a recognition ''that it's not size per se but the perception of size.''
 ''A big house on a little postage stamp of land just looks terrible,'' he said.
 But the main goal of such ordinances is not to mandate smaller homes, but to preserve a community's ''streetscape'' by preventing houses that are so much larger than the prevailing architecture as to be jarring, said Virginia Kurshan, chairwoman of the Maplewood, N.J., Historic Preservation Commission. 
 At one extreme, she said, nearby Glen Ridge declared the entire borough a historic district, putting tight restrictions on any building allowed. Maplewood, she said, is considering a less drastic law that might apply to new construction and additions.
 Like Maplewood, New Castle has little undeveloped land left, said Frank Annunziata, the town engineer. ''Like a lot of towns that are almost completely built out, we're worried about older, maybe historic houses being knocked down and replaced with something that's inappropriate and much bigger,'' he said. Proposed zoning changes would permit a house of up to 10,391 square feet on four acres; quarter-acre lots would be capped at 4,100 square feet.
 Aesthetics are less of a factor in Sagaponack, near East Hampton, on Long Island, with its expanses of open acreage. Nevertheless, critics have little trouble finding examples for their cause in this newly created village, which is writing its first zoning ordinance. 
 There is the 66,000-square-foot mansion on 63 beachfront acres, for example, or the structure called ''the Great Wall of Sagaponack,'' a sprawling residence protected by a wall more than 100 feet long and 20 feet high. 
 ''We have generally large lots, most at least three acres, but there's still concern over really large houses,'' Mayor Bill Tillotson of Sagaponack said. ''They still stick out.'' 
 Builders argue that large-scale homes are an inevitable result of skyrocketing land values and changes in home-buying habits.
 ''You never used to have 9-, 10-foot ceilings with cathedral space,'' said Stuart R. Koenig, a lawyer and land-use consultant to the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, who estimates that half of New Jersey's towns have tried to regulate housing size. ''And once you do that, if you want to still have living area, you need a bigger building.''
 Mr. Benson, the Westport builder, also said that modern tastes dictate larger houses. ''Older houses have low ceilings and out-of-date kitchens,'' he said. ''People don't want to live in houses built in the '40s, '50s and '60s. So they tear them down.''
 Mr. Benson said he finds ordinances restricting large houses infuriating because they take aim at a problem that is disappearing on its own. ''We've had three years of an economic slowdown, and market conditions and energy costs are causing builders to build smaller houses,'' he said.
 As an example, he cited two houses he built on adjoining lots in Westport: one a 6,500-square-foot home on one and a half acres, which was purchased well before completion, the second a 9,600-square-foot residence on two acres, which took two years to sell. 
 ''I had to keep dropping the price,'' he said. ''It was just too big.''

HEADLINE: What's Furry and Thirsty and Loves the Dark?

BYLINE: By SUSAN STEWART

 BODY:
IT'S spring: time to plant perennials, clean closets -- and call the microbial inspector. What does spring cleaning mean in the age of green? For many of us, it means fear. 
 Homeowners whose grandparents beat rugs and washed windows worry about more than dirt. So what if the baseboards are dusty? The lead in the paint could be lowering your toddler's future SAT scores. The air may be fragrant with the season's first blooms, but that doesn't make you safe from colorless, odorless gases like radon and carbon monoxide. And, by the way, you're sneezing. Is it a cold, or is it mold?
Household nightmares often capture the public imagination for a while and then fade away. Asbestos, lead and radon, riveting in the 1970s and 1980s, are still around, but they're old news. Mold, which started making headlines in the 1990s, is in. And with the recent flooding throughout the region, mold inspectors and remediators can barely handle the business. 
 ''People are really irritable right now,'' said Margaret Ann Furer, a contractor and mold mitigator in Katonah. She was not referring to the hardest-hit victims of the recent northeaster and subsequent flooding; people who lose their homes to water have much more to worry about than mold. But mold is one of the most common and insidious aftereffects of even minor flooding, and when a wet spring season connects with a less than watertight house -- or when moisture is trapped in an airtight house made of mold-conducive materials -- it can make for a bumper crop.
 Mold is a furry, thirsty fungus. Outdoors, it earns its place in the ecosystem by breaking down wood, leaves and plant debris. Indoors, it breaks the hearts of homeowners, mostly by attacking their pocketbooks.
 ''Mold is the hot topic right now,'' said Robert Weitz, a certified microbial inspector and a principal in RTK Environmental Group, an environmental testing company in Connecticut.
 On a cloudy April day, Mr. Weitz is examining the entrance of Jay and Julia Bacal's multilevel contemporary house in northern Westchester County.
 ''This is Cladosporium mold,'' he says, pointing to grayish shadows near the front door. ''This is opportunistic, a dark area without much light. And this house is covered in a solid stain, and mold loves solid stain.''
 Loves? Mr. Weitz is creeping us out already, and we're not even inside the house. Is it . . . alive?
 ''Mold is not dead or alive,'' he says reassuringly. ''It is viable or nonviable.''
 But what if mold is merely dormant? That is another story. Mold feeds on organic materials and is brought to life by moisture. When a water source is removed but existing mold is left, according to Mr. Weitz, ''the spores, if you will, start to panic.''
 ''They go through the process of sporulation,'' he said. ''They throw themselves toward water sources.'' We feel like throwing ourselves back in the car, but instead we move indoors.
 The pale spring sun fills the high-ceilinged living room, illuminating the area where a trickle of water once made its way down the chimney wall. ''Water was leaking from a ceiling pipe in the lowest level of the house,'' Mr. Weitz says. ''They've already removed the carpet on that level and replaced it with tile.''
 WE head downstairs to a finished walk-out basement. At the foot of the steps, on the new tile, Mr. Weitz places a small white object atop a chest-high tripod. This is a monitoring device that can detect elevated levels of mold spores in the air, even in rooms where mold is not visible.
 Crouching, Mr. Weitz peers behind a heater against the back wall. ''There's a little bit of mold here,'' he says, in the calm, considered tone of a doctor reading the results of a blood test. ''All very typical.''
 Mr. Weitz spends two hours or so going through a residential property, checking for radon, asbestos, lead and, of course, mold. He takes baseline readings of air quality inside and out (some neighborhoods are naturally moldier than others). He charges $400 to $500, and a few hundred more for lab costs. But if you have a mold problem, that cost is only the beginning. Nightmare stories aside, a typical suburban remediation, according to several local remediators, runs from $2,000 to $4,000, though some reach $12,000.
 ''Mold is a health concern for a very limited population,'' said Charles Wiles, executive director of the American Indoor Air Quality Council, which certifies microbial inspectors like Mr. Weitz. ''However, mold is a financial issue for everyone, as it reduces the value of their assets.''
 Even if the mold in your house isn't causing discomfort to you, odds are that it will make potential buyers very queasy. Most mold isn't toxic to most people, but mold has had a toxic reputation since 1993, when a cluster of children in Cleveland suffered pulmonary hemorrhages linked, although inconclusively, to the presence of a mold called Stachybotrys in their homes.
 Then in 2001, a Texas jury awarded Melinda Ballard $32 million in a ''bad faith'' lawsuit against Farmers Insurance Group of Companies after mold was discovered throughout her 22-room house. (The award was lowered to $4 million two years later.)
 In 2003, Johnny Carson's former sidekick, Ed McMahon, and his wife, Pamela, were awarded $7.2 million from American Equity Insurance in a California court. Mold, the McMahons' lawsuit claimed, killed their sheepdog Muffin and caused health problems for them and their staff, forcing them to leave their six-bedroom home for six months.
 These and other cases helped to create a virtual industry around a fungus that has been among us forever.
 Five years ago, the air-quality council listed 1,000 certified microbial inspectors on its books. Today, there are 5,000. Is there more mold, or are we just more worried about it?
 Both, said Charles Bernzweig, owner of Spectrum, a remediation company in Scarsdale. 
 ''For one thing, houses are more tightly built, so moisture builds up,'' he said.
 Houses today are also made with materials like drywall that are mold-friendly and that are often left out in the rain and installed wet, Mr. Bernzweig said.
 In addition, he said, ''people want to be comfortable,'' so they put humidifiers in their heating systems. 
 ''It's a Catch-22,'' said Mary Lamielle, executive director of the National Center for Environmental and Health Strategies, a lobbying group for people with chemical sensitivities. ''You caulk your windows to save energy, and that leads to more toxin growth.''
 As a result of the environmental movement, recycling has also increased, which means that more and more organic materials are being used in construction. When damp, wallboard coated in recycled newspaper provides a delicious meal for mold, Mr. Weitz said.
 Thanks in no small part to the Ballard case and the attention it drew, mold-damage claims skyrocketed a few years ago. Insurers paid $1.4 billion in mold claims in 2001, and twice that the next year. The level of such payouts has not pleased the insurance industry, which has taken steps to limit coverage for mold damage.
 ''Mold has been around longer than humans,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, president and chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute. ''The entirety of our existence has been in the company of mold. Why had insurance adjusters never seen a mold claim before 2002? It wasn't because a new strain of mold had been unleashed upon the earth. It was the trial lawyers.''
 Most homeowners policies have caps for mold damage, but do cover water damage. ''It was never the intent of policies to cover mold,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''The vast majority of mold is failure to perform some kind of maintenance.''
 ''If a tree comes into your house and it takes a few weeks to repair the water damage, the mold resulting from that water damage would be covered,'' he said. ''But it has to be mold that happened just because of the water damage.''
 And the only way to prove that is to call your insurer quickly. ''It's incumbent on you as a homeowner to report damage as quickly as possible to the insurer,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''First, it helps to keep the damage from getting worse. Second, if you wait it becomes harder to see which damage was caused by the incident and which was not.''
 Mr. Hartwig was speaking from his son's Little League game in Elmsford where, he noted, the Saw Mill River had done some recent damage. He said this is the time to buy flood insurance, which is distinct from homeowner's insurance. ''Because it takes 30 days for a policy to go into effect,'' he explained, ''and most of the floods are from remnants of tropical storms. And we're coming up on tropical storm season.''
 Mr. Weitz makes his way slowly through the Bacals' house, from bottom to top. He notes a kitchen cabinet ''delaminated'' by a nail puncture in the dishwasher hose. He wields a digital moisture meter -- eerily reminiscent of the Geiger counters in old science fiction movies -- to see if a stain on the garage ceiling is a new leak or an old one.
 ''Every building shows a history,'' he says, ''and it's your job to find out if the history is ancient or recent.''
 Mr. Weitz started out as a contractor, but became absorbed in environmental issues. ''I've probably done 3,000 inspections,'' he says. His company, RTK, does not do remediation, just detection. Checking for mold and then charging to remove it would be a conflict of interest, he says.
 He developed his soothing manner out of necessity. ''We get some people who call who are literally in tears,'' he says. ''And that is really not the exception.''
 When Traci Ludwig, the owner, with her husband, Michael, of an 1884 house in Mamaroneck, called in the mold people a few years ago, she was only mildly hysterical.
 ''We had white and fuzzy mold, we had brown mottled mold, we had black mold,'' she said. ''It was a scientific study of mold.''
 It was all in the wine cellar -- the only room in the basement that had been redone by the previous owner.
 ''Sometime in the 1960s the previous owner had put in walls,'' Ms. Ludwig said. ''There were beautiful old wine casks and shelves.''
 There was also water, leaking from the terrace above and dampening the new plasterboard. 
 ''We moved in on Friday, the 13th of December, in 2002,'' Ms. Ludwig said. ''There was no mold smell. As the months got warmer, we were overcome by a very strong smell. The children were coughing. After some thinking we put it together and realized they and we were probably breathing in mold spores.''
 After testing, Ms. Ludwig called an environmental firm in Scarsdale. ''They put tarps in the yard, and men in white suits kept going in and out,'' she said.
 Today the mold is gone, and so is the wine cellar. ''It's just an empty room at the moment,'' Ms. Ludwig said. 
 In suburban Connecticut, the owner of a 10-year-old house with a 5,000-square-foot basement moved his 1,200-bottle wine collection to the garage when he found mold on the wallboard behind the basement paneling after some minor flooding. He estimated that he had spent more than $100,000 diagnosing and eradicating the mold problem and returning his basement to its original condition. But he's still not sure why he responded the way he did.
 ''I grew up on a farm, and mold was everywhere. I certainly didn't feel any side effects,'' he said. ''But the issue now is, if you're going to sell a house, you have to take care of these things. The industry has done a good job of marketing itself.''
 The homeowner spoke on condition of anonymity -- not a rare occurrence, in the murky world of mold.
 Gary Stone, a mold remediator whose company, Homeguard Environmental, operates out of Stamford, said he deals with privacy issues all the time. ''Last week a woman said, 'Do you have unmarked trucks? Because I saw a truck in front of my neighbor's house that said Toilet Doctor.' '' 
 You won't be seeing trucks with decorative spores painted on them anytime soon.
 ''It's hard,'' Mr. Weitz says. ''Mold is like a personal issue somehow. People don't want to share.''
 But Mr. Weitz loves to share. ''As much as a fungus can have a personality, I suppose mold does,'' he says. ''I'm fascinated by mold. I could bore you for hours with all things mold. My wife says, 'Bob, you're a lot of fun at a cocktail party.' ''
 NOW Mr. Weitz is in the yard of the Bacals' house, noting where shrubs are too close to the walls, where drainage away from the house is insufficient, where roof tiles are missing. With our mold consciousness raised, we notice some greenish scum around the deck. 
 ''Green is algae,'' Mr. Weitz says. ''Algae is O.K.''
 The Bacals learned the results of their testing within a week of Mr. Weitz's visit. Some spores found in the lower level were Stachybotrys, the scary mold. They're getting estimates from remediation companies. They're not terribly concerned.
 ''I did get down on my hands and knees, and I saw some black smutty stuff,'' said Mr. Bacal, who has been using an air filtration device he bought online to try to mitigate his acid reflux and sinus pain, symptoms he thinks could be environmental in origin. 
 Would he ever think of getting rid of his three cats?
 ''Oh, definitely I'm not getting rid of the cats,'' he said. ''They're family.''
 His doorbell rang.
 ''Oops, got to go,'' he said. ''That's the guys who're coming to take care of my mice.'' Getting to Know Mold 
 THERE are 800 to 1,000 identified molds, according to L. Claire Macdonald, laboratory manager at SanAir Technologies Laboratory, a microbial testing firm in Richmond, Va. ''When you actually see mold with the naked eye, it's just a bunch of spores stuck together,'' she said. ''It's kind of known in the industry that you can't tell by looking at it what species a particular mold is.''
 Ms. Macdonald's laboratory analyzes the spores trapped in the air-monitoring devices used by microbial inspectors in the buildings they check for mold. The most common genuses of mold in homes are Aspergillus, Penicillium and Cladosporum, she said. Each also manifests in various species, as in Aspergillus parasiticus. Rarer but scarier is Stachybotrys, the mold that is often called ''toxic.''
 But toxic is as toxic does, according to Ms. Macdonald. While Stachybotrys has been associated with illness, its presence says something else to mold experts. ''Stachy is considered a water indicator mold,'' Ms. Macdonald said. ''It requires higher levels of water to grow, so if you see it there must be a water problem.''
 Ultimately, if you have water where water shouldn't be, as a result of a flood, a leak, a sewage backup or a fire, you may need a mold inspection. Other reasons to check for mold, according to Robert Weitz, a microbial inspector: dampness in the basement, an odd odor, especially on the lower levels of your house, or water that has stayed behind a wall or under a floor for more than 24 hours -- the time it takes a well-hydrated mold colony to sprout.
 Increasingly, prospective home buyers want mold checkups. ''You want to know, 'Am I buying somebody's mold problem which I'm not seeing?' '' Mr. Weitz said.
 Mold likes to hide, which is one reason it makes such a stubborn adversary, whether it's toxic or just foul.
 ''People want to know, 'Do I have toxic mold or don't I?' '' Ms. Macdonald said. ''The issue is, does the mold produce mycotoxins? Mycotoxins are chemicals emitted by fungi.''
 Are mycotoxins dangerous to breathe? Despite a raft of court cases involving mold, nobody really knows.
 ''We have a lot to learn in this field,'' Ms. McDonald said. ''You can get sick from ingestion, but we're not so sure about inhalation.'' SUSAN STEWART

HEADLINE: Trans-Atlantic Bargains Begin

BYLINE: By JENNIFER CONLIN

 BODY:
Is there about to be a price war among airlines flying the intensely competitive New York-London route? Zoom Airlines, which has been operating low-fare flights from Britain to Canada for three years, is starting service between London and New York on June 21. The company will offer daily flights between Gatwick and J.F.K., with 25 percent of the seats sold for as little as as $199 each way, plus taxes. 
 Zoom is hoping its year-round one-way fares and increased flexibility (travelers do not have to stay over on a Saturday night) will give it an edge over other budget airlines that are expected to join the trans-Atlantic market following the recent ''open skies'' agreement.
Zoom will also offer a premium economy class for an extra $179, which includes extra leg-room, priority check-in, better meal service and free drinks. The London-New York route will use Boeing 767-300s, with 182 economy and 84 premium seats 
 Tickets for United States citizens will be available at the end of May on www.flyzoom.com.

HEADLINE: A Dot-Com City Comes Back After the Collapse

BYLINE: By JOSH SENS

 BODY:
ACRONYMS applied to up-and-coming urban neighborhoods often hint at grungy hipness, suggesting the presence of cutting-edge art galleries and underground nightclubs, with the promise of lattes and live-work lofts to come. 
 So it is with SoFA in San Jose. On a recent balmy evening, in the South First Street Area, throngs of moviegoers gathered at the California Theater, a renovated Art Deco building. Left for dead for decades, then brought back to life a few years ago with a computer mogul's millions, the theater is now the home of the local symphony and the opera. But on this March night, crowds had come for a screening of a small-budget Israeli feature, one of 450 entries in the Cinequest Film Festival, an annual event that draws independent movies from around the world.
A block away, salsa lessons kicked off at a corner dance club. Diners filled the booths of a retro-chic restaurant, where bow-tied waiters toted plates of veal piccata and eggplant Parmesan. It was happy hour at a nearby ''ultra lounge,'' whether or not patrons knew what was meant by ''ultra.'' 
 Inside the theater, the movie started: a young woman rode a scooter through a lifeless city. Shuttered storefronts. Silent streets. It wasn't long ago that you could have filmed the same scene in San Jose.
 ''After the dot-com bust, this city was a wasteland,'' said Cherri Lakey, who runs Anno Domini, a SoFA art gallery, with her partner, Brian Eder. ''But one of the upsides of a landscape like that is that you get to start from scratch.''
 Even before the tech implosion of the early 2000s, which snuffed out start-ups and sent vacancy rates soaring around the city, San Jose rarely ranked high on travelers' lists. Outsiders knew it largely for what it wasn't. It wasn't San Francisco (though it wasn't much more than a 40-minute drive away). It wasn't on the water. It wasn't a place they could locate easily on a map. 
 When, in 1989, San Jose surpassed San Francisco in population, the news did little more than reinforce the view of skeptics, who saw the self-proclaimed capital of Silicon Valley as anything but a capital of culture. It was, in their eyes, merely big and bland, an expanse of subdivisions spreading from a hollowed-out downtown. 
 That perception lingers still. ''Some people have called it an image problem,'' said Tom McEnery, a former mayor. ''But I never have. It's never been an image problem because we've always had a positive image of ourselves.'' 
 During his tenure, from 1983 to 1991, Mr. McEnery spearheaded an active civic effort to instill San Jose with a vital downtown. Slow to take root (then partly uprooted by an economic downturn and a corruption scandal that swept a more recent mayor out of office), those efforts have started to bear fruit. San Jose today is shaking off its past and its reputation, emerging as a city with a core and also a rich culture that appeals to travelers with eclectic tastes. 
 For starters, there are the museums. The San Jose Museum of Art stars in a constellation that ranges in focus from quilts and textiles to Mexican-American history and art. The Tech Museum of Innovation, befitting its Silicon Valley surroundings, offers visitors a hodgepodge of virtual experience, including a chance to ''arm wrestle'' with museumgoers in New York. 
 In a city that nurtures its art institutions, an underground art scene has also taken shape. Vacant buildings, which still blemish many downtown blocks, have been transformed into temporary exhibit space for local painters and sculptors, attractive place-holders until permanent tenants arrive.
 The best established of these spaces, an airy, engaging gallery called Kaleid, sits on South Fourth Street. Along with a collection of other downtown galleries, it stays open until 9 p.m. on First Fridays, a kind of roving art reception held on the first Friday of every month.
 By the stratospheric standards of Silicon Valley, San Jose ranks as affordable. How long it will remain so is a reasonable question as high-end condominium towers sprout downtown. These projects, once completed, are sure to be a boon to restaurateurs like the celebrity chef Michael Mina, who operates Arcadia, an innovative steakhouse, on the ground floor of the Marriott Hotel. A short walk from the Marriott stands a local favorite, the perpetually packed Original Joe's, which serves a throwback meat-and-potatoes menu at (again, relatively) throwback prices. Filet mignon is $26.95. 
 Downtown is flanked by the campus of San Jose State University and a cluster of SoFA nightclubs cater to the college-age crowd. Those with youthful spirits (but less delicate eardrums) often gravitate toward the Fahrenheit Ultra Lounge. ''Ultra'' is something of a hyperbolic reference to the less-than-ultra-surprising mix of offerings: cocktails, live music, full dinner menu. But, hey, you can get pan-seared scallops while you sip your gin.
 In 2005, San Jose christened a new city hall. The $374 million project, designed by Richard Meier, features a gleaming building of glass and steel, fronted by a 110-foot-highrotunda that calls to mind a planetarium George Jetson might attend. Historic photos of San Jose are on display inside. From the city hall plaza, another point of local pride stands in view: the Martin Luther King Jr. Library, run jointly by the city and the university. Downtown's jewel, however, sits a few blocks away in the SoFA district. A grand 1927 movie palace, the California Theater, closed in 1973 as flight to the suburbs sucked the life from downtown. It remained shuttered until 2004, when David Packard -- as in Hewlett-Packard -- put $75 million into its restoration. The lavish theater, with its Art Deco detailing and kaleidoscopic ceiling, is now the stage for Opera San Jose and the Symphony Silicon Valley. Less well known is the theater's counterpart in the performing arts, Le Petit Trianon, a rose-hued building patterned after the Versailles palace of the same name. An acoustic marvel, it stands across town on North Fifth Street and is the site of chamber music concerts. 
 Several years before the California Theater reopened and SoFA started showing a vital nighttime pulse, developers cut the ribbon on their own downtown, five minutes west of city hall by freeway. Santana Row, a large mall with high-end retail and residential space, was decried by critics as a kind of Stepford showpiece, a triumph of commerce over culture. Mr. Eder, co-owner of Anno Domini gallery, refers to it today as Satan's Row.
 ''When I travel to another city,'' Mr. Eder said, ''I'm not interested in seeing what their Gap looks like.'' 
 In fact, there is no Gap at Santana Row. But there are a Borders and a Tommy Bahama. And upscale restaurants such as Amber India, where curries crack the $20 price range, helping to cover the cost of the rose petals that waiters sprinkle across the bar. 
 On a recent Friday evening, as film festival ticket-holders streamed toward a SoFA screening, Santana Row, too, had begun stirring, like a sister city in an alternate universe. Shoppers swarmed Starbucks and Urban Outfitters. In an outdoor courtyard, a suburban restyling of a European town square, a pianist played pop standards. A line formed at the front door of Pasta Pomodoro, an Italian restaurant chain.
 A traveler, in other words, could understand the critics. But shuttling from one spot to another -- from the artsy, acronym-worthy downtown districts to the spit-shined storefronts of Santana Row -- it did not seem surprising that San Jose had managed to embrace such contrasts. In a city this big, each could succeed in its own way. A NEW IMAGE WHERE TO STAY 
 Hotel Montgomery, 211 South First Street, (408) 825-0530; www.hotelmontgomerysj.com. The only hotel in Silicon Valley with an outdoor boccie court, the Montgomery goes a long way to keep things young and fun, with a buzzing bar and restaurant just off the lobby. It is in the heart of downtown, a short walk from major museums. The hotel's 86 rooms start at $129.
 Hotel Valencia, 355 Santana Row, (866) 842-0100; www.hotelvalenica.com. An upscale hotel in the heart of an upscale shopping plaza, the Valencia has plushly appointed rooms for demanding travelers and a rooftop wine bar, Cielo, for travelers who need less sleep. Ayoma, a spa on the hotel's fifth floor, specializes in Indian ayurveda treatments. The 212 rooms start at $199.
 Hotel De Anza, 233 West Santa Clara Street, (800) 843-3700; www.hoteldeanza.com. A historic downtown hotel with stately architecture and comfortable guestrooms, the De Anza appeals largely to business travelers. Its 100 rooms start at $139. WHERE TO EAT 
 Arcadia, 100 West San Carlos Street, (408) 278-4555; www.michaelmina.net. The chef Michael Mina takes playful turns at surf and turf at this tony, unpretentious restaurant on the ground floor of the Marriott Hotel. Dishes range from lobster pot pie (price varies) to a $16 Kobe burger to whole fried chicken ($26 a person) carved tableside and served for two. 
 Original Joe's, 301 South First Street, (408) 292-7030; www.originaljoes.com. Open since 1956, this restaurant, ancient by downtown dining standards, attracts a family crowd. Many are there for the retro atmosphere, but the reasonable prices and charcoal-grilled meats make the place appealing in other ways.

 CORRECTION:
The Next Stop column on May 20 about a cultural revival in San Jose, Calif., misstated the amount and the donor of a gift to help restore the California Theater there. It was $25 million -- not $75 million -- and it was given by the Packard Humanities Institute, not by David Packard, who is president of the institute.

HEADLINE: From HBO to Chips, Airlines Go a la Carte

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
THIS summer, be sure to pack some extra cash in your carry-on. More airlines are starting to charge for services that used to be free on many carriers. 
 Skybus Airlines, a new carrier based in Columbus, Ohio, that plans to take to the skies this Tuesday, promises low fares but will charge extra for everything from soft drinks ($2) to bag checking ($5 apiece for the first two bags) to early boarding privileges ($10 a person, except for those with disabilities).
Next month, Spirit Airlines, based in Fort Lauderdale, will begin charging for bag checking and onboard beverages, which had been free. It's also moving to a single-class cabin but renaming its business class Big Front Seat and charging a premium for the larger seats. 
 Meanwhile, nearly every major carrier has done away with free onboard meals in coach on domestic flights, and has instead begun to charge for individual food and drink items, often at hotel minibar prices. Earlier this year, American Airlines, for example, replaced its $4 snack boxes offered on domestic flights of three hours or longer with offerings like Lay's Stax Potato Crisps ($3), M&Ms ($3) and bottled water ($2) and now sells them on domestic flights of two hours or longer. On longer flights within the United States, American offers $5 light meals like breakfast bagel sandwiches, Italian wraps or Asian chicken salads.
 ''What the airlines are doing is basically the same thing as if you go to a typical hotel or movie theater,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel analyst at Forrester Research. ''Your room rate includes the room you want. If you want an in-room movie you're going to pay for that. If you want breakfast you're going to pay for that. A movie ticket includes the seat. The popcorn is extra.'' The airlines, he added, ''are finally realizing that not everybody sitting in the economy cabin wants or needs to have the same experience.''
 Airlines say it's a way to keep fares low while giving customers exactly what they pay for. ''Why should your ticket price include your neighbor's dinner?'' Skybus said on its Rules of Flying fact sheet. But charging separately for seats and services is also a way to increase ancillary revenue, and it's a tactic that has been gaining popularity among airlines looking for ways to dig out of bankruptcy or stay profitable. 
 Delta added a dedicated HBO channel to its in-flight entertainment system just this month and is charging domestic coach passengers $5 per feature film and $2 for television programs. A new cocktail service costs $5 a glass for domestic coach-class passengers. Some airlines are even charging passengers to reserve the most coveted seats for them. Northwest Airlines began charging passengers $15 to reserve some of the better coach-class seats, like exit row seats, on domestic flights last year. United Airlines charges a premium to sit in the Economy Plus section, which gives passengers five extra inches of leg room. 
 Air Canada has perhaps taken the a la carte pricing concept the furthest. For example, the airline's cheapest tickets, called Tango, come with minimal flexibility and earn just 50 percent nonelite frequent flier miles. The most expensive, Executive Class, come with all the perks including meals, lounge access, unlimited itinerary changes, and 150 percent Air Canada Status Miles. Customers can also pick and choose from a list of add-ons like seat assignments and bag checking or forgo those options for savings. 
 Amadeus, which provides software and a booking engine for such creative pricing, says that more than 20 airlines, mostly international, are using its Flex Pricer technology to help maximize revenue and distinguish themselves from other carriers. 
 ''Airlines are looking at ways of differentiating themselves and bringing value back to what has largely been a commoditized product over the last several years,'' said Robert Buckman, director of airline distribution strategy at Amadeus North America. 
 A la carte pricing also tends to boost the bottom line. ''Given the choice,'' said Mr. Buckman, ''consumers will pick the best choice for them, and it's not always the lowest price.'' He added that an analysis of 10 Amadeus clients who used a la carte pricing saw ticket revenues increase more than 32 percent across the board in the first three months, representing more than $200 million in additional sales for the carriers. 
 Las Vegas-based Allegiant Air, which charges for extras like snacks, checked bags and reservations by telephone, has experienced growth of ancillary revenues to $31.3 million last year from $11.2 million in 2005 and $3.1 million in 2004. The airline, which caters to leisure travelers flying to destinations like Las Vegas; Orlando, Fla.; and Tampa, Fla., also sells tchotchkes like $5 Elvis sunglasses and other products like $15 beach towels on board. On its Web site, it also sells hotel rooms, car rentals and show tickets, offering up options tailored to passenger itineraries.
 As airlines move to this approach of selling services separately, customers should be wary of unexpected wrinkles. Spirit Airlines sells travel insurance from AIG Travel Guard at the time of the airline ticket purchase. But instead of letting the traveler decide to buy, the insurance is already included in the final price, forcing the traveler to opt out or uncheck the selection to avoid paying the $12 insurance fee. (AIG Travel Guard says customers who realize later that they failed to drop the insurance have up to 15 days to cancel and receive a full refund, as long as it is prior to their departure and no claim has been filed.) And Skybus, while touting its food offerings, is telling customers not to bring their own food ''unless you brought enough for the whole plane.'' 
 AIRLINES say that a la carte pricing allows passengers to customize their flight experiences by picking and choosing what they want to pay for. But unless customers get something in return that wasn't free before, or a reduction in price that compensates for the charges, the separate fees amount to price hikes. 
 ''They're not doing you a favor,'' said Joe Brancatelli, the publisher of the subscription travel Web site www.joesentme.com. ''They're trying to get more revenue.'' And although it may appear that the airlines are lowering fares, he added, simply charging more for services that were once included in the base fare is ''effectively, raising the cost you're paying to fly.'' 
 Not all airlines are going a la carte. Continental is one of the few that still offers hot meals on domestic flights and continues to have blankets and pillows available for passengers. And JetBlue, which offers complimentary Dunkin' Donuts coffee and satellite television on all its flights, has no plans to begin charging for these extras. 
 ''In fact,'' said Bryan Baldwin, a JetBlue spokesman, ''we continue to look at ways to enhance customer experience without charging customers to do it.''

HEADLINE: Illegal Migrants Dissect Details Of Senate Deal

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD and JULIA PRESTON; Randal C. Archibold reported from Tucson, and Julia Preston from New York.

DATELINE: TUCSON, May 19 

 BODY:
Under the shade of a mesquite tree here one morning this week, waiting for work that did not come, Elias Ramirez weighed the hurdles of what could be the biggest overhaul in immigration law in two decades.
 To become full legal residents, under a compromise Senate leaders announced Thursday, Mr. Ramirez and other illegal immigrants would have to pay a total of $5,000 in fines, more than 14 times the typical weekly earnings on the streets here, return to their home countries at least once, and wait as long as eight years. During the wait, they would have limited possibilities to bring other family members.
 ''Well, it sounds difficult, but not impossible,'' said Mr. Ramirez, 24, a native of Chiapas, Mexico, who has been here a year. ''I would like to be here legally in the future, so these things are what I might have to do.''
 Another man among the group gathered outside a church here that serves as a hiring site for day laborers overheard Mr. Ramirez and approached with disdain. 
 ''It's almost impossible to bring your family,'' he said, rattling off information he had gleaned from a Spanish-language newspaper. ''You have to go back first, and what are you going to do in Mexico while you are there and there is no work? I've been here 20 years and I still work and support my family, so why would I do any of these things?'' 
 The compromise bill has offered a glimmer of hope to illegal immigrants here, 60 miles from the border, and elsewhere. But they and others, through news reports, advocates and lawyers, are just now learning the fine print.
 Advocacy groups here said they would lobby lawmakers to reject the bill, saying it would place onerous restrictions on illegal workers who want to win legal status and also hurt efforts to unify immigrant families. 
 ''This is an unprecedented shift from family unity being the cornerstone of our immigration policy,'' said Isabel Garcia, a lawyer and a chairwoman of Derechos Humanos, an advocacy group here. Ms. Garcia also objected to what she called ''insurmountable'' obstacles in the bill.
 The compromise Senate bill proposes an initiative to give legal status to an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants. It also portends a major shift in the priorities and values of American immigration for the future. It would gradually change a system based primarily on family ties, in place since 1965, into one that favors high-skilled and highly educated workers who want to become permanent residents.
 In the future, low-skilled workers like the men waiting for work here would largely be channeled to a vast new temporary program, where they would be allowed to work in the United States for three stints of two years each, broken up by one-year stays in their homeland. 
 ''This is a different architecture,'' said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, and commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1993 to 2000.
 Illegal workers already here would gain a provisional legal status, known as a Z visa, fairly quickly. But to become permanent residents they would have to pay the big fines and get in an eight-year line behind others who have already applied legally for green cards, as permanent resident visas are known.
 Still, despite the outcry from immigrant advocates, a reading of the details of the legislation suggests important benefits for relatives of legal immigrants and naturalized American citizens who have been waiting for green cards for as long as 22 years in some cases.
 A first step is to eliminate, within eight years, the backlog of 4 million people who have applied to come legally to the United States, allotting 440,000 visas a year for that purpose, according to summaries provided by the Department of Homeland Security and the office of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who was a chief author of the bill.
 ''We are adding to our family-based system, we are not substituting merit for family,'' said Laura Capps, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kennedy. 
 After the backlog is cleared, a slowly increasing number of permanent visas would be approved through a merit system, based on points granted for English language proficiency (an acute hurdle for the men waiting for work here, as none spoke English), level of education and job skills, among other factors. 
 Siblings and adult children of legal immigrants will no longer be able to apply for visas, and visas for parents of United States citizens will be limited to 40,000 a year. 
 In his weekly radio address on Saturday, President Bush said that the measure ''will improve security at our borders. It will give employers new tools to verify the employment status of workers and hold businesses to account for those they hire.''
 Mr. Bush added, ''The legislation will clear the backlog of family members who've applied to come to our country lawfully, and have been waiting patiently in line. This legislation will end chain migration by limiting the relatives who can automatically receive green cards to spouses and minor children. And this legislation will transform our immigration system so that future immigration decisions are focused on admitting immigrants who have the skills, education, and English proficiency that will help America compete in a global economy.''
 The immigration debate has long stirred politics, sometimes dividing members of the same party and forcing lawmakers to reconsider positions. This bill is no different.
 Last year, as he sought re-election, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, a Republican, was critical of giving illegal immigrants legal status. But this week Mr. Kyl stood with John McCain, Arizona's senior senator and a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, as the compromise was announced, saying ideological sacrifices had to be made.
 The proposal, though, divided the two Democratic members of Congress from here in southern Arizona, Gabrielle Giffords and Raul M. Grijalva.
 Ms. Giffords called it a positive step while Mr. Grijalva, whose father was a migrant farm worker, told The Arizona Daily Star it was ''tentative and unfinished.''
 In south Tucson, outside the Southside Presbyterian Church, where immigrants -- mostly men -- have gathered for decades to find work, the immigration debate is also playing out as the men wait for jobs.
 There are people like Mr. Ramirez, who spent several years just over the border in Sonora before finally coming to Arizona for construction and other work. He has not seen his family, he said, for 10 years.
 Sipping from a bottle filled with ice as the day's heat soared, Mr. Ramirez occasionally broke away when pickup trucks and other vehicles approached, joining others begging for a day's work.
 The biggest obstacle, Mr. Ramirez said, would probably be paying the $5,000 in fines on the way to permanent legal status. He does not have health insurance now, which he would be required to provide for his family if he decided to return to Mexico and come back as a temporary worker. ''I don't know who sells that or what it costs,'' he said.
 Still, all in all, ''the important thing is saving. The fines are similar to what we pay polleros,'' Mr. Ramirez said, using a Spanish slang term for the smugglers who guide people across the border.
 Teoforo Valdes, 32, nodded in agreement. He has lived in and around Tucson for 10 years and still makes occasional trips home to Sonora, evading the Border Patrol.
 But Mr. Valdes has grown tired of the journey, he said, and, at least upon first look at the proposal, sees reason for optimism.
 ''Right now, we have nothing, no real way to legalize ourselves,'' he said. ''This government is giving us steps and so we have to think how we can take them.''
 As the morning wore on, the number of potential employers driving past grew thin. The workers began to disperse, though some stayed behind to use the bathroom and a shower at the church.
 Jesus Antonio Rodriguez, 49, who said he was a legal resident and acts as an informal adviser to the men, summed up the dilemma.
 ''People do not believe it but we really do come to work,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''We are not delinquents here. We have to work. And we want to cooperate, but everything is always so hard here.''

HEADLINE: Where Two Rivers Converge and Two Histories Divide

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: CAIRO, Ill. 

 BODY:
Four city workers set out this morning to whack the weeds sprouting several inches high from the deserted downtown sidewalks. With machines whining, they inch down Eighth Street, trimming in front of the grand Gem Theater, empty, in front of the florist's, empty, around the entranceway tiles that spell out the name of Michelson, the jeweler, empty.
 They make their way to Commercial Avenue, where rows of old buildings stand vacant or abandoned. Behind the brick facades, which evoke a silent movie set waiting still for the shout of ''Action!,'' sunlight pours through collapsed ceilings, and trees grow from broken floors. 
If inclined, the workers could step into a trashed old tavern, there before their great-grandfathers were born, or peruse the peeling tin ceiling of an ancient shop across the street. But with appearances to maintain, they whack that purple-flowered plant rising near the lobby of Maxine's clothing store, empty.
 The small city of Cairo does not need another wide-eyed pilgrim passing through, whispering, Oh my God. Its people have better ways of spending their time than explaining, yet again, why the place looks the way it does. 
 But this is the dilemma of Cairo, defined as much by its proud and shameful history as by its position at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. Since it entices visitors with billboards celebrating selected points of historical interest, it must endure the painful questions that arise from glancing beyond those selected points.
 ''The long-range goal is to restore some of those buildings,'' says Judson Childs, the recently elected mayor. ''How far down the road that is, I don't know.''
 He says this with a justified hint of weariness, because the road has already been long and hard for Cairo (pronounced CARE-oh), a place once accustomed to being at the center of America.
 Lewis and Clark camped near here in 1803. Charles Dickens called it ''a dismal swamp'' in 1842, a rating that Mark Twain upgraded to ''brisk town'' in 1883. By then it was a thriving port, its location having already proved advantageous to merchants and, in the Civil War, to Ulysses S. Grant and the Union Army -- even though, sitting at the bottom of Illinois, it has always been a Southern town uneasy in Northern garb. 
 By the early 20th century, the triangular city seemed on the verge of urban distinction, blessedly situated, possessing at least two ingredients necessary for a great metropolis, affluence and bawdiness. But various factors conspired against Cairo, including Cairo itself.
 The river water seeped, the riverfront economy declined, and the river-locked geography thwarted industrial growth. Then the Great Depression hit, and the population, which had peaked at more than 15,000, began to shrink. Cairo no longer wore its hat cocked.
 Eventually, a civil rights struggle in the late 1960s exposed Cairo as a simmering, segregated town that blocked its sizable black population from having any say in government. Armed conflict and a protracted business boycott by black residents marked those ugly years.
 The city continued to bleed people and businesses. Poverty took root. A casino opportunity went elsewhere. For the past four years, the previous mayor and City Council members fought so vehemently that police officers often stood near the door at meetings, just in case.
 ''Nothing got done,'' Barbara Wilson, the managing editor of The Cairo Citizen, says. ''Not anything. Nothing.''
 Preston Ewing Jr., a native of Cairo who was the president of the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. during the strife, says that some white residents still blame the boycott for the city's decline. ''Of course, of course, of course, civil rights killed this town,'' he says, his impatience with the thought reflected in his every word.
 The idea that the fight for justice killed Cairo is clearly a sore subject. With his tone changing to matter-of-fact, Mr. Ewing recites census data and presents old newspaper articles that he says demonstrate an exodus ''irrespective of civil rights and boycotts.'' 
 Now 73, still lanky but with hair gone gray, he stands in the foyer of what is essentially his second home, the majestic Cairo Public Library, a red-brick and stained-glass remnant of the city's glory days that he did not enter until he was well into his 30s. Segregation, you see.
 Last month, when Mr. Childs, a retired corrections supervisor, became the city's first black mayor -- something he takes pains not to emphasize -- he appointed Mr. Ewing city treasurer, a job Mr. Ewing had held in an earlier administration. They and the City Council now oversee a city so mired in problems that students from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale earn credits trying to come up with solutions.
 For one thing, no one can afford demolition. So, in the residential area, historic mansions and well-maintained homes sit beside abandoned mansions and decrepit homes -- eerie reminders that only 3,600 now live in a city designed for 15,000. Even the hospital stands empty.
 Still, for all its troubles and past sins, this city has its protectors. Mr. Ewing presses promotional brochures into a visitor's hand. The town librarian, Monica Smith, works overtime preserving the Custom House and other architectural gems. A musician named Stace England spent years soaking in the history, the good and the bad, before producing a CD two years ago called ''Greetings From Cairo, Illinois.'' The only problem: You can't find anywhere in Cairo to buy one.
 As the morning sun arcs higher over Commercial Avenue, those city workers continue whacking sidewalk weeds, buzzing their way toward Marcy's Shoes (''Modern Shoe Service''), empty, and the old neon sign for the Rhodes Burford furniture store, empty. 
 Soon their machines fall silent. That Cairo quiet returns. And a city of history awaits the next wide-eyed pilgrim.

HEADLINE: Help Could Be at Hand

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
BORROWERS facing higher interest rates on adjustable-rate loans may hear something unexpected from lenders in the coming months: an offer of help. But just how much help they will get is still uncertain.
 Earlier this month, a group of prominent mortgage lenders and servicers said they would start writing to borrowers with high-interest loans to determine if they were having trouble making their payments. The loans in question are adjustable-rate mortgages that carry low initial interest for a short period, usually three years or less. After the introductory period, the rates rise to the 8 or 9 percent range, and higher still in later years.
After a meeting with Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, the lenders and the companies that collect the borrowers' payments said they would review their files to identify borrowers with high-interest ARMs. (The loans are often referred to as ''subprime,'' even though many borrowers with prime credit ratings took them out because they were not aware that they could qualify for better terms.) 
 Litton Loan Servicing, a Houston company that collects mortgage payments for 400,000 mortgages, many of them subprime, said that in some cases it would be willing to freeze the borrowers' interest rates for up to two years. 
 ''We're being more proactive than we've been historically,'' said Larry Litton Jr., the company's chief executive. ''We're trying to protect the investors' interests, and keep the borrower in their home.''
 Mr. Litton said that foreclosure rates among his clients had jumped in the greater New York area over the last year. ''We think this will absolutely make a difference,'' he said.
 Some affordable-housing advocates are not as sanguine. ''We do see some servicers working very hard with borrowers to keep a stable situation,'' said Sarah Gerecke, the chief executive of the nonprofit Neighborhood Housing Services of New York City. ''And in those situations, they can make a huge difference.''
 But Ms. Gerecke said many loan servicing companies were unsure how much latitude they had to modify the terms of loans on behalf of the investors who hold the loans. 
 Mr. Litton said that for most of the loans in his portfolio, he had unlimited discretion to modify the loan terms. But others in the industry do not have the same freedom. Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase, said that bank had not yet received clear signals from major mortgage investors about how much relief the bank can offer borrowers.
 ''The challenge, which might not have been true 20 years ago, is that servicers don't have as much control over the loan,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''It's not like they can talk to three people at the local bank and do it.''
 But banks and investors are under some pressure because legislators have pledged to pass laws to protect subprime borrowers against foreclosures. Earlier this month, for instance, Massachusetts enacted a temporary moratorium on foreclosures against homeowners who have filed complaints with state banking regulators. Many subprime borrowers, in particular, have complained that lenders hid the true costs of their loans. 
 In the meantime, a borrower with a subprime loan whose rate is about to be adjusted upward can call or write the loan servicing company and ask about revising the mortgage terms. 
 Jason Allnut, a vice president of Fannie Mae, which buys mortgages from lenders and resells them to investors, said that even servicing companies that cannot revise loan terms might be able to switch a borrower to a completely new mortgage. Under Fannie Mae's HomeStay initiative, for instance, borrowers struggling with their current loans can often qualify for better loan terms. 
 ''It may not modify their current loan,'' Mr. Allnut said, ''but it accomplishes the same thing.''
