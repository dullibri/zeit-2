HEADLINE: Romania's Port Cities 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I wish that your Sept. 21 news article about Romania ("Down the Danube" series), when referring to Sulina, Romania, and the Danube Delta people, had also mentioned their Roman, Greek and Byzantine heritage and the city's historic past and commercial importance. 
 The Balkan crisis took a heavy toll on Romania's port cities. These cities and the delta hold great prospects for economic development.
Along with tourism potential, the area offers economic opportunities through the port of Constanta and the free trade zone along the Danube-Black Sea Channel, which shortens the way to the Bosporus and the Middle East.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Cooking It Up in Swedish, With a Touch of Japanese

BYLINE:  By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
MARCUS SAMUELSSON, the executive chef and co-owner of Aquavit, is munching on a green-tea doughnut in the bustling kitchen of the Midtown restaurant where his take on Scandinavian cuisine has brought him huge celebrity.
 He is certainly not one to run out of ideas. But what is this green-tea doughnut? 
 "I wanted America to meet Japan," says Mr. Samuelsson, as he arranges three doughnuts, just so, on a square plate before spooning amber-hued fruit chutney into a vertical line and drizzling cinnamon cream atop the chutney. "It's all about shapes, lines. The focal point is the green-tea doughnut. Boom! That's the star of it all." 
Perhaps an explanation is in order. Mr. Samuelsson, a 32-year-old Swede, likes to stir things up. He is opening a Japanese-American restaurant, Riingo, a playful take on the Japanese word for apple. The restaurant is set to open in November at 205 East 45th Street in the Alex Hotel, which is under construction.
Riingo is but one of many projects on his plate. He has a cookbook, "Aquavit and the New Scandinavian Cuisine," due out Oct. 2 (Houghton Mifflin). He is also a good-will ambassador for Unicef.
But back to that doughnut. He rocks on a red-sneakered heel, then says enthusiastically, "This is good; this is killer."
Even in the very multiculti kitchen of Aquavit, where about 25 cooks converse in about 30 languages, Mr. Samuelsson, who speaks four languages, stands out. Leanly built, with coffee-brown skin and fashionable chin stubble, he wears blue jeans, an embroidered shirt and a wide belt, a seat belt. "American Airlines, baby!" he says, proudly patting the vintage purchase.
Much is known about Mr. Samuelsson: that he was born in Ethiopia and orphaned at age 3 when his family fell victim to a tuberculosis epidemic; how he and his older sister were adopted by a young Swedish couple, a geologist and a homemaker, and raised in an middle-class household in the port city of Goteborg. His Swedish grandmother, the private cook for a wealthy family, ignited his passion for cooking.
"I think I saw the back of my grandmother more than the front of her," he says, recalling how he quizzed her in the kitchen.
Mr. Samuelsson had apprenticed in Switzerland and Austria when he first came to Aquavit in 1991 for an eight-month apprenticeship. The stint was followed by a position at the three-star restaurant Georges Blanc, in Lyon, France. He returned to Aquavit in 1994 and was appointed executive chef in 1995 when his predecessor, Jan Sendel, died unexpectedly. Within a few months, the restaurant was awarded three stars by The New York Times. He was 24.
The accolades have been steady. This year, he was named the best chef in New York City by the James Beard Foundation, and recognized as one of the "Global Leaders for Tomorrow" by the World Economic Forum. Why? He says he doesn't know precisely.
On this day, when he bounds into Aquavit, a former Rockefeller town house on West 54th Street, he apologizes for a slight lateness. He was in Chinatown, meeting and having tea with vendors in food shops while a film crew from Food Network Canada trailed him.
In the light-filled central dining room, Mr. Samuelsson is at ease and animated. He takes a bite from a gravlax club sandwich. "I feel a sense of arrival," he says with a faint Swedish accent. "But I will never feel comfortable. An artist should never feel comfortable."
HE has been planning Riingo for three years, and says that combining modern American dining with Japanese cuisine seemed like a natural. "Sushi might be the pizza of this decade. Sushi is a natural extension of what we eat."
He says he has long had a love affair with Japanese cuisine.
Speaking of love affairs, can he explain the red lipstick on his cheek? He rubs it off, speculating that an elderly businesswoman at the next table planted it. Nah, it is pointed out, he came in with the smooch mark.
He is asked about his love life. He looks up, startled. But why? People magazine placed him in the Top 5 of the nation's Top 100 most eligible bachelors in 2000. And his hunky reputation certainly was enhanced when he posed nearly nude in a Vita-Mix blender advertisement a few years ago. (He thinks he wore a Speedo but can't remember.) "Almost every great chef has done it now," he says.
Mr. Samuelsson, who lives on the West Side near Central Park, says he is not dating anyone but is drawn to women who are creative, open-minded and naturally kind. In his spare time, he paints, plays soccer and hangs out with artist friends. But for now, his preoccupation is his work: "I think it's a really cool time."
He has become the public face of new Scandinavian cuisine, and he happens to be black. Does he weary of the inevitable questions about race?
"I've never focused my career on that," he says. "I've got enough on my plate, and if I keep working hard, more stuff will come. I can't say it's a nonfactor, but I'm not going to be the one to label it and bring it up."
It is time to show off Riingo, so out the door he goes, striding briskly. The restaurant is a shell of steel beams, wires and dirt. Even though its opening has been delayed a couple of times, he does not look worried. He is smiling.
Got something to share? "I have a lot of things to be positive about. I love what I do."

HEADLINE: Who's Poor? Don't Ask the Census Bureau 

BYLINE:  By Jared Bernstein; Jared Bernstein is a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Today the Census Bureau will release the official poverty rate for 2002. While that figure is likely to indicate that the ranks of the poor have increased, it unfortunately won't really tell us much of anything about the true extent of poverty in America.
 The problem is that the official definition of poverty no longer provides an accurate picture of material deprivation. The current measure was created 40 years ago by a government statistician, Mollie Orshansky, and hasn't much changed since. "Anyone who thinks we ought to change it is perfectly right," Ms. Orshansky told an interviewer in 2001. 
 The current procedure takes the 1963 poverty thresholds for each given family size devised by Ms. Orshansky and updates them for inflation. For example, if the income of a family of four with two adults and two children fell below $18,244 last year, they were counted as poor by the bureau. Simple, yes, but there are two basic problems.
First, it fails to capture important changes in consumption patterns since the early 1960's. The research underlying the original thresholds was based on food expenditures by low-income families in 1955. Since her calculations showed that families then spent about a third of their income on food, Ms. Orshansky multiplied a low-income food budget by three to come up with her poverty line. But even she suspected this method underestimated what it took to meet basic needs, and was thus low-balling the poverty rate. 
And that mismeasurement has worsened over time, as food has become less expensive in relation to other needs like housing, health care and transportation, meaning the share of income spent on food by low-income families has fallen further.
The National Academy of Sciences has estimated what the Orshansky measure would look like today if it were updated for changes in consumption patterns, and found the threshold could be as much as 45 percent higher, implying higher poverty rates.
Second, the current measure leaves out some sources of income and some expenditures that weren't relevant when it was devised. The Census Bureau counts the value of cash transfers, like welfare payments, but it ignores the value of food stamps and health benefits, as well as newer tax credits that can significantly add to the income of low-end working families. Not only would taking these additions into consideration bring down the poverty rate figure, it would also provide a real measure of the effects of these antipoverty programs.
On the other side of the ledger, the current method also ignores important costs to low-income families. For example, these days many more women with young children participate in the labor force, yet the money they spend on child care is not factored into the poverty calculation.
If the Census Bureau's poverty findings were simply an accounting tool, these failures might not be important to anyone but economists and demographers. But the official figure plays an important role in determining eligibility for the federal and state safety nets: if we're not getting the measurement right, we're not providing services to the right people.
There is a better way, but of course it's a political hot potato. Census Bureau analysts have been working on alternative measures that take into account the changes in family life over the past four decades. The one I consider most reliable, because it factors in child-care costs for working parents, has shown poverty rates that average about 3 percent above the official figure, implying that there may be 9 million more Americans whose incomes are inadequate for their basic needs. 
Of course, no administration would want to adopt such a measure on its watch. The Census Bureau, to its credit, says it will release a few of its alternatives to the official measure today (although not one that adequately considers child-care costs), which may help poverty analysts get a more accurate picture. Still, the public and the news media will focus on the outdated official measure. 
While this may provide a vague sense that our poverty problem has worsened, it won't tell people as much as we could or should know about poverty in America.

HEADLINE: Home Sales Rose in August; Durable Goods Orders Fell 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Home sales unexpectedly rose and durable goods orders fell in August, reports released yesterday showed. The mixed results, economists said, help explain why companies still lack the confidence to hire.
 "Without follow-through from significant job growth and the income generation it begets, the current upsurge in consumer spending could be jeopardized," Cathy E. Minehan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in Dallas. 
 Americans bought new and existing homes at a record combined annual rate of 7.62 million in August, reports showed. Even with such signs of consumer confidence, economists said executives might stay cautious about hiring until demand grew more steadily. Orders for items made to last at least three years dropped unexpectedly by 0.9 percent last month, the Commerce Department said.
The number of Americans filing for first-time unemployment claims fell 19,000, to 381,000, last week while the less volatile four-week moving average stayed above 400,000, the level some economists call weak, the Labor Department said. 
"It will be a while before we can be sure that a self-sustaining expansion is under way of sufficient strength and persistence to put the economy back on a path toward full employment," Donald L. Kohn, a Fed governor, said Wednesday night.
Sales rose 5.5 percent for existing homes and 3.4 percent for new homes last month, reports showed yesterday. Both were forecast to decline. Durable goods orders had been forecast to rise 0.6 percent, to $175 billion.
Last week's jobless claims were the lowest since the 378,000 filed the week of Feb. 8, the Labor Department said. Hurricane Isabel kept about 9,000 workers from filing claims, the department said.
The durable goods orders decreased 0.9 percent, to $173.3 billion, after rising a revised 1.5 percent in July, the Commerce Department said. Excluding transportation equipment, orders fell 0.3 percent last month, after a revised 2.3 percent gain, to $122.3 billion, close to the $122.6 billion median forecast.
Sales of new and existing homes were both forecast to decline. Instead, both rose. The 6.47 million resales of single-family homes at an annual rate came after a July pace of 6.13 million, the National Association of Realtors said in Washington. New home sales rose 3.4 percent, to a 1.15 million rate, the Commerce Department said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Fall on Fears of Quarterly Reports

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell for the fourth day in five yesterday as some investors said they were concerned that profit growth would not be fast enough to justify the six-month rally that has lifted the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index 25 percent.
 Eastman Kodak plunged to an 18-year low after sharply reducing its dividend, the first such cut in its history. Tupperware fell after the company said it would have an unexpected loss this quarter. 
 Companies will report third-quarter financial results next month, and the prospect that earnings may fall short of forecasts has prompted some investors to sell shares each time the market rallied this week. The S.& P. 500 erased gains in the last hour of trading. 
"People are questioning the strength of the economic recovery, and they need to be reassured from the company commentary," said Robert L. Arnold, who helps manage more than $90 billion at Delaware Investments in Philadelphia.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 81.55 points, or 0.9 percent, to 9,343.96; Kodak contributed the most to the drop. The S.& P. 500 shed 6.11 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,003.27. The Nasdaq composite index decreased 26.46 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,817.24.
A government report showed that orders for durable goods dropped unexpectedly in August, while another indicated that the job picture was improving.
The S.& P. 500 has climbed 25 percent and the Dow has gained 24 percent since this year's low, on March 11.
Kodak lost $4.84, or 18 percent, to $22.15. Besides the dividend cut, investors also seemed disappointed in the company's plan to shift into digital imaging, ending a 123-year reliance on film. Three years of declining sales have began to limit Kodak's ability to pay debt and finance projects. The annual payout was cut to 50 cents a share from $1.80. Kodak has paid a dividend since 1902.
Tupperware tumbled $2.53, or more than 15 percent, to $13.81, for the second-biggest drop in the S.& P. 500 after Kodak. The company said it would lose 2 cents to 3 cents a share in the third quarter. Tupperware had been expected to earn 7 cents, the average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.
Darden Restaurants fell $2.62, or 12 percent, to $18.75. The company, which specializes in casual restaurants, said first-quarter net income fell to $68.6 million from $71.9 million a year earlier.
Flextronics International sank $1.10, or 7 percent, to $13.90. Beckman Coulter said it won a $934 million verdict by a state court jury in Orange Country, Calif., against Flextronics, the largest award in 2003, according to Bloomberg data. The jury found Flextronics defrauded Beckman in 2000 by breaking a five-year contract to supply it with circuit boards used in medical equipment.
Military stocks fell after Banc of America Securities reduced its ratings on them, saying continuing expenses in Iraq and a rising fiscal deficit are increasingly crimping the military budget. The budget's growth will slow to 2.9 percent by 2008 from 4.2 percent this year, Banc of America said.
Raytheon slipped 86 cents, or 3 percent, to $28.04. L-3 Communications Holdings declined $2.15, or nearly 5 percent, to $42.35. Northrop Grumman fell $1.08, or 1 percent, to $84.92.
Walt Disney added 50 cents, or more than 2 percent, to $20.31, after a Goldman, Sachs analyst raised his rating to outperform from in-line. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose for a sixth day in seven in New York trading after the unexpected drop in durable goods orders in August.
The note's yield, which moves inversely to its price and is a benchmark for borrowing rates, fell to the lowest in two months. 
By late in the day, the 10-year note gained 11/32, to 101 7/32. Its yield fell to 4.10 percent from 4.14 percent on Wednesday. And the 30-year bond rose 20/32, to 105 22/32. Its yield fell to 4.99 percent from 5.04 percent.

HEADLINE: Facing Death for Adultery, Nigerian Woman Is Acquitted 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: KATSINA, Nigeria, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
Amina Lawal, the Nigerian peasant woman whose case became known worldwide after she was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery, was acquitted today by the highest Islamic court in her state.
 A roar of approval swept through the small, sweltering courtroom when a five-member panel of judges ruled 4 to 1 to overturn Ms. Lawal's conviction in a case that had heaped worldwide opprobrium on Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and one in which the split between Muslims and Christians has become increasingly sharp. 
 Her veiled head bowed, Ms. Lawal sat quietly, holding in her lap what had been cited as the chief evidence of her crime: her daughter, Wasila, now almost 2 years old. Ms. Lawal was to be executed as soon as she had finished weaning the child. 
When a judge, Ibrahim Mai-Unguwa, finished his 60-minute recitation of the panel's ruling, Wasila let out an ear-splitting wail, as if to signal her relief.
Later in the day came cries of relief from distant corners of the world. Both Italy and Brazil had offered asylum to Ms. Lawal.
Mother and child were ushered into a side room immediately after the ruling and escorted out of the courtroom under heavy police guard.
Hauwa Ibrahim, one of Ms. Lawal's lawyers, beamed as she stepped out of the courtroom. "It is a victory for justice, it is a victory for the law, it is a victory for freedom," she said. "Amina is free today."
Ms. Lawal, who had been living at her father's home pending outcome of the appeal, was sentenced under Shariah, or Islamic law, which has swept across the country's largely Muslim north over the last three years. Human rights groups condemned her sentence as a violation of international treaties against torture, which Nigeria has signed. . The defense argued that death by stoning was not allowed under the Nigerian Constitution.
Today's ruling relieves Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, a born-again Christian from the heavily Yoruba region in the south. from having to intervene directly. Mr. Obasanjo had said that the country's Constitution would ultimately spare Ms. Lawal's life, a possibility that carried the potential for antagonizing his country's largely Muslim, ethnic Hausa north.
Ethnic violence is estimated to have killed some 10,000 Nigerians since 1999. Home to 120 million people, Nigeria is one of the world's biggest oil exporters and is a critical economic and political ally of the United States.
Ms. Lawal's March 2002 conviction for adultery was overturned today by the Katsina State Shariah Court of Appeals, largely on the basis of technicalities in the application of Islamic law. It remains unclear what impact, if any, it will have on the dozens of other Shariah sentences now pending before Islamic courts, some of which involve execution by stoning. Just this week, for instance, another Shariah court, also in the north, convicted a man of sodomy and sentenced him to death by stoning, Agence France-Presse reported.
Ms. Lawal, who was divorced, had admitted to having had a relationship with a man she identified as the father of the child. The man denied the charge, swore on the Koran, and was deemed innocent by the trial court. No one suggested DNA tests. The court ordered that Ms. Lawal be executed.
The Shariah Court of Appeals here in the state capital cobbles together the rituals of British and Islamic legal systems. The courtroom is a former state government building, painted sea blue. The judges wear caftans and turbans. Lawyers from both sides maintain the dress code left over from British colonial rule: black gowns and wigs.
Today, in an opinion read aloud in the regional language, Hausa, the appeals panel overturned the original conviction, largely on the basis of irregularities. It found that the lower courts had been wrong not to allow Ms. Lawal to retract her earlier confession. Moreover, the court ruled, the first confession was invalid because it was uttered only once, instead of four times, as required by Islamic law, and only one judge presided over the first trial, instead of the requisite three.
The panel also cited more substantive grounds. The police officers who arrested Ms. Lawal produced no witnesses to fornication, the court said. The court also gave a nod to what defense lawyers had called the "sleeping embryo" theory: under some interpretations of Shariah, an embryo can be in gestation for up to five years, meaning that Ms. Lawal's baby could have been fathered by her former husband.
The one dissenting judge on the panel, Sule Sada, argued that there was nothing wrong with the way Ms. Lawal's confession was drawn and that her conviction should stand.
Speaking for the prosecution, the Katsina state counsel, Nurulhuda Mahmud Darma, told reporters today: "Whatever the court determines is our guidance."
The appeals court did not accept one of the key substantive arguments offered by the defense. Ms. Ibrahim had argued that to consider pregnancy as evidence of a crime inherently discriminates against women, and therefore violates an important tenet of Islamic thought: that men and women are equal before the law.
Shariah law governs everything from prayers and meals to custody battles and sexual behavior to spelling out the punishment for crimes like robbery and rape. Twelve of the country's 36 states have put Shariah into effect since 1999, though the code does not apply to Christians living in those states. Ms. Lawal is the second Nigerian woman to be condemned to death for having sex outside marriage. The first, Safiya Hussaini, had her sentence overturned on appeal.

The Piano Triumphant (With No Bourgeois Taint)

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: GULANGYU, China 

 BODY:
For decades, music or more accurately, Western classical music -- has defined this former colonial outpost, nicknamed Piano Island for its high concentration of pianos in private homes. 
 But in recent years, the island, with its fading European style architecture and quaint charms, has resembled a vintage metronome, unable to keep pace with a dynamic region that is more karaoke than classical. 
 Now, as part of an effort to recast the island's history in a kinder, more tourist-friendly light, the local government is upgrading dozens of historic buildings, almost all of them built before the Communist victory of 1949. 
It is an ambitious yet delicate project, freighted with the political baggage of the turbulent Cultural Revolution (1966-76), and of the island's first family of music, the Yins, who are helping in the renovation. 
Led by the family patriarch, a wealthy banker, the Yins arrived here in the 1920's, blending into a privileged world nurtured by foreign powers that had pried open China's ports after the Opium War. By the turn of the 20th century, a dozen foreign consulates called this one-square-mile island home, offering legions of diplomats and wealthy overseas Chinese a tranquil and intimate retreat.
Because so many residents, the Yins included, were Christians, Gulangyu had at least half a dozen churches, each with its own piano. Music coursed through the leafy, winding lanes of Gulangyu, with families like the Yins holding informal recitals in luxurious villas sheathed in Mediterranean and Art Deco styles. Even today, cars and bicycles are not allowed here. 
One of the women among the Yins was a soprano who released Christian recordings in the 1930's. A male Yin became a baritone singer who settled in Los Angeles in the 1980's. Yin Chengdian, a music teacher who showed a visitor around on a recent day, founded the Xiamen Music School in the early 1990's. 
But the most famous Yin was Chengzong, one of China's most accomplished pianists, born here in 1941. 
In May 1967, during the Cultural Revolution, as the Red Guards prepared to denounce him for essentially being politically incorrect, Mr. Yin rolled out a piano in the middle of Tiananmen Square. For three days, he played revolutionary odes to Mao. 
"I think he played a heroic role in helping to save the piano from destruction," said Richard Kraus, a political scientist at the University of Oregon and the author of "Pianos and Politics in China," published in 1989. 
"If you played the piano, it was prima facie evidence that you were contaminated by Western bourgeois culture. So by agreeing to harness the piano for the Cultural Revolution, Yin Chengzong was responsible more than any other artist to give everyone the signal to stop beating up on the pianists and the violinists."
Later, Mr. Yin helped to write the music for the "Yellow River Concerto," which became a staple of the Cultural Revolution, and remains popular today. 
But he was criticized by some for seemingly cozying up to Communist leaders, and becoming a favorite of Mao's wife, Jiang Qing. So when the political winds shifted with the end of the Cultural Revolution, he was persecuted and banned from playing for several years. 
Eventually, he left China for the United States in 1983, settling in Manhattan, where he still lives today. Even now, he does not like to talk much about the past, saying that people should focus on music, not politics. But he has said that he was only trying to save the piano from destruction, and survive himself. 
It was not until a few years ago that he made a bittersweet visit home. By then, the island had already changed from a place that had been ambivalent about its history to one that was trying desperately to restore it. The population had dwindled to about 17,000, with most young people moving to Xiamen, across the water in Fujian Province.
In part to bolster the restoration effort, Yin Chengzong has embarked on a concert tour of China that will run until November. "Gulangyu is now just an island for tourists, so they asked me to come back to help." 
Some criticize the renovation as an attempt to restore his reputation and that of the family by fitting them into an economy that is turning Gulangyu into a theme park.
In the commercial heart of the island, near a ferry landing that some residents say is shaped like a piano, the sidewalks have been repaved with embossed music notes, Gulangyu's answer to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
A few years ago, Gulangyu opened a piano museum, the largest in the country. Within the last year or so, the government installed outdoor speakers around the island that now play everything from Ravel's "Bolero" to a classical version of the Beatles' "Yesterday."
Yin Chengdian, Chengzong's older brother, estimates that the restoration will affect up to 200 historic buildings, including the family residence. The goals, he said, include having regular piano master classes and small recitals. 
He is convinced that classical music will never be scorned again in China.
"If you want to take it back, you can't, because it's what the people want," he said. And besides, he added, "we prefer to talk about the future. We don't like to talk about the past very much."

PERSON: Franco Modigliani 

HEADLINE: Franco Modigliani, Nobel-Winning Economist, Dies at 85 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Franco Modigliani, who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1985 for his pathbreaking explanations of how people save and the role of debt in determining the value of corporations, died yesterday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 85.
 He died in his sleep, the family said. The evening before, he and his wife, Serena, had attended a dinner in honor of a fellow economist, John Kenneth Galbraith, and Mr. Galbraith's wife. Mr. Modigliani had taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for 28 years, until he retired in 1988, but continued to teach at least one course each spring. 
 Mr. Modigliani, who was Jewish, often recounted his experiences with fascism in his native Italy. As a young man just out of law school -- active in the antifascist movement -- he fled to France and then the United States after Mussolini promulgated racial laws in 1938. His enduring hatred of the Mussolini government flared up one last time this week. 
In a letter to The New York Times published on Tuesday, he protested the decision of the Anti-Defamation League to present Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy with its Distinguished Service Award. Mr. Berlusconi had been quoted as saying that Mussolini did not murder anyone; he only sent them into long exiles. Mussolini in fact "was responsible for the deaths of many political opponents, partisans and Jews," Mr. Modigliani wrote in the letter, which was co-signed by two other Nobel laureates, Paul A. Samuelson and Robert M. Solow, also of M.I.T. 
Mr. Modigliani never practiced law. Midway through law school at the University of Rome, he discovered a talent for economics, finishing first in a national essay competition on economics. Once in New York, he pursued that new career, earning a doctorate from the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science of the New School for Social Research in New York. The New School was a haven, as Mr. Modigliani put it in an autobiographical sketch written at the time he received the Nobel, "for European scholars who were victims of the fascist dictatorships."
His various early teaching jobs brought him to the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh in the 1950's. There he developed the life-cycle hypothesis, his best-known work. Economists had thought that only the rich saved, or people saved only when their incomes rose. Mr. Modigliani, who persisted in testing theories against experience, doubted this. Talking it through with Richard Brumberg, then a graduate student, he came up with the insight that everyone saves and accumulates wealth through the early decades of their lives and then spends the accumulated wealth in old age.
Across a nation, savings rise as an economy and a work force grow and productivity rises, Mr. Modigliani concluded. After World War II, that was the experience of the United States, then Japan and now China. In life-cycle theory, the accumulated American savings should be spent soon by the baby boomers now approaching old age.
"Modigliani's theory was a powerful searchlight on what was happening," Professor Samuelson said. "It is the best explanation of what has actually been happening in the great swing of American life since the 1950's."
Holding this view, Mr. Modigliani criticized what he considered the dissipation of built-up public savings as a result of the Bush administration's tax cuts and the rising deficit. In a similar vein, he has opposed the various Social Security privatization plans and had planned to reiterate his views in a meeting with two congressmen this week, his family said. As it now stands, Social Security gives poor people a greater return relative to their contributions than higher-income Americans, Mr. Modigliani argued.
The Nobel he received in 1985 also honored him for his insights into corporate financing. Working with Merton H. Miller, who won a Nobel in 1990 for his contribution, Mr. Modigliani demonstrated that leveraging a company through a lot of debt did not in itself affect a corporation's value.
Until Mr. Modigliani and Mr. Miller came along, much attention had been devoted to determining just the right mix of debt and equity. But the payoff from expansion through debt, for example, is offset by the risk that the company might not be able to repay the debt. What investors focus on, in fact, is profitability, and they offset the risk of purchasing stock in a leveraged company by holding safer investments in their portfolios. 
Mr. Modigliani thought of himself as a Keynesian who nevertheless melded Keynesian theory with classical economic concepts. He believed, as the classicists do, that economies reach an equilibrium. The demand and supply of labor, for example, balance each other -- but not always at the high level of employment that classical economic theory postulates.
Mixing in Keynesian stimulus -- that is, a combination of public spending and central bank manipulation of interest rates -- he played a big role in developing a forecasting model still used by the Federal Reserve and by private forecasters.
Franco Modigliani was born on June 18, 1918, in Rome to Enrico and Olga Modigliani. His father, a prominentpediatrician, died when Mr. Modigliani was 13 and his schoolwork, in response, "became pretty spotty," he recounted years later in the biographical sketch, "until I moved to Liceo Visconti, the best high school in Rome, and the challenge proved healthy and I seemed to blossom."
"Encouraged, I decided to skip the last year of the Liceo, passed the required difficult exams and entered the University of Rome at 17 (two years ahead of the norm)," he added.
His family had wanted him to be a doctor; he chose law, "which in Italy, opens the way to many career possibilities," he wrote.
Forced to leave Rome, he went to Paris to join the family of his future wife, Serena, whose father, Giulio Calabi, was a noted antifascist. The couple married when he was 20 and she was 19. Mrs. Modigliani survives, along with their sons, Andre, a professor of social psychology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and Sergio, an architect in Brookline, Mass.; four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
The Modiglianis arrived in New York in August 1939, a few days before the outbreak of World War II. "I immediately began thinking on how best to pursue my interest in economics," Mr. Modigliani wrote. By early fall, he had embarked on a routine that would last for the next three years, studying economics in the evenings and selling books by day to support his family.
In his memoir, "Adventures of an Economist," published in 2001, Mr. Modigliani said that the crucial figure in his education as an economist was Jacob Marschak, a Russian teaching in Germany who had fled Hitler, landing at the New School.
"Marschak at once took a liking to me and, first, gave me to understand that if I wanted to get ahead as an economist I should study more mathematics," he wrote. "That was a field in which I had no grounding -- indeed, ever since secondary school I had felt some aversion to it. But now Marschak persuaded me to apply myself seriously."
After receiving his doctorate in 1944, he embarked on a career that brought him to a dozen posts before he arrived at M.I.T. from Carnegie as a visiting professor in 1960. He earned tenure in 1962 and had appointments in both the Economics Department and the Sloan School of Management. Through all these years he acted as a consultant to Italian governments. "Every conversation you had with Franco started with a dissertation about Italian politics," said Charles M. Vest, M.I.T.'s president.
His early career brought him for a while to the University of Chicago, Harvard University and the University of Illinois, where he met Mr. Brumberg and began the collaboration that eventually produced the life-cycle theory, first published in separate papers in 1953 and 1954. Mr. Brumberg died in 1955, and Mr. Modigliani delayed the publication of a final "aggregate" paper until 1980.
"Brumberg's untimely death," Modigliani wrote, "sapped my will to undertake the revisions and condensation that would have been required for publication in one of the standard professional journals."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Historic Districts Found to Lift Values

BYLINE:  By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
In historic districts across New York City, from Fort Greene in Brooklyn to Mount Morris Park in Harlem, homeowners are severely restricted in how much they can redevelop or alter their properties, so that the character of their areas will be preserved.
 Those restrictions, while often called a burden on homeowners, appear to have paid off for them, according to a new study. The study, by the New York City Independent Budget Office, offers some limited statistical support for the argument that home values are enhanced by historic-district designation. 
 The study found that despite the limitations on property rights and the higher cost of meeting historic-designation requirements, the sale prices of one-, two- and three-family homes, per square foot, within historic districts were higher than in nearby neighborhoods in every year studied since 1975. And on average over the entire period, prices of homes in historic districts increased in value slightly faster. 
These findings remained even after taking into account differences in house and yard sizes, distances from the subway, age of homes and the relative affluence of neighborhoods. Over all, the study found, the typical house, which sold for $38,000 in 1975, sold in 2002 for $397,000 outside a historic district and $458,000 in one.
But the study also reported that during several intervals -- including the last few years -- houses outside historic districts increased in value at the same rate or slightly faster, or that they decreased more slowly than those in the districts.
While the study did not prove that historic designation caused the increase in values, its findings suggested that at least in the neighborhoods studied, the designation did not make things worse. "It is not likely that property owners are adversely affected" by historic-district designations, the report concluded. They "may actually benefit from being included in a historic district," the report said.
The study was begun in the late 1990's at the request of two City Council members, Kenneth K. Fisher of Brooklyn and Andrew S. Eristoff of Manhattan. Both have since left the Council. Mr. Fisher recalled this week that the Landmarks Preservation Commission was looking at that time to expand the number of historic districts in the city, and that some homeowners were worried that preservation would hurt their home resale values.
Alan Treffeisen, who wrote the report on the recent study, said that studies around the country have typically found that historic-district designations have had a "small but positive" effect on home resale values. Most of the studies, he noted, have been small and limited. The New York study, in contrast, analyzed 31,093 property sales, including 3,948 in historic districts from 1975 to 2002 in six Brooklyn community boards with historic districts.
It found that since 1975, houses in historic districts increased in value by 10.2 percent a year, on average, compared with 9 percent in nearby neighborhoods, or after adjusting for inflation, 5.3 percent in historic districts, compared with 4.2 percent elsewhere. Outside historic districts, newer houses tended to command higher prices than older ones, while within historic districts older houses were worth more.
"There are individual homeowners who believe they will suffer an economic loss when a historic district is created," said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historical Preservation. "This goes a long way to debunking that theory."
But Michael Slattery, a senior vice president at the Real Estate Board, an industry group, said the study had limited relevance to much of the New York real estate market, where properties are often valued by their development potential and designation as a historic district can reduce this potential.
In Fort Greene and Park Slope, Brooklyn, the relationship between historic-district status and house prices has changed over time, along with the neighborhoods, according to brokers and longtime residents. In the early years, the status was vital in building credibility and attracting people willing to invest money and time to restore vacant and damaged buildings.
Later, as prices rose within historic districts, surrounding areas were also in demand, and the boundaries blurred in buyers' minds. In Park Slope, Marc Garstein, president of Warren Lewis Real Estate, said that houses in the historic district cost more than those nearby, but that those in some of the adjoining neighborhoods are rising faster. Today, he said, buyers pay more attention to school district lines than historic district lines.
In Fort Greene, Howard Pitsch, who is chairman of the Fort Greene Association and has been restoring a 150-year-old frame house for the last two decades, tirelessly gives tours of the neighborhood, pressing for a major expansion of the historic district to encompass streets that he said are architecturally indistinguishable from many streets inside the current district. Adding to the urgency is the fact that just outside the boundary of the district, an 11-story condo and medical office building, approved under the current zoning, is now rising on a long-vacant corner lot. He said that development could not have been built had the site been within the boundaries of a historic district.

HEADLINE: What's Good for Russia Is Good for America 

BYLINE:  By Robert McFarlane; Robert McFarlane, national security adviser from 1983 to 1985, is chairman of an energy and environmental consulting firm in Washington.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
As President Bush meets with President Vladimir Putin of Russia today and tomorrow at Camp David, he should take the opportunity to chart a new course for Russian-American relations. The logic for such a change is compelling, especially regarding United States interests in Iraq, and it is clear to Russian officials in both government and industry.
 This new thinking is the product of several factors involving the common experience of Russia and the United States as victims of terrorism and a common interest in nurturing greater stability in the Middle East. The countries' complementary capacities could accelerate the rebuilding of Iraq and help to end the violence there. 
 Russia and the United States have had similar experiences with terrorism. Both countries have seen violence in their major cities: the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center and the attack by Chechen terrorists on a theater in Moscow a year ago. The shattering impact of these events galvanized in the United States and Russia a determination to counter the terrorist menace.
Russia was -- and remains -- very helpful in the American campaign against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. And whatever may have been their differences over how to deal with Saddam Hussein, President Putin agreed with President Bush that Saddam Hussein was a destabilizing influence in the Middle East.
Similarly, both have come to recognize the unacceptable implications of a nuclear-armed Iran. Chastened by the International Atomic Energy Agency's discovery of traces of enriched uranium at a power plant in Natanz, Iran, Russia has become much more demanding of credible safeguards for the Iranian nuclear program. It is also cooperating with the United States in seeking to deal with the nuclear ambitions of North Korea.
In a larger sense, an inchoate but palpable evolution in Russian thinking has been taking place. President Putin has absorbed a core value of pluralistic governance: nations operating under some measure of popular restraint are less likely to make war.
Mr. Putin has shown himself ready to join the United States in nurturing an evolution in this direction in the Middle East. Talking to reporters last month, he said Russia would support an international force in Iraq -- even under United States command -- if it were authorized by the United Nations Security Council. Such a statement would have been unthinkable six months ago.
But perhaps the greatest incentive for the United States to bring Russia into a more active role in Iraq is self-interested pragmatism. Russians know a lot more about the Iraqi infrastructure and how to repair it than Americans do (after all, they built much of it), and they are ready to join in the effort to restore power, water and other necessities of daily life. And since Russia has solid relationships with tribal leaders throughout the country, it is better able to gain their help. And it would be far better to get Iraqis involved in guarding their own patrimony than to have to rely on foreign forces.
True, Russia's motives -- like America's -- are not entirely altruistic. In return for its physical and financial involvement in rebuilding Iraq, Russia will want assurance that the oil contracts signed by Russian companies before the war will be honored. The United States should accept this, not least because it has no legal basis for denying these contracts.
Beyond helping to bring stability to the Middle East and revenue to Russian economy, Russian involvement will have benefits for the Russian people. Elevating Russia's role in dealing with the most daunting problems on the global agenda will have a profound impact on the view of average Russians about themselves, their leaders, their country and their role in world affairs.
The last decade has been traumatic for the Russian people. They lost two-thirds of their per capita income, half of "their" territory and their superpower status. To be once more engaged and contributing to the solution of vital matters will have an incalculable effect on Russia's sense of place and its commitment to a constructive role in the years ahead.
While it is true that America's roots are more deeply intertwined with the countries of Western Europe, the United States need not choose between Russia andEurope. It will always be in America's interest to cooperate with both.

HEADLINE: In Their Own Words 

 BODY:
 Richard A. Gephardt
On unemployment

I've got to ask everybody a question. How many jobs do Americans have to lose before George Bush loses his? That's the question we ought to be asking today.

Howard Dean
On repealing the Bush tax cuts

I think the test of leadership is not doing what's popular, I think it's doing what's right. I stood up against all the president's tax cuts. And I find it somewhat surprising that some folks are supporting some of the Bush tax cuts.
They are a mistake. The middle class never got a tax cut for us to defend. Their college tuitions went up. Their property taxes went up. Fire and police and first response services are going down, and local people are having to pay for that.

John Kerry
On middle-class tax cuts

We Democrats fought hard to put those tax cuts in place. Those represent the efforts of Democrats to try to reach the middle class of America.
The 10 percent bracket wasn't George Bush's idea. It was our idea. It was in keeping with the spirit of our party to try to help the average American get ahead in a country where increasingly average Americans are getting stomped on, where there's an unfairness in the workplace, where corporate executives, as we've seen, are walking away with millions and sticking the average American with the bill.
I think Governor Dean is absolutely wrong.

Joseph I. Lieberman
On the party's direction

Immediately as president, I would attempt to repeal the Bush tax cuts on the highest-income Americans. They don't need it. It sent us in a deficit that will cost the middle class, and as Bob said, our children and grandchildren, all sorts of money in the future.
There's a choice here, and I want to take it to a larger point. The debate going on between us is really a debate about whether we want to take the Democratic Party back to where it was before Bill Clinton transformed it in 1992 or whether we want to take it forward.

John Edwards
On White House tax policy

Everyone on this stage is against Bush's tax cuts for the rich, but there's something more radical than that going on here. What this president is doing is trying to shift the tax burden in America from wealth to work. He wants to eliminate the capital gains tax, the dividends tax, the estate tax, all the taxation of wealth or passive income on wealth, and shift that tax burden to people who work for a living. It's an enormous mistake.

Al Sharpton
On White House trade policy

I disagreed with Nafta when Clinton was in, and I think that we have come to see that that disagreement was correct. I think that we cannot have trade policy that overlooks labor, overlooks workers' rights, overlooks environmental concerns. We can't act like just because something is trade that also makes it right. African-Americans are here on a bad trade policy.

Carol Moseley Braun
On budget policy

When Bill Clinton became president, we balanced the budget and created jobs and had this country on a good economic foot, and the people were doing well. We were in a time of prosperity.
This administration has not only had a job hemorrhage, but sent us into record deficits. Their policy of borrow and pass the buck has just simply shifted the responsibilities not only to state and local governments and tax payers, but to our grandchildren, and that's wrong.

Bob Graham
On supporting troops in Iraq

I will support whatever is required for the troops in Iraq. I will not support a dime for the profits of Halliburton. We have two clear issues. One, support of the troops. I believe that should be done by eliminating the tax breaks for the wealthiest of Americans and using that to pay the cost of occupation of Iraq.

Dennis J. Kucinich
On his priorities

First, I would take action to stop the federal death penalty.
Second, I would move to cut the Pentagon budget by 15 percent, which would in no way affect adversely our national defense, and put the money into child care.
Third, I would move to create a Department of Peace, which would seek to make nonviolence an organizing principle in our society and to work with the nations of the world to make war itself archaic.

Wesley K. Clark
On why he is a Democrat

I am pro-choice. I am pro-affirmative action. I'm pro-environment, pro-health. I believe the United States should engage with allies. We should be a good player in the international community. And we should use force only as a last resort. That's why I'm proud to be a Democrat.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 30, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a heading on Thursday with excerpts from the previous night's Democratic presidential debate mislabeled a topic discussed by Representative Dennis J. Kucinich. He was responding to the question "What in office, as president, would be the least popular, most right thing you would do?" He was not discussing his priorities.

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, Mayor Attends To Some Unfinished Business 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg made a campaign-style swing through Brooklyn last month. Problem was, it was the day of the blackout, so his visit was cut short and all but ignored by the news media. 
 Undeterred, Mr. Bloomberg scheduled Brooklyn Day, Part 2. 
 So as the cameras rolled yesterday, the mayor trekked across the borough for the second time in six weeks in his latest effort to boost his visibility -- and standing -- with voters, particularly those outside Manhattan. And this time, all the lights stayed on.
He began by convening his daily staff meeting amid the collections of the Brooklyn Museum of Art. He ended up on the Boardwalk at Coney Island, where he announced the creation of a local development corporation to promote economic activities there.
In between, Mr. Bloomberg signed autographs for students at a high school in Crown Heights, danced with a 100-year-old woman in Midwood, and trolled the streets of Borough Park for hands to shake and babies to admire. He even found time to munch on two hot dogs and to stock up on apples, honey and challah for Rosh Hashana, which begins at sundown.
The mayor, dressed in his customary suit and tie, and his aides and bodyguards moved quickly and efficiently from event to event like seasoned pros after a summer spent canvassing all the boroughs. Often criticized as stiff and awkward in public, Mr. Bloomberg loosened up enough to banter with bystanders and reporters.
While visiting Middle College High School at Medgar Evers College, the mayor walked up to a group of students waiting outside a classroom. "Hi, guys," he said. "Is everybody using me as an excuse not to go in and take the test?"
The students giggled, and the mayor posed for a group shot.
Mr. Bloomberg also obliged when several students handed him sheets of folded green paper to sign. One student later told a reporter that he would auction the mayor's autograph on eBay, and hoped to get $1,000.
When informed of this plan, the mayor responded: "If he could get $1,000 for it, I'd sign a lot more if the money went to the Department of Education. I'd be flattered if somebody was interested. They don't have to pay $1,000."
Mr. Bloomberg seemed so tickled by the idea that he joked about it when he arrived at his next stop, the East Midwood Jewish Center. 
There the mayor was ushered into an ornate room with chandeliers, as gray-haired men and women cheered, clapped and crooned their version of "Hello, Dolly!":
"Well hello, Mr. Mayor, it's so good to have you here where you belong."
Only one man, in the back, could be heard booing. The mayor shrugged it off. "Well, it's New York," he said. "You can't please everybody." 
The mayor presented a bouquet of flowers to Bertha Berman, a retired bookkeeper who turned 100 last week. And as the music started again, Mr. Bloomberg -- who made headlines dancing the merengue in the Dominican Republic -- swung her onto the dance floor. Ms. Berman barely reached his shoulder, and as the mayor looked down at her, he sang along to the music, "You make me feel so young."
Ms. Berman beamed up at him. 
"Wonderful," she said later about the dancing mayor.

HEADLINE: Some Sharp Exchanges in Democrats' Debate 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
The Democratic presidential candidates squabbled intensely over tax cuts, health care and trade policy yesterday afternoon at a debate in Manhattan, trading often personal attacks. But the newest entrant to the race, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, stood on the sidelines and was largely ignored for much of the first debate of his political career.
 The third official debate of the Democratic presidential contest, held at the downtown campus of Pace University, drew more attention because of the general. The reporter contingent alone filled a basement gymnasium, and the candidates -- including General Clark -- arrived with large numbers of aides and advisers. 
 But the general's debut -- in which he swiftly sought to affirm his Democratic credentials -- was overshadowed by detailed and often sharp disagreements about defining issues like tax cuts among the nine other Democrats for whom this has become a familiar exercise. And it was Howard Dean -- not the general -- who drew the most fire. 
In the sharpest exchange, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri cited statements Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, made in the mid-1990's in which Dr. Dean sided with Congressional Republicans as they pushed for cuts in the growth rate of Medicare.
"When I was leading the fight against Newt Gingrich and the Contract With America, he was shutting the government down," said Mr. Gephardt, who is locked in a tough battle with Dr. Dean for support in Iowa. "Howard, you were agreeing with the very plan that Newt Gingrich wanted to pass, which was a $270 billion cut in Medicare. Now, you've been saying for many months that you're the head of the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party. I think you're just winging it."
Dr. Dean's face reddened, and he flashed a look in Mr. Gephardt's direction. "That is flat-out false," he said, "and I'm ashamed that you would compare me with Newt Gingrich. Nobody up here deserves to be compared to Newt Gingrich."
"I did say that Medicare was a dreadful program because it's administered dreadfully," Dr. Dean continued, adding: "I've done more for health insurance, Dick Gephardt, frankly, than you ever have, because I've delivered it to a lot of seniors and a lot of young people. And I'll stake my record on health insurance against anybody up here."
A moment later, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who is battling Dr. Dean in New Hampshire, jumped in on Mr. Gephardt's side, saying: "In defense of Dick Gephardt, I didn't hear him say he was like Newt Gingrich, I heard him say that he stood with Newt Gingrich when we were struggling to hold on to Medicare. That's a policy difference."
General Clark, who is retired from the Army, looked crisp and confident throughout the debate. If he was often ignored by the other candidates, the questioners from The Wall Street Journal and CNBC, the debate's sponsors, did not try to draw him into some of the session's more detailed policy discussions.
General Clark, a recently registered Democrat, who said he voted for Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan, defended his allegiance to the party after he was asked about favorable statements he had made about Mr. Reagan and President Bush at a Republican dinner in Arkansas in 2001.
"It's been an incredible journey for me and for this country since early 2001," he said, adding: "I was never partisan in the military. I served under Democratic presidents; I served under Republican presidents. But as I looked at this country and looked which way we were headed, I knew that I needed to speak out. And when I needed to speak out, there was only one party to come to."
And General Clark, whose views on several issues are something of a mystery, even to his supporters, sought to reassure Democrats that he was in line with some of the party's basic positions.
"I am pro-choice, I am pro-affirmative action, I'm pro-environment, pro-health," he said.
At several points, General Clark noted that he was new to the game. He declined, for example, to offer health care plans to match those that had already been suggested by most of his opponents.
General Clark, like some of his opponents, also declined to say how he would vote on President Bush's request for $87 billion more to pay for reconstruction and continued military activity in Afghanistan and Iraq. In the process, he made reference to his shifting statements in the days after he announced for president about whether he would have supported the Congressional resolution on war in Iraq. 
"If I've learned one thing in my nine days in politics, it's you better be careful with hypothetical questions, and you've just asked one," he said in reference to a question on Mr. Bush's financial package.
The decision by some of the better-known candidates to attack one other and ignore General Clark had the effect, by design or not, of allowing him to appear the way his aides have sought: a fresh face above the fray.
For much of the debate, the rest of the field parried as if General Clark were not even there, showcasing the policy divisions within the party. Mr. Kerry attacked Dr. Dean and Mr. Gephardt for advocating the rollback of all of Mr. Bush's tax cuts.
Mr. Kerry, along with Senators Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, John Edwards of North Carolina and Bob Graham of Florida, said they supported retaining the tax cuts already in place for middle-class voters. General Clark said he would release his own economic and tax plan within a few weeks, but backed rolling back tax cuts for the wealthy.
Mr. Kerry, addressing Dr. Dean and Mr. Gephardt, said: "We can cut the deficit in half, we can be fiscally responsible, but we don't have to do it on the backs of the middle class."
Mr. Lieberman said: "Some of my opponents here, including Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt, want to repeal all the taxes. That, as John has said, would mean a middle-class tax increase. Bill Clinton was for a middle-class tax cut."
Dr. Dean said it would be impossible to fulfill the promises the candidates have made -- like eliminating the deficit and expanding health care -- without eliminating all of the tax cuts Mr. Bush had promoted.
"With all due respect to Senator Kerry and the others from Washington that voted for these tax cuts, this is exactly why the budget is so far out of balance," he said.
Mr. Edwards sought to blur the differences among the candidates on the issue. "Everyone on this stage is against Bush's tax cuts for the rich," he said, "but there's something more radical than that going on here. What this president is doing is trying to shift the tax burden in America from wealth to work."
The candidates clashed over trade, highlighting the strain on them as they try to balance the sentiments against expanded free trade in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, against the push by the party under Mr. Clinton to support free trade.
Mr. Gephardt has aggressively pushed the trade issue, seeking the support of union leaders and trying to enhance his position in Iowa. Yesterday afternoon, he recalled trade agreements Congress passed in the 1990's. 
"Most everybody here voted for Nafta, voted for the China agreement," he said, referring to accords that dropped restrictions on trade with Mexico, Canada and China. "I did not. I led the fight against it. That's the kind of trade policy we need that globalizes with fairness and standards around the world so work, wherever it's performed, is given a fair wage."
Mr. Kerry attacked Dr. Dean for saying the nation should not trade with foreign partners until they adopted labor and environmental standards equal to those in the United States. "That means we would trade with no countries," he said. "It's either a policy for shutting the door, if you believe it, or it's a policy of just telling people what they want to hear."
As the attacks continued, Dr. Dean grew visibly annoyed. "You know, to listen to Senator Lieberman, Senator Kerry, Representative Gephardt, I'm anti-Israel, I'm antitrade, I'm anti-Medicare and I'm anti-Social Security," he said. "I wonder how I ended up in the Democratic Party."
Once again, it fell to the Rev. Al Sharpton to counsel Democrats to stop bickering. "I hope we don't, in our distinguishing, make George Bush the winner tonight," he said. "I think all of us have disagreed. I think clearly we need to make sure we don't give George Bush the night by getting too personal, Brother Howard."
After the debate, eight candidates headed to a $3 million fund-raiser for the Democratic National Committee. With 650 attendees each paying $1,000 or more, the rare multicandidate appearance was the committee's largest event of the year.

HEADLINE: Democratic Candidates Pass on Opportunities to Pound on Clark 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

 BODY:
The very first series of questions out of the box from the moderator Brian Williams included a sweet invitation for the nine established Democratic presidential candidates to take a big swing at the newcomer, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who as recently as 2001 voiced support for the policies of Presidents Bush and Ronald Reagan.
 "Do you believe this is a Democrat you're standing next to?" Mr. Williams asked former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, who has conducted a surging campaign. 
 "I think that's up to the voters in the Democratic Party to determine," Dr. Dean responded, letting that big fat pitch slide right over the heart of the plate unmolested.
And that pretty much set the tone for the evening. Hands off General Clark.
"As the only New Yorker, I want to welcome General Clark to New York," said the Rev. Al Sharpton. "And I want to welcome him to our list of candidates. And don't be defensive about just joining the party. Welcome to the party. It's better to be a new Democrat who's a real Democrat than a lot of old Democrats up here who have been acting like Republicans all along."
While many had expected General Clark, the fresh meat in the presidential abattoir, to dominate the occasion -- at the very least drawing heat for positions on some issues --it was instead almost as though the man was hardly present, even as he commanded middle-stage by the luck of the draw. Indeed, the only two challenges came from reporters on the questioning panel, and when the general declined on several occasions to offer specific policies on such issues as health care, citing the infancy of his campaign, the others candidates responded with not a whimper of protest.
The other nine spent their ammunition as they usually have in recent weeks, bad-mouthing the Bush administration and taking target practice on one another, particularly Dr. Dean. If there was any difference yesterday afternoon, it was that Dr. Dean was moved to make some sharper-than-normal retorts of his own, so sharp that they drew some rebukes from fellow candidates.
"I think clearly we need to make sure we do not give George Bush the night by getting too personal, Brother Howard," said Mr. Sharpton, who referred to the field of candidates as "eight career politicians, an officer and," gesturing to himself, "a gentleman."
Mr. Sharpton's rebuke came after Dr. Dean had taken objection to having his name mentioned by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri as a one-time policy ally of Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. "That is flat-out false, and I'm ashamed that you would compare me with Newt Gingrich," Dr. Dean said. "Nobody up here deserves to be compared to Newt Gingrich."
A suddenly stone-faced Mr. Gephardt listened as Dr. Dean declared that he had done more for health care as governor of Vermont than the congressman had ever done. "We need to remember that the enemy here is George Bush, not each other," Dr. Dean said.
Later, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts came to Mr. Gephardt's defense and further scolded Dr. Dean for raising the temperature in the auditorium. 
When asked after the debate if he was surprised that the other candidates had not questioned General Clark more sharply, Dr. Dean smiled, tilted his head and shrugged slightly. "I wish I could say I was surprised," he said, "But I'm not."
The organizing topic of this third presidential debate at Pace's downtown campus in Manhattan was the economy. The questions included budget balancing, trade policy and job creation. But the larger, unspoken question was how General Clark would stand up to the rigors of a debate alongside so many seasoned politicians.
Ten podiums were set in a gentle curve across the stage, facing a table of three questionnaires. The blue-carpeted stage took up half of the main floor in the 650-seat hall. Enfolding curves of the ceiling were all a gleaming white, making the room feel like a cross between a high school auditorium and the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. 
Outside, there were some early skirmishes between supporters of Dr. Dean and Senator Kerry over possession of the best poles for hanging candidate placards. Pace security officers came out and removed them all from the flagpoles, but allowed them to remain on utility poles, garbage cans and other available surfaces.
But no army of protesters descended on the site.
The candidates filed into the auditorium less than 15 minutes before the start of the debate, first posed for pictures and then found their way to their appointed lectern. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois hopped aboard the three-inch-high platforms that workmen had just placed behind their lecterns to bring them more in line with the height of the other candidates. Dr. Dean, who has taken some ribbing for his his 5-foot-8-inch frame, planted himself firmly on the ground. 
General Clark came striding out with the rest of them, shaking hands, patting shoulders. He seemed right at home, and listened pleasantly as the candidates attacked one another and left him blissfully alone.
The general even ostentatiously offered a few statistics -- 41 million Americans without health care -- demonstrating a growing command of campaign boilerplate, but still promising to offer more-detailed plans sometime down the road. 
"I'll be coming out in a few weeks with an economic policy to address the deficit," he said. And later: "I've been in the race about nine days, so I don't have a complete package of health care proposals."
The other nine candidates nodded sagely and let another sweet fat pitch slide across the plate.

HEADLINE: Iraq Is Seen as Crucial Factor In OPEC Move to Cut Output 

BYLINE:  By ERIC PFANNER 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
For someone whose attendance at the OPEC meeting this week seemed in question until he stepped out of a black Mercedes and past the Austrian police guarding the door, Iraq's new oil minister had a surprisingly potent impact.
 As a newcomer to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, appointed to the job less than a month ago by the Iraqi Governing Council, Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum was probably not a deal maker at the meeting, but Iraq's returning oil production was crucial to the group's decision Wednesday to cut output. 
 OPEC's surprise move to cut 900,000 barrels a day from its output -- oil ministers had been hinting that no change in quotas was likely -- was probably made possible by Mr. Uloum's assurance that Iraq would be able to sustain exports of that very amount. Iraq has been struggling to raise output to prewar levels and, possibly, beyond. 
"He may have given some legitimacy to Iraq's message," said Walid Khadduri, editor of The Middle East Economic Review, referring to Iraq's current exports.
Mr. Uloum said that Iraq was already producing 1.8 million barrels of oil a day, roughly two-thirds the level before the United States-led invasion. About half that is being exported, he said, and he added that Iraq hoped to double overseas sales within six months. By the end of the decade, total production could be as high as six million barrels a day, he said -- a level never achieved under Saddam Hussein and second only to Saudi Arabia within OPEC.
Though Iraq's long-term potential has never been doubted, as it sits on the third-biggest petroleum reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia and Canada, sabotage to pipelines and other oil operations has kept production from returning to prewar levels. Mr. Khadduri said the country's northern oil fields were experiencing about one sabotage act a week, and therefore were not exporting oil, though southern fields were faring better. Iraq is exporting oil from its fields in the south, which are producing around 1.2 million barrels a day.
To go beyond prewar output levels, Iraq will need significant amounts of new investment, Mr. Uloum acknowledged. He said he was beginning efforts to attract foreign investors, adding that privatization was probably most suited to the "downstream" oil businesses -- refining and marketing -- rather than upstream production operations.
"We have not invited companies in yet to bid, but we are looking for ideas," Mr. Uloum said in a news conference.
Analysts said Iraq might have difficulty attracting investment until the political situation clears up and security improves. 
"No company with a board and shareholders is going to put people and investment into a place without a legitimate government," said Vera de Ladoucette, director of Middle East research at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, which is based in Massachusetts.
For companies that signed provisional contracts with the government of Mr. Hussein while United Nations sanctions were in place, there could be added problems. Nabeel Musawi, a deputy on the Governing Council who said he represented the council's president, Ahmad Chalabi, said those deals would be reviewed case by case. 
"If we find that contracts were signed illegally, we will take it further than just canceling them," he told reporters in Vienna. "We will make it very hot for them."
Before OPEC's move to cut its production ceiling to 24.5 million barrels a day as of Nov. 1 -- a decision that drove oil prices higher for a second day today -- questions about the Iraqi delegation's authority threatened to dominate the meeting. Venezuela had objected to seating an Iraqi representative until Iraq had a United Nations-recognized government in place.
Abdullah al-Attiyah, the OPEC president and Qatar's oil minister, had expressed similar views in April, when the group met without an Iraqi representative in the aftermath of the downfall of Mr. Hussein. But he said this week that he had changed his mind after remembering that his own country had joined OPEC in 1961, while it was still a British protectorate and not a sovereign nation.
In announcing OPEC's decision, Mr. Attiyah said that Iraq was coming to the market "dramatically," raising fears of a possible oil glut if nothing was done.
The supply cut caught many analysts by surprise, however, because inventories remain relatively tight.
Officials of other OPEC countries, including the United Arab Emirates, also cited signs of improvement in Iraqi production as a crucial reason for the cut. Crude oil for November delivery rose 5 cents today, to $28.29 in New York.
That puts Mr. Uloum, still settling into his job, and backed by a government that has not had to stand for election, in the position of having to deliver on what he has promised.

HEADLINE: Brazil Stands Firm Amid Criticism on Trade Talks 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

 BODY:
The search for someone to blame for the breakdown of the world trade talks in Cancun, Mexico, seems to be taking on a life of its own.
 Since the talks dissolved on Sept. 14, Brazil has been accused of causing the deadlock in several published post-mortems, most notably in an essay by Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative. 
 At a forum in New York City yesterday, the president of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, defended his country and its leading role in a group of developing nations that emerged as a major force during the deliberations in Mexico. The unwillingness of wealthy countries, he said, to address the developing world's concerns about agricultural trade was the real stumbling block. 
In Cancun, Brazilian officials often spoke on behalf of a group of developing nations, which joined together at the conference and pushed rich nations to reduce their tariffs and export subsidies on agricultural products and to reduce or eliminate $300 billion in annual subsidies to farmers.
To the dismay of many European and American officials, this group, which includes China, India and 19 other countries, had a rock star attend its first news conference and took on the mantle of helping the world's poorest farmers compete against the world's wealthiest. In his essay, published in The Financial Times, Mr. Zoellick denounced the group's approach as springing from a "culture of protest that defined victory in terms of political acts rather than economic results."
Showing an edge of defiance, Mr. da Silva said he had personally raised the matter with President Bush, using up precious minutes of a short, private conversation they had this week while attending the United Nations General Assembly meeting.
"What happened in Cancun wasn't because of any change on behalf of Brazil," Mr. da Silva said he told Mr. Bush. "Seventy percent of our proposal was the same as what the United States supported earlier."
He said he explained to Mr. Bush that Brazil wanted to work with the United States, but that Washington was choosing instead to side with Europe against Brazil and other developing nations.
Mr. da Silva described his relationship with Mr. Bush as friendly and frank, and said that he ended the conversation with a vow to go back to the table and complete the latest round of trade talks, which are intended to help the developing world. 
In an earlier news conference with Brazilian journalists, he said Mr. Bush had advised patience and said talks would resume.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Zoellick said his assessment of Brazil and the positions it took at Cancun had not changed. "These positions fed the politics of protest instead of compromise and contributed to the missed opportunity in Cancun to achieve global farm reform," the spokesman, Richard Mills, said.
Trade frictions appear to have exploded, not diminished, since Cancun, and positions seem to be hardening. Mr. da Silva said yesterday that he had met with his counterparts from India and South Africa on Wednesday night to put the finishing touches on a coalition they are forming to act as a counterweight to the Group of 7 wealthy countries in trade talks. 
The three nations, among the world's largest democracies, said they were committed to the United Nations and to the World Trade Organization as important institutions for solving problems of the world's poorest countries. 
Technical-level talks are scheduled to resume at the trade organization's headquarters in Geneva in December, but without the senior political figures who could move the talks forward, no major progress is expected. In the meantime, several countries said they would concentrate on bilateral or regional trade negotiations. 
Mr. Zoellick said he had been flooded with requests from countries wanting bilateral free trade agreements with the United States, and that he planned to push ahead with talks to create a free trade agreement for the entire Western Hemisphere, an expansion of the North Amerian Free Trade Agreement to span from Canada to Argentina.
But in those talks, Brazil will be just as aggressive, Mr. da Silva said. He said that he was working to integrate all of South America in a single free trade zone, and that he hoped to link two regional groupings, Mercosur and the Andean Community of Nations, by Jan. 1.
What about Mr. Zoellick's plans to extend Nafta southward?
"If you don't eliminate farm subsidies, then it will frustrate free trade," Mr. da Silva said.

HEADLINE: Schwarzenegger Adds Support Inside G.O.P. 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY and JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
As prominent Republicans rallied around the candidacy of Arnold Schwarzenegger, aides to Gov. Gray Davis today framed the final week and a half of the recall campaign here as a partisan duel between the Democratic governor and the actor.
 A day after the most vigorous debate in the campaign, several factors seemed to push the contest toward a two-candidate race. Not the least was a growing desire by Republicans and Democrats for a more conventional head-to-head finale. 
 In the clearest indication of that direction, Mr. Davis suggested for the first time that he might challenge Mr. Schwarzenegger to a debate because of what Mr. Davis described as distortions of his record, particularly on the state's economy, in Mr. Schwarzenegger's statements and television advertising. 
"I'm going to set the record straight," Mr. Davis said in Los Angeles at an event with the police. "If he doesn't set the record straight himself, I may just have to debate him."
Schwarzenegger's aides said a debate with Mr. Davis was highly unlikely. Today The Los Angeles Times and CNN canceled a debate for Tuesday among the prominent candidates and the governor, because Mr. Davis and Mr. Schwarzenegger declined to attend. But whether they debate or not, Davis strategists see a Davis vs. Schwarzenegger confrontation in advertisements, speeches and news coverage as their best hope to keep their man in office.
Internal polls show Mr. Davis still losing the recall vote on Oct. 7. The strategists suggested that he could win if 8 to 10 percent of likely Democratic voters could be persuaded to vote no instead of yes on the recall.
A pollster for Mr. Davis, Paul Maslin, said that task would be easier if the contest became a more partisan clash in a state where registered Democrats far outnumber registered Republicans and where Democrats hold every statewide office. 
"It will become more and more apparent to voters that they have two choices," Mr. Maslin said. "If they vote yes on the recall, odds are Arnold Schwarzenegger will be governor. If they vote no, Gray Davis is governor. We like the trend. We have Democrats out there."
Republicans said they also liked the trend, though they forecasted certain victory for Mr. Schwarzenegger as the party leadership closed ranks around him. The coming together of Republicans, though still untidy, took on a feeling of inevitability as Mr. Schwarzenegger picked up important endorsements and some prominent Republicans began speaking of a two-candidate race. 
Bill Simon Jr., the Republican whom Mr. Davis narrowly defeated in November, endorsed Mr. Schwarzenegger, calling him "the right man to be governor of California." Mr. Simon, who dropped out of the recall race last month, joined a growing list of Republicans, many of them more conservative than Mr. Schwarzenegger, who have come to view the recall vote through a pragmatic lens.
On Friday, Representative Darrell Issa, the Republican from San Diego who bankrolled the signature gathering for the recall, is also expected to endorse Mr. Schwarzenegger.
"I think Arnold is the front-runner and the individual most likely to win," Mr. Simon said. He did not call on State Senator Tom McClintock, Mr. Schwarzenegger's main Republican rival, to drop out, but indicated that he believed that Mr. Schwarzenegger was more popular among Republicans and more likely to attract Democrats and independents' votes.
Mr. Simon also said he believed that the choice was narrowing to a decision whether to keep Mr. Davis or replace him with Mr. Schwarzenegger. He said that he expected the governor to unleash a harsh campaign against Mr. Schwarzenegger.
"Having survived roughly $80 million of negative advertising from Gray Davis," Mr. Simon said, "it wouldn't surprise me if he began saying false and misleading things now. His general strategy is to distract attention from his own track record, because there is nothing he can do to persuade people he has been a good governor."
Mr. McClintock insisted again that he would not drop out of the contest. But many Republicans read more into his rather friendly demeanor toward Mr. Schwarzenegger in the debate on Wednesday than into his pronouncements to stay the course. 
"The main thing of interest to me last night was if Tom McClintock went after Arnold Schwarzenegger, it would mean he was in the race for good," said Dave Gilliard, chief strategist for Rescue California, a group that wants a recall. "He did not. It really did tell me that McClintock has decided in his own mind it isn't going to happen for him, and he is going to end up with some sort of exit strategy."
In Sacramento today, an association of county Republican leaders voted overwhelmingly to endorse Mr. Schwarzenegger. Leslie Cornejo, the chairwoman from Ventura, Mr. McClintock's home county, described the decision as gut wrenching but unavoidable.
"We felt a certain amount of desperation for a message of unity from our party," Ms. Cornejo said.
Ron Nehring, the chairman from San Diego County and the association's president, said the vote was 40 to 9, with 5 abstentions. He said the lack of bickering between Mr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. McClintock at the debate made the decision easier.
"Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom McClintock had their guns pointed in the same direction," Mr. Nehring said. "The Republican vision of this state is clear."
Mr. Davis's campaign is hoping that a fiery moment in the debate, an exchange between Mr. Schwarzenegger and Arianna Huffington in which Ms. Huffington accused Mr. Schwarzenegger of being antiwoman, will take hold and turn off female voters to Mr. Schwarzenegger.
Ms. Huffington said her campaign had received several thousand e-mail messages and phone calls, many from women who insisted that Mr. Schwarzenegger's aggressive tone toward her was an indication of his attitude toward women. Most of the outrage, she said, focused on his saying Ms. Huffington should be cast in his next "Terminator" movie, which Ms. Huffington interpreted as a reference to a scene in "Terminator 3" in which Mr. Schwarzenegger's character dips the head of a female robot in a toilet.
"I am not asking for an apology," Ms. Huffington said. "I am asking for the people of California to open their eyes. This is about a man who should not be governor."
Mr. Schwarzenegger dismissed exchange with Ms. Huffington as entertainment and said nothing more should be made of it. Davis aides, however, suggested the line might have been the work of Mike Murphy, a strategist for Mr. Schwarzenegger who advised Rick Lazio in his losing Senate campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2000. Mr. Lazio got in hot water with women's groups when he appeared overly aggressive toward Ms. Clinton in a debate.
Mr. Murphy did not return calls today. A spokesman for Mr. Schwarzenegger acknowledged that advisers had helped Mr. Schwarzenegger script some responses for the debate, but could not say whether the "Terminator" remark was one of them.
Asked on the Fox News Channel and ABC radio about the comment, Mr. Schwarzenegger said it was not a reference to the toilet scene.
"I don't know why she picked that scene," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "But the fact of the matter is it was a compliment. Because in 'Terminator,' we always had powerful women. If she takes it the wrong way, it's not my fault."

HEADLINE: Top 1% in '01 Lost Income, But Also Paid Lower Taxes 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
The incomes of the top 1 percent of Americans fell 18 percent in 2001, as did their income taxes, shaving $66 billion off revenues and showing how dependent the federal government has become on its wealthiest citizens.
 Over all, Americans had 2.8 percent less income in 2001 than in the previous year. But federal tax revenues fell 9.4 percent because the incomes of those at the top, who pay the highest tax rates, dropped so much more than the average. 
 The top 1 percent reported $1.09 trillion of income, down from $1.34 trillion in 2000, according to data posted by the Internal Revenue Service on the Internet yesterday without announcement. 
The minimum income to reach the top 1 percent was $293,000 last year, down from $313,500 in 2000, but almost identical to the threshold in 1999.
The sharp decline in incomes at the top "is obviously due to the collapse of the stock market boom and the recession," said Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a lobbying group.
The combination of a sharp drop in income, if sustained for several years, and the tax cuts that were enacted this year could result in another sharp drop in taxes paid by the top 1 percent. The top rate on capital gains and dividends, the source of much of the income in the elite group, has been cut to 15 percent from 20 percent.
Taxes paid by the top group fell to $300.1 billion in 2001 from $366.9 billion in 2000. The decline accounted for the bulk of the $92.7 billion drop in individual federal income tax revenue in 2001.
The sharp drop in incomes caused the share of income taxes paid by the rich to shrink nearly a tenth. The share of total taxes paid by other groups consequently increased. The top group paid 33.9 percent of all income taxes, down from 37.4 percent in 2000.
The share paid by the next most wealthiest group, the 4 percent of Americans just below the top group, grew slightly. The bottom half of Americans, the 64 million households making less than $28,000, accounted for a somewhat larger share of total taxes.
The biggest increase, however, was among those making $56,000 to $92,800, whose share of all income taxes increased to 18 percent from 16.7 percent. They accounted for a larger share of income taxes than the very wealthiest, the top tenth of 1 percent of Americans who paid 16 percent of the government's total income taxes.
Isaac Shapiro, an analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit group in Washington that advocates for the poor, said the tax rules set by Congress mean broad swings in revenues as the economy moves through good times and bad.
"If you have income concentrated at the top, it will produce tax revenue greater than growth in the economy over all," he said, adding that the opposite takes place when the economy contracts.
The I.R.S. also released data on the top tenth of 1 percent, the most prosperous 129,000 households in the country. This group had so much income that they made almost as much as the other nine-tenths in the top 1 percent.
This very top group, representing one in a thousand households, had $505 billion in income, for an average of $4 million each. To be counted among this group one needed an adjusted gross income of at least $1.3 million, down from $1.6 million in 2000.
This small group received almost $1 of every $12 earned by all 129 million American households.
Mr. Bartlett, an advocate of lower taxes, noted that the Bush tax cuts in 2001 did not cause the drop in taxes by the wealthy. 
"It is pretty clear that the tax cut played no role by the fact that the average tax rate paid by the top 1 percent actually went up slightly," he said. 
This group paid 27.5 cents in taxes on each dollar of reported income, up a sliver of a penny from the previous year. This increase was caused by a drop in income from capital gains, which are taxed at a much lower rate than wages.
Over all, the tax rate fell, with Americans paying the government 14.2 cents in taxes on each dollar of income, down from 15.3 cents in 2000. Because spending did not decline, the government borrowed to make up the difference, in effect deferring the cost.
While the tax cuts that President Bush championed in 2001 will give the most benefits to the top 1 percent in income, those cuts had not taken effect in 2001. At Mr. Bush's urging, Congress voted this year to make most of the cuts benefiting the wealthiest immediate instead of waiting until the latter half of this decade. Congress has now reduced the maximum income tax rate to 35 percent, from 39.6 percent when Mr. Bush was elected, and reduced the top rates on capital gains and dividend income to 15 percent from 20 percent.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Sept. 27 about the income tax paid in 2001 by the top 1 percent of Americans misstated the top rate for taxes on dividends before it was cut to 15 percent this year. It was 38.6 percent, not 20.

HEADLINE: U.S. Economy Grew 3.3 Percent in Quarter 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The United States economy grew at an annual rate of 3.3 percent from April through June, lifted by an increase in consumer, corporate and government spending, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
 The rise in gross domestic product, the most since last year's third quarter, was greater than the estimate of 3.1 percent that the government issued last month. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent annual pace from January to March. 
 One hurdle to sustaining this pace is the lack of job growth, which is weighing on consumer confidence, economists said. The University of Michigan's index of sentiment fell in September to 87.7 from 89.3 in August, a report showed yesterday.
"You really do need job creation to make this a sustainable recovery, because jobs create income and income supports spending," said William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "Between now and the end of the year, I think it's absolutely critical on the job creation front."
Economists had forecast that the G.D.P. would not be revised from the 3.1 percent gain that the government estimated last month.
Spending rose at an annual pace of 3.8 percent for consumers, 7.3 percent for businesses and 8.5 percent for government.
Companies satisfied the increase in demand by selling from inventories. Figures this quarter show spending has accelerated, bolstered by lower taxes and cheap borrowing costs.
Production increases may be in store to restock depleted inventories, helping to strengthen the economy into 2004, economists said.
But consumers still appear to be wary. The University of Michigan's final September confidence figure was down from a preliminary reading of 88.2 reported on Sept. 12. 
"Americans are still not convinced that this expansion can be sustained. They don't see job growth," said Daniel Laufenberg, chief economist at the American Express Financial Corporation. "Nevertheless, the drop wasn't large enough to suggest that consumers will change their behavior" and rein in spending.
The current conditions index, which reflects Americans' perception of their financial situation and whether it is a good time to make major purchases, fell to 98.4 this month from 99.7 in August and a preliminary reading of 98.8. The expectations index, based on optimism about the next one to five years, fell to 80.8 from 82.5 the previous month.
The economy has lost 2.7 million jobs since President Bush took office in January 2001, and a report on Friday is forecast to show another loss of 25,000 jobs for September.
"We're continuing to see the economy grow stronger, but there is more to do," said Scott McClellan, a spokesman for the White House.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Fall Broadly as Investors Await Earnings Reports

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as investors took a cautious stand before the corporate earnings season starts next month and digested mixed economic data that tempered optimism about a strong recovery.
 The Commerce Department reported that brisk consumer spending nudged the expansion of the economy ahead at a slightly faster pace than expected, setting the stage for a second-half surge in growth. Gross domestic product grew at a revised 3.3 percent annual rate from April through June -- up from a 3.1 percent rate estimated a month ago. 
 But a separate survey showed that consumer sentiment fell unexpectedly in September, hurt by persistent weakness in the job market. 
"The good G.D.P. figures are encouraging, but it's kind of old news," said Taai Izushima, head trader for Daiwa Securities America. "The market's really not moving anywhere. We're just waiting to see what earnings come up later on." 
Mr. Izushima also said stocks might be at a peak technically or consolidating before again moving higher. "There's really not a strong trend in the marketplace right now," he said, "so everybody is wondering whether a top is forming or it's the start of another step up.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 30.88 points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,313.08. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 6.42 points, or 0.6 percent, to 996.85. The technology-oriented Nasdaq composite index was down 25.17 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,792.07.
Some traders also attributed the market's declines to selling from money managers eager to lock in gains from the market's rally over the last six months as the quarter draws to a close. So far this year, the blue-chip Dow is up nearly 12 percent, the S.& P. 500 is up 13.3 percent and the Nasdaq is up 34 percent.
In the consumer sentiment reading, the University of Michigan's final September index of consumer sentiment fell to 87.7, from 89.3 in August. The expectations index, based on optimism about the next one to five years, fell to 80.8 from 82.5 the previous month.
Consumer sentiment is still above the nine-year low it hit in March at the start of the war with Iraq. But the recovery in confidence since the end of major combat has fallen flat, weighed by the weak job market, plus the human and financial costs of the post-war occupation.
Motorola Inc. topped the New York Stock Exchange's most actively traded list. Its shares fell on a report that it would not be able to supply two popular digital camera cellphone models in time to meet expected high demand in this year's holiday season in the United States. In the afternoon, the stock rebounded after Mike Zafirovski, Motorola's president, said in a statement that the company was "well-positioned for the holiday sales season." Shares of Motorola closed 27 cents higher at $12.53.
The tumultuous day for Motorola came after last week's surprise resignation of its chairman and chief executive, Christopher B. Galvin, amid differences with the board. 
On the Nasdaq, shares of Human Genome Sciences, the drug development company, fell after it said its experimental anti-inflammatory drug failed a midstage trial in adults with chronic skin ulcers. The company said it would not develop the drug for that use. Human Genome shares fell 43 cents, or 3 percent, to $14.06.
Shares of 3M rose and ranked among the Dow's top percentage gainers after Banc of America Securities upgraded its rating on the conglomerate to "buy" from "neutral." Shares of 3M, which makes products ranging from sandpaper to Post-it notes to fiber-optic connectors, gained 46 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $141.61.

 BODY:
Supplier of Power and Gas Seeks to Avoid Bankruptcy
Allegheny Energy, an important supplier of electricity and natural gas service in Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, said that it was considering several measures to stave off a bankruptcy filing, including a purge of its accounting department and the possible sale of assets to raise cash.
 The announcement of the measures came as senior executives at Allegheny acknowledged in a conference call with investors that the company did not have enough cash to meet its debt obligations in 2004. Page C2. 

G.M. Names Chief for Design
Ed Welburn, left, who helped oversee the design of the Hummer H2 and Chevrolet SSR, was named by General Motors as its chief design executive, only the sixth one in the automaker's 95-year history. He will be the first African-American to lead the design process for a major car company. Mr. Welburn is succeeding Wayne Cherry, who is retiring. C2.

No Quick Fix for Do-Not-Call List
The court decision forbidding the government from moving ahead with a national do-not-call registry on First Amendment grounds will force appeals courts and lawmakers to make some excruciating choices. Unlike an earlier ruling that said the Federal Trade Commission had overstepped its authority in establishing the registry, the most recent decision is not subject to a quick fix. News Analysis. A1.

Air France and KLM Discuss Alliance
Air France and KLM of the Netherlands appeared to be moving toward a sweeping alliance, possibly including an effective takeover of KLM by Air France, that would change the ultimate shape of both airlines and reconfigure the European industry, company and government officials said. C3.

Segway Scooters Are Recalled
The Consumer Product Safety Commission and Segway announced a recall of all 6,000 Segway Human Transporters, which tend to tip when the batteries are low and the rider does something that requires a quick burst of power. The recalled machines will receive a software upgrade that will cause it to give battery warnings earlier and to shut down before the low levels of power become a problem. A8.

2nd-Quarter Growth Revised Up
The United States economy grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate from April through June, lifted by a rise in consumer, corporate and government spending. The growth rate was greater than the estimate of 3.1 percent issued last month. One hurdle to sustaining the pace is the lack of job growth, which is weighing on consumer confidence. The University of Michigan's index of sentiment fell in September to 87.7 from 89.3 in August. C2.

Stocks Fall on Mixed Economic Data
Stocks fell as investors took a cautious stand before the corporate earnings season starts next month and digested mixed economic data that tempered optimism about a strong recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 30.88 points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,313.08. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 6.42 points, or 0.6 percent, to 996.85. The Nasdaq composite index was down 25.17 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,792.07. C4.

$117 Million for Bear Stearns Chief
The chairman and chief executive of Bear Stearns, James E. Cayne, is receiving $117 million in company stock as deferred compensation, mostly from a single bonus that has compounded in value for a decade. Bear Stearns will also distribute shares worth $210 million to three other executives. C2.

Britain Clears Way for Safeway Sale

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: RECONSTRUCTION; 
IRAQ LEADERS SEEK GREATER ROLE NOW IN RUNNING NATION

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 26 

 BODY:
With an advanced degree in engineering and a high technology career behind him in Britain, Hayder Awad Aabadi, Iraq's new minister of communications, smiles when asked whether Iraqis are ready to run their country again.
 He will get the telephones working in Baghdad by the end of November, he says. He will build a state-owned mobile telephone network by piggybacking on existing infrastructure. He will thwart saboteurs who have been cutting the fiber optic lines around the capital. 
 "Iraqis are a very proud people," Mr. Aabadi said in an interview in his spare office, which is situated away from the front of the building to protect him from car bombs. "They will not be motivated in a situation where things are run by a foreign occupying power." 
Impatience is beginning to grow here as Iraqi officials chafe at the strictures of an American occupation, which, they say, has in some cases slowed reconstruction because power is centralized in the hands of the military commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, and the civilian occupation administrator, L. Paul Bremer III.
While Mr. Bremer makes the rounds in Washington, contracts for a cellular phone network await his signature. Mr. Aabadi asserted that he could have had a network running 30 days after major hostilities ended, a claim supported by other telecommunications executives in the region.
American officials are aware of the problem. "The reality of foreign troops on the streets is starting to chafe," Mr. Bremer said this week in Washington. "Some Iraqis are beginning to regard us as occupiers and not as liberators."
But at the same time, the United States is convinced that the Iraqi Governing Council, an appointed rather than an elected body, is not ready to take control of an unstable and still violent country.
Such a transfer of power may take at least a year, American officials say, a process that the French government argues is too dilatory and therefore dangerous.
Iraq -- its electricity intermittent, its communications irregular, its army in the first stages of formation, its police in training, its roads often insecure -- is a hard place for anyone to govern. But with competent officials beginning to return to ministries and national pride stirring in opposition to occupation, the question of when to give power to Iraqis has become central.
President Bush has proposed that in Iraq, the United States make the largest reconstruction commitment since the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II. Administration officials say it goes without saying that such a commitment must be organized under American supervision.
The problem with the allied plan is that the 23 million Iraqis may not be willing to wait.
Opinion polls show that a majority in Baghdad say the current violence and other problems are a price worth paying for the removal of Saddam Hussein, but most Iraqis regard Mr. Bush and the Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain with distrust.
American and British officials have been running the country for five months, but security is far from being restored, Iraqi officials say. And Mr. Bremer's Coalition Provisional Authority has failed to stabilize electricity supplies, end water shortages or even return normal traffic patterns in the capital.
"When you in are someone else's house, the person who built that house and maintained it is the person you should look to," said one Iraqi security chief. American officials counter that they have already given considerable authority to Iraqis who are, for instance, laying down the laws that will govern Iraq's future economy.
Mr. Aabadi cites an example of how his work as communications minister is complicated by the occupation. Every day, he sends out armed security teams to repair fiber optic cables that saboteurs have been cutting. His men, he says, are often disarmed, abused and humiliated by American soldiers who patrol the capital.
The United States military says it is carrying out orders to disarm Iraqis who do not have permits or police authority, though many Iraqis violate the rules for self-protection.
"You cannot blame anyone," Mr. Aabadi says. "The soldiers are doing their job. The workers are doing their jobs. But you can't run a country with a professional army in the streets."
But to whom exactly could the United States cede power? Many European officials cite the Afghan model, where Hamid Karzai quickly took control of the country after the war, while the United Nations retained an important role and international troops provided security.
But no figure with the authority of Mr. Karzai has yet emerged in Iraq. Rather, a host of former Iraqi opposition leaders who helped persuade the Bush administration to topple Mr. Hussein are jostling for position as this country of many religious and ethnic groups ponders its future governance.
These leaders include Massoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, the Kurdish chieftains of northern Iraq; Ahmad Chalabi and Iyad Alawi, the secular Shiite leaders who have strong backing in Washington; and Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the brother of Ayatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim, who died in a car bomb attack on Aug. 29 in Najaf.
All are on the Governing Council formed in July. All are pushing for a strategy that would reduce Mr. Bremer's authority and strengthen the interim government. But few of them are in any agreement on what sort of constitution should govern the country or which one of them should emerge as Iraq's new leader.
That, however, does not stop them from complaining about Mr. Bremer. When the Governing Council formed in July, he pledged that it would have a major role in finance, security and foreign affairs. 
The council members asked him to put it in writing, which he did, saying he would "consult the Governing Council on all major decisions and questions of policy." Only in "exceptional circumstances," he said, "would the coalition act without the support of the council."
But last week, five Iraqi leaders resolved to tell Mr. Bremer that it was time to fulfill those pledges by giving them real access to Iraq's budget and finances, and to give the new ministry of interior a security role that would allow the American Army to pull back to bases. Mr. Bremer has yet to respond to them.
"Bremer wants to do everything himself -- I mean they call him king over there," said Mudhar Shawkat, a senior member of Mr. Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress. "He has done a lot, but he has yet to consider Iraqis as his partners and treats them as his subjects." 
Underlying the clash of approaches are American and British concerns that Iraq could implode if power is transferred too quickly. 
Iraqi political leaders argue that the proof of their ability to govern lies in the fact that they have been doing so since the Governing Council was formed in July.
They have appointed a cabinet to supervise the tens of thousands of Iraqi experts and technocrats returning to ministries. They have passed laws on foreign direct investment, a customs and income tax system, and a nationalities law to end discrimination. They have also worked closely with the occupation authority on security and finance policies.
But there are other unspoken concerns.
Some senior American and British officials say privately that they are concerned that if an election was held today, a Shiite muslim cleric might well dominate the polling on the strength of the 60 percent Shiite share of the population.
Many Iraqis today say such concerns are exaggerated, that Shiites are divided along secular and religious lines and are unlikely to vote as a bloc unless they perceive a threat that they will be disenfranchised as they were in 1932, when the British withdrawal and Sunni duplicity excluded them from political power.
Still, senior American officials say they are hoping that six months to a year of constitution writing and preparations for national elections will provide a process from which a moderate and secular Shiite leader will emerge to head the first democratic government here, one that would have the independence and self-assurance to avoid tilting toward the conservative Islamists of Iran.

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Mo., a Former Union Worker Who Sees Nothing Getting Better 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON

 BODY:
If the economy is on its way to recovery, it is not evident to Roger Giboney in Mexico, Mo. 
 "I don't see nothing getting any better around here," Mr. Giboney, 59, a former union worker, said. "It might be getting better for the rich people. They might be trying to make like they are helping us. But round here, seems nobody has a chance left." 
 In April 2002, after 38 years of moving and fixing heavy machine equipment in a firebrick factory in this tranquil town of 11,321 people, Mr. Giboney lost his job. The factory, the old A. P. Green Industries plant, once a leader in the refractory industry, had been cutting back for years. In 2002, the factory, a division of RHI A.G. of Austria that made heat-resistant linings for industrial furnaces, closed completely, displacing the last blue- and white-collar employees in the plant.
Mr. Giboney's fortune mirrored those of tens of thousands in this region. A new Census Bureau report shows that the Midwest suffered a greater increase in poverty and reduced income last year than any other area. Missouri led the nation in job losses, shedding 77,700 positions. Many of the losses were factory jobs like those at A. P. Green. 
After four months, Mr. Giboney found a job unloading trucks and moving merchandise at a receiving plant for a retail chain, a faster recovery than some people he knows, he acknowledged. 
But his union job paid $19 an hour plus benefits. The new job pays $8 an hour, without benefits. To make ends meet, Mr. Giboney and his wife, Joyce, have dipped into the $40,000 in savings that they managed to put away over the years. The sum has dwindled, they said, to almost nothing. 
People have told the Giboneys that job losses tend to continue the year after a recession ends and that things should be looking up any time. But the couple's son Rick, 31, the youngest of their three children, lost his factory job in July, when the wire factory where he worked closed.
Rick Giboney and his wife, Sherry, also with three children, are scraping to get by on Ms. Giboney's $9-an-hour position as a manager at McDonald's and Rick's unemployment check of just over $200 a week.
"Recovery?" Rick Giboney asked at his parents' kitchen table. "Whose recovery? When a little bitty town like ours loses so many businesses, you feel it everywhere."
Rick and Sherry Giboney received $800 from the Bush tax cuts. 
"But I wouldn't have wanted it if I'd known it would have come back to bite me in the butt later," he said. "And I know some people struggling with four children who didn't even get anything at all, because they didn't make enough." 
His father jumped in and said: "I don't mind paying taxes, long as I have a job with decent pay coming in. What good is getting a few hundred back, when you don't have a paycheck to go with it?" 
Missouri was one of the many states in which low-income workers planned protests to coincide with the release of the Census figures. Residents of Mexico and surrounding towns rode a bus to St. Louis to voice, among other points, criticism of President Bush's request for $87 billion to spend in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Mr. Giboney, who is a Democrat and has several American flags in his front yard, did not participate in the protest. But he said he was glad that someone did. He added that he hoped that the figures on income and poverty would "wake people up about needs here at home." 
Looking at his son and his wife and photographs of his children and grandchildren, he shook his head again and sighed.
"I'm patriotic," he said "But we need to get Americans on their feet before we go helping other folks."

HEADLINE: Clark Takes His Campaign to New Hampshire 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Sept. 26 

 BODY:
A beaming Gen. Wesley K. Clark popped out of his car here today and into a crush of news people outside the venerable Merrimack Restaurant, a must-stop for decades of passing presidential candidates.
 "Let's mix it up!" General Clark announced. "Let's go!" 
 With that, he wrapped his arm around a bystander, pulled her in close, asked her about herself and asked for her vote. He did the same with a man who said he usually voted Republican and wanted to know General Clark's views on the economy. Glancing at the mob of cameras recording his every gesture, General Clark plunged into the details of his newly announced jobs program. 
It has been a week of firsts for General Clark, who announced his candidacy for president just 10 days ago. He made his first policy address on Monday (on what he calls "a new patriotism"), participated in his first debate on Thursday and today made his first foray into the ritual of one-on-one politicking among the nation's first primary voters.
On the trail this week, he showed himself to be an eager campaigner, holding his listeners in a two-handed grip. And not camera-shy. Asked after the Thursday debate in New York how he liked having all the cameras in his face, he responded, "I love it!"
And he has quickly adapted to the task of modern presidential candidates of connecting to voters. 
At a packed town hall meeting tonight in Henniker, a woman who had been in the Army for 25 years told General Clark an emotional story about what she said was a sexual assault against her. General Clark responded with an apology and said that as a senior commander in the Armed Forces he had let her down and wanted to know what he could do to help her now.
The 54-year-old woman said she found his response heartfelt but was afraid that nothing would be done about sexual assault in the military. General Clark met with her privately after the meeting.
At DePauw University in Indiana earlier this week, he said that despite his position as supreme allied commander in Europe -- with a personal staff of 100 people, a Gulfstream jet at his disposal and a 19th-century Belgian chateau with five gardeners and three greenhouses -- he was one of life's little people. "I'm really one of you guys," he said in a small forum with students.
He said his mother was a bank secretary and his father a recovering alcoholic without a job.
More important, said his growing cadre of aides and advisers, General Clark's first week out has established him as a plausible alternative to the other nine candidates in the field and to President Bush.
"This is a candidate who speaks to big ideas," said Ron Klain, the former chief of staff for Vice President Al Gore and now General Clark's top policy coordinator. "A lot of people on the Hill are concerned that the field is stuck a little bit in the weeds. Clark takes it up a notch. And people look at him as someone who can actually beat George Bush."
But the week also underscored some perils for the four-star retired general as he began introducing himself to the country only four months before the voting begins. 
They included questions about his commitment to the Democratic Party, and whether he can translate his experience in the Army to the new world of elective politics.
These are in addition to the questions asked of all candidates, like whether they offer a message that resonates with voters and whether they can build an organization and raise money. But General Clark has less time to answer them and remains largely unknown to the public.
"He's no Colin Powell," Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster not affiliated with any campaign, said of an enormously popular military man who rejected the idea of entering presidential politics. "He doesn't come on the scene and every group just immediately flocks to him."
He described General Clark's debut week as "a soft handshake rather than a firm handshake." 
But, Mr. Hart added, "he clearly brings something that the Democrats badly need: someone with credentials as commander in chief, and it's that element that works."
His rivals are already starting to make an issue of his votes for the Republicans Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan and questioning his party loyalty. In a statement to The Associated Press, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, another Democratic candidate for president, accused General Clark today of joining the party for "political convenience, not conviction."
In addition, after Thursday's debate, Republicans made available a tape of a speech General Clark gave in May 2001, heaping praise on the Bush administration. On the tape, made at a Republican dinner in Little Rock, Ark., he said: "I'm very glad we've got the great team in office, men like Colin Powell, Don Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, people I know very well -- our president, George W. Bush. We need them there."
He lavished praise on former President Reagan, saying: "He was truly a great American leader. And those of us in the armed forces loved him, respected him and tremendously admired him for his great leadership."
General Clark said today that in 2000, he had voted for Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, and he has been attacking President Bush's economic and foreign policies all week.
Democrats here had a mixed reaction to his history of voting Republican. Jim Partin, 47, a commercial airline pilot and Manchester resident, said this was not a problem for him. "As a former military officer myself, I know that 99 percent of the military is Republican, and it's especially not surprising that he supported Reagan because of the military build-up in the 80's," he said.
Mr. Partin's wife, Isabel, also 47, was not so forgiving. "It's kind of disgusting," she said. "Not so much Reagan, but Nixon -- he was such a black mark on the presidency and on history."
Clark aides said they had hoped that the general had addressed this concern in Thursday's debate with his declaration of support for abortion rights and affirmative action and his relentless criticism of President Bush. "I'm sure he'll have to answer this again," said Bruce Lindsey, a Little Rock lawyer who was a close aide to former President Bill Clinton and is now traveling with General Clark. "But he was in the military for 34 years and you don't want partisans in the military."
General Clark himself learned some lessons in his first week. He found that the news media will pounce on him for inconsistencies. He also learned that old battles can come back to haunt him. He was surprised -- and hurt, aides said -- when he heard a critique of him from Gen. H. Hugh Shelton, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Shelton said that the reason General Clark left his command in Europe early "had to do with integrity and character issues," which he did not elaborate on.
Can voters absorb the man, accept him and decide he should be president, all within the short time that remains? His aides admitted that this was a challenge.
"This is unlike any other campaign I've been involved in," Mr. Klain said. "It's not like we've done months and months of testing different things and then have the guy announce. It's not a campaign that has a political strategist. It's a campaign that has a candidate and a message and the political strategy will have to follow. We'll try a bunch of different things and see what works."

HEADLINE: For Unleashing 'Hulk' Online, Fines and 3 Years of Probation 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
A New Jersey man who released a bootleg version of the movie "The Hulk" on the Internet before it opened in theaters, violating copyright law and costing Universal Pictures what it estimated to be millions of dollars in lost ticket sales, was sentenced yesterday to probation and ordered to pay fines and restitution.
 The man, Kerry Gonzalez, of Hamilton, N.J., apologized in court for the misdeed, which will cost him $5,000 in restitution to Universal, $2,000 in fines and six months of home confinement, with three years of probation. 
 Mr. Gonzalez, 24, pleaded guilty in June in Federal District Court in Manhattan to one count of copyright infringement, a felony for which he could have received a year in prison.
The tape that Mr. Gonzalez uploaded into an Internet chat room in early June was intended for use at an advertising agency. It was unfinished, and the agency was not allowed to make or distribute copies, according to a court document.
But an agency employee lent the tape to a friend, who lent it to Mr. Gonzalez. After he put it on the Internet in advance of the movie's June 20 opening, it became available for further unauthorized copying, "to the economic detriment of Universal," the court papers say.
"I was not allowed to have this copy of the tape," Mr. Gonzalez, who works in the insurance business, said when he pleaded guilty. "I took it home. I captured it onto my personal computer."
Mr. Gonzalez also said he tried to use his computer to defeat an embedded security tag to conceal the tape's origin. "Then I distributed it through a chat room," he said.
But he did not succeed in destroying the tape's tracking mechanism.

HEADLINE: Pakistan Does Its Share 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Pakistan, a Troubled Ally" (editorial, Sept. 21), you say "Pakistan's behavior has fallen well short of what Americans are entitled to expect from an ally in the war on terrorism." 
I am a Pakistani-American, and I feel strongly that Pakistan is being wrongly accused. President Pervez Musharraf and the Pakistani people have played a critical role in the war against terrorism. 
 Pakistan's law enforcement and intelligence agencies have penetrated terrorist organizations, and as a result, several top Qaeda leaders and hundreds of their minions are in United States custody, something American and European agencies could have never done on their own. 
 Furthermore, Pakistan has made the sacrifices in human, social and economic terms. When these sacrifices are not appreciated and instead further accusations are made, as in your editorial, it gives fodder to the minority extreme elements in the country at the expense of the moderate majority.

HEADLINE: Full Disclosure on Full Disclosure 

BYLINE:  By Richard Blow; Richard Blow is author of "American Son: A Portrait of John F. Kennedy Jr."

 BODY:
Last week Arnold Schwarzenegger proclaimed his desire for greater openness in politics. "We need to throw open the doors and windows of government," he said. At the same time, however, Mr. Schwarzenegger has forced his campaign staff to sign strict confidentiality agreements. Under threat of termination, staff members must agree not to disclose information about "Arnold Schwarzenegger and his family, friends, associates and employees." The policy, first described in The Los Angeles Times, stipulates that Mr. Schwarzenegger can obtain an injunction against anyone trying to break it and a fine of $50,000 per violation.
 A campaign aide later promised that if elected, Mr. Schwarzenegger would abandon the policy. In the meantime, his use of confidentiality agreements shows how, as celebrity candidates are becoming more common in politics, so too are the dubious mechanisms of celebrity image control. 
 Confidentiality agreements were once primarily used to protect commercial secrets. More recently, celebrities have adopted these contracts to protect themselves against checkbook journalism and embittered assistants. This isn't such a big deal. But increasingly, confidentiality agreements ban their signers from revealing information that furthers more meritorious public debate. The Catholic Church, for example, used them to silence victims of sexual abuse by priests, possibly allowing that crime to continue longer than it otherwise might have.
These agreements aren't made merely out of a concern for privacy. Confidentiality agreements have become a tool used by the rich and powerful against people who can't afford to turn down a job, as a way to stifle public discussion of embarrassing issues, and as a means of ensuring that a whistle-blower can't throw a wrench into the image-making machinery of a public figure.
They're also something I have firsthand experience with. After the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., I decided to write a book about him and his magazine, where I had been executive editor. Some of the staff members, including me, had signed confidentiality agreements. But could that prohibit me from writing about a man who was no longer alive?
It very possibly could have. When a well-known First Amendment lawyer told one magazine that the document was enforceable, my publisher hastily backed out of an agreement to publish the book. Fearing a legal morass, no other house would touch it.
Stunned, I paid a series of short visits to $500-an-hour lawyers I couldn't possibly afford. No one had ever litigated a case asking whether a confidentiality agreement survived the death of a celebrity journalist. For a sum in the mid-five figures, these lawyers would write a brief arguing my position -- but they could guarantee nothing.
That wasn't very promising. So I abandoned the legal route and spent a year writing without a contract, falling deeply into debt. When the manuscript was done, I managed to find a publisher certain that no one would sue over my laudatory book. But in a way, I was lucky: if the project had been less commercially viable, it would have been killed before a word was written.
However one regards the import of a memoir about John F. Kennedy Jr., the implications of my experience should be disturbing. What if Lyndon Johnson had required his staff to sign confidentiality agreements -- and after his death, Lady Bird chose to enforce them? Or if Senator Hillary Clinton ran for president and compelled the silence of her staff in perpetuity? These are not far-fetched possibilities. (Mrs. Clinton, for instance, required the ghostwriters of her autobiography to sign such documents.) How much valuable information would be lost to history? And how much more easily could political candidates project an image of themselves that covered up a less-flattering reality?
Arnold Schwarzenegger is running for governor of a state with 34 million people and the world's fifth-largest economy. Whether he is qualified is for the state's voters to decide. But they won't be able to judge his fitness for the job if he uses legal intimidation to suppress information about himself.
Confidentiality agreements allow Mr. Schwarzenegger to enter the public arena with very little of the risk that every other noncelebrity politician must live with: that the public will learn unfortunate truths about him. If a candidate isn't willing to take that chance, perhaps he shouldn't be running in the first place.

HEADLINE: Developers Urge Support of Water Transfer to Populous South Florida 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 26 

 BODY:
Some of Florida's wealthiest real estate developers ignited what will probably be a fierce debate this week by urging Gov. Jeb Bush to consider allowing the transfer of water from the state's northern regions to its far more populous south.
 The recommendation came on Thursday in a report by the Florida Council of 100, a private lobbying group that has advised governors on economic and policy issues since the 1960's. The group selects its own members, but the governor's approval of them is necessary. The current chairman is Al Hoffman, a South Florida developer who was the chief fund-raiser for both of Governor Bush's election campaigns and is the national finance chairman for the Republican National Committee. 
 While the recommendations are informal, Mr. Bush will probably consider them carefully, given that many council members are strong supporters of him and his brother the president, for whom Florida will be a pivotal state in the 2004 election. The committee that wrote the report, whose members also include business executives and three newspaper publishers, also called for a statewide water supply commission to replace the five regional districts that currently control water use. 
 The report incensed northern lawmakers and environmentalists, who want Mr. Bush to crack down on development in South Florida instead; such development, they say, is contributing to a statewide imbalance in water distribution. The problem is that northern rural areas have small populations and lots of water, while southern communities have too many people for their water supplies.
Tensions around the report began rising last month, when The St. Petersburg Times revealed preliminary details of it and State Senator James E. King Jr., a Republican whose district is in the north, told the newspaper, "This is as close to North vs. South as you're going to get since the Civil War."
 If Governor Bush endorsed the water-transfer plan, some Republicans say, it would divide Florida's Republicans just in time for President Bush's re-election campaign. The governor would not show his hand on Thursday, telling reporters in Tallahassee only that he saw the recommendations as a starting point.
 "We have a significant problem," Mr. Bush said as he left a meeting in the Capitol. "We need to have a debate about how to deal with it. I don't have a set position. But, gosh, to suggest that we shouldn't let the debate begin on something of this importance I think is wrong." 
 Earlier this week, Mr. Bush addressed criticism of the water-transfer plan by saying the state needed bold ideas.
 "If you start with the premise that we ought to just be timid and be status-quo driven on something that is an issue that will develop over a quarter of a century," he said, "then I would reject that notion." 
 As any longtime Floridian will say, most of the major fights in the state, with its ever-growing population, its dependence on agriculture and its hunger for golf courses and lush gardens, come down to water. And the battle lines have always been clear: 80 percent of the fresh water supply is north of Interstate 4, which snakes across the state from Daytona Beach in the east to Tampa in the west, while 80 percent of the population is south of it.
 The Council of 100 report emphasized that imbalance, saying that 50 percent of the state's fresh water supply is consumed by South Florida, which includes densely populated Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties and much of the state's farmland. Over all, the report said, Florida will need 9.1 billion gallons of fresh water daily by 2020, a 26 percent increase over the current 7.2 billion. The council expects the state's population to grow by 25 percent in that time, but environmental advocates said this week that the council was overestimating projections of water use.
 To end inequities -- rural regions having water surpluses, for example, while the region that includes Tampa had to build an expensive desalination plant a few years ago -- the council wants a seven-member state water commission, appointed by the governor, that would have broad powers to allocate water statewide. The regional water districts -- whose leaders are also appointees of the governor -- would still exist under the plan, but would have less power over their region's water supply.
 State law already allows the transfer of water from one region to another, but it requires a region to take every measure possible to find water nearby first. The report recommended eliminating that requirement, saying, "Developing a system that enables water distribution from water-rich areas to water-poor areas seems to make good environmental and economic sense." Such a system would also allow water-rich communities to profit from selling some of their supply, the report said.
 Most of the report's recommendations would require the Legislature's approval as well as Mr. Bush's. But while many lawmakers from North Florida will resist endorsing the plan, South Florida, with its bigger population, has far more votes in the Legislature. 
David B. Struhs, commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Protection, told Governor Bush in a memorandum last month that the water-use strategies that the five regional water districts had devised were sufficient. Most notably, the South Florida Water Management District is pursuing an $8.4 billion plan both to restore the Everglades and to conserve enough water to meet South Florida's needs for the foreseeable future.
But Lee Arnold, the council member who headed the panel, echoed many skeptics when he said on Thursday that the expensive plan might not provide much potable water. 
 Mr. Arnold is a developer in the state's increasingly populous southwestern region. Other members of the panel include Alfonso Fanjul, chairman of the Florida Crystals sugar company; Ben Hill Griffin III, chairman of Alico, a major citrus company; and Bill Graham, a developer who is the nephew of Senator Bob Graham, a Democratic presidential candidate. 
 A coalition of environmental groups, including the Florida Wildlife Federation, Audubon of Florida and the Clean Water Network, said on Thursday that the council should focus on curbing development, not accommodating it. 
 "The problem is population growth," said Eric Draper, a lobbyist for Audubon of Florida. "Figure out how to grow population in a way that you don't have to have these excessive uses." 
 Asked on Thursday why the council had not taken on the question of population growth, Mr. Arnold said, "That isn't for us to decide."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a proposed regional water transfer in Florida misattributed a report of a comment from State Senator James E. King, who said, "This is as close to North vs. South as you're going to get since the Civil War." It appeared in The Palm Beach Post, not The St. Petersburg Times.

HEADLINE: With Oil Smoothing Ties, Russia Sends Message to U.S. About Iraqi Contracts 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE

 BODY:
The moment was a small but sweet victory for the Russian oil baron Vagit Y. Alekperov: the Getty gas station he bought in Manhattan three years ago was renamed yesterday after his own huge oil company, Lukoil, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was on hand to ring in the change, coffee cup in one hand and Krispy Kreme doughnut in the other.
 Mr. Alekperov wanted American consumers to understand that they need Russian oil and that companies like his are ready to provide it. For the last two years, oil has become an increasingly powerful bond between the United States, the world's largest consumer, and Russia, among the largest producers. 
 But Mr. Alekperov's trip to the United States as part of Mr. Putin's entourage may partly be in the hope that the Bush administration could help Lukoil with a crucial oil interest outside Russia: the huge West Qurna field in Iraq.
Lukoil is among several foreign companies that negotiated contracts and memorandums of understanding with the government of Saddam Hussein to develop oil fields once United Nations sanctions were lifted. The sanctions are gone, but so is the old government. Lukoil, along with the other companies, now worry that the agreements they spent years and millions of dollars to develop will be abrogated by the new Iraqi authorities.
People close to Mr. Putin and Mr. Alekperov said that they expected Mr. Putin to raise the question of protecting the Russian oil contracts with President Bush during their weekend meeting at Camp David.
"The Iraqi question will clearly be on the agenda of the summit," Mr. Alekperov said in an interview in New York on Thursday evening. "I think the president of a country and the government should help their own companies."
After going it alone for so many years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian companies are now finding opportunities in which American help would be invaluable. At an oil conference earlier this week in St. Petersburg, Russian oil companies talked about the need for American assistance in building more oil infrastructure to ease exports, like ports, storage facilities and pipelines. And it is widely known that ChevronTexaco and Exxon Mobil are vying to buy a large stake, perhaps as much as 25 percent, in Yukos, Russia's largest oil company.
Lukoil itself is not on the market, Mr. Alekperov said. But the company did receive financing from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, an agency backed by the United States government, to build a terminal in Leningrad province to supply gasoline to 1,300 Getty gas stations the company bought in the United States three years ago, including the one that Mr. Putin visited yesterday in Manhattan, at 10th Avenue and 24th Street.
In this kind of feel-good atmosphere, Lukoil is hoping that its efforts to preserve its old Iraqi oil contracts gains some traction with the White House. West Qurna, which is in southeastern Iraq, could hold 15 billion barrels of oil, according to a 2002 report by Deutsche Bank. Developing the reserves, which could yield one million barrels a day at peak production, would require about $3.7 billion, the report said.
Given the dangers in Iraq and the sabotage of the Iraqi oil industry in particular, work on West Qurna may be years away. But oil companies work on the long timelines of research scientists, and Lukoil wants to try and protect its contract now.
Certainly, Mr. Putin has expressed interest in the issue. Mr. Alekperov confirmed that he went to Mr. Putin's vacation home in southern Russia on Sept. 6 and discussed the Iraqi contract with him in detail.
"From the impression I have, Lukoil is probably the company that is most well placed with Putin now," said Julia Nanay, an expert on the Russian oil industry at PFC Energy, a consulting firm. "The company's international expansion is focused on the Caspian and Iraq, and Putin is focused on those places."
She added, "Putin understands the importance of a Russian presence in energy projects, and it's a Russian ambition to have a role in Iraq."
There is a great deal of speculation in Moscow these days that Russia would agree to send troops to help the American-led coalition in Iraq if the Bush administration moved to protect Russian oil interests in that country, according to Russian businessmen. But a person with Mr. Putin's delegation who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that Mr. Putin would likely abide by what he has said all along: that Russia would only send troops if the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution authorizing such a step.
Mr. Alekperov said that he knew of no such quid pro quo of oil for Russian military help, but did not discount the possibility of Russian troops going to Iraq at some point. Sending troops, he said, "is a political question. But if oil contracts go through quickly, we would have lots of Russian oil specialists on the ground, and every country should be able to protect its own people."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE COST; 
Debate Rises Where Bush And Marshall Plans Diverge

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 

 BODY:
The Bush administration says its plan to rebuild Iraq is modeled on the farsighted spirit of the Marshall Plan. But lawmakers and historians are increasingly finding flaws in the postwar analogy, many of which are at the heart of the debate over the administration's $87 billion spending request, which includes a modest amount for Afghanistan.
 The Marshall Plan, they say, required a much larger contribution from its European beneficiaries after World War II than the administration is asking of Iraq. 
 European countries were required by the Truman administration to match every dollar of American aid, and 10 percent of the Marshall Plan's $13 billion was made up of loans. By contrast, the $20.3 billion reconstruction grant for Iraq is not contingent on any contribution from that country's future revenues. 
L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator in Iraq, told senators this week that Iraq might eventually be able to share a large part of the costs with its oil revenues, but he said the country was too burdened with debt to take on another large loan now. 
Iraq owes $200 billion, about half in reparations to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for damages surrounding the invasion of Kuwait and the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the rest borrowed from France, Russia, Germany and Japan by Saddam Hussein's government.
The refusal to guarantee the United States some form of return on its investment is causing enormous consternation among both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. Their constituents are pressing them to explain the great expenditures on Iraq at a time of high deficits and squeezed domestic spending. 
Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, told Mr. Bremer at a hearing on Thursday that Americans would be "justifiably outraged" if a dime of taxpayer aid allowed Iraq to pay back its loans to creditors in France or Saudi Arabia.
"The American taxpayer is very generous," she said, citing Iraq's short-term needs. "But in the long run, Iraq will be a prosperous country. Therefore, it seems logical to many of us to come up with a way to structure part of the construction costs as a long-term loan." 
Similar requests have been raised in the House by lawmakers as disparate as Tom Lantos of California, a liberal Democrat, and Jeff Flake of Arizona, a conservative Republican.
Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said today that the administration still opposed a loan to Iraq, but was willing to work with Congress to get the package approved.
Mr. Bremer and other administration officials say that Iraq's needs are immediate and desperate, and that the investment is necessary to prevent Iraq from returning to the kind of tyranny that can breed terrorism. 
"A stable, peaceful, economically productive Iraq will serve American interests by making Americans safer," Mr. Bremer told the Senate Armed Services Committee this week as part of a weeklong marathon of Congressional testimony.
But Larry I. Bland, the editor of Gen. George C. Marshall's papers, said the primary purpose of the European reconstruction program was not a guarantee of safety or pure altruism but rather American and global economic needs.
"The primary emphasis of the Marshall Plan was on restimulating trade," said Mr. Bland, who has produced four volumes of the former secretary of state's papers for the Marshall Foundation at the Virginia Military Institute. 
"The countries of Europe already knew how to build bridges and phone systems," he said. "But they had no money to buy anything from us, so trade was dead. The idea was to stimulate their economy so they could buy goods again."
Some Republicans, like Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said the comparison to the previous plan was apt, predicting that the reconstruction of Iraq would eventually pay for itself many times over. Senator Jim Talent, Republican of Missouri, said it would be harder to ask allies to help pay for Iraq's rebuilding if the United States was only willing to advance a loan.
Measured in today's dollars, the Marshall Plan cost the United States about $90 billion to $100 billion, far more than the administration is now proposing to spend on Iraq's reconstruction. 
But Democrats note with bitterness that current Republican leaders are allotting only a few weeks of debate on the Iraq plan, compared with the months of Congressional debate and testimony that took place in 1947 and 1948.
"To say this is a Marshall Plan couldn't be further from the truth," said Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader. "We're having only a few hearings, and the president hasn't even presented us with a real plan. The president expects the taxpayers of America to shoulder virtually all of the cost of this effort in human lives and tax dollars, and that's too much to ask the American people."
The first phase of the Marshall Plan passed Congress overwhelmingly in the spring of 1948, but not without vocal opposition from many Republicans. 
Mr. Bland said that the isolationist Taft wing of the Republican Party fought the plan as a "budget buster and a big-government giveaway," but that Marshall, then the secretary of state, eventually persuaded large majorities of the danger of isolationism and of the economic benefits to the nation. 
In contrast to the Iraq plan, Marshall had to promise that his plan would be administered by an agency independent of the White House, would be limited to four years, and that its priorities would be determined by Europeans, not Americans.
"It would be neither fitting nor efficacious for this government to undertake to draw up unilaterally a program designed to place Europe on its feet economically," Marshall said in a speech on June 5, 1947. "This is the business of the Europeans. The initiative, I think, must come from Europe."

HEADLINE: MORE AMERICANS IN POVERTY IN 2002, CENSUS STUDY SAYS 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 

 BODY:
The number of Americans living in poverty increased by 1.7 million last year, and the median household income declined by 1.1 percent, the Census Bureau reported today. The worsening economic conditions fell heaviest on Midwesterners and nonwhites. 
 It was the second straight year of adverse changes in both poverty and income, the first two-year downturn since the early 1990's. 
 The data, results of the Census Bureau's annual Current Population Survey, the official barometer for measuring income and poverty rates, showed that lingering negative effects of the recent recession cut across a broad swath of the population. 
The official poverty rate rose to 12.1 percent in 2002 from 11.7 percent the year before, bringing to total number of people living below the poverty line to 34.6 million. 
The median household earned income fell $500 over the same period to $42,400. Per capita income declined by 1.8 in 2002 to $22,794, the first decline since 1991. 
Daniel H. Weinberg, chief of the Census Bureau's Housing and Household Economic Statistics Division, said the findings were consistent with the bureau's expectations.
"If you look at the historical timeline trend, there is a lag with poverty rates," Mr. Weinberg said. "Low points in poverty and income seem to come the year after a recession ends." 
The most recent recession lasted from March 2001 through November 2001, though job losses have continued at high rates this year. 
Asked about the census data, Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said, "The actions that we've taken to boost the economy and to create jobs are essential to turn this around."
At his daily press briefing, Mr. McClellan, rather than focusing on the census data, pointed instead to newly released figures from the Commerce Department that showed a larger-than-expected rise in the gross domestic product.
A 3.3 percent increase in G.D.P. in the second quarter of this year, Mr. McClellan suggested, indicates that the economy is moving in a positive direction. 
Gross domestic product is considered a leading economic indicator, while poverty is seen as a lagging indicator.
Within hours of the morning release of the data, Democrats seized on the figures to criticize Bush administration policies in a flurry of faxed press releases, e-mailed statements and news conferences. 
"This is sad news that the Bush administration is trying to sweep under the rug," said Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, a Democratic presidential candidate. "I'd like to hear President Bush explain to all the single mothers with kids living in poverty how his tax breaks for the rich are helping them."
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the newest Democratic candidate, said of Mr. Bush, "With a record like this he shouldn't be running for president, he should be running for the hills."
In general, poverty rates over the last two years have not been as severe as in the aftermath of past recessions, a point several conservative analysts pointed out.
"As recessions go this is extremely good news," said Robert E. Rector, a senior research fellow with the Heritage Foundation. "This shows that this has been a shallow recession that has been mild in its impact, and it also shows the positive impact of welfare reform which has kept more women in the work force."
The Midwest was the only area of the country to have a significant increase in poverty rates, rising to 10.3 percent from 9.4 percent a year earlier. Real median income declined 2 percent in the region, with drops in important battleground states in next year's presidential election, including Illinois, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio.
Among racial groups African-Americans suffered the worst increases in poverty, after several years of economic progress in the 1990's. The poverty rate among blacks rose to 24.1 percent from 22.7 percent a year earlier. Median income for blacks fell 3 percent. 
Other racial and ethnic groups also saw significant decreases in median income, which declined 4.5 percent for Asians, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders and 2.9 percent for Hispanics, a group that Mr. Bush has been courting.
And though rates of poverty did not change significantly from 2001 for those under age 18 and over age 65, staying afloat was harder last year for people aged 18 to 64, the bulk of the work force. 
The poverty threshold for a family of four is $18,392. For individuals the amount is $9,183. The percentage of people in severe poverty, those with incomes below half of the poverty threshold, increased to 14.1 million from 13.4 million. 
Liberal economists took the position that any increase in poverty was too high, given the relative prosperity of the country. Many also criticized policy shifts, which they said reduced the social safety net for the poor, like reductions in child care assistance and reduced unemployment insurance benefits.
"We would all expect poverty go up some in an economic downturn," said Robert Greenstein, executive director for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. "But misplaced priorities by Congress and the president are making the increase in poverty larger than it needs to be."
As controversial as the data was the timing of its release. Typically the results of the annual survey have been released on a Tuesday in late September at the National Press Club in downtown Washington. 
This year the bureau scheduled the release for a Friday, the first time it has done so, and moved the news conference from the centrally located press club to the bureau's suburban headquarters in Suitland, Md. The switch prompted some advocates and lawmakers to speculate that the government agency had been pressured by the administration to move the date and place so that that the results, which most people expected to be worse than they were last year, would generate less attention in the weekend news cycle.
The effect of the move meant that the figures on poverty and income were released on the same day as the data on G.D.P., data that many economists expected to be more positive.
Census officials maintained that the delayed release had to do with nothing more than a work backlog.
"We were running into technical problems getting it all done; we were running behind," Mr. Weinberg said. "So we decided, hey, how about some more time."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 8, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sept. 27 about the increase last year in the number of Americans living in poverty and its connection to the recent recession referred incorrectly to the gross domestic product. While the G.D.P. helps measure the current economic performance, it is not a leading indicator -- one that predicts conditions.

 ACT OF CREATION
The Founding of the United Nations:
A Story of Superpowers, Secret Agents, Wartime Allies and Enemies, and
Their Quest for a Peaceful World.
By Stephen C. Schlesinger.
Illustrated. 374 pp. Boulder, Colo.:
Westview Press. $27.50.
 Anyone who has ever watched the History Channel or CNN must be familiar with the grainy black-and-white film of President Harry S. Truman, seated on the stage of the San Francisco Opera House on June 26, 1945, signing the United Nations Charter. That iconic moment links World War II and the cold war; the great wartime alliance with the Soviet Union still exists as the war enters its final months with Japan, but the tensions that will become the cold war are already evident to some American and British officials, even as the world celebrates the birth of the United Nations.
Amazingly, the event that led to that ceremony -- the San Francisco conference, which once gripped the world --has been almost totally ignored by historians. Stephen Schlesinger, a historian of foreign affairs who runs the World Policy Institute at the New School University, has filled that gap with "Act of Creation," a superb book that reconstructs this drama with great lucidity, and illuminates its contemporary relevance. With the exception of "FDR and the Creation of the U.N.," a 1997 study by Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley that focuses on the Roosevelt era and has only one chapter on San Francisco, little has been published about the founding of the world body. (Schlesinger says that many editors rejected his book proposal the moment he mentioned that it was about the United Nations -- the publishing equivalent, he notes wryly, of "biting on a sour lemon.")
The United Nations did not spring full-blown from the minds of Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill (although its name did come from Roosevelt, who burst into Churchill's bathroom at the White House to unveil his inspiration). An obscure but determined State Department official named Leo Pasvolsky had been working in secret on a postwar world organization since the end of 1939, under the direct guidance of Secretary of State Cordell Hull. Pasvolsky, a Russian-born journalist and economist who had covered the failure of the League of Nations first-hand, was one of those figures peculiar to Washington -- a tenacious bureaucrat who, fixed on a single goal, left behind a huge legacy while virtually disappearing from history.
By 1944 most key elements of the new organization were in place in Pasvolsky's draft, especially an idea that evolved into the United Nations Security Council -- a small group of nations that would be empowered to authorize the use of force, in the words of Article 39 of the Charter, "to maintain or restore international peace and security." The most important change in the later drafts was that they accorded to the "Four Policemen" -- the United States, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and China -- permanent membership on the Security Council and authority to veto its resolutions. At San Francisco, France was also given this special status, with consequences to this day (as Colin Powell can attest).
In the spring of 1945 everybody came to San Francisco, or so it seemed, to draft the final version of the United Nations Charter. The Soviet Union was represented by its rigid foreign minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Stalin's young ambassador to the United States, Andrei Gromyko (then at the beginning of an astonishingly long diplomatic career that would not end until Mikhail Gorbachev was already in power). On issue after issue, Moscow took positions that foreshadowed the cold war. To get around Molotov and Gromyko, Truman used his ambassador in Moscow, Averell Harriman, and Roosevelt's legendary special envoy, Harry Hopkins, who arose from his deathbed to make a final trip to Moscow to persuade Stalin to drop several impossible demands, and, in the view of most observers, including Schlesinger, saved the San Francisco conference.
The American delegation in San Francisco was led by Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius, a lightly regarded man whom Schlesinger tries to elevate in stature. A handsome former U.S. Steel chairman, Stettinius was described by one delegation member, the future Nobel Prize winner Ralph Bunche, as "a complete dud." He was demeaned by the press (and especially by the most important journalist in San Francisco, James Reston of The Times), looked down on by most of his colleagues, and nearly forgotten by history. But it is Schlesinger's surprising conclusion that, in fact, Stettinius presided with skill and patience over a fractious group of prima donnas, and deserves credit for forging a successful outcome from what could have been a chaotic mess.
Stettinius was certainly treated badly by Truman, but he kept his dignity in public, continuing his efforts even after he learned, in the middle of the San Francisco meetings, that he would be replaced as soon as the conference ended by Senator James F. Byrnes of South Carolina. (Stettinius gracefully accepted the position of first American ambassador to the United Nations.) Still, it is not poor Stettinius, but the strong-willed team surrounding him that fascinates today. By any standard it was a remarkable group, containing five men who would seek the presidency (Adlai Stevenson, Nelson Rockefeller, Harriman, Arthur Vandenberg and Harold Stassen), a future Republican secretary of state (John Foster Dulles), the Republican chairman and the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (Senators Vandenberg and Tom Connelly), and, as the secretary general of the entire conference, a State Department official named Alger Hiss.
The inclusion of the two senators was Roosevelt's last masterstroke, designed to avoid the risk that the Senate might reject the United Nations as it had the League of Nations in 1920 -- an event that Roosevelt and Truman were determined at all costs not to repeat. Critical to this strategy was the self-regarding but powerful Vandenberg. Schlesinger shows how his commitment to bipartisan internationalism was locked into place at San Francisco. Vandenberg's vanity made him believe that he was almost singlehandedly responsible for the United Nations. "You could have heard a pin drop all the way through my speech," he wrote in his diary after his Senate speech calling for immediate ratification of the charter. The price of humoring Vandenberg was worth paying; his support ensured easy Senate ratification.
Truman comes across in "Act of Creation" as far more than the executor of Roosevelt's grand design. It was not at all smooth sailing in San Francisco, but through it all Truman steered a steady course. He and Stettinius flattered Vandenberg, co-opted Dulles (who for the rest of his career would respect and support the United Nations), held off Molotov and Gromyko while Hopkins and Harriman worked things out with Stalin, and tried to keep their volatile assistant secretary for Latin America, Nelson Rockefeller, who seemed determined to run a separate foreign policy, under control. Under the guidance of another distinguished assistant secretary of state, Archibald MacLeish (who twice won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry), the administration put together an immensely sophisticated public relations operation -- a campaign that involved business groups, labor, church leaders, schoolchildren, women's groups and academia, and created a huge wave of support for the United Nations.
To Truman, the opportunity to preside at the creation of the world organization must have had an almost mystical meaning. Unknown to the public, he had carried folded in his wallet for years several stanzas of his favorite poem, Tennyson's "Locksley Hall," which ended:
For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,
Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonders that would be . . .
Till the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the battle-flags were furl'd
In the Parliament of Man, the Federation of the World.
Of course, reality would hijack the Parliament of Man: during the cold war the United Nations was often marginalized, unable to solve, or sometimes even to address, many of the world's most pressing problems. An explosion of new states that almost quadrupled its membership (now 191) changed the very nature of the United Nations. And its inefficient bureaucracy needs more reform, despite some valiant efforts by its current secretary general, Kofi Annan.
For these and many other reasons, it has become easy, even fashionable in some quarters, to criticize the United Nations. But can any serious policy maker actually think that the world -- and especially the United States -- would be better off without this organization? Its record of achievement -- from specialized agencies like UNICEF and WHO to successful peacekeeping operations in such places as Namibia and East Timor -- is substantial; without the United Nations the world would be in far worse shape. Despite its flaws, the United Nations still serves American foreign policy interests far more than it hurts them.
Blaming "the United Nations" for what happens inside the talk palaces on the East River is like blaming Madison Square Garden for the New York Knicks. In fact, the United Nations is no more -- and no less -- than the sum of its member states, and what happens there is determined not in New York but in the world's capitals, which send their ambassadors instructions on major issues. American success at the United Nations therefore requires hard diplomatic work not only in New York but in countries around the world, something that has unfortunately not been a regular ingredient of American foreign relations in recent years; hence such unpleasant surprises as the loss of America's seat on the Human Rights Commission in 2001.
Despite the United Nations' achievements over the years, major improvements are essential. This requires, above all, stronger leadership from the nation that founded the organization, hosts its world headquarters and remains its largest source of funds. But the fault hardly lies solely with the United States. Other nations, especially the so-called nonaligned movement, or NAM, a group of over 120 nations formed as a "third force" during the cold war, have regularly voted for one-sided General Assembly resolutions concerning Israel and other issues -- resolutions full of empty rhetoric and cheap symbolism, but damaging to the organization as well as the Middle East peace process. The United States should work actively to break up or reduce the size of the NAM; this would contribute greatly to advancing the peace process in the Middle East, and strengthen the United Nations. Many will say this is a hopeless quest, but it can be done, as was demonstrated on some key votes during the Clinton administration, when the United States prevented the Sudan from becoming a Security Council member, reformed the entire financial structure of the United Nations, reduced its own dues and repaid most of its huge arrears.
In peacekeeping, still its most important function, the United Nations rises or falls with the actions of the Big Five. Adlai Stevenson, later President Kennedy's ambassador to the United Nations, saw this with perfect foresight at the very beginning. The charter "is only paper," he said in a speech in Chicago in 1945, "no better and no worse than the will and intentions of its five major members." 
No serious policy maker would advocate subordinating American national security interests to the United Nations; for this reason President Clinton twice used force in the Balkans (in Bosnia in 1995 and in Kosovo in 1999) without Security Council authority. But the United Nations provides the United States with an invaluable forum from which to advance parts of its global agenda, fully protected by the Security Council veto in precisely the way that the Truman team foresaw.
Truman correctly called the United Nations "imperfect," but his challenge to future generations was to improve on their creation, not weaken it. This is the deeper meaning of Schlesinger's book. A strong United Nations is in America's national interests; a demeaned, weakened and underfunded United Nations only undermines American diplomacy. With this in mind, it would be a tragedy if 21st-century policy makers continue to fail those who assembled in San Francisco 58 years ago.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 19, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A review of "Act of Creation: The Founding of the United Nations" on Sept. 28 referred incorrectly to two senators who were present at the adoption of the Charter in San Francisco in 1945. Tom Connally was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, not just its ranking Democrat; Arthur Vandenberg was an influential Republican member of the committee, not its chairman.

 THE SMALL BOAT
OF GREAT SORROWS
By Dan Fesperman.
308 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $24.
 When we first meet Vlado Petric, the homicide-detective-cum-Bosnian-refugee hero of Dan Fesperman's deft, gripping new spy novel, he's sitting atop a backhoe in a hard hat clearing out a muddy platz in central Berlin. One of his fellow workers strikes a big slab of concrete, and the two men dig furiously until they unearth an old SS bunker. Vlado has just started poking around inside when the boss appears. "Bury it," he says, impatiently.
Ah, but in the world of international espionage thrillers the past never stays buried. So it is that when Vlado gets off work and trudges back to his apartment in a gray high-rise in the suburbs, he finds an American investigator from the war crimes tribunal at The Hague waiting for him in his living room. Thus begins Vlado's journey across the continent in pursuit of a Croatian Nazi collaborator; in the spirit of the genre, it's a manhunt fueled as much by Vlado's effort to assemble the pieces of his late father's hidden history as it is by his desire to see justice served, however belatedly. This time, in other words, it's personal.
The espionage novel was rescued from sub-literary depths decades ago. The secret was in the shading. The protagonist, usually a brooding loner, needed flaws, the antagonist needed nuance and everyone in between needed to be as opaque as possible. So much the better if the author could knit in a sins-of-the-father subplot, as John le Carre did so brilliantly in "A Perfect Spy" with Magnus Pym, the double-agent son of an infamous con artist.
Fesperman breaks all of these rules in "The Small Boat of Great Sorrows." Vlado is not only a devoted husband and father, he's unimpeachably virtuous, while Pero Matek, the Nazi collaborator he's chasing, is every bit as murderous as advertised by the tribunal. The peripheral characters -- the ex-prostitute with a heart of gold; the brash, endearing ex-cop from the Bronx; the glib, menacing State Department liaison -- are easy enough to sort out as well. As a literary endeavor, the novel, Fesperman's second, suffers from this lack of moral ambiguity and psychological subtlety, but their absence doesn't slow the momentum of this impeccably plotted and ably written book.
Vlado is recruited for the mission because his father was, according to the tribunal's dossier, a friend and accomplice of Matek's. Who better, then, to help lure the old man down from his encampment in the snow-encrusted hills of Bosnia? Of course, the war crimes tribunal would never waste its time hunting down an aging Nazi, even one who'd made off with two crates of gold from the state bank of Croatia, unless there was something sexier at stake. Matek, it turns out, is just a consolation. The real prize is Marko Andric, the Serbian general responsible for the massacre at Srebrenica. It's diplomatic quid pro quo: if the tribunal brings in Matek, a Croat, the French will deliver them Andric, a Serb.
Fesperman evokes the feel of Vlado's beloved Sarajevo -- ravaged but functioning and maybe even a little bored with this unfamiliar state known as peacetime -- magnificently. The journalists moved on years ago, but the vacuum has been filled by international businessmen looking to squeeze a profit from the nongovernmental organizations and European Union subagencies that have undertaken the country's so-called rebuilding. The bombs may no longer be exploding, but the city still wears its scars -- rubble-strewn streets, abandoned apartment houses, burned-out office towers. Fesperman, a foreign correspondent for The Baltimore Sun, describes his hero's surroundings economically and with reportorial precision. "Shell holes had been patched and repaired," he writes of Vlado's Sarajevo Holiday Inn. "And now the place again had uninterrupted heat, water, electricity and phone service, with real windows instead of the sheets of plastic that had been taped over the shattered frames during the fighting. Yet the lobby still smelled faintly of leaks and dampness, mildew and smoke, an enduring desolation that clung like rot." 
Vlado has a partner, Calvin Pine, the American investigator who went to fetch him in Berlin. In one of their first exchanges, Pine explains why his countrymen had such a hard time getting their heads around the ethnic strife in the Balkans: "Family always seems to make such a difference in your country. Families and where you grew up. . . . Hell, if you're from a small town in America, the first thing you want to do is get out." But at the same time, Pine is living proof that his country has its own systemic problems. A former assistant United States attorney, he joined the tribunal because he was tired of locking up young American drug mules.
Not that this job doesn't come with its own frustrations. After Matek eludes them, Vlado and Pine run afoul of the State Department, which tries to bully them into retreating. They press on, naturally, stopping in Rome to debrief a disgraced, paranoid ex-spook who implicates Washington in Matek's charmed postwar life. There are occasional melodramatic digressions, including Vlado's periodic attempts to phone his worried wife and daughter, whom the tribunal has ordered him not to contact for fear of jeopardizing the mission, but the action is more or less nonstop. 
Vlado and Pine wind up in an unattractive town at the northern edge of the Amalfi coast where Matek lived under an assumed name after World War II. By now, even the tribunal is calling them off, but Vlado is moving closer to the truth about his father's past and he has no intention of stopping until the final pieces are in place. While the villains aren't quite led off in chains, the novel closes more Clancy than le Carre. It comes as no surprise when Vlado learns that his father may have acquitted himself fairly nobly considering the burdens of history that he, like so many in the former Yugoslavia, inherited at birth. 
"The Small Boat of Great Sorrows" manages to survive its Hollywood finish, much as it transcends its black-and-white moral landscape. There's even something reassuring, if unfashionable, in being able to distinguish the good guys from the bad. But Fesperman's biggest contribution to his genre may be his discovery of the narrative potential of the Balkans. Cold war Europe, with its shadowy deceptions and murky defections, has a worthy successor in this land of divided loyalties and uncomfortably overlapping layers of violent history.

 WHERE I WAS FROM
By Joan Didion.
226 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $23.
 JOAN DIDION, who will turn 70 next year, belongs to that minority of Americans for whom, in the telling of family history, the "crossing" refers to an overland journey and not an ocean voyage. Didion's early fiction and landmark first essay collection, "Slouching Towards Bethlehem" (1968), drew frequent attention to her descent from pioneers, and her new book, "Where I Was From," reminds us that in 1846 some of her forebears traveled part of their way west with the doomed and eventually cannibalistic Donner party.
The women in Didion's family lived "without much time for second thoughts, without much inclination toward equivocation." Didion herself became a writer so famously distrustful of abstraction that the skeptical quotation marks she liked to put around all but the commonest of nouns constituted an important element in one of the most recognizable -- and brilliant -- literary styles to emerge in America during the past four decades.
In contrast to those female ancestors, this new book of Didion's is full of second thoughts: about the Sacramento Valley of her childhood and, finally, the whole history of California. What we get is a darker view of the "crossing" than this writer has presented before, one in which its supposed "redemptive power" has pretty much vanished. The emphasis is now on futility, not heroism, more on chicanery and self-delusion than the self-respect she once said her ancestors "knew all about." Her title is strictly accurate; this is a reconsideration of a place, not the conventional memoir of a person. The book's autobiographical aspect is intellectual and moral, an attempt to account for what Didion now sees as the "strikingly unearned" pride she and her family took in California and their early arrival there.
Some of this volume's material first appeared a decade ago in The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books, but it has been reshaped to an effect that seems not at all miscellaneous. This "exploration into my own confusions" becomes a connected argument and, sometimes quite directly, a fascinating gloss on Didion's own earlier writings. If its very doubts sometimes themselves seem dubious, the book nevertheless feels like a fresh departure, something that will be appreciated especially by longtime admirers who have been disappointed in the paucity and repetitions of her more recent work.
Didion is these days trying to rid herself of the sense that there used to be "true" Californians who were overwhelmed by later, particularly postwar, arrivals -- the ones who brought with them, or created, what she called in "Slouching Towards Bethlehem" "the flotsam of the New California." Beginning a scholarly quest for a different understanding of her home state, Didion is distressed to find herself quoted, twice, in a recent history book on just that subject. She accomplishes her revisionism only with the help of much older texts, like Charles Nordhoff's "Northern California, Oregon and the Sandwich Islands" (1874), Josiah Royce's "California: A Study of American Character" (1886) and Frank Norris's novel "The Octopus" (1901), which she now views not as a blunderbuss of naturalism but as "a deeply ambiguous work" in which the octopus is nature itself (not the railroad, as people usually remember) and the wheat ranchers are "farmers with tickers in their offices," speculators more in love with the score than the land -- and thereby, in Didion's current view, truer to the state's ethos than those Californians she used to accept as "true."
As the author now sees it, the state's history is all of a piece, a saga always advanced with "somebody else's money," chiefly the federal government's, "spent on behalf of a broad spectrum of business interests" -- enough of it to build the railroads; to flood the Sacramento Valley into a wondrously unnatural fertility ("a vast agricultural mechanism in a kind of market vacuum"); and to dapple the southern part of the state with a vast patchwork of modern suburbs centered on the defense and aerospace industries. The residents of those subdivisions became merely the latest "artificial ownership class" in the state's dependent history.
The individualists and buccaneers who used to excite this author's attentive admiration now seem more like a weary succession of itinerants on the public dole. The whole human presence in California has begun to feel like such a fiasco to Didion that she finds the people-banishing poems of Big Sur's Robinson Jeffers ("When the cities lie at the monster's feet there are left the mountains") starting to make "fatally seductive sense."
It now appears to Didion that Californians neverreally practiced the sort of personal responsibility, the "wagon-train morality," that she extolled almost 40 years ago. "Where I Was From" impeaches the sworn collective belief that the state's citizens "were meant to show spirit, kill the rattlesnake, keep moving." In fact, Didion now argues, California has always been a republic of buck-passers who let someone else kill the snake after they had managed to get out of its way. She remembers how, as a young woman, she herself, seeing a rattlesnake in the cemetery her family used to own, "failed to get out of the car and kill it" -- the same way her mother never killed the copperhead that slithered near Didion's brother's playpen.
The cemetery found a place in Didion's first novel, "Run River" (1963), a book conceived in the period when the giant Irvine and Hollister ranches were ready to be broken up for development, a time when the "old" or "true" California of the author's childhood seemed on its way out for good. Didion was in her late 20's; she'd come east to work at Vogue and was, she now says, "experiencing a yearning for California so raw that night after night, on copy paper filched from my office," she "wrote myself a California river." The author's current rereading of "Run River" -- the story of Lily Knight McClellan and her husband, Everett, who grows hops in the Sacramento Valley -- makes up the most interesting part of "Where I Was From," an almost penitential chapter in which Didion reconsiders the way she once viewed her characters' baffled gestures and angry shibboleths with something like pride. She can no longer concede them the staunchness she did then. In that book of her young imagination, change was "understood to mean decline"; today she finds the novel's nostalgia as "pernicious" as it is "tenacious."
Some of that tenacity can be discerned even in this new book's treatment of Lakewood, Calif., the suburb from which the sexually rampaging, teenage "Spur Posse" emerged, into brief talk-show infamy, during the early 1990's. Amid whatever sympathy Didion may feel for Lakewood's parents -- then losing their mortgaged dreams to layoffs at McDonnell Douglas -- one notices a remnant of the old pioneer contempt: the residents of this boom-time "breeder town" irritate her with their insistence on seeing themselves as middle-class rather than working-class.
DIDION'S efforts to trace the real beginnings of her conversion from California myth -- she cites incidents from the early 1970's and even some cracks in "Run River" -- give this book a much more coherent, convincing feel than the attempt she made, a couple of years ago, to explain her overall political development. In the introduction to a collection of essays called "Political Fictions" (2001), Didion took less than a single paragraph -- one that defies any known political science or close reading -- to explain how she had gone from voting "ardently" for Barry Goldwater in 1964 to registering as a Democrat a few years later.
Despite an equally inexplicable assertion, in that same paragraph, that she would have voted for Goldwater "in every election thereafter," her long evolution as a journalist, from National Review to The New York Review of Books, invites a reader to regard her as the sort of Republican who's said to have "grown" -- in her case, into the approving quotation of Ralph Nader; into the making of references to American "empire"; into a view of our cold war victory so blinkered that its chief consequence appears to have been not the liberation of Eastern Europe but economic downturn in Los Angeles County. All of this renders Joan Didion much more typical of American literary intellectuals than she used to be. And yet, the more penetrating and idiosyncratic moments of "Where I Was From" are the work of someone who can still be very much herself, someone who is even now, arguably, a great American writer.

 AMERICA'S WOMEN
Four Hundred Years of Dolls, Drudges, Helpmates and Heroines.
By Gail Collins.
Illustrated. 556 pp. New York:
William Morrow. $27.95.
 A GENERATION ago, "America's Women" amounted to 10 words (and one letter): Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, Helen Keller, Betsy Ross, Harriet Tubman. On a good day, or perhaps as an admonition, a Salem witch might be thrown in. There was more to be said about the country's soybean crop. If it is a sign of the times that Gail Collins has devoted 556 pages to the subject, it is an even healthier sign of the times that she offers up celebration rather than polemic. Her rousing epic amounts less to a story of how women have shaped America -- finally, it seems, we might rest our case -- than to how America has shaped her women.
Collins's history begins with an image of which she is fond: a woman surveying the vast wilderness of the New World from the deck of a ship. The first to do so happens to be pregnant. On a summer day 33 years before the arrival of the Mayflower, Eleanor Dare would give birth to the first English child born in America. She may or may not have made peace with the American Indians already living on Roanoke Island; she then passes silently, demurely, into oblivion. Collins's history ends in the middle of Fifth Avenue, 383 years later. John Lindsay has denied Betty Friedan's demonstrators permission to parade, requesting that they confine themselves to the sidewalk. On Aug. 26, 1970, Friedan surveys the crowd swelling around her, one that has defied all expectation, and issues a battle cry with which, as it turns out, American woman have had an ambivalent relationship since Eleanor Dare first sighted land: "Take the street!" she commands. 
Collins visits every frontier separating those two summer days: plantation management, magazine publishing, head-to-toe bathing, cattle drives, the department store, drug addiction, temperance, divorce, college education, the voting booth, self-absorption, birth control, short hair, Kotex, the wheel of a car, green bean casserole, bra-burning, pro tennis. It is not always a pretty story. One woman hurls herself from the deck of the Mayflower without ever setting foot on land. Colonial diapering is a subject on which the less said the better; it was a gamy world to begin with. In the far West, the white settlers leveled the same criticism against the Mexicans that the Mexicans leveled against the Indians: the women did all the work. The suffragists could hardly have been more vile to black women, perceived as a political liability. The civil rights and women's movements collided repeatedly, victims of competing agendas. Even in the early 19th century, women apologized for their success. They douched with Lysol, happy to advertise itself as an antidote to "calendar fear." And in their first national showing at the polls, they put Warren Harding -- one of the greater embarrassments among American presidents -- in the White House.
Happily and not, it is also a familiar story. A New England man who beats his wife to a pulp is granted a reprieve. In one Boston case an accusation of witchcraft grew out of a wealthy widow's spat with her carpenter, evidently the 17th-century equivalent of misplacing legal files or acting on a stock tip. (It was remarkable that nearly all the accused hailed from the prosperous side of town.) And it turns out that America has a long history of prenuptial pregnancy. In the midst of the good suffragist fight, Elizabeth Cady Stanton had baby-sitter troubles. You could get a man with a gun, but it took something you can't fake -- a mean blueberry pie, say -- to keep him. Then as now, women's lives have been endangered by morals not their own: the decorous obstetrician who averted his eyes from his patient's nether regions did her untold harm.
It is in grappling with that contortionism that Collins, the editorial page editor of The New York Times, reveals her evenhandedness. The 19th-century obstetrician bungled as much because of women's modesty as because of the constraints of his profession. If there is a villain in this tale she may just wear a skirt; as Collins sees it, we have repeatedly tripped ourselves up. The enemy is not so much the other half of the human race as the mixed messages, our love-hate relationship with hearth and home. (Collins is particularly incisive on the very different struggle of the African-American woman, whose early battle was to not to go out but to stay in.) It seems it is never too late to be dumb and helpless again: remember that earth-shattering 1986 Newsweek story, which made it easier for a 40-year-old single woman to meet a terrorist than a husband? You have to wonder why Tom Ridge hasn't dusted that one off.
What has saved us time and again is the economy. Collins's is a tale of imprudence and dissent and defiance but it is also a tale of forces greater even -- who knew there was one? -- than a woman's will. Ladylike behavior has been regularly defined by exigency; necessity has been the mother of emancipation. The hordes of Southern mosquitoes that produced young l7th-century widows produced very resourceful businesswomen. The Revolution brought with it the short-lived right to vote in New Jersey. Every war in which America has engaged has spelled social and political and economic opportunities for women. The Depression brought an end to federal restrictions against birth control. (In U.S. v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries, the text of which, I am delighted to report, is available online.) Polio gave us Eleanor Roosevelt; World War II got Maya Angelou a job as a San Francisco streetcar conductor. Collins sees the freedom to work for decent wages as the single greatest force behind the change in the status of America's women; how are you going to get them back on the farm once they've learned stenography?
Historical forces do not take center stage here however, generously reserved for the heroines of the tale. Collins encourages her cast to speak for themselves, at least as distinctly as any woman has ever been allowed to. She dusts off the icons and tracks down those who have flown under the radar: the 17th-century surgeons, the cattle owners, the proto-Annie Oakleys, the Revolutionary soldiers. (One husband got a war pension.) This she does without ever losing sight of the bigger picture, and without flogging anyone with a thesis that might minimize her contributions. She is a master of the effortless glide from the individual to the collective experience and back again, with the result that her narrative is as broad as it is deep, pleasing proportions in a book, if not in a soccer mom or a vampire slayer. Only a spoilsport would point up any lacunae, of which here are mine: Who established women's colleges, and why did they do so? Twice a day every day my Massachusetts school bus took me past Susan B. Anthony's birthplace, but where is the female figure who loomed largest over my childhood? Surely Barbie can't be missing from these pages. 
Twiggy puts in an appearance, however, and it's impossible to quibble with someone who is equally gifted at parsing hapless Lucy and defiant Rosa, who imaginatively connects four centuries' worth of dots to produce a marvel of pointillisme. The featis all the more impressive in that the history with which Collins conjures is, in itself, sprawling and contradictory; geography and race further divide the female universes. And no one has ever accused women of being consistent. Here we are, bumping up against glass ceilings, and some of us still prefer the pinch of the glass slipper. The immensely accomplished Louisa Adams sat in her husband's White House and titled her autobiography "Adventures of a Nobody." Women fought for the vote in order to ban alcohol -- in other words to keep their men at home -- when their own struggle was in large part to escape the house. To have worked these tales of New World bravery into a seamless text is in itself a bravura accomplishment. It also happens to make for a story more complex, and more inspiring, than anything Harriet or Susan B. could have imagined. Who knew that women had a sunnier future as switchboard operators because men tended to talk back to customers?

John Singer Sargent and the Fall of Madame X.
By Deborah Davis.
Illustrated. 310 pp. New York:
Jeremy P. Tarcher/Penguin. $24.95.
 THE painting that takes center stage in Deborah Davis's lively first book had been hanging in John Singer Sargent's studio for more than 30 years when he agreed in 1916 to sell it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for $:1,000. The subject had died the previous year. Did Sargent insist that the sitter be identified in future only as "Madame X" to negate Amelie Gautreau's hunger for enduring fame, or to preserve the anonymity of a Parisian beauty whose fragile reputation was destroyed by this sensational, and suggestive, portrait?
Research undertaken in 1981 showed that it was not only the sharp-nosed profile, ash-white skin and coral ears of "Madame X" that had caused a scandal when Sargent first exhibited the painting at the Paris Salon in 1884. Daringly, and with the sitter's consent, he had depicted Gautreau with one jeweled shoulder strap loosened to reveal naked flesh. The implication was that the lady might be available to men other than her dull and wealthy husband. A sketch for the portrait, in Tate Britain in London, shows that Sargent originally planned to do away with the strap altogether; the Met's portrait, hastily revised after the notorious Salon show, has two straps. Both are in place. The subject's black velvet bodice is thrillingly low -- but secure.
"Madame X," described by Sargent in 1916 as his finest work, has provided a rich source for inspiration. A play and a ballet and a novel have all explored the life of the sitter, her affair with a charismatic and sexually voracious gynecologist, Dr. Pozzi (another of Sargent's subjects), and the disastrous impact of the portrait on her social position. Deborah Davis -- inspired, she tells us in "Strapless," by the experience of having been lent a black velvet evening dress similar to the one that clings so provocatively to Gautreau's body -- has researched more deeply into her life and uncovered some intriguing details.
The least important may be that Gautreau preferred her second name -- Amelie -- to Virginie, by which she is best known. The daughter of Creole landowners, she was born in New Orleans and brought to Paris by her mother after her father died in the Civil War. Despite her daughter's development of an unnervingly long and narrow nose, Amelie's mother recognized that she had a salable beauty on her hands and prepared her accordingly, with a view to finding a rich husband. Pierre Gautreau, small, singularly ugly and twice the age of Amelie Avegno, was a prosperous man who owned a handsome chateau in Brittany. He also shared Amelie's wish that she should make her mark in society. In 1878, following their marriage, the couple went to Paris where, in Davis's gushing prose, "Amelie Gautreau set forth to conquer the City of Light."
Padding out a slight story with a mass of detail, of which less might have been welcome on Parisian architecture and the Franco-Prussian War, Davis writes enjoyably about the cult of beauty that contributed an annual $3 billion to the city's economy by the 1880's. A Parisian lady of leisure could easily spend $100,000 a year on her tailor, milliner, dressmaker and hairdresser in a decade when it was not unusual to change costume eight times in a day. Pierre Gautreau, rebelling against the strictures of his penny-pinching mother, indulged his young wife's luxurious tastes: she was given a handsome present of 40,000 francs after the birth of their first and only child, a daughter. But more than fine dresses was needed to capture interest and attention; Amelie's lavender-white skin was suspected by some of her rivals to be the work of an enameler and by others to have been achieved by judicious doses of arsenic, known for its bleaching effect. Davis, having examined the family accounts, notes that large amounts of rice powder provide a more likely source for Madame Gautreau's singular tint. (This detail had already been established by Sargent's biographer, Stanley Olson.) Her habit of rouging the lobes of her ears was noticed but less generally admired.
It was, perhaps, because Amelie was a celebrity rather than a woman of high social position that Sargent, an ambitious and successful young artist, was ready to take liberties in the way he presented her. An indolent and self-centered woman, Gautreau was forced to suffer in the cause of Sargent's art as he obliged her to hold a tortured pose that would best show the lithe curves of her superb figure. The result delighted her; Sargent, a shrewder character, was apprehensive about how the portrait would be viewed by the conventional crowds for whom a day out at the Salon was a social fixture in the Paris calendar.
He was right. The public saw nothing lovely in this pallid, long-nosed woman with her prominent chin and superior smile. They were not impressed by the display of a naked, disturbingly marmoreal shoulder. Amelie, who had come to the show expecting to be honored, left in tears and begged Sargent to have the portrait removed. He refused. She, furious, declined to buy it. Commissioning a new portrait of herself in the feathery style of Thomas Gainsborough for the Salon of the following year, she found herself ignored. When, desperate for attention, she commissioned a third artist to show her with a strap falling from her shoulder, evoking Sargent's notorious portrait, no critic thought the reference was worth a mention. Dismally aware of her fading attractions, Amelie took refuge at St. Malo, where, heavily swathed in veils, she walked along the beach at night. In her house, orders were given for the mirrors to be robed in dust-sheets. She ended her life a recluse.
The portrait of Madame X did not, as Davis suggests, propel Sargent to international celebrity while destroying his subject. Already a well-established portrait painter, he was eager to escape the treadmill. "Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose," an enchanting painting of two small girls with Chinese lanterns in an English garden that Sargent rudely renamed "Damnation, silly, silly pose," brought him fame in England in 1887. This led to a series of lucrative commissions from the United States, taking him on a triumphal progress through some of the grandest houses of New England and the East Coast. But it was only, and typically, the flamboyant Isabella Stewart Gardner, creator of Boston's Gardner museum, who had the courage to demand a portrait of herself in the style that had brought such unwelcome notoriety to vain, unhappy and finally, obscure, Amelie Gautreau.

Here Come The Discountmobiles

BYLINE:  By Ted C. Fishman; Ted C. Fishman is a contributing editor for Harper's.

 BODY:
A year ago, The People's Daily, one of the Chinese government newspapers, ran a short, tantalizing item announcing that 252 Chinese-made economy cars had been shipped to Port Everglades in Florida, the first Chinese cars exported to the United States. A Boca Raton company planned on receiving 25,000 of these cars, known as Xialis, over the next five years. The small cars are the same models that swarm Beijing as bumpy red taxis, getting a miraculous 56 miles to the gallon and costing under $6,000 in China. 
 The news took hold in the recess of my brain reserved for browsing at Costco, where I have become hopelessly addicted to deflation. I have become a kind of retail Manchurian Candidate, reflexively piling my cart with ever-cheaper DVD players, T-shirts and socket-wrench sets. If Chinese manufacturers do to cars what they have done to toys, clothes and electronics, a Chinese economy car might just qualify as an impulse item. 
 Alas, the Xiali never made it to the streets of America. The importer folded. The cars, which even Chinese drivers buy only as a last resort, were re-exported out of Florida to downmarket climes where warranty service comes cheap. But the brief flicker of news about the Xialis shed light on possibilities both promising and dangerous: can China make a good $6,000 car for the U.S. market? What might it look like? And is there any chance I'll ever be able to buy one at Costco? 
Supercheap cars already exist all over the world. Brazilians and Russians make frumpy sub-$10,000 cars by the hundreds of thousands, but they know better than to bring them to the United States, where they would fall perilously short of safety and performance standards. The Korean company Kia Motors currently makes the lowest-priced sedan in the United States, the Rio, which lists with no extras at $9,665. That buys basic transportation: 104 horsepower and the road feel of a kangaroo. One reviewer, struggling to say something nice, wrote that if you "keep engine r.p.m. up . . . the Rio can stay with the flow of traffic on the highway." 
The earliest Chinese export car might not be much better. "A first automotive product here," speculates Kevin Smith, the editor of Motor Trend, "would represent the bottom of the market in features, refinement and quality, but it won't be too far behind its competition." Smith points out that it took the Koreans 10 years to get their cars up to a quality acceptable to American buyers. He says he thinks the Chinese may get there in significantly less time.
As it stands right now, virtually every big international automaker is building vehicles in China. The first Chinese car exported to the United States may well be a model of car already sold here; a Chinese-made Volkswagen Jetta or Honda Civic perhaps. Those, however, would not be the Chinese cars that bust open the low end of the market. That car would probably come into the States under a name few Americans will have heard of. And it will arrive, just as dirt-cheap consumer electronics did, only after China puts in place the hyperefficient industrial infrastructure that will allow it to cut prices to the bone. There is a long way to go on this; most cars still cost more to make in China now than in the West, Japan and Korea because the industry is so diffuse -- factories are relatively small, many parts have to be imported and infrastructure like roads are unreliable. 
But the price slope is getting slippery. Michael J. Dunne, who runs a Beijing-based consulting firm called Automotive Resources Asia, describes China's auto business as the most exciting, fast growing and unpredictable in the world today. The market is voracious. Car sales in China rose an astonishing 82.4 percent in the first six months of this year, to 842,800. By 2010, the country should surpass Germany as the No. 3 auto producer, and some speculate that it will catch the United States by 2020. Though the number of cars sold in China is a fraction of the 17 million sold here last year, the market potential, like everything else in China, is mind-boggling. The Chinese middle class will soon top 100 million, and they will want cars not only as transportation but as an emblem of their place in society. 
How will that land a cheap car in the United States? The only way a Chinese car will be able to compete in the American market, at least initially, is if it's the cheapest possible. And right now Chinese manufacturers are rushing to expand their capacity; as they do this, prices are dropping precipitously. Last year the price of a car in China fell by 20 percent, and this year it will drop between 10 and 20 percent again. 
China has nearly 100 automobile manufacturers (roughly the number of American carmakers early in the last century), and a good many of them are small firms cobbling together cars any way they can. Some make models based on old Soviet cars and European compacts several generations past. Others jerry-build their own using whatever parts can be had -- often dubiously -- in the market. "Many Chinese consumers are so hungry for cars that they don't care what they look like if the price is right," Dunne says. "Right now there is a budding demand on the low side of the market, and upstart Chinese companies are building knockoffs that buyers who just want transportation can settle on." 
Adding to the chaos is that Chinese businesses are rarely stand-alone entities -- so intertwined are many companies, including direct competitors, that it can be hard to tell where one firm begins and another ends. This produces an extremely idiosyncratic industry that baffles and surprises even the most sophisticated foreign companies. VW, for example, found its parts in a domestic rival's cars. G.M. is currently investigating a Chinese manufacturer that released a subcompact car this summer for $6,000 that looks suspiciously like a $9,000 model of their own. China's car industry is like a potluck supper where everyone's technology is sampled by everyone else. So by the time a Chinese car lands here, it may well include features from all the world's top car and parts makers.
These cars could also have technology that established car companies won't. "R and D capability in China is ramping up at a dizzying pace," says Paul Lienert, whose newsletter Global Auto Insider often alerts Detroit to China's growing critical mass and capabilities in the car industry. For example, China has already built its own fuel-cell vehicle. 
"It is unofficial Chinese policy to encourage companies to incubate their own design teams," notes Brad Huang of Lotus Capital, an investment group that is putting together a huge industrial park in Haining, 100 miles from Shanghai, for Japanese and American automotive companies. "The government," Huang says, "hopes that the joint ventures with foreign auto companies can train a team of engineers who can design auto models that are 100 percent Chinese."
Lienert sees the Chinese exporting a car with a lot of Western technology to North America within the next five years, offering "cars that some Americans will find acceptable for six or seven thousand dollars." A fully Chinese car will take longer. Huang estimates that one will hit the world market by 2018.
Auto insiders can only speculate on what the Chinese car might actually look like. Dunne says he believes it will be a plain vanilla knockoff of some other country's economy car. Lienert expects it will have licensed or "borrowed" technology on the inside; come equipped with a decent four-cylinder engine, radio and AC; and have a clean, contemporary design. 
Geoff Wardle, of the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., one of America's top automotive design schools, suggests that the shape of the Chinese car will depend largely on who brings it in and how it is sold. "Young people in the U.S. and Europe are rapidly losing interest in cars as a status symbol," Wardle says. This indifference to the family trucks and Camry clones in Big Auto's showrooms has left American and Japanese carmakers struggling for ways to capture market share among first-time car buyers. It's a generation gap that a cheap Chinese car could drive straight through -- so long as the car can be body-pierced. 
Indeed, Chinese consumers are enamored of adding their own touch of cheap glitz to standardized products. The makers of elegantly simple European and American mobile phones discovered this when China's handset manufacturers attracted customers by offering options like prismatic trim and rhinestones. 
"There is a subculture emerging where kids can order all sorts of bits and bops online," Wardle says, "and a Chinese car could capture a piece of that market by building to it."
A primary market, then, would be young male tinkerers who turn their cars into exotic expressions of their own identities. The so-called aftermarket performance-parts business is growing rapidly, up fivefold in the last five years. Companies like Nopi, one of the nation's largest sellers of aftermarket parts, work directly with manufacturers to develop the molded plastic parts that can turn a plain, cheap car into wheels fit for a superhero. The term of art is "accessorizable." Models at the low end of the market are often the ones that get jazzed up because their relatively plain styles offer the greatest opportunity for reinterpretation by their owners. That's how Honda Civics and other small Asian models have become the vehicles of choice among young buyers. In the United States, young Asian-American men have a strong consumer presence in the custom-parts aftermarket, and the makers of these plastic accessories are almost always Chinese. 
To bring in an entirely new car and keep the price down, a new entrant would have to find an alternative to a dealer network, which both adds costs and takes time to develop. Costco and other big-box retailers are a possibility. Costco already parks S.U.V.'s at store doors and has negotiated no-haggle prices with car dealers around the country. Wal-Mart experimented this year with used-car sales in Texas. The superlow price of a Chinese car is what might open up new sales venues. Currently the most expensive items in most Wal-Marts are high-definition flat-screen TV's, priced near $5,000. 
Jean Jennings, the editor of Automobile Magazine, suggests an even more direct approach: eBay. Low-cost cars fill the same market niche as used cars, so why not go where the used-car buyers, especially younger ones, already browse in droves? Since eBay Motors started three years ago, it has become the biggest conduit for used cars in the world, on track to handle more than $4 billion in car-related sales this year. "They sell more cars before noon than the largest dealers sell all year," Jennings says. 
Asked whether an importer could sell a cheap new car on the site, Simon Rothman, eBay Motors's vice president, enthusiastically pitches the idea back. "The Internet is probably the most natural approach for a new car trying to build brand awareness," he said. "EBay has 75 million users, and it's not unfathomable for anyone who wants a cheap, controllable and speedy distribution network center to move online." Infomercials are another possibility; you can hear the pitch -- buy one car and get another one free.
Ten years ago, few people in China could drive. Today the Chinese have in their sights an auto industry that can rival any in the world. While international automakers rush in to capture China's domestic buyer, China's long view looks outward. "The West greedily eyes China for its market of 1.3 billion people," Wardle observes, "but the Chinese see the rest of the world as 5 billion customers for its products."

HEADLINE: STYLE: THE WAY WE DRIVE NOW; 
The Pickup, A Love Story

BYLINE:  By Manny Howard; Manny Howard is a writer in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
The bed of a full-size pickup truck stretches as much as 8 feet long and 5 1/2 feet wide. It can carry 2,500 pounds, give or take, as well as tow something a good deal heavier, like a boat. But that's not why Shannen Doherty drives one.
 As useful as the bed of a pickup is, for most drivers these days the receptacle over their right shoulders remains untapped potential, a Void filled only by duffel bags and the occasional bag of manure. What's more, the cab of the Platonic pickup -- its single bench seat, more precisely -- is entirely impractical if you wish to travel with company beyond your dog or your best girl. But that's the point: alone, but not lonely, the wellspring of a pickup's iconic appeal in America. The man (and increasingly, the woman) behind the wheel of a pickup is the automotive equivalent of the lone rider loping off into the horizon. It was, after all, for the pickup that the gun rack was invented. 
 There was a time when pickup-truck enthusiasts described their vehicles by the load they could bear: half ton, three-quarter ton and so on. Or, by extension, the size (in cubic inches) and type (number of cylinders and whether they sit straight or on a slant) of motor that powered it. The six-cylinder engine that powered Ford's 1952 F-series was rated at 101 horsepower. At the time, the engine was considered a marvel.
The list of options included a larger back window. That was it. By comparison, for its 2004 F-150, there are so many options available -- including a rear-seat DVD, black platform cab steps and "Arizona beige" wheel lip moldings -- that more than a million different configurations are possible. This is one of the reasons that Ford now sells more pickup trucks than any other vehicle in its inventory -- or anybody's inventory, for that matter. In 2002, Ford sold 813,701 F-series trucks, nearly twice as many as America's most popular passenger car, the Toyota Camry.
If you sit behind the wheel of a 2004 pickup, it's pretty hard to find the way back to that truck of yesteryear -- with the plywood floors, the two-piece windshield and the hand-crank windows -- the one that America first fell in love with. Dealer lots all over the country twinkle with full-size pickups that taunt us with awesome power that we will, very likely, never need and assuage us with deep pile carpet, countless cup holders, GPS guidance systems and power sunroofs. Truth be told, we would all find a long ride in the ancestral pickup less than enjoyable. But that doesn't mean the roots of the pickup aren't important. In fact, the history is essential to understanding how the pickup has come to represent a perfect marriage of our desire for frontier-style freedom and suburban-style comfort.
Shortly after introducing the Model T in 1908, Henry Ford noticed that farmers were ripping out the trunks of their vehicles and rigging flatbeds to the back to haul hay. So the company started doing this in the factory and saving farmers the trouble. Competitors quickly copied the idea. The origin of the term "pickup" is mysterious, but it was in general use by the middle of the 1920's. Off the farm, these were adopted as service vehicles at gas stations and as industrial-fleet vehicles for the military, mining concerns, delivery companies and the like.
In 1955, Chevrolet developed the first light truck designed to appeal to people with something on their minds other than work. In addition to a 265-cubic-inch V-8 (previously reserved for passenger cars), the Cameo Carrier had a four-speed Hydro-Matic transmission, stylized hubcaps and a dash-controlled passenger heater for the cab. Because the Cameo's body was so intricately sculptured, it was partly fashioned (like the Corvette) from fiberglass. It was pretty, but it wasn't nearly as tough as other trucks. While the going rate for a pickup was about $1,600, the fully loaded Cameo sold for $3,000 -- a harbinger of the pickup's future 50 years later. The Cameo is a sought-after model by collectors and a regular part of automotive-museum collections.
Most pickups, though, retained their rough edges. In the early 60's, the first extended cabs, which had back seats for additional passengers, became available as an option. Ford was the first to offer them widely. Driven almost exclusively by construction crews and power-line workers, these were not refined vehicles. The beds had very primitive suspension systems, making the ride rough and the road noise nearly unbearable. This was how pickups were made; comfort was barely a consideration. "Not so long ago, people would've found it absurd even to have carpeting in the cabs of pickups," says Daniel Hershberger, an automotive historian. "These were strictly utility vehicles."
Of the classic work trucks, Max Berryhill, curator of the Tupelo Automobile Museum, remembers Chevrolet's 1967 C-10 most fondly. "The Air Force had hundreds of the things," says Berryhill, an Air Force vet. "The C-10 had a six-cylinder, which was plenty of engine. Let me just say, those C-10's were lethal in the hands of a military man. Those trucks were real fun to drive."
Slowly, however, a new understanding sank in among American car makers. "Somebody, somewhere, got smart and started making pickups so Mama would drive it," Berryhill says. "As soon as folks weren't afraid to go to church in a truck, that's when they really started selling them. And money was no object."
The transformation from workhorse to church shuttle was, in marketing time, glacial. "Ford had been describing their pickups as appropriate for sport or personal use in the late 70's, but the message didn't really catch until the late 80's," Hershberger says. While there was a boomlet in the truck market in the late 60's around the truck camping craze, the oil crisis in 1973 put a crimp in that and very nearly killed the market for full-size pickups too.
Then, in the early 1980's, Datsun and other foreign manufacturers came along with scrawny, fuel-efficient pickups whose selling point was that if you bought one, you could start your own business. It was a message tailored to the time, directed at people who found themselves out of work. This was not yet the moment to tap into the middle-class fetish of the workingman, but that time was coming.
The west's lone horseman, the yeoman farmer alone in his field, young airmen tearing up empty desert runways -- these are the cultural forebears and the inspirations for what is one of the most effective and long-lived corporate anthems in marketing history: Bob Seger's "Like a Rock," which was licensed by Chevy Trucks in 1991. "We launched 'Like a Rock' when the truckers, guys who used them for work, were still the primary market for pickup trucks," says Bill Ludwig, chief creative officer at Campbell-Ewald, which handles advertising for Chevrolet.
That changed almost immediately. Suburban car shoppers started trading in minivans and station wagons for full-size pickups. Observing this shift, Chevrolet commissioned what Ludwig describes as the first comprehensive anthropological study of car buyers to determine what accounted for the change -- and to see if "Like a Rock" had anything to do with it. "The economic conditions were much the same as they are now: huge economic downturn, people losing white-collar jobs to downsizing, all manner of economic instability," Ludwig says.
What the study indicated, Ludwig says, was that white-collar consumers, feeling anxious about the economy, were drawing inspiration from blue-collar workers (desribed in Campbell-Ewald's study as "Skilled Labor"). Lawyers and doctors and other professionals realized, according to Ludwig, that members of the working class "have always dealt with this instability. They just pick themselves up, dust themselves off and keep on going."
The white-collar consumers tried to emulate the stoic self-reliance of "Skilled Labor" by purchasing the stuff that they identified with the other half's lives -- not only signifying vehicles like pickups but other items too, like work boots and hunting jackets. 
It was just good timing, Ludwig says, that these workingman virtues were the ones expressed in the lyrics of "Like a Rock." Better still, Seger's lyrics could be parceled out to sell particular trucks to specific audiences. Television commercials for the modest S-10, a starter truck, were scored to reach strivers with a self-described inner dignity. Ludwig recited, like the poetry that it is, Seger's second verse to make his point: "I was 18/Didn't have a care/Working for peanuts/Not a dime to spare/But I was lean and solid everywhere/Like a rock."
As the 90's went on, American consumers found themselves with plenty of dimes to spare, though they still retained some dim sense of identification with "Skilled Labor." American car makers refashioned the pickup accordingly. Dodge introduced a sleek design in 1993 and soon manufactured a four-door model, the so-called "extended cab." Meanwhile, the interiors were consistently ramped up to the point where they are now almost indistinguishable from those of luxury sedans. These trucks have been the saving grace of the American car industry; like S.U.V.'s, pickups provide a spectacular profit margin, and they are consistently strong sellers. Ford's F-series is now the nation's highest-selling fleet, contributing $2.4 billion to the company's otherwise sagging bottom line in 2002.
As the pickup became domesticated and popularized, however, it suffered an identity crisis. The bed -- once the vehicle's reason for being -- created a predicament. What ought to go in the Void? How many suburban couples ever have the occasion to haul hay or dirt? Nobody needs that much space for groceries, no matter how many football players are being raised. A tag line of GMC's current advertising campaign for its line of trucks -- "Not more than you need, just more than you're used to" -- is a tacit acknowledgment of a certain self-consciousness that affects some consumers when they realize they are sitting astride more tool than is necessary.
Ford's earliest efforts at addressing the concerns of its broadening market were cheery enough. A television commercial flashed on a coifed woman pulling away from a tidy Connecticut Yankee antique shop with a stately (and expensive) dresser tied into the back of her F-150. But this created something of a credibility gap with Ford's traditional customers, and the commercial had a brief run. 
Partly as a response to the question posed by the Void and partly as an experiment to see if they could squeeze still more money from consumers by combining three highly profitable products, American car makers have come out with what they call a "crossover vehicle," a hybrid pickup/S.U.V./luxury sedan. The most famous of these is Cadillac's Escalade EXT; another well-known model is Chevrolet's Avalanche. In each, the bed is covered with hinged fiberglass or plastic, the walk-in closet of car trunks. 
Because making the Void disappear might alienate some pickup buyers, there are other solutions. For a mere $50,000 or so, Galpin Motors in North Hills, Calif., customizes an F-150 for use as a luxury tailgate apparatus, complete with televisions, a gas grill, a blender and two beer taps. At first blush, bumper-to-bumper barbecues might not seem to be where Americans expressing their inner Shane would imagine themselves, but there is myth and then there is reality, and on any given Sunday, tens of thousands of Americans are huddled in the shadows of football stadiums, grilling and swilling to their hearts' content.
For most pickup drivers, though, the Void lives on, and it confers meaning. In a new television spot for the GMC Sierra, a guy is stopped by traffic in front of a construction site. As he waits in his brand-new truck, an earth-moving machine dumps a ton or so of soil into his empty bed. The truck's owner is not upset. He glances back, almost contentedly, understanding it as an honest mistake. General Motors wants us to understand that he doesn't mind being mistaken for a member of the construction crew, a genuine working person. In fact, it's one of the residual benefits of driving a real machine. The pickup has always referenced a simpler kind of existence -- one without kids and mortgages, one in which playing with dirt is permitted, even if the dirt is not your own.

HEADLINE: Confessions Of A Spam King 

BYLINE:  By Jack Hitt; Jack Hitt is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
I. MEET THE SPAMMER
"Click here," says my spamming mentor. Hovering over my chair, he points to the computer screen. "Now click on that file of e-mail addresses there." I have been invited by a master for an education in spamming, the practice of blasting millions of unsolicited e-mail messages into the Internet in order to advertise everything from loans with easy terms to women of easy virtue. 
 "Let's go online and download some software," says my guide. His name is Richard Colbert. On the Rokso, or Register of Known Spam Operations (a kind of Most Wanted List for the Internet posted on an antispam Web site called spamhaus.org), Colbert is described plainly: "Nonstop scam spammer, kicked off so many hosts and I.S.P.s" -- or Internet service providers -- "it's hard to count." 
 Dressed in blue shorts and a purple T-shirt, Colbert, 31, has blondish hair stuffed under a baseball cap, a prominent diamond earring and a mild twang that betrays his Atlanta origin. He lights up a Monarch menthol as he shows me his computer room, an intimate homemade space built off the side of an aging two-tone mobile home -- robin's-egg blue and white -- which sits among hundreds of Airstreams and Miami Deco single-wides in the Sunset Colony Mobile Home Park in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
Colbert claims that he's now on a sabbatical from spamming, but he's watching current events and weighing a return. During this interlude, he has agreed to help me learn how the avalanche of solicitations I receive winds up in my online mailbox every day. Who are these guys? Who hires them? How do they get legitimate e-mail addresses? And finally, can federal legislation currently under consideration actually stop them?
First off, Colbert doesn't think about spam the way I do (or, most probably, the way you do). He likes to call it "bulk e-mailing," for starters. And he considers it just one of the many exciting new markets available on the Internet. He's the kind of guy who is always interrupting himself to tell you about some smart economic angle he has figured out, some new edge.
"These shorts are Dockers," he says, pointing at the clothes he has on. "And I got them off eBay. Shirt? Tommy Hilfiger. EBay. Shoes? Nikes. EBay." 
Colbert and I dig around on the Internet until, under his direction, I find a piece of software that allows for mass e-mailing. These are common and legal, used legitimately by professional archaeologists, say, or chess enthusiasts to form an online group and conduct chats or exchange information.
Right away there's a problem. The software we've selected requires registration or payment. But Colbert says he once used this very piece of software, slightly altered, when he worked with some other spammers who live nearby. So he snatches his phone and calls a neighbor for support. A minute later, we are back in business. It turns out that an unusually large number of spammers live in this area, the stretch of beaches north of Miami that old-timers loosely call Boca and new-timers know as a staging ground for the smarmier characters in Carl Hiaasen's novels.
According to Steve Linford, who maintains the Rokso list, there's a good reason that so many spammers wind up on Spam Beach: "Boca Raton is where they used to run those pump-and-dump investment scams and where the telemarketing sweatshops are." The phone scammers and infomercial wannabes of the 80's and 90's -- who themselves supplanted the land speculators who established Florida's earliest cities upon shifting sand and sinking swamps -- have been pushed aside by the new boys on the block, the bulk e-mailers of the Internet. 

2. A SPAMMING PRIMER
How does a spammer obtain a million working e-mail addresses? Most simply, there are lists you can buy off the Internet. But there are also other, cheaper, ways. A "dictionary attack," Colbert instructs, is when you blast reams of computer-generated potential e-mail names (Arnie1@hotmail.com, Arnie2@hotmail.com, Arnie3@hotmail.com . . .) and see which ones take. Another good tool is called a spider, a software program that can crawl through Web pages, looking for that telltale symbol: @. Then it simply records everything to the left and right of it, and bingo, it has a good e-mail address. (A good method for avoiding spam, then, is to always type your e-mail address on the Web this way: Arnie at hotmail.com or ArnieREMOVETHIS@hotmail.com. Humans can look at either and figure out what to do; software -- so far -- is helpless.)
Sitting at Richard's computer, I set out to launch my first spam. I append a file of e-mail addresses to the software along with my cover letter -- my spam. To keep everything vaguely legal, my spam is nothing more than a cheerful holiday greeting, at the end of which is a link to bowieltd.com, one of Colbert's Web sites. 
The software starts firing, and my notes ricochet through cyberspace. The software monitors which e-mails are returned and tabulates their status. When an "out of the office" auto-reply comes back on one e-mail message, Colbert says: "Oh, we love those. They confirm that the address is active." Within six minutes, on a single computer, running through a regular phone line, I have fired off 1,000 e-mail messages. 
Which is one of the attractive things about spam for spammers. You don't have to leave your mobile home to do it. There's no door-to-door soliciting for clients, no annual conferences to attend. The business is all neatly contained on your desktop. For instance, how does a spammer find clients willing to hire him? 
He spams.
Colbert used to find clients by trolling through AOL's member directory. Many of AOL's 35 million members fill out helpful "online profiles" when they join, listing their interests and activities. Colbert used those profiles to turn AOL into a rich and easy source of contacts. He would limit his search by typing in "business opportunity" or "multilevel marketing" in order to find the sort of small-time sales folks who might be receptive to his offer, then he would spam them all with his pitch. 
"I might get 100 responses from 100,000 e-mails," Colbert says. He would write back personally to those, asking for the text of the ad they wanted to spam out and relaying his pricing structure: $300 to send out 100,000 messages or $900 for a million. From the 100 people who would agree to hear his personal pitch, he would usually land between two and five contracts. Although this might seem like a pitiful response rate -- one-five-hundredth of one percent is ruinous in any other market -- this one search for spam clients could yield Colbert as much as $14,000. 
Colbert describes how he would set his computers for "send" with millions of e-mail messages queued up, then go to sleep and let the machinery make the money for him. "I used to have nine computers bound over five DSL lines on a 10 meg pipe feeding 500K per second per computer," Colbert says. "That's a million e-mails an hour per computer, nine million an hour on a good day." 
His clients were usually small-scale entrepreneurs or Web-site hosts who worked the margins of the online economy: herbal supplements and cut-rate financial services. Sometimes he would be hired to spam for larger, more reputable, companies -- not that he would name any for me. But he did admit that he would try to use the "cleanest" lists possible in those cases, to keep down the tsunami of complaints that a company typically receives with each spam blast.
Payment to Colbert was strictly old-school. "I didn't ever take credit cards," he says. He would insist on being paid by money order or check. He explains the risk of credit card payment: "If the clients didn't get the response they wanted, they'd frequently charge back the fee." 
The majority of spammers are paid a flat fee, Colbert says, and those fees have been dropping. Only five years ago, the top tier of spammers was building "online marketing" companies and selling them for astonishing sums, in the millions of dollars. In those heady days, spam enjoyed the same inflated finances as tech stocks. But even after the bubble burst, spam was handsomely profitable. "I cleared $130,000 in 10 months," Colbert says, "the best money I've ever made." As more players enter the market, though, the profits are thinning. "These days I've seen spam offered as low as $25 for a million addresses," Colbert grouses. "There's still money in it, but it's a lot more work for a lot less."

3. THE NEW NEW SPAM
Ever since the Federal Trade Commission earlier this year held a spam conference -- which brought together spam recipients, Congress, antispammers and the spammers themselves -- a metaphysical question has emerged: Is there such a thing as good spam versus bad? 
Colbert thinks so, and his reasoning has led him to a solution that he predicts will make everyone happy. He recently wrote a letter to both of his senators outlining his thoughts. He said that the only way to stop the "bad" spamming -- the scams, the deceptive links, the anonymous porn mailings -- is to sanction a legitimate form of commercial spam with established standards. These might include accurate and functional "from" lines, so that when you click "reply" to a piece of commercial e-mail you would actually be able to contact the person who sent it. ("From" lines on most spam e-mail messages are frauds, routed through various computers in order to give the spammer a cloak of invisibility.) Also, each legitimate spam would have a real, working "remove" link, so that it would be easy for the recipient to take himself off spammers' lists. Then, according to Colbert's plan, legitimate spammers could drum up business, and spam cops would spend their time tracking the real outlaws. 
Another spammer I spoke with, Bill Waggoner, who operates out of Spam Beach West (aka Las Vegas), drew the same distinction. "Spam is scam," said the part-time heavy-metal musician and shortwave talk-radio host who was, according to Rokso, "one of the Top 10 spammers in the world." He claims that all his bulk e-mail is "clean," meaning that each one has a good "return" address, contains a working "remove" link and sells legitimate goods and services. I couldn't resist pointing out to Waggoner that he has publicly admitted that he pushes an herbal penis-enlargement pill.
"That's not fraud," he said. "If it was fraud, the company wouldn't make any money." When I tried to pursue this suddenly slippery definition of fraud, he quickly added, defensively, "The only sex product I sell is the penis-enlargement pill."
This debate about good and evil isn't going on just among spammers; it is also currently under way in Congress. Some kind of spam law will probably emerge from Washington in the next year. And it will be the first test of populist digital legislation in Congress since the creation of the Internet.
In the weeks leading up to the August recess, the spam fight in the House got pretty intense. There are two main competing bills, which basically track the two strands of this emerging philosophical argument. The leading one, written by Representative Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and sponsored by two influential Republican representatives, F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin and Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, more or less codifies Colbert and Waggoner's view.
As first written, the Burr bill was meant to outlaw only fraudulent spam, in order to protect commerce on the Internet. "From our point of view, we are trying to retain e-mail as a legitimate form of commercial activity," one Burr staff member said. "If you want to sell a product, you should be able to do that with e-mail."
But the public debate on spam is changing fast. Within a few weeks, the momentum moved away from the power brokers like Sensenbrenner and Tauzin and toward less known representatives whose proposals are tougher -- mainly Heather A. Wilson, a Republican from New Mexico, and Gene Green, a Democrat from Texas.
"The Burr bill approaches the problem from the point of view of commerce," Wilson observed delicately. "We approach it from a consumer perspective." 
A core debate regarding spam turns on how you are allowed to say no to spam -- a debate that boils down to the phrases "opt in" and "opt out." "Opt in" is the toughest; it requires that all bulk e-mailers get your permission before sending any spam. "Opt out" allows spammers to flood your mailbox all they want, as long as each individual e-mail message contains a link permitting you to stop all future spams from that one business. This summer, the "opt out" provision was the one favored by most members of Congress because it gave marketers and business the greatest leeway. But as the representatives sped toward their summer recess and the levels of spam in their constituents' in-boxes spiked to record-high levels, it suddenly seemed like "opt out" was no longer acceptable. 
"We are at a tipping point," Wilson confessed. "We may have to get more radical in our solution." 
But according to Colbert, the tipping point for spam will always be just around the corner because spammers are so good at figuring out the potential use (or abuse) of each new technological innovation. Colbert seems to enjoy recounting the many ways he made the tiniest changes in the system work for him.
"I was thrown off more BellSouth accounts than half the state of Florida," Colbert says. His name was known, and he was a marked and wanted man. But he found a way around the heat. "Do you remember when American Express came out with temporary credit cards?" he recalls happily. "You could go to the 7-11 convenience store and buy a $25 credit card -- sort of like you buy a $25 phone card, only it was good for just $25 worth of credit." 
Armed with a dozen of these cards, Colbert would go to the BellSouth Web site and create numerous e-mail accounts from which to send spam, each account with a fictitious name and address. Since the credit card couldn't be connected to him in any way, he could spam away until BellSouth finally got around to canceling that particular account. "They were great, totally untraceable," he says of the credit cards. "They don't sell them anymore. I think it's because of me."
More recently, spammers have figured out how to send unwanted text messages to cellphones. And new wireless, or "wi-fi," technology, Colbert tells me, is providing spammers with another potential cloak of invisibility. 

4. IS THERE AN ANSWER?
So what does a spammer like Richard Colbert fear? Going to jail or going broke? There's a difference, and in that difference is the key to the debate about stopping spam. Despite our ferociously partisan times, the Republicans and Democrats agree on this one thing: prosecuting spam should be the domain of a big Homeland Security-style federal bureaucracy. The only question is, Should it be the Federal Trade Commission or some other agency?
Most of the antispammers prefer a solution known as "private right of action," which would permit consumers to hunt down spammers and sue them for small damages, say $500, in a state district court -- just enough, goes the theory, to ruin the slim profit margin on spamming. Also known as distributive justice, it's the same idea that worked to stop junk faxes a decade ago: "death by a thousand paper cuts," as Ted Gavin, treasurer of SpamCon, an antispam group, likes to call it.
The debate is an old one. Which deters better? A widespread campaign of harassing a lot of midlevel operatives or highly visible arrests of a few kingpins? Washington politicians tend to prefer the latter, because they bring immediate television coverage. In recent testimony before Congress, Orson Swindle, an F.T.C. commissioner, stated this position plainly: "We need a couple of good hangings here."
Despite the threat of the noose, spammers yawn at the law-enforcement approach, according to Colbert, for the simple reason that the police are slow and a digital trail goes cold very fast. Most I.S.P.'s record the digital trail of each e-mail message that passes through its system, but these "mail server logs 2/3" as they are called, are routinely overwritten and erased. "You have about 12 hours to track a person on the Internet before the trail goes dead," Colbert says. "Law enforcement is too slow." 
The antispammers, on the other hand, pose a different threat. "A little known secret about antispammers is that many of them are fairly renowned hackers," Colbert says. "They track spammers in ways that the F.T.C. can't." 
But the distributive-justice approach is all but dead in Congress, at least in part because of the Republicans' deep antipathy for trial lawyers. "It's not on the table," said a Democratic staff member on the Commerce Committee. 
Wilson told me that private right of action was not such a bad idea and was interesting to talk about in an intellectual way. "But I also want to get a bill passed in the House," she confessed.
Back in Colbert's mobile home, I ask my spammer guru if he is feeling nervous, now that Congress is in the market for a few high-profile public hangings. Doesn't he fear that Orson Swindle might soon have him in an orange jumpsuit and shackles, doing a prime-time perp walk? "Congress is full of idiots," he notes succinctly. Colbert says he doesn't believe that a strategy of going after a few kingpins will accomplish anything. Politicians will gain some publicity, but in the process, he argues, they will drive smaller operators further underground. "Spammers will just use even more deceptive practices to keep from getting shut down," he says.
So is he getting back in business? Colbert remains cagey with a direct answer, but then sidles over to a file cabinet. He pulls out a CD and twirls it among his fingertips. "This CD has 200 million e-mail addresses on it," he tells me, sounding like a man eager to once again hit "send." I ask him about his old system -- the nine hard drives bound together with a superfast connection speed that could pump out millions of e-mail messages in an hour -- and whether the coming laws make him too nervous to spend money rebuilding his infrastructure. 
Colbert seems amused by my assumptions regarding his expenses. As the late afternoon sky turns Boca gold, he fires up another menthol and takes a big, noirish puff. He points under his desk to a recent arrival, a second hard drive, precisely what he would need to begin a new network.
"It's a Dell Pentium 233," he says. "I got it for $15, plus $23.95 shipping." A cloud of smoke fills the side room of the single-wide.
"EBay," he says with a smile.

HEADLINE: Q & A; 
A Rising Mortgage Interest Rate

 BODY:
 Q -- My mortgage broker advised me that he had a rate commitment at 6 percent from the bank that was providing my mortgage. Three weeks later, when I received the papers to sign, the rate was 6.625 percent. When I protested, he countered that the bank had raised the rate and that he could do nothing. I have the e-mail from the broker confirming the 6 percent rate, but I do not have anything from the bank. What legal recourse do I have? . . . Susan R. Harris, Scarborough, N.Y.

A -- Richard Nardi, a Manhattan lawyer and counsel to the Mortgage Bankers Association of New York, said that when a lender issues a mortgage commitment, it usually has an interest rate and an expiration date. "The duration of the commitment is usually 60 to 90 days," he said. "But how long they'll hold the rate varies."
 Mr. Nardi said that the original bank commitment should have contained both an expiration date for the commitment and an expiration date for the rate. While it is possible that both could be the same, they could also be different.
When a lender issues a commitment, he said, the borrower usually must sign the commitment and return it to the lender. Some lenders offer the borrower the ability to lock in the rate for a certain period. In most cases, he said, the borrower must pay a fee up front to lock in an interest rate. So, he said, the writer should ask whether there was a written commitment for the 6 percent rate. If not, it is possible that the lender merely provided the broker with verbal approval of the 6 percent loan. It would not be unusual these days for the interest rate to rise to 6.625 percent over three weeks.
But if the e-mail the writer received from the broker states unequivocally that the interest rate is 6 percent, the writer could file a complaint with the New York State Banking Department at (800) 522-3330.

Converting a Co-op To a Condo

Q -- I have a second residence on Long Island in a small, six-unit co-op. We have a relatively small underlying mortgage. As co-op president, I am interested in raising the value of the units. What would we have to do to convert to a condominium, and how difficult or expensive would this be? . . . Anthony LoGrande, Manhattan.

A -- Dennis H. Greenstein, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that it is both difficult and relatively expensive to convert from a co-op to a condominium. To make the change, he said, it will probably be necessary to get the consent of all the shareholders.
It would then be necessary to hire an architect to divide the building into separate tax lots, and a lawyer to draft the paperwork to convert to a condo and ask the state attorney general's office for an exemption from filing an offering statement. 
It would also be necessary for the co-op to pay off the underlying mortgage, if that is possible and economically feasible under the terms of the loan; and for each shareholder to pay off any share loan and get new financing for the condo.
"That might be a problem for some shareholders," Mr. Greenstein said, explaining that their economic circumstances may mean they will not qualify for a new mortgage.
Mr. Greenstein said each shareholder should consult a tax adviser to ensure that the conversion does not result in adverse tax consequences.
Converting "is a time-consuming process and the costs can be significant," he said. But he said it is fairly easy and inexpensive for a co-op to remain a co-op and act like a condo. "We have amended co-op proprietary leases to make the sale and sublet provisions identical to those of a condo," he said. "Some buildings believe their apartments are more valuable because of the change."

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 9-28-03: CRASH COURSE; 
The Tracking System

BYLINE:  By Dirk Olin; Dirk Olin is national editor at The American Lawyer.

 BODY:
If Superintendent Peter Horoschak had his way, most of the sixth graders who entered the middle school in Maplewood, N.J., this month would truly be on the same page. Last spring, Horoschak led an effort to reduce the practice of stratifying new middle-schoolers based on previous academic performance. Such "tracking" would have been limited to math classes, where students would still be sorted by elementary-school grades and test scores. For all other core subjects, students -- save extreme underachievers, who would get special help -- would have been randomly assigned to classes and given common curriculums and instruction. Wider-scale tracking (or "leveling") would begin only in seventh grade. But an outcry from parents who wanted their children in the high level delayed the "detracking" process, at least for one more year. 
 This debate has raged in school districts across the country. And now a study published last month by the Public Policy Institute of California could well add fuel to the fires on both sides of the issue. The study concludes that students' performances are demonstrably affected by those of their peers. "One of the more consistent findings," as Julian Betts, a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, and a co-author of the study, put it, is that "an individual student's rate of learning appears to be strongly, and positively, influenced by the initial achievement of students in his or her grade, and with somewhat less consistency than that of students in his or her classroom." So anti-trackers will argue that mixing up the students will allow the high achievers to pull up those below; pro-trackers will endorse separate levels so the lower tracks don't pull down those above. 

A HISTORY LESSON
With the disappearance of the iconic one-room schoolhouse, the United States saw a rapid rise in the calibration of educational performance during the 20th century. Assessments led administrators to group students based on achievement (or I.Q. tests) and then to tailor course work accordingly. Though such practices were often blatantly racist and classist, they also enjoyed intellectually honest support among progressives (including leaders of the National Education Association) who said that students learn best when surrounded by peers of like ability. But the academic orthodoxy shifted in the wake of the 60's. Tracking has increasingly been vilified for perniciously widening social inequity while providing no demonstrable improvement in classroom performance on any tracks. As Jeannie Oakes, director of the Institute for Democracy, Education and Access at U.C.L.A. and the author of "Keeping Track: How Schools Structure Inequality," has led the attack: "What tracking really does is stigmatize lower-achieving kids, and the consequences are pretty hellish, academically and psychologically and socioeconomically. It doesn't just stigmatize them, it treats them as if they can't learn."
But in recent years a number of education theorists have come to the defense of tracking and the many parents who resisted the reformation (perhaps believing their own children would excel in the higher tracks). According to Tom Loveless, a former professor of public policy at Harvard who directs the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution, studies show tracking can help the highly placed while remaining largely neutral in its effects on those in lower strata. Although he empathizes with the spirit behind the critique of tracking, Loveless points out that many foreign systems are far more regimented and that most attacks on the more tempered American approaches are wrongheaded: "This comes from people deeply committed to equity. But they want to get it on the cheap. The right way is to teach everybody. But that's hard to do. So they just pretend people are equal."

INSIDE TRACKS
The dynamics of how children learn in tracked and untracked environments are murky and much debated. Meta-analyses (that is, studies of the studies) have found some evidence of overall achievement gains through grouping. But it's not as simple as that, according to James A. Kulik, a research scientist at the University of Michigan. Sometimes, tracking works best within a single classroom, sometimes across distinct, sorted classes. But most important, he says, is whether the instruction is properly tailored. "Changing a child's associates will not by itself change the amount that a child will learn," he says. "Grouping strategies are only effective when accompanied by appropriate curricular changes." As for Oakes's widely shared concern that such grouping hurts the self-esteem of those in the low tracks, often called "the labeling hypothesis," Kulik says he has found the so-called social-comparison theory more tenable, with low-aptitude group members often benefiting from the "big-fish-little-pond effect."

A LEVELING DEBATE
Advocates of detracking can't pretend it won't harm high achievers; trackers must acknowledge the inequities inherent in their regimes. In short, the issue requires, in Betts's words, "an intensely political decision as to the size of losses for the high achievers that a community would be willing to support in exchange for gains among the lower achievers." But Betts holds out hope for a third way. "Suppose that schools separate students by ability," he says, "but then they use this grouping to address interventions toward the students who are lagging behind in the grade. Targeted interventions like this might not only help the students who lag behind, but could spill over, benefiting all students in the grade. If we can bring up the bottom end, teachers can raise standards for all students, benefiting all."
In 1848, Horace Mann called public schools in America "the great equalizer." Cleaving to that vision, however, brings up the question, At what point do we allow for -- much less encourage -- the pursuit of excellence? It is beyond dispute that tracking must avoid deterministic straitjacketing by allowing for "retracking" if kids catch up. But the tracking abolitionists might reflect on the enforced egalitarianism of the romanticized one-room schoolhouse. Age-based grade levels, after all, are themselves a form of tracking. 

ANOTHER URBAN PLIGHT
From 'The Tracking Wars: State Reform Meets School Policy,' by Tom Loveless (Brookings Institution Press, 1999)

"Detracking is a gamble. This study is the first to discover that the risks of the gamble are being assumed disproportionately by urban schools, low-socioeconomic-status schools and schools with low achievement. This should cause great concern. Some of society's most disadvantaged children are now part of an educational experiment, with the outcome completely unknown. . . . High-achieving minority students in low-income urban schools are most at risk of suffering from the abolition of tracking. . . . Educators should also assess the political costs of detracking. . . . Researchers have described schools where parents threaten to transfer their children if tracking is abolished."

HEADLINE: ART; 
Working Girls, Without Exoticism

BYLINE:  By PHILIP GEFTER

 BODY:
PROSTITUTION may be the world's oldest profession, but you'd never know it from Reagan Louie's pictures of "working girls" in Asia. Young, stylish and playful, their freshness is an unexpected departure from the haggard patina of the all-night sex worker. An exhibition of these photographs, "Reagan Louie: Sex Work in Asia," has recently opened at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. 
 A fifth-generation Chinese American, Mr. Louie began this project six years ago in Guangdong Province in southern China, his ancestral home and the focus of his previous documentary photographs. The global economy has brought to that region a growing number of international corporations and, with them, a thriving nightlife. For the young girls drawn there from rural villages, sex work is one of the few employment options available. 
 Mr. Louie began photographing these young prostitutes in the party atmosphere of a nightclub called the Golden Sand. On each of his subsequent visits to Asia, he ventured to a different country, photographing in red-light-district bars in Seoul, flashy sex emporiums in Bangkok and Image Clubs in Tokyo. Some of his subjects had no qualms about displaying their wares before the camera; in fact, many pictures in the show are far more explicit that those shown here.
How does the typical museum-goer distinguish Mr. Louie's pictures of unabashedly naked young women from the general run of pornographic imagery? Intention, for one thing. Mr. Louie writes in the accompanying catalog that, by returning to his ancestral home, he was aiming to reconcile both his Chinese and American identities. And, photographing in China, he noticed a different dynamic in his relationships to Asian women and American women. It was his intention to dispel the Western stereotypes and myths he had carried around about "exotic" Asian women.
MR. LOUIE did not take these photographs to titillate viewers. "The photographs of these sex workers were collaborations," he explains. "I was very aware of the nature of the relationship I had with the women, the power I had as a man and as an outsider, and the power of photography. I wanted to make clear to these women that I was photographing them for reasons other than sexual gratification. How much they understood or believed this would be evident in how willing they were to step out of expectations and present themselves as people."
That the photographs remain undeniably titillating need not be taken as proof that he failed; they tell us as much about the photographer's attractions as they do about his subject. "They are very beautiful pictures," says Sandra S. Phillips, senior curator of photography at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, "physically so, very allusive and colorful, layered, resonant, not easy, and certainly thoughtful and humane."
As part of the exhibition, an additional 50 images from the museum's collection are being shown, including work by E. J. Bellocq, who photographed prostitutes in New Orleans at the turn of the last century, and Brassai, who photographed "working women" in Paris at night in the 1920's and 30's. The additional pictures provide a context for understanding the documentary tradition to which Mr. Louie's work belongs. The exhibition is up through Dec. 7. A smaller show from the same body of Mr. Louie's work is at the Von Lintel Gallery in Manhattan through Saturday.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
Japan Makes New Pitch To Lure Americans

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
CONJURING up a return to the 1960's, when Japan was a popular and affordable tourism destination, Japan wants to double its foreign visitors to 10 million a year by 2010. With the hubris and sky-high prices of the 1980's a fading memory, tourism officials are trying to sell Japan as a destination with newly reasonable prices, no recent history of terrorism and streets that can be walked without fear all night long. 
 "Immerse yourself in the safe arms of a proud, ancient culture," beckon advertisements that started running this month in American newspapers and magazines, part of a $17 million Visit Japan Campaign, also aimed at four Asian countries. 
 Tokyo is safer and more affordable for tourists than London, says Rob Henderson, who moved there from London last spring to work as a spokesman for ANA, one of Japan's major international airlines. 
 "Japan is extremely safe," he said. "Japanese people are extremely hospitable. You don't have to worry about getting lost in a back alley in Japan. 
 When Bill Murane, a Denver lawyer, toured Japan last December, he said, he found "unfailingly courteous staff" but often comical attempts to cross the language barrier. "The restaurant staff would scramble to find a diner who spoke English," Mr. Murane said of his tour. "In Kanazawa, I recall a recruited diner pursued us down the street after we had given up at the restaurant entrance. We ended up with an excellent tempura dinner." 
 But Japan has a long way to go. While it has the world's second largest economy, Japan ranks 35th worldwide in foreign tourism. With 5.2 million foreign visitors last year, Japan was far below the champion, France, which drew about 70 million, and drew not half as many as the 10.8 million Thailand says it had. For every foreigner who comes here, three Japanese go overseas. For every American who visits their country (731,900 did last year), seven Japanese visit the United States.
 Today, Japanese tourists spend $30 billion more overseas than foreign tourists spend in Japan. After Japan came under fire for its trade surplus in the 1980's, it virtually stopped promoting tourism and encouraged Japanese to spend their yen overseas. 
 "One of the big obstacles was that Japan was not promoted," Mr. Henderson said. "There were no glitzy ads in the London underground." 
 Despite the new advertising, visas remain a major hurdle to tourism growth. About 70 percent of Japan's tourists come from Asian countries whose nationals must spend weeks and varying but significant sums to get visas to visit Japan.
 The Japanese might learn a lesson from South Korea and China, who have dropped visa requirements. A few years ago, when South Korea dropped the requirements for the Japanese, tourism by Japanese immediately soared. This Sept. 1, China followed suit, and demand is so strong that Japan's two largest airlines, Japan Airlines and ANA, are increasing flights between Japan and China by 50 percent starting Oct. 26.
 But Japan is not expected to liberalize its visa policies. With a per capita income far higher than any of its Asian neighbors, Japan worries about foreigners overstaying their visas and living off crime. (Americans do not need visas for tourist visits to Japan.)
 "The problem is the people most interested in coming to Japan also require visas," said Anthony Concil, Asia spokesman for International Air Transport Association, the airline trade group. "In order to bump up the numbers, you have to get more Koreans, Chinese, Thais. So you are going to have to do something about the visas."
 Americans are more likely to be concerned by the expense. Tokyo and Osaka routinely top lists of the world's most expensive cities. But these cost-of-living listings are heavily influenced by residential rents and have little to do with the cost of a meal in a noodle shop.
 "A lot of foreigners think, 'Well, Japan is O.K. , but it is rather expensive,"' said Satoru Kanazawa, who is running the new Visit Japan campaign "We have to make efforts to get the cheaper locations known."
 A cab ride from Narita airport to downtown Tokyo still costs a stunning $220. But the Narita Express train to Tokyo Station costs $30. Fourteen years after Japan's speculative bubble burst, Tokyo's hotels and restaurants have settled down to the levels of other major world capitals with good dinners going for $40 a head and good hotel rooms for $175 a night.
 "Paris is not cheaper than Tokyo, neither is New York," said Xavier Destribats, general manager of the Grand Hyatt Tokyo, which charges $400 to $465 for a double. Since the hotel opened last spring, he said, it has been 95 percent occupied, largely by Japanese. 
 Hotel rates may further soften as 4,000 new rooms go on the market in Tokyo by 2007. In the last year, three top-class hotels have opened, each anchoring a major new development: the Hyatt in Roppongi Hills, the Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo in Marunouchi and the Royal Park Shiodome Tower in Shiodome. By 2007, they will be joined by the St. Regis Tokyo and the Peninsular Tokyo.
 But even at new developments, language barriers can stand tall. At the sleek new Shiodome media and business complex, the minimalist decor does not include prominently posted signs in English for the anchor hotel, the Royal Park. Recently, a friendly janitor walked a quarter-mile out of his way to show the entrance to a gesticulating American visitor. 
 Lauren Rooney, a 21-year-old Georgia college student who went on a student tour last spring, said, "Sometimes I would find a young adult like me who spoke English, but there were not many."

HEADLINE: FALL/WINTER CRUISES; 
A Stage Set On the High Seas

BYLINE:  By TONI SCHLESINGER; TONI SCHLESINGER is a columnist for The Village Voice and a New York-based theater artist.

 BODY:
THERE was a knock at the door. Well, actually Jose never knocked, he just came in. "I have brought your hors d'oeuvres. Is everything satisfactory?"
 "Oh, yes, Jose," I said, wrapped up in the ship's Frette bathrobe, staring out at the veranda visible between the gold-washed drapes. 
 Jose, the butler, came with the Penthouse. He appeared every day at about 4:30 to chat and to ask if we needed more Evian. Our 10-day cruise on the Crystal Harmony last May was like some 1980's "Dynasty" episode. The 940-passenger ship, built in 1990, has that sort of chandelier decor: water dribbling over crystal-like cylinders in the reception area, a plexiglass piano and a grand staircase for descending in an evening gown or maybe a St. John knit. 
 My aunt was treating. We were on a Mexican Riviera Getaway, sailing from Los Angeles to San Diego, Cabo San Lucas, Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and back again, a day in each port. The rest of the time we rocked gently in a theater of luxury, in which the passenger is the star, the crew and the leaping dolphins the supporting cast. 
 This Crystal cruise differed from others offered on the Harmony and its sister ships, the new Serenity and the Symphony, the regulars said. Many of the people on board had received "unheard of deals," according to Linda Daubar, cruise manager at Five Star Travel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The cruise "came together at the last minute," she said, when the Harmony's Asian program was interrupted because of SARS in Asia. The cost for each passenger in a 360-square-foot Penthouse --with queen or twin beds, couch, armchair, Jacuzzi and walk-in closet -- was more like $2,000 than the $7,000 brochure rate. More elaborate penthouses at a higher cost are the 492-square-foot Penthouse Suite and the 948-square-foot Crystal Penthouse with a living room. 
 Both passengers and crew members were always changing costumes. At night, the yellow-, red- and purple-sequined dancer in the abbreviated version of a Broadway show was singing "You say po-TAH-to." By day, she was a librarian in a polo shirt, or the one leading the bingo. 
 Then there was the plot: Would my aunt get a reservation at Prego, one of the ship's two specialty restaurants? The Harmony's main dining room had all sorts of choices: chilled strawberry soup, crab claws, veal medallions, cherry crumble, depending on the day. The many courses are served by a team of waiters in a 1930's-style low-ceilinged dark-wood-paneled room with strawberry linens and crystal light fixtures that look like flower petals -- all very Agatha Christie, especially the people wearing heavily beaded chiffon. But passengers are wild to eat at Kyoto and Prego. The competition to get reservations was fierce; people lined up the minute they boarded. Though the restaurants are in the same rooms where people at the breakfast buffet eat bran flakes, the lighting is different at night. 
 Other rooms changed, too, depending on the event. Club 2100 was a big art auction or bingo by day and all romance at night, with the Manila Sextet playing "Oh, Spanish eyes, don't leave me before I go," as a woman floated on her gold shoes. The karaoke bar, though, is always the karaoke bar. A couple from Japan sang a beautiful rendition of "Sunrise, Sunset." 
 There were subplots. Was it really safe to leave clothes in the laundry machines with automatic soap on each floor? Should one go to a free step class or pay $83 for an hour of private Pilates instruction? The gym -- with 10 treadmills, 3 cross trainers, Life Fitness machines and the like -- and spa were designed by a feng shui master. Would it be the Frangipani Ceremony of Strands conditioning hair and scalp ritual with hand and foot treatments for $191 (if you have short hair)? Or the two-and-a-half-hour Cellutox Aroma Spa Ocean Wrap with Well Being Massage for $254. Then there is the pool, with ocean water and wild waves depending on the sea, and at lunch, the Manila Sextet, now in Hawaiian shirts, would play "Itsy Bitsy, Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini" and "Leaving on a Jet Plane." 
 But the highest-stakes question was: Should one go on a Crystal land expedition or rent a van with a driver? Some expeditions require walking; many of the ship's passengers were 60 and up. Then there were people who just insisted on doing something "special," away from the crowd.
 Crystal offered three, four or five land tours in each port, ranging from $34 a person for a three-and-a-half-hour Coastal Highlights of Cabo San Lucas to $137 for a six-and-a-half-hour Sierra Madre Villages Aerial Exploration in Puerto Vallarta. The only exception was San Diego where there was one tour, "Military Legacy," for $39. 
 In Puerto Vallarta, my aunt and two other people rented a van and driver for about $100 with tip for a few hours. In Puerto Vallarta, everything was beautiful -- the roses, the bougainvillea, the Arabian Nights cupolas on the houses. The best stop was the Sets of the Night of the Iguana Restaurant, which was built to be the hotel in the movie; it still looks exactly the same. You can just hear Ava Gardner yelling for Pedro, Pepe, her mariachi boys. (The restaurant plays the video of the movie every night.) 
 Back on shipboard in the elevator, I got jealous of a couple who had gone on one of the Crystal expeditions and spent the afternoon at a private villa. They had towels around their necks, and they were delirious, as if they had just been in a Fellini movie. "Fabulous, fabulous," they said. 
 In Mazatlan, after seeing the magnificent cathedral with chandeliers holding candles and a mysterious gold and blue light above the altar, I wandered around the Golden Zone. I don't know what was golden except the contribution to the local economy, although there was an extraordinary Internet cafe with one computer, a sewing machine and a nice woman making placemats. I got back to the ship with a driver in a golf cart ($10) that zoomed along the sparkling coast. 
 The truth is, upon hitting land each time, I felt too poor and real. I was happy to get back to the set. 
 Sometimes there were class struggles. There is a certain consciousness of who gets off on what floor; the level of luxury, especially stateroom size, gently goes down as one goes from the tenth to the seventh floor. Then there is the whole Crystal Society thing. The more Crystal cruises one goes on, the more one is a Crystal Society member and the more rewards one gets -- free stateroom upgrades, shipboard spending credits, special invitations to special cocktail parties in the Palm Court with its mushroom-white wicker chairs and a free tote bag with seahorse logo if you've been on two trips. A man in a long line for nasi goreng at the Asian buffet said, "They really should let Crystal Society members go first."
 In the end, though, as in a 1930's drama, it is the butler who rules. After the passengers hung up their bathrobe costumes and headed off to go on dusty land, Jose, ever charming, was putting toothpicks in the shrimp, getting ready for the next crowd. He got to stay in the play. 
 The next Crystal Pacific Riviera Holiday will be on the new Serenity. The Christmas-New Year's trip leaves Dec. 22 from Los Angeles with stops in Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan, Acapulco, Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta, returning to Los Angeles on Jan. 5. Rates per person, double occupancy, range from $12,410 for a penthouse with veranda to $6,900 for a deluxe stateroom without veranda. A similar 14-day cruise, which also calls at San Diego and Zihuatanejo, leaves Jan. 5, with rates from $10,215 to $4,635. 
 The Harmony will be sailing on 11-day Panama Canal and Caribbean cruises from October to early January; prices from $1,695. In late January and February it begins a new series of 10-day Hawaiian cruises round trip from Honolulu.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
Phoning Home While Abroad

BYLINE:  By MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON; MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON contributes regularly to the Travel section.

 BODY:
WHEN I traveled in Southeast Asia in the 1990's, telephoning home was fraught with frustration. Wedged into a hot, mosquito-ridden cubicle, I waited for an operator to make a connection. If I was lucky, I'd hear a faraway ring, and finally a voice, often with a lag or an echo. International communications are now light-years from those days, with mobile phones that can roam worldwide, inexpensive global telephone cards, toll-free numbers and a plethora of rapidly evolving technologies. 
 The subject generates a lively exchange on such posting boards as Lonely Planet's "Thorntree" forum (thorntree.lonelyplanet.com), Rick Steves's "Graffiti Wall" (www.ricksteves.com) or the forum at Virtual Tourist (www.virtualtourist.com). For someone with a specific question -- say, "What's the best place to rent a cellphone in Rio?" -- these forums are a good place to find up-to-the-minute information. 
 The first consideration: What sort of communications do you actually need? Some people on vacation figure that being unavailable is not a bad thing. Others can't imagine a day without at least text messaging. Still others want family to be able to reach them in case of emergency. Parents whose children are traveling abroad may want to have a way of checking in with them by phone. 

Cards for Calls
 For those who plan to spend a week or two in Europe, in hotels with switchboards that take messages, local phone cards are an economical choice. You buy a card with a certain value, an access number and a pin code. Sold in tobacco shops, train stations and post offices, they usually work in only one country.
Also popular are international phone cards, including AT&T cards (best value at Sam's Club and Wal-Mart, though also available elsewhere and at www.att.com) and GlobalPhone cards from IDT (www.idt.net), another phone card company, based in Newark. These cards connect via an access code in each country (or, in the United States, a toll-free number), then the account number and sometimes a pin, and, finally, the number you are calling. The international access codes are listed at the company's Web site. With the IDT cards, you can also create mailboxes for voice mail and faxes. For someone backpacking for about three weeks in Europe, a card with 1,000 minutes was recommended, or two 500-minute cards for $30 each. 
 Cheap global rates are also available through rechargeable online "telephone card" systems like Ekno (www.ekno.com), which offers international calls via access numbers in more than 55 countries, as well as voice mail and e-mail capability. 
 Other global phone cards are proliferating. One, the Nobel card (www.nobelcom.com), quoted rates as cheap as 1.5 cents a minute in the United States, and 5.9 cents a minute from Britain to the United States. 

Mobile Phones
 Most likely, your domestic cellphone won't do you any good outside the United States, and the calling card for your home phone service probably charges high rates internationally. But there is technology that allows you to call anyone from anywhere, including cruise ships, and for anyone anywhere to call you. You often end up paying either way. For someone planning to travel extensively and who truly needs to stay plugged in, a triband mobile phone or a GAIT phone, a newer, more extensive (and more expensive) technology, is the best option. Either phone will operate on any of the three wireless frequencies (triband) now in place worldwide. You can buy or rent either (triband phones start at close to $100 at sites like www.ustronics .com; AT&T and Cingular are offering discounted GAIT phones as they change over to more widely used global standards. 
 T-Mobile offers global roaming, and will sell (or rent) a triband phone to go with it. Calling rates for T-Mobile subscribers are high, between 99 cents and $4.99 a minute, but there is no activation or subscriber fee. Visit www.t-mobile.com or call (800) 937-8997. 
 Without some sort of roaming capacity, owners of what's known as an unlocked phone (meaning one not programmed for a phone service) will need to buy SIM cards (Subscriber Identity Module, basically the ego of the handset) in each country they visit, and so will change phone numbers each time. 
 The SIM card is a postage-stamp-sized chip that snaps into the back of the phone. Prepaid SIM cards may be bought for a specific country, and you then get a local phone number and benefit from local rates that nearly always include free incoming calls. The cost of SIM cards varies from $16 to $79, depending on the country and the competition; a SIM card in Britain, for example, sells for $16 to $24, which includes $8 worth of talk time with no expiration date. 
 SIM cards can be bought in advance from online companies like Telestial (www.telestial.com), which also offers a HopAbroad SIM card that roams through 70 countries. 

Phone Rentals
 As for renting cellphones, in many countries you can do so at the airport or from hotels. Or you can rent a globally enabled cellphone (plug in your itinerary to make sure it will work in all the countries you plan to visit) from a company like TravelCell, at www.travelcell.com or (877) 235-5746, or Cellhire, at (866) 476-7368 or www.cellhire.com. 
 A friend, David Bannon, an actor and teacher in Los Angeles, is planning a four-month trip to Ireland, London, India and Thailand. According to Josh Mehlman, president of TravelCell, David qualifies for the company's long-term plan, for rentals of over three months, and would pay $19.99 a month, plus optional insurance of $8 a month; the country-to-country rates are about half of T-Mobile's.
 For those traveling where there is no cellphone service -- say, on cruise ships or into the Himalayas -- the companies offer satellite phone rental. TravelCell charges $149.99 for the first week and $49.99 each additional week, with incoming calls free from anywhere in the world and outgoing calls at $2.49 a minute.
 Some travelers are using corporate solutions to save on international phone charges. For instance, my friend David could get an 800 number in the United States for $1 a month through American International Telephonics, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., and anyone who wanted to reach him, dialing the 800 number, would automatically be forwarded to his cellphone number abroad, or to any number he specified, although at his expense. He can change the "ring to" number as he wishes: to a hotel phone number, for instance, or to that of a friend with whom he's staying. Sample charges, according to Michael Framer, a partner at A.I.T., would be 8 cents a minute to London or 37 cents a minute to Bombay from the United States (plus the $1 monthly fee for the 800 number). 
 Whatever you do, warn many forum correspondents, don't use the 800 number posted on public and hotel telephones, whether calling collect or with an ATM or credit-card number. Charges can be $30 to $50 for calls under five minutes.

HEADLINE: FALL/WINTER CRUISES; 
Pink Beaches, Well Scrubbed

BYLINE:  By TERRY TRUCCO; TERRY TRUCCO writes frequently for the Travel section.

 BODY:
THE day after Hurricane Fabian ravaged Bermuda early this month, The Royal Gazette printed a photograph that became the talk of the island. It showed a boat with the wildly inappropriate name of Tiptoe that had crashed into a deserted guest room at the Sonesta Beach Hotel, landing in a puddle of curtains and bedding.
 "Boats in the rooms and TV's on the beach, that sums up this storm," Paul Tormey, general manager of the Fairmont Hamilton Princess, the grande dame hotel in Bermuda's capital, Hamilton, said on Sept. 16. 
 Although Hurricane Isabel eclipsed Fabian in the United States, no one who experienced Bermuda's worst hurricane in 40 years is likely to forget Fabian anytime soon. For 12 relentless hours, the storm pummeled the island with 120- to 140-mile-an-hour winds, spawned small tornados and unleashed a towering surge of ocean that doused much of the island in salt water. Trees were uprooted, beaches routed and windows blown out. 
 On an island that hadn't seen a severe hurricane in 16 years and where gale-force winds typically last three to four hours, Fabian was bigger, nastier and more destructive than anything most Bermudans can recall. 
 Yet they also marvel that Fabian's damage wasn't worse. Though thousands of homes were without electricity for days, in some cases weeks, most large hotels and businesses never lost power. Long-distance telephone service, essential now that international business is the major contributor to the country's economy, was quickly restored, aided by linesmen flown in from the Caribbean.
 Residents wielding machetes and chain saws joined government workers the morning after the storm to clear away fallen trees, enabling several main roads to open shortly after the storm. And while the bright-blue plastic sheeting fluttering atop buildings is testimony to the white roof tiles blown off during the storm, Bermuda's signature sherbet-colored buildings, with 10-inch-thick walls made of concrete and island limestone, look remarkably untouched. 
 "If we'd had frame houses, everything would have been flattened," said Vince Cann, a cabdriver whose house was undamaged.
 Some of the worst damage was sustained by the two-lane causeway to the airport, which was partly washed away by the surge. Four people were killed (the only hurricane-related deaths) and the airport was forced to close, reopening five days later when one causeway lane was restored. Highway traffic to the airport this month slowed to a crawl, but authorities expect the causeway to be back to two lanes in the next few weeks. 
 "No one can deny that we're facing challenges caused by the hurricane," said Alex Scott, premier of Bermuda. "But since the Monday after the storm, Bermuda has been open for business."
 Indeed, while parts of the island look battered, notably the charming East End Town of St. George, which was pounded by the surge, visitors can expect a nearly full complement of amenities and activities. Taxis are plentiful (if as costly as ever), and the pink public buses are running most routes, as are the ferries. Hamilton's fancy clothing and jewelry shops, more upmarket than a decade ago, seem untouched by the storm, and all but a handful of the island's 77 restaurants are open. 
 Although Bermuda's eight golf courses lost trees, six have cleared their debris and reopened, with Belmont Hills scheduled to join them on Wednesday and the Fairmont Southampton course closed until further notice. Still closed indefinitely are the Botanical Garden and a few tennis courts. But the six cruise ships that dock here each week were back after a one-week absence.
 Residents seem particularly proud that the country's line-up of autumn amusements will proceed as scheduled, including the Bermuda Jazz Festival from Oct. 9 to 11 and the King Edward VII Gold Cup regatta Oct. 18 to 26. The only scratch so far has been a bicycle race, canceled because of poor road conditions. 
 The storm treated the island's lodging establishments capriciously, harming some but leaving others unscathed. Nearly all the damaged properties have made repairs and reopened except three that suffered severe damage -- the Pink Beach Club, a glamorous 94-room cottage community, which plans to reopen in March; the 593-room Fairmont Southampton, Bermuda's largest hotel, which will close for two to six months; and the 400-room Sonesta, to undergo a major renovation before reopening in May.
 Although Bermuda has 62 hotels and lodging establishments, the three damaged properties account for 40 percent of the island's rooms, leaving industry officials concerned about the potential loss of visitors and revenue. "It is not in the country's best interest to have to have these hotels offline for long," said William Griffith, president of Bermuda Resort Hotels, a boutique hotel group that includes the Harmony Club. The Fairmont Southampton, for example, is the only hotel here that can accommodate large groups. "We had to move some group business off the island since no one here could handle it," said Norman Mastalir, the hotel's general manager and president of the Bermuda Hotel Association. 
 One local businessman even suggested leasing a cruise ship and docking it in Bermuda for use as a floating hotel for six months or so. 
 Nonetheless, hoteliers sound grateful that the hurricane struck in September and not in July. Unlike the Caribbean, Bermuda's season runs from April through October. "Bermuda is coming out of its high season, and the island has more than enough rooms to entertain people successfully," said Michael Winfield, president of Cambridge Beaches, a discreet luxury cottage community on the West End.
 For now, hotel officials hope that the specter of post-hurricane Bermuda will not deter visitors. Nancy and Roy Kapanka of Nazareth, Pa., received a call from the owner of the hotel where they have stayed each September for the past 10 years, encouraging them to come as planned the week after the hurricane.
 "I said as long as there was electricity and the causeway was open, we'd be there," Mrs. Kapanka said on the plane to Bermuda. But most hotels reported cancellations for the days immediately after Fabian, and there are concerns that guests will postpone visits to the spring. 
 What can a visitor to Bermuda expect to see in the next few weeks? From the inside of most buildings here, you would never know nature had run wild. Stroll through the immaculate, chandelier lighted lobby of Elbow Beach, a majestic 95-year-old hotel overlooking Bermuda's south shore, and you'll see businessmen dressed in blazers, knee socks and Technicolor Bermuda shorts stride purposefully past flower-adorned tables while guests in flip-flops relax on a sofa in the lounge, catching a movie on a flat-screen television. 
 Step outside, however, and the landscape bears testimony to Fabian's wrath. On a verdant island, the trees stand leafless and forlorn, and ferns are withered and brown, burned by the salt water. Trucks hauling huge heaps of horticultural debris drive past decapitated palm trees bent at improbable angles. And throughout the island, casarina trees, with their shallow roots, lie lifeless on their sides as if a giant had plucked them out of the ground. 
 "Two weeks ago, this garden could have won an award," said David Saul, a former premier of Bermuda, looking at his devastated yard. "But Bermuda gets 65 inches of rain a year, and it will all grow back. In two years you will never know the hurricane was here."
 Some of the damage to natural sites is permanent, unfortunately. Natural Arches, an expanse of cliff that years of erosion had fashioned into a graceful arch over the beach on the south shore near the East End, was completely washed away. Parts of several beaches were also lost, but the surf will bring much of the sand back, local residents say. 
 And if nature doesn't restore the beaches, help is promised. Using jets supplied by several Bermuda corporations, the government has conducted reconnaissance flights over the island. "We have a digital map of the Bermuda that was, which we will compare with the Bermuda that is, so we can put it back in place," Mr. Scott said. 
 While no one would call Fabian a blessing, some people here concede that the hurricane may prompt some much-needed changes. It crystallized the need for a bridge or some kind of replacement for the two-lane causeway. The hurricane also illustrated the advantage of underground power sources, and may speed up the country's efforts to move wires below ground. "With underground power lines, you're out 48 to 72 hours instead of days or weeks," said Philip Butterfield, chief operating officer of the Bank of Bermuda.

HEADLINE: Habitats/The Bronx; 
West Side Family Finds A Riverdale Compromise

BYLINE:  By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
SHE grew up in the Normandy, the Art Deco palace designed by Emery Roth on Riverside Drive. She attended the Lycee Francais on East 72nd Street and spent her summers in the mountains in Austria.
 He grew up in a rambling colonial house in Avon, N.Y., a small town of 7,000 outside Rochester. Each summer, the Memorial Day Parade passed so close to his house he could reach out a window and touch the band. 
 He had been a fireman; she has a degree in media. She loves the Upper West Side, where she had lived her whole life; he loves the water. 
Four years ago, Nadine Holzer, now 40, and Bill Widener, 36, met on the 16th floor of an office building on East 41st Street, where they each work, at first eyeing each other in the hall like dancers in a quadrille. That they would marry seemed almost a foregone conclusion after a first date, an afternoon lunch where neither ate a thing. 
Where they would live once they married, however, was more problematic. At first, they forged a happy compromise: the weeks were spent at her apartment, on 95th Street, near Broadway, and the weekends, at his house in Keyport, N.J., a town on the Raritan Bay. When their daughter, McKayla, now 1 1/2, arrived, they found a two-bedroom apartment on the corner of 96th Street and Columbus Avenue -- and there were no more weekends on the bay.
The new apartment was large and bright, but as noisy as only a third-floor New York City apartment, perched above a major cross street, could be. Mr. Widener was in agony. "I just hated it," he said, explaining how he hung stereo speakers high in the corners of their living room for a "surround-sound effect" to block the yawp of the sirens and the squeal of the brakes on the crosstown bus. 
Ms. Holzer, sick at heart, knew her city days were numbered.
"Bill had always been an advocate of leaving the city," she said. "But the Upper West Side is my element, my comfort zone. And the culture of it is something I wanted to pass on to my daughter. I wanted her to grow up as I had." 
Ms. Holzer, a vice president at a company that provides temporary help for corporate special events and the hospitality industry as well as general office support, had an upbringing that was decidedly not run-of-the-mill.
HER mother, an artist and designer, is a descendant of Catherine the Great; Ms. Holzer is named for Catherine's daughter, Natasha. Her father, Hans Holzer, was born in Austria. An authority on the paranormal, Mr. Holzer is known as the Ghost Hunter, and has written 138 books on the subject.
When her parents were ghost hunting in Europe, she stayed with her maternal grandmother, who is French and who married a Russian count.
The Holzers lived their very own ghost story: A summer house three hours from Vienna was haunted, Ms. Holzer said, by a displaced ghost confused by the family's renovations. "We'd hear doors slamming," Ms. Holzer said. "And sometimes you could just feel her in the halls." 
Ms. Holzer's mother lives on Long Island with Ms. Holzer's grandmother, now 92. Mr. Holzer, who is 83, is still living at the Normandy. "I didn't want to be far from him," she said. "That was another factor." 
Still, the rent on their apartment was high, $3,200 a month. Both Ms. Holzer and Mr. Widener, who is an account executive for a company that provides staffing for Fortune 500 companies, work on commission. They felt that a lower-price rental was more appropriate to their incomes, with the idea of a buying a house somewhere down the line. "Before, our business was very lucrative," Ms. Holzer said. "In this economy, it's seat of the pants." 
Ms. Holzer continued: "I knew Bill was right about making a change, but whether I was going to admit that to him was another thing altogether. Sometimes you just know, but you don't want to see it." 
Two friends of Ms. Holzer's lived in Riverdale, in the west Bronx just north of Manhattan -- though one has since moved -- as did an acquaintance of Mr. Holzer's. "When I got Hans's blessing," Mr. Widener said, "I jumped on Metro-North with my digital camera." 
It had snowed that day, and the Hudson was as smooth as glass. Mr. Widener's goal was the Century, a nearly 600-unit apartment building built in 1975. With 31 floors, a community center, a gym and an Olympic-size swimming pool, it is like a city in itself. Its west-facing apartments look out over Riverdale to the cliffs of the Palisades; you can see the statue of Henry Hudson floating on its pedestal, the toes grazing the tops of the trees in Henry Hudson Park. 
Mr. Widener was entranced. Ms. Holzer was horrified. "I really didn't think he'd find anything," she said.
One day in late February, the sort of grim, raw day when nothing north of the 18th parallel looks right, Ms. Holzer followed Mr. Widener to a selection of two-bedroom apartments at the Century. A west-facing unit on the 15th floor was $2,340 a month. And it had a terrace. 
"I couldn't find anything wrong with it, though I tried," said Ms. Holzer, who went home and burst into tears. "I felt that Riverdale was so out of my element. I just couldn't fathom it." 
They moved in April, during a northeaster, the wind blowing the rain sideways. Yet when they fell asleep that night, it was so quiet Ms. Holzer could hear her ears ringing. 
"The next morning I took McKayla and the stroller and I began to walk," Ms. Holzer said. "And you know what? I started to feel O.K. Every day I walked a little more, up to Wave Hill" -- the 28-acre public garden overlooking the Hudson -- "over to the river, miles and miles in each direction. And I now tell myself, 'I'm not in the suburbs; I have the subway; in 22 minutes I can be in Manhattan.' And I feel I can do this." 
In his recent book, "The Ghost Hunter's Favorite Cases: Still More True Ghost Stories" (Dorset Press; 2003), Mr. Holzer suggests that New York and its surrounds are full of ghosts. "Ghosts walk the streets of Manhattan or the parkways of its suburbs with the same regularity as they do in lonely Midwestern farmhouses or English manors," he writes. "Subways and noisy buses seem to have no ill effect on the specters, who have other business on their etheric minds, it seems." 
The Century, however, is clean.

Prices 'Robust' In Manhattan

 BODY:
Apartment prices in Manhattan remained resilient in the second quarter of this year, according to companion reports by the Real Estate Board of New York. "Despite the recent rise in interest rates and continued slowdown in the city's economy, New Yorkers are still investing in housing," said Steven Spinola, the president of the board. 
 The two reports, for condominiums and co-ops, were based on a total of 738 sales below 96th Street in the second quarter of this year, compared with 692 in the corresponding quarter in 2002. 
 In the postwar condominium category, the median price per square foot increased by 4 percent, from $624 to $649. And for prewar condominiums, the price per square foot increased 8 percent, to $640 from $592.
For co-ops, the median price per room -- not including bathrooms -- rose 3 percent in the studio and one-bedroom category, to $111,429 from $108,184 a year ago. And for two-bedroom co-ops, the median price was up 5 percent, to $172,222 from $164,020. However, in the three-bedroom category, co-op prices decreased by 9 percent, to $232,051 from $255,001. In light of the wide range of apartment layouts, the board believes that using price per room provides the fairest comparison.
The chairman of the real estate board's residential research committee, Hall F. Willkie of Brown Harris Stevens, said, "While the co-op market is not as strong as it was six to nine months ago, when it reached all-time highs, it remains robust with prices still appreciating in some areas."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/Former Colony Club at 120 Madison Avenue; 
Stanford White Design, Elsie de Wolfe Interior

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
WHEN its clubhouse went up in 1907, the Colony Club instantly became the premier women's social club in New York, but it occupied the little building at 120 Madison Avenue (near 30th Street) for less than a decade. Although damaged by later changes, the original interior is still wonderfully intact, and the building sparkles amid the tatter of lower Midtown. The American Academy of Dramatic Arts, the building's owner since 1963, has almost finished a facade restoration. 
 Although there were women's organizations at the turn of the century, the city's elite women did not build a clubhouse on the par with men's clubs like the Union and the University until 1905, when work began on one of Stanford White's most refined creations, for the newly formed Colony Club. 
 Founded in 1903 by women from the professional, society and creative walks of life, the Colony was led by Florence Harriman, who was active in social causes. She led one of the suffrage parades down Fifth Avenue, worked on campaigns on child labor and safe milk and, as minister to Norway in World War II, organized evacuation efforts while hiding in a forest from the Nazi invasion. 
The club's treasurer, Anne Morgan, who was also interested in social reforms, was sometimes referred to as the richest woman in the world -- her father was J. Pierpont Morgan.
Though the original purpose of the club was to provide athletic facilities, it delivered far more to the original 500 subscribers when it opened in 1907. The ground floor had the typical receiving rooms, but the second floor was the main course: a double-height gym in the rear, with a running track on the balcony, and an elegant, French-style assembly room at the front, with a musicians' balcony above. 
In the basement was a swimming pool, surrounded by white marble walls and floors, with a broad trellised ceiling. Vines were woven into the trellis, through which yellowish artificial light shone through, similar to a garden bathed in soft sunlight. The lighting fixtures were fashioned in greenish-white glass after bunches of grapes. 
The interiors, by the decorator Elsie de Wolfe, were as simple as money could buy -- restrained neo-Colonial and French -- and the exterior still has some of the finest brickwork in New York. Laid with the headers, the short ends, facing out, they form a deliciously mellow mix of muted grays, reds and blues. De Wolfe lived in the club during construction.
Despite the careful planning, there was a significant problem within a month of opening. Someone had overlooked the law prohibiting liquor licenses within 200 feet of a church without the church's consent. The Madison Square Baptist Church, just across Madison Avenue, was strong on temperance and adamantly refused such a release. 
Club officers denied that the club even served spirits, saying that members brought in their own, but the presence of a wine room in the basement was rather telling. The club's position was not helped when someone -- apparently a disgruntled employee -- leaked receipts and other documents to the press, such as a menu reading "All wines will be charged by the bottle."
The club was never able to get a liquor license at that location.
The club soon replaced most of its women employees with men; The New York Times recorded an officer saying that the women "put themselves on an equal plane with the members" but also "talked too much."
The Colony's rules reflected typically upper-class attitudes and activities. One rule read that "doubling at bridge shall not continue past 100 points a trick." But regardless of class, women enjoying even nominally equal rights with men were often considered fit subjects for lampoon, and an early Times article was headlined, tongue in cheek, "A Strenuous Day Within the Colony Club."
However, Colony Club activities also show a more serious side. After a presentation by factory workers in 1909, de Wolfe passed the hat to collect $1,300 for striking workers of the Triangle Shirtwaist Company. There was also a rumor that Anne Morgan was going to finance a $1 million cooperative factory to compete in the garment industry but under humane conditions. 
Many of the club members were active proponents of women's suffrage. Conversely, a 1913 meeting of a different sort of activist was led by Louise Morgan Satterlee, Anne Morgan's sister, where those in attendance wore black, white and rose -- the colors of the anti-suffrage movement. 
Morgan and Harriman were still in office in 1913 when the decision was made to move uptown to escape the invasion of lofts and business buildings. There was a split in the club -- some wanted to move to Westchester or Long Island for better sports facilities. 
Perhaps this was the reason for the first selection of a very large midblock site running from 66th to 67th Streets, between Lexington and Third Avenues. This site, 125 feet by 200 feet, would have permitted tennis courts, trees, a skating rink and similar facilities, but the membership said it was too far away from Park and Fifth Avenues. The club then built its present clubhouse at 62nd Street and Park Avenue, opened in 1916. The original building soon became a war hospital, then a club for Catholic girls and then an arts center.
SINCE the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, an acting school, bought the former Colony Club in 1963, it has converted the gym and ballroom to theaters but has made few other major changes. On a recent morning, about 25 young people in Elizabethan costume were rehearsing "Love's Labors Lost"; the low-cut velvet gown on one young woman revealed an extensive tattoo between her shoulder blades.
On the outside, the building has been repaired and cleaned -- a mason's-eye view of the brickwork will put a spring in your step -- and the iron and wood trim is freshly painted, linen white, all at a cost of $100,000, says Roger Croucher, president the school, which has a two-year acting program. If the exterior's elegance has been reclaimed, the interior is more of an archaeological dig, one that reveals a treasure house of detail.
The delicate glass sconces in the ballroom are intact, even though the room has otherwise received very rough treatment. The staircase is heavily worn, but the ultrathin balusters are undamaged and almost all there. 
The swimming pool has never been filled in, except by shelves of props. Bags of costumes hang down from the original trellis work, and there is a sense of being below a lowering storm cloud of shimmering plastic dry cleaning bags. The original mirrored walls are mostly intact. Apparently, the modest budgets of the owners have protected the interiors from the kind of damage better financed organizations can wreak.
Although Mr. Croucher says the academy would like to restore the rooms, economics continue to play a part in the preservation of the unusual elements of the former Colony Club. Sometimes they favor preservation. The large, ground-floor windows, for example, are quite different from the typical window: the glass is held in place by trim nailed in from both sides, instead of a fixed element on one side and putty on the other. 
Mr. Croucher says that the academy considered putting in modern windows, which would be much simpler than stripping and repairing the original ones, until its contractor told it that new windows would cost $9,000 each, whereas repair is costing only $3,000 each.

Clay Berry, Bikas Joshi

 BODY:
Elizabeth Clay Berry, the daughter of Mary and John M. Berry of Alexandria, Va., was married yesterday to Bikas Joshi, the son of Shakuntala Joshi and Basu Deb Ram Joshi of Kathmandu, Nepal. Michael Berry, who is the bride's brother and a Universal Life minister, officiated at the family's vacation house in Randolph, N.H.
 The bride, 32, and the bridegroom, 29, are economists in Washington, she at the Treasury Department, he at the International Monetary Fund. 
 Ms. Berry, who is known as Clay, is keeping her surname. She graduated magna cum laude from Bowdoin College and received a master's degree in international affairs from Columbia University. Her father, a reporter for The Washington Post, covers the Federal Reserve and economics. Her mother is the author of "Voices From the Century Before: The Odyssey of a 19th-Century Kentucky Family" (Arcade Books, 1996), a collection of her family's letters from the Civil War period.
Mr. Joshi, who received a master's degree in economics at Columbia, is a doctoral candidate in that subject there. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard. His mother is an account officer at the Rastriya Banijya Bank in Kathmandu, of which his father is the chairman. His father retired as executive director of the Nepal Rastra Bank in Kathmandu. 
Ms. Berry and Mr. Joshi met at Columbia in 1998 in a class on international trade. He was the teaching assistant, and she was a student. They did not become friends until the following summer, when she was consulting at the World Bank in Washington, and he worked nearby as an I.M.F. intern.
"She was one of the few people I knew in Washington," he remembered, "So I e-mailed her for lunch." By August, after two months of friendly outings, a relationship developed, which continued in New York. She was working as a trader and analyst at the Federal Reserve, and he was doing his doctoral studies at Columbia. 
By October, they agreed that perhaps Mr. Joshi wanted more from the relationship than Ms. Berry was willing to give at that point, and they broke up. 
"I had just moved back to New York, was starting a new job and looking for a new apartment," Ms. Berry explained. She sent him a Christmas card. "After a month or so, when I didn't hear back from him, I figured that's that," she recalled.
Indeed, things might have ended there, were it not for the United States Postal Service. The next June, Mr. Joshi received what he described as an "ink-smudged, dirty, battered envelope." It was the Christmas card.
"If I'd received her card in December, I would have tossed it out because I was still angry," Mr. Joshi said. Instead, he was pleasantly surprised and sent her an e-mail note, which rekindled their friendship and eventually led them to the altar.

HEADLINE: The Edge of Hip: Vice, the Brand 

BYLINE:  By VANESSA GRIGORIADIS

 BODY:
YOU see a lot of strange things at fashion shows, but models chugging cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon is not usually one of them. Two weeks ago, however, at the show put on by Vice, a Lafayette Street boutique, a series of gaunt men and women in $200 overalls and $80 T-shirts applied their bee-stung lips to cans of beer and then gleefully tossed the remainder of the brew -- sometimes nearly half the can -- on the whimpering audience. In the front row, a slender woman with a fuchsia streak in her hair raised an umbrella.
 After the show, a sendup of Fashion Week, the wet 20- and 30-something crowd gathered in a parking lot next to the store, gripping plastic cups of beer pumped from a keg and eating barbecued hot dogs served by waitresses on pink roller skates. 
 In many ways, Vice, which is less known for retail lines than for publishing a free glossy magazine found at downtown boutiques like Seize sur Vingt and record stores like Other Music, embodies the apex of hipsterdom 2003. What that has meant this year is a trailer-park sensibility, embraced with and without irony, that has taken hold among postcollegiate society in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles, in Brooklyn and on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. 
The fashion aesthetic is epitomized by vintage shirts with high school football logos and the foam-front trucker hat. In entertainment, the touchstones are the Southern rock revivalists Kings of Leon and testosterone-charged skateboarder-influenced shows like "Jackass" and "Punk'd." In contrast to older and gentler downtown style guides like Paper magazine, Vice shuns the Nirvana generation's wounded sense of responsibility, instead embracing a frat-boy crudity and ethnic stereotypes. Think of it as a lad magazine for the Williamsburg set.
"Of all the magazines that are out there, I think that's the one that nails hipster cultureon the head," said Robert Lanham, author of "The Hipster Handbook," a recent satire in the spirit of "The Official Preppy Handbook."
As Jimmy Kimmel, a comedian on ABC-TV, put it: "People throw the term 'politically incorrect' around a lot, and normally it's a lot of bluster, but Vice truly is un-p.c. Their brand of humor is what I would do if there were no 'standards and practices' on TV."
The magazine has its detractors, especially among women, and the retail store (which has three branches) is accused by online bloggers of commercializing hipsterdom. But so far the stores and the magazine have proven successful. The Cassandra Report, a trend survey issued by Youth Intelligence, part of the Creative Artists Agency, recently queried 300 "trendsetters" who ranked Vice as one of the top three magazines among people 19 to 30.
Founded in 1994 in Montreal by three out-of-work friends -- Gavin McInnes, now 33, Suroosh Alvi, 34, and Shane Smith, 33 -- Vice acquired a $10 million cash injection from a dot-com company (now defunct) and moved its operations to Manhattan, opening retail stores in SoHo, Los Angeles and Toronto. 
The founders, who recently started British and Australian editions of the magazine, say their business plan is to use Vice's credibility with young people to form partnerships with record labels and clothing lines, something that is already under way.
At Vice stores the merchandise is a mix of high fashion and kitsch, including $1,000 Evisu men's suits and women's underpants with "I Don't Have AIDS . . . Yet" in blue script on the front. (Plans include opening another store in Tokyo and a pub in London.) The American edition of "The Vice Guide to Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll" has just been published by Warner Books with cover endorsements from Rolling Stone ("Hot Book") and Entertainment Weekly (" 'It' Read").
Atlantic Records is financing a Vice Records label, which has signed the Streets and issued a compilation of downtown cult bands like Interpol and Le Tigre. Showtime has ordered a "Vice" cable pilot, to star David Cross of "Mr. Show" fame. And Vice has five movies in production, the founders say, including one starring Casey Affleck and another written by Mr. Smith and Spike Jonze, the director of "Adaptation" and "Being John Malkovich."
"Spike is the one guy in Hollywood who's one of us," Mr. Smith said. "He's not going to make a wack film. He's going to make a cool film with us."
All of which raises a question: if Vice spreads its brand of fashion, journalism and entertainment across the map, how hip can it remain? Will they still love it on Lafayette Street if it's at the mall in Massapequa? By definition, hip taste is embraced by hipsters because the masses don't get it -- and can't buy it. (Nor should a hipster ever admit to being one; Mr. McInnes says hipsters are "spoiled rotten.")
Mr. McInnes, who has a full beard and a tattoo across his back that reads "Destruction" and who serves as the unofficial spokesman for Vice magazine, dismisses the notion of selling out.
"The term 'sell out' is juvenile and naive," he wrote in an e-mail message from the company's unkempt offices in a graffiti-lined warehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. 
Mr. Smith called the appeal of the trailer-park aesthetic purveyed by Vice the latest twist on bohemia's old nostalgie de la boue.
"For middle-class kids just out of university and living in Williamsburg," he said, "the closest thing right now to bad-ass culture is blue-collar culture, so you have hipsters play-acting blue collar. Instead of saying, 'I'm a PlayStation-reared, e-mailing-all-the-time Friendster loser,' they're getting lots of tattoos and drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon and listening to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs."
The magazine's content is often . . . well, offensive. It features expletive-laden articles with the tone of your most cynical friend, like this rant against wine: "O.K., you've had your taste -- is it spoiled? No? Then nod at the waiter and let's get this date over with." (Add a few four-letter words to get the full effect).
Each issue also includes "Dos & Dont's," a gallery of candid photos on the street and in bars with scathing, profane comments about people's clothes and hair. 
"That is pure undiluted magazine genius," said Andy Pemberton, the editor of Blender, an indie music magazine. "The rest of the magazine I find really hit or miss, but everyone loves that thing. I've been to parties downtown where the page will be stuck up on the lavatory wall."
With photography by Terry Richardson and Ryan McGinley that sometimes falls just short of pornography, Vice's articles can be raunchy in the extreme. The magazine's contributors seem unconcerned about AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, with one article arguing that safe-sex messages are ignorable propaganda for people who are not partners of gay men or injectable-drug users.
Mr. McInnes said he was a women's studies major in college. But his magazine would offend many women. An article offering a "Guide to Guilty Pleasures" calls Gwen Stefani lovable for "that pouty face that you kinda want to kiss and slap at the same time."
" 'No means no' is puritanism," Mr. McInnes said, expanding on his view of romance. "I think Steinem-era feminism did women a lot of injustices, but one of the worst ones was convincing all these indie norts that women don't want to be dominated."
Many Vice readers defend the magazine's brand of political incorrectness, including some women. "If you think Vice is misogynistic, then you are a self-centered white woman," said Sarah Silverman, a comedian (and Jimmy Kimmel's girlfriend). "Because Vice is so much more. It harshly makes fun of men, women, all races, nerds, hipsters, the elderly, the short, the tall, the fashionable, the hopeless. It's without boundaries, which is what makes the playing field even."
Few of Vice's fans or customers seem to realize just how deeply hostile Mr. McInnes is to the liberal live-and-let-live ethos of traditional bohemian culture. It is a fair bet that a majority of the downtown population opposed the Iraq war and dislikes the policies of George W. Bush. But in an interview Mr. McInnes advocated changing New York license plates to read "Liberalism Gone Amok." Last month, he wrote an article for Patrick Buchanan in The American Conservative boasting of having converted Vice readers to conservatism.
He actually leans much further to the right than the Republican Party. His views are closer to a white supremacist's. "I love being white and I think it's something to be very proud of," he said. "I don't want our culture diluted. We need to close the borders now and let everyone assimilate to a Western, white, English-speaking way of life."
In an interview in The New York Press last year, Mr. McInnes's views came through in the coarse ethnic expressions he used in saying how pleased he was that most Williamsburg hipsters are white. As a result, he became the focus of a letter-writing campaign by a black reader. Vice apologized for Mr. McInnes's comments.
Some people assume that such remarks are posturing, akin to the ethnic and anti-gay slurs that pepper the pages of Vice, establishing its rebel credentials. They argue that for 20-somethings raised in a multicultural society, ethnic slurs -- part of contemporary street patois -- do not have the sting they do for older generations. 
Vice has female and gay contributors, and on a recent trip to hear some music Mr. McInnes was joined by a Bruce LaBruce, a pornographic-film maker who is gay and was wearing a jacket with a National Rifle Association logo. (Mr. LaBruce insisted that this was "ironic.") And Mr. McInnes's business partner Mr. Alvi was born in Pakistan and emigrated to North America as a child.
"I can't with a clear conscience purport the same political ideals as Gavin," Mr. Alvi said. "But since Day 1, we tried not to censor ourselves or anyone else, both in the form of editorial and advertising, so if Gavin wants to make an argument for his political ideals, bring it on."
Joe Levy, the music editor of Rolling Stone, said: "It's always a disappointment when someone whose aesthetics are edgy and inclusive voices their politics and they're exclusionary. But this is not someone who pretended to be anything other than an offensive, opinionated jerk. So when he turned out to be an offensive, opinionated jerk who wasn't kidding, it wasn't entirely shocking."
In any event, the Vice squad maintains that its readers and fans are ripe for further economic exploitation. In July, Vice added a marketing arm, AddVice, which assembles teams that, for example, promote bands by stuffing Peaches CD's into gift bags at the opening of a sexual aids shop in SoHo.
"We help companies tap into the typical Vice fan," said Nadine Gelineau, the head of AddVice. "We put them in touch with a psychographic, if you will." Mr. McInnes, beside her in the office, pondered for a moment. "Psychographic, huh," he said, the left side of his mouth curling up. "Is that like one of those posters where if you look at it long enough you see a penguin or a horse?"
Not surprisingly, the hipster aesthetic as defined -- and sold -- by Vice has begun to stir a backlash. "Hip culture is a little exposed at the moment," said Mr. Lanham, the "Hipster Handbook" author. "Marketers are constantly scouting Williamsburg, catching trends immediately -- you see the lead singer from the Rapture in a T-shirt, and next week it's in Urban Outfitters. People are starting to realize that hipsters are just upper-middle-class kids in trucker hats and mesh T-shirts."
At one blog, hipstersareannoying.com, the author posted a sendup of all things Williamsburg: "I don't have any of those little T-shirts that say things about Little League football teams from little nowhere American towns. . . . I don't hang giant pictures of paint-by-number art on the fresh Sheetrock walls of the Williamsburg loft (that I don't have) that my parents (don't) rent for me. I don't go to art school. . . . I don't think Andy Warhol was brilliant, I don't think the Velvet Underground were 'totally underrated.' . . . I don't carry a digital camera everywhere I go shooting pictures of my other dumb hipster friends and putting them up on my dumb hipster photolog site."
The confusion between authenticity and pose -- between earnestness and irony -- is hardly new south of 14th Street. "If you walked into an East Village bar in the mid-80's," said Mr. Levy of Rolling Stone, "you could find an all-female band playing Led Zeppelin's 'Whole Lot of Love,' with the lead singer telling you that she wanted to give you every bit of her love, and was that ironic or was it rock? It was both, and so it is now. If you have a bohemian neighborhood full of people drinking bad beer and wearing ugly T-shirts and trucker hats and dressing the exact same way as Justin Timberlake, it's real and it's ironic, and it's cool and it's uncool at the same time."
Might the current hipster backlash imperil Vice's dreams of expansion? Mr. Lanham said hipsters are still reading the magazine, but "they're just stuffing it under their seat covers."
How long until they simply outgrow it? Mr. Alvi, for one, said the magazine's founders are not worried about overexposure and obsolescence. "The downside to getting recognized," he conceded, "is that we're seen as purveyors of hipsterdom to the masses, packaging cool and selling it to the mainstream."
"The upside," he continued, "is financial gain, and dreams and ambitions being realized. We're living the American dream. Hell, we'll all have houses with white picket fences and be wearing trucker hats when we're 65."

HEADLINE: Partying Like It's 1999 

BYLINE:  By STEVE KURUTZ

 BODY:
ONE of the great virtues of New York has always been its retail diversity, the way a bakery, a dress shop, a fruit market -- perhaps a dozen businesses -- exist on the same block, under a dozen separate roofs. Still, there are shops where specialization is taken to almost unimaginable extremes. Riceto Riches, on Spring Street, is such a place. 
 Rice to Riches famously serves only rice pudding, the one concession to variety being that the pudding comes in different flavors and in two sizes, "Solo" ($5) and "Sumo" ($15). Should you forget this and crave, say, a sandwich, the highly stylized, Space Age decor acts as a not so subtle reminder: everything from the Lucite counter to the opaque doorway is shaped like an oversized grain of rice. 
 Rice to Riches seems the kind of risky business associated more with the footloose dot-com years than the current leaner times; how many people can consume $15 worth of "Coconut Coma"? Yet the manager, Anna Gallo, said business is brisk at the restaurant, which opened in April. As for its NoLIta location, "This was the perfect neighborhood to take this concept to," Ms. Gallo said. 
NoLIta these days is reminiscent of old New York. Not the era of cobblestone streets, but the good old days that seem almost more distant, the New York of the late 1990's, when Wall Street was ferociously bullish, everyone seemed flush with vast disposable income, and establishments that specialized in rice pudding would have been viewed not as a frivolity but as a bold new industry. 
While much of downtown is struggling financially, with vacant storefronts along West Broadway in SoHo and a decrease in foot traffic, NoLIta has remained an outpost of the luxe life; an island of continued prosperity that endures as a stamping ground for the city's remaining young and privileged. 
It is as if the slightly fuzzy borders of NoLIta -- roughly Houston and Grand Streets to the north and south and the Bowery and Broadway to the east and west -- somehow protect the neighborhood from the effects of 9/11, two wars, a year of awful weather and especially a recession. Although NoLIta has been famous since 1996 as a shopping destination, remarkably, this tiny pocket of the city has almost magically escaped the ravages of the economic downturn.
Every afternoon, Cafe Gitane, a French bistro on Mott Street across from St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, brims with a joie de vivre, not to mention a clientele for whom the phrase "day job" seems to be equally foreign. In the past six months, at least four new stores have opened, including the French boutique Jamin Puech and the men's clothier Duncan Quinn; others like Hollywould, a shoe store, have expanded, despite escalating rents. The locals -- a pulsing mix of models, artists and international jet setters -- exude a carefree, moneyed glow no amount of rain could dampen. 
It is not just that the shops are prospering; a good-time vibe embraces the entire neighborhood. The prevailing mood seems best summed up by a saleswoman at Sigerson Morrison, an accessories boutique on Mott Street. Asked if the recession was hurting business, she replied, "I didn't know there was a recession."

Let Good Times Roll
In the past year, the New York metropolitan region has lost 50,000 jobs, and the city "remains in the grip of a stubborn recession," according to Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. But especially on weekends, the streets of NoLIta begin to bustle around noon, go until late in the evening and resemble nothing so much as an all-day parade. 
"This neighborhood was happening two years ago, but nothing like this," said Scott Menchin, an illustrator and longtime resident. "The foot traffic that's here now, I can't believe it."
Mr. Menchin was sitting outside Cafe Habana, a tiny Cuban restaurant at Prince and Elizabeth Streets that serves as NoLIta's social epicenter. Lenny Kravitz filmed a video here, and the place has retained the look of a hip set-piece, populated by tanned European men in open shirts, models in slinky dresses and an ever-present crowd on the corner waiting for a table. 
Joao Correia, who works in advertising, trekked down from Hell's Kitchen to eat brunch at Cafe Gitane and, afterwards, stop by Cafe Habana. 
"This place has the best cafe con leche," said Mr. Correia, who was wearing a pink Lacoste shirt turned up at the collar and a Frederique Constant watch bought on a recent trip to Portugal. The journey had another benefit. "There's not one ugly person in here," he said cheerfully. 
Mr. Correia is one of many New Yorkers who travel from elsewhere to absorb NoLIta's spirited atmosphere. Sharone Katz, who lives in the East Village but often strolls through NoLIta, can rattle off the names of new boutiques -- Calypso Bijoux, Jamin Puech -- as if she were head of a local business bureau. "It's nice to see a neighborhood that is flourishing," she said.
On this day Ms. Katz was simply browsing, but, according to roughly a dozen storeowners, NoLIta, unlike most of the city's other shopping districts, remains a place where shoppers and their money are often parted.
At Edmundo Castillo on Mott Street, where stilettos are displayed with a reverence usually reserved for precious stones, the current best seller is a patent python model that retails for $600.
"We have customers who are buying 10 pairs of shoes a season," said Leslie Ternes, the manager of Hollywould, an upscale women's shoe store on Elizabeth Street. "I don't think it's bankrupting them." Ms. Ternes said her business was so brisk that last year she moved to the current space from smaller quarters on Mulberry Street. Sigerson Morrison was doing so well on Prince Street, it opened a second shop on Mott Street devoted solely to handbags.
Luxury retailers elsewhere in the city might well envy such success. Tiffany's, for example, recently began offering "no money down" deals more commonly associated with buying fridges.
No neighborhood, of course, can be completely untouched by an economic downturn. Some NoLIta storeowners spoke of, if not a decline in business, then a leveling off in recent months. At times, the area has resembled a retail version of musical chairs, with established stores bouncing from one street to the next and boutiques opening and closing quickly. Currently, Elizabeth Street between Prince and Houston Streets has three vacant storefronts. 
But Luc Levy, who owns Cafe Gitane, thinks that the turnover is due more to poor management than fiscal weakness. "The recession has weeded things out," he said. "The people who had their act together, the ones that have quality merchandise and a good business sense, have only grown." 
Calypso, a clothing boutique that began with one store in the neighborhood, now has five. Mr. Levy, too, has expanded, opening Polux Fleuriste, a flower shop on Mott Street. And NoLIta's growth shows no signs of slowing down; construction recently began on one of the vacant storefronts on Elizabeth Street between Prince and Houston, where yet another boutique is moving in.
The expansion comes at a time when commercial rents, once a bargain at $1,000 a month in the mid-90's, are at an all-time high, averaging $6,000 and more a month. But neither high rents nor the city's recent layoffs seem to faze the area's young entrepreneurs. 
When Duncan Quinn, a former lawyer, opened his eponymously named Savile Row-style men's shop on Spring Street four months ago, he did have one concern, but it had nothing to do with the economy. "We were a little worried because we're on the dog end of Spring, near the Bowery," said Phil Meynell, the manager. "But so far, business has been great."

The Young and Recession-Proof
New York has always been a city of wealth and, in turn, a segment of the populace will always remain insulated from economic downturns. During the Depression year of 1930, Barbara Hutton, the Woolworth heir, held her debut at the Ritz-Carlton, an event that cost a reported $50,000, a fortune at the time.
But NoLIta was one of the greatest benefactors of the dot-com boom, its development fueled not by old-money Upper East Siders but largely by young Internet millionaires. That it continues to survive, and in many cases thrive, as a high-end shopping destination is in many ways remarkable and raises the question: where's the money coming from?
"It beats me," Mr. Levy said. "Before, you used to see the retired doctor driving the Porsche. Now it's the 22-year-old guy."
Mr. Menchin, the illustrator, suggested: "Maybe we're becoming like the countries in Europe, a nation of spoiled inheritors. America is old enough now, and there's enough old money, that parents can afford to give their kids $100,000."
Mr. Menchin may be right; some shop owners say that many of the fashionistas who haunt NoLIta's stores are spending someone else's fortune, although they prefer the more discreet phrase "family money." Since Calypso spun off its jewelry store, Calypso Bijoux, last year, for example,a college student from a wealthy Thai family has dropped a small fortune of her future inheritance -- tens of thousands of dollars -- at the shop, according to a sales clerk. 
In addition, the neighborhood has become a playground for others who are young and recession-proof: models, successful artists, wives of wealthy men, celebrities and affluent tourists from Europe and Japan, where word of its eclectic boutiques and European feel has reached hip guidebooks. 
The fact that NoLIta emerged as a hot neighborhood so recently may also help explain why it is enduring; it's still enjoying an upswing and hasn't had time to sink. 
Mark Newhouse, deputy commissioner of neighborhood development for the city's Department of Small Business Services, has another theory; he thinks NoLIta has prospered because of its intimate scale. "The thing that insulates you from economic downturns is a core of very loyal customers," Mr. Newhouse said. "The stores in NoLIta are places where shoppers are passionate about the merchandise and have a relationship with the owners." Those kinds of personal relationships, Mr. Newhouse added, are unlikely in the larger, uptown stores.
Yet another reason for the neighborhood's continued growth is that, while the designer items sold in boutiques are technically luxury goods, to the wantonly fashionable they are an absolute necessity. 
"Looking good is a priority for our girls," said Ms. Ternes of Hollywould. "They want the new thing." Or, as Mr. Meynell put it, "Smart clothes and a good haircut will get you through life." 
And Mr. Correia, the adman, said: "People who have money are going to spend it. When the economy is down, you may be a little more careful, but you still want to look fashionable and you're still going to go shopping."

A Tale of Two Mayors
With many people complaining that SoHo is overly commercial and Fifth Avenue cold and cavernous, NoLIta remains a shopping district that feels both human and resoundingly upscale. There are no fannypack-wearing tourists, no Gaps or J. Crews and, because of the pocket-sized storefronts, there may never be. In the grand tradition of gentrification, enough locals remain to create a sense that the neighborhood has character, a sense that if these were not once exactly Martin Scorsese's mean streets, at least the place has a past.
Vinny Vella Sr. vividly embodies that past. A husky, sociable fellow who is the self-appointed mayor and unofficial historian of Elizabeth Street, he has lived on Elizabeth between Prince and Houston "since before the flood," as he puts it. He has been a numbers runner, a milkman and an actor on "The Sopranos," and like any good civic official, he knows his district intimately.
"This block used to have everything," Mr. Vella recalled the other day. "There was a dry cleaner, a candy store, a butcher, a steakhouse, a fruit market, and the whole block was Italian. You never had to leave."
Should Mr. Vella begin subscribing to Lucky, the glossy shopping magazine, he might still feel the same way; his side of his block is home to five clothing boutiques, three shoe stores, three interior design boutiques, and an upscale maternity shop, to name a few tenants. 
But the sea change that transformed NoLIta from a sleepy Italian enclave to an upscale shopping Mecca actually began one block over, on Mott Street, and was spearheaded by another neighborhood mover and shaker, Mr. Levy. In 1994, Mr. Levy, a sometime filmmaker who hoped to open a restaurant, looked at a space near the corner of Prince and Mott Streets. At the time, money was flooding into the city from Hong Kong, and the Chinese were buying up much of Little Italy. 
Had Mr. Levy passed on the space, the street would have likely become one more part of ever growing Chinatown. Instead, he opened Cafe Gitane, a shabby-chic restaurant that became the lightning rod for the area's dormant energy. 
"There was an amazing nucleus of talented people here," Mr. Levy said. "Vincent Gallo, the filmmaker, lived down the street. The artist Tom Sachs lived here. All these people hadn't made it yet, but you could tell they would. So I moved in, and then the shoe store next door moved in, and then Calypso, a clothing boutique, came in up the street, and those three stores formed a small base."
Soon, fledgling designers, artisans and entrepreneurs, lured by the neighborhood's European feel and cheap rents, began moving into other parts of the area, carving out a new neighborhood from a few nondescript blocks north of Little Italy, hence the catchy name. 
While a bit of its bohemian spirit lingers, in the past year a long-standing hardware store closed and only one original business remains. The holdover, Albanese Meats and Poultry, finds itself in the strange position of having operated in the same location for 75 years and yet being completely out of place.

Turning Down a Transfer Can Freeze a Career

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS

 BODY:
EIGHT years ago, Russell Carr, who was working at a telecommunications company in Atlanta, was offered a transfer to Pelham, Ala., to manage a new plant there. He turned it down. "I just didn't see myself living in Alabama," he said. 
 It was a decision he would regret. Not only did his superiors give him a cold shoulder for months, he said, but the Pelham plant turned out to be the most successful new branch in the organization. "I would have had limitless opportunities there to move ahead," said Mr. Carr, who estimates that by not taking the assignment he set back his career about five years. 
 Mr. Carr, 40, says he is determined not to let history repeat itself with his new employer, ReCellular, which sells refurbished cellphones to businesses. He has made it clear since he joined the company in August, he said, that he is open to a transfer, and he expects to relocate sometime soon from an office in Fort Worth to the company's headquarters in Dexter, Mich. The move, though, will mean that his wife, Manju, 41, a real estate agent, will have to re-establish herself in another state. The couple have no children. 
 "If you really want to build your career, you've got to be adaptable," Mr. Carr said. "It tells companies that you're seriously committed."
 Fewer employees, though, are as committed these days, according to experts in relocation and career services. They say that while many employees still agree to transfers in order to move ahead in their jobs -- or, in some cases, to keep them -- there are many more who refuse. Most people cite family concerns or the high cost of living in a new city. Fifty-four percent of the 316 human-resources managers surveyed earlier this year by the Atlas World Group, a moving company, said they had employees who declined opportunities to relocate in 2002, up from 21 percent the previous year. 
 Career experts advise employees, particularly those in executive positions, to think carefully before turning down out-of-town transfers -- and to be prepared for stalled careers if they do so. 
 "There's no question that a reluctance to move puts a big question mark on the executive's forehead," said Dr. Edward C. Ryterband, managing director of RHR International, a consulting firm in New York. "People will start to question how motivated you are."
 Debra Condren, a business psychologist and president of Business Psychology Solutions, an executive coaching and professional development firm with offices in New York and San Francisco, says she coached several executives recently who turned down transfers and ultimately lost their jobs when their companies reduced the size of their work force. Others who have made such choices have experienced "de facto demotions, or chilly supervisor relations," she said.
 Of course, no one can persuade an employee to move if he really doesn't want to. But career experts say that workers who are reluctant because a spouse may not find employment or an elderly relative may not find proper care should investigate the growing number of relocation services provided by companies. According to the Atlas World Group study, 42 percent of companies offered job-search assistance to the spouses of relocating employees in 2002; only 23 percent had such services in 2001.
 Many companies provide financial help for a move, like reimbursement for home-sale closing costs, home bridge loans, mortgage assistance and cost-of-living allowances. In most cases, the longer an employee has been with a company, the more attractive the perks. 
 Some employers are doing more. Union Pacific Railroad in Omaha offers job counseling for spouses and referrals to centers for care for the elderly, said Jackie Austad, director of quality and process improvement for the company. If relocating executives have spouses who run their own businesses, Ms. Austad said, the company will pay for new brochures and business cards to help them get started in their new location. "We realize that in this economic climate, spouses' jobs are a big concern," she said.
 The RAND Corporation, the public-policy research organization, provides similar help for spouses. Monica Hertzman, a Web producer at RAND, said that one of the selling points for her transfer from the company's headquarters in Santa Monica, Calif., to its Pittsburgh office in July 2002 was the company's offer to help her husband, Adam, 30, find a job. "It was like they were his personal recruiter," said Ms. Hertzman, 32. 
 The company put Mr. Hertzman, who had just graduated from business school at the University of California at Los Angeles, in touch with several marketing executives in the Pittsburgh area and ultimately helped him land a position as the marketing director for a local bank, she said.
 Some companies have in-house services, while others hire relocation consultants. The number of corporate clients has soared since Monstermoving.com, a branch of the online job-listing service Monster.com, started in October 2000, according to Chip Smith, senior vice president for marketing at the subsidiary, which is based in White Plains. The company offers corporate clients like Colgate-Palmolive and ADP customized Web sites where employees can find information about the cost of living in a new area and gauge the job market for their spouses.
 Mr. Carr says that his company offers job-finding assistance for spouses, too, but that his wife won't need to use it. She is likely to sign on to work for one of the local real estate companies after they move, he said.
 Employers, of course, have a vested interest in ensuring that a move goes smoothly. The average cost of relocating a current employee who owns a home is $60,831, according to a study released last year by the Employee Relocation Council, a professional group based in Washington.
 BUT what if no amount of perks can persuade an employee to move? How can workers decline an offer to relocate without hurting their careers?
 Those who have a compelling personal reason to stay put should be frank with their companies, said Allen Salikof, chief executive of Management Recruiters International in Philadelphia.
 Mr. Salikof recalled one recent situation involving an executive client whose child was severely handicapped. The executive did not want to move because his community offered highly specialized services for the child. "Any employer with a heart is going to take these kinds of things into consideration," Mr. Salikof said. (Employers are less likely to be sympathetic, he noted, when an executive turns down an offer simply because he doesn't like the city where he has been asked to move.)
 Other career experts advise executives to shy away from giving a personal reason for declining a transfer. Earl Taylor, president of the North Carolina branch of Dale Carnegie Training, an executive training firm, said he advises clients to come up with a sound business reason for turning down an offer to move. "Even when a personal reason is the real driver, you don't have to share that information," Mr. Taylor said. 
 Those who are working in their company's headquarters, for example, might talk about how they prefer that location because they can learn from the company's top executives, he said. Others might say they have already had experience in the field and want to give someone else the opportunity, he said.
 "Then you'll be seen as a team player, rather than someone who didn't want to go because he wanted to coach his daughter's soccer team," Mr. Taylor said.
 Executives who feel a need to bow out of a move must offer other evidence of their commitment to the company, Dr. Ryterband added. He said he recently worked with an office manager who had children in high school and did not want to disrupt their lives by moving across the country. He coached the woman to offer a list of other ways she wanted to become more involved with the company -- by joining a corporate task force, for example. 
 "Do everything you can to make your employer understand it's purely a relocation issue, not a motivation issue," Dr. Ryterband said.

Raising Minimum Wages, City by City

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
REMEMBER the minimum wage? It used to go up regularly, but that stopped happening 20 years ago. We are now in the seventh year of the latest drought, and increasingly the states and lately a few cities are constructing their own ad hoc network of minimum wages.
 Over the last 20 months, eight states have either instituted a minimum wage higher than the minuscule federal minimum of $5.15 an hour, or they have taken an existing minimum wage that is already higher than the federal one and raised it even more. Not satisfied, four cities have gotten into the act, the largest being San Francisco, which has a proposition on the November ballot asking voters for approval of an $8.50-an-hour minimum. 
 Labor unions and activists for the poor gathered the signatures to put the proposition on the ballot. The cost of living is high in San Francisco, even by California standards, and while a voter initiative increased the state minimum to $6.75 last year from $6.25, the extra 50 cents is not enough to put bread on the table in that city. 
 Few will argue that it is. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, for all his criticism of the high cost of doing business in California -- workers' compensation is a particular target -- has not said a word in his gubernatorial campaign against the $8.50 initiative or, for that matter, the state minimum. Of the 12 states with higher-than-federal minimum wages, only Alaska is above California, at $7.15 an hour.
 "The point is that the federal minimum wage has eroded to the level of irrelevance," said Paul Sonn, associate counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. 
 The center is providing legal support for the new thrust in minimum wages -- the municipal minimum. Until last year, only Washington, D.C., had its own minimum, adopted in 1994 as an automatic $1 above the federal minimum. 
 An attempt in the mid-1990's to set up municipal minimums failed, and this effort might, too. More than 100 cities and metropolitan areas have adopted living-wage ordinances in recent years, some setting a minimum as high as $9.50 an hour. But these apply only to employees of companies that benefit from city contracts or subsidies -- a small percentage of the low-wage workers in any city. A minimum wage, on the other hand, applies to every employee, and that is a tougher battle. 
 New Orleans tried first, and failed. The voters there authorized a $6.15-an-hour minimum last year, and the Louisiana Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional, ruling that a state law bans cities from setting wages. In Santa Fe, N.M., the city council early this year authorized an $8.50 minimum, effective in January, if a court challenge now under way does not intervene. In Madison, Wis., last week, a coalition of politicians and activists began circulating a petition to put a proposal for a $7.75 minimum on the primary election ballot in February. Separately, state officials are considering a $6.80 minimum for all of Wisconsin, which now adheres to the federal law.
 The opposition to increasing minimum wages comes mainly from small businesses, particularly restaurants and hotels. They have been the biggest opponents of Senator Edward M. Kennedy's various attempts to have Congress increase the federal minimum by $1.50, to $6.65 an hour, in two equal steps over two years. When he tried in July to attach this proposal to another Senate bill, the Republican leadership yanked the entire bill from consideration. 
 NO one opposed to an increase argues that $5.15 an hour is adequate to keep body and soul together. It is not. The argument instead is that employers will not pay unskilled workers any more than the minimum. The problem with that argument is that employers are increasingly doing so. The evidence is in the statistics.
 Back in 1981, when annual increases in the federal minimum wage abruptly halted under President Ronald Reagan, 15.1 percent of the nation's wage and salary workers earned no more than the minimum, Labor Department data show. That had fallen to 5.1 percent when the next increase, in two stages, brought the minimum to $4.15 in 1991. Eleven years later and 90 cents higher, only 3 percent of all wage and salary workers earn no more than the minimum. The majority of that 3 percent are adults, not teenagers picking up pocket money. 
 The point of a government-mandated minimum wage is to ensure that no one is impoverished on the job. Employers are recognizing the absurdity of paying only $5.15 an hour, and in the absence of congressional action, cities are joining states in trying to fix the problem.

 CORRECTION:
The Economic View column last Sunday, about state and local increases in the minimum wage, referred incompletely to states that have a higher minimum than California, where the hourly figure rose to $6.75 last year. In addition to Alaska ($7.15), there are three: Washington ($7.01) and Oregon and Connecticut (both $6.90).

Guarding the College Savings Account

BYLINE:  By James Schembari; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: jimschem@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I'M glad I'm not in my daughter Marian's shoes. She has just started her junior year of high school, and this is when the march to college becomes a sprint. Marian, 16, has set her sights on schools in New Haven and New York, so she has loaded herself down with honors and advanced placement classes, refuses to cut back her extracurricular activities and has hung on to her part-time summer job to fatten up her savings account.
 It's a lot of work for her, but I'm not off the hook either. I've got to start pulling together the money I've set aside to pay for college. I have been saving since she was a little girl and have been relieved to know that if she did get into Yale, I could pay for it. 
 That is, I could pay for it now. If the stock market were to take another tumble in the two years before she is a freshman, I would be in serious trouble because most of my investments are in individual stocks or stock funds. It is time for me to get the money out of there. Actually, financial planners say, I should have already started doing that.
 "The stock market is the best way to accumulate wealth; it is not the place to be for a short period of time,"' said Scott Kays, president of the Kays Financial Advisory Corporation in Atlanta. "You don't want to tell a kid that 'we can't send you to college because of the downturn in the stock market.' So you want that money set aside in something secure."
 According to Mr. Kays, I'm way off schedule. He said parents should start protecting college money five years ahead. That means having the money for your child's freshman year safe and sound when she is 13, with money for all four years set aside by the time she is 17. He suggested putting the money in low-risk investments like certificates of deposit, short-term bond funds or money market funds. Taking on more risk to get a bit more return, he added, isn't worth it. "Safety is paramount at this point," he said.
 Philip C. Johnson, a financial planner in Clifton Park, N.Y., has the same philosophy, but he suggested a shorter time frame. 
 "You need a three-year comfort zone," he said. "Beyond that, look for growth with a growth fund or a balanced fund. When the horizon is more than three years, you have to take inflation into account, especially college inflation."
 Ed Kowalski, 50, a legal researcher in Commack, N.Y., didn't move money until about six months before his son, Daniel, 19, began college. For his daughter, Amy, 16, Mr. Kowalski started moving money last year.
 "If the market were to go down, I'm not comfortable with that risk," he said. "I don't have money to take from elsewhere waiting for the market to come back."
 Within the last month, Russell K. Schlecht, 47, of Marietta, Ga., an environmental consultant, put money into a bond fund to pay for the freshman year of his daughter, Katie, 15. Last fall, Dr. Donald R. Lurye, 50, of Evansville, Ind., put money into a college savings program called a 529 plan for his daughter, Jessica, 16. These plans, operated by the states, offer certain tax benefits.
 "We knew it was time to think more of preservation and less in terms of looking for big gains the last two to three years before college," Dr. Lurye said. "We thought it was time to accept that we had come as far as we were going to. It was too close to the beginning of college to take on a lot of investment risk."
 It seems a lot to expect parents to not only have the wherewithal to save a stunning amount of money for their children's college, but to also know when to cash in. I managed the first part but have messed up with the second.
 There is a way for parents like me to catch up, Mr. Kays said. He suggested turning the investment strategy of dollar-cost averaging on its head. Instead of buying stocks every month at different prices to spread out the risk, parents can sell some stock every month until they've caught up. Then they can get back on the five-year schedule.
 Of course, nothing is simple when it comes to college money. In my case, most of the money is in stocks that have greatly appreciated over the years, so I'm going to be hit with a huge capital gains tax. 
 Mr. Johnson says there is a way out of that, too. I can reduce the tax by giving my daughter some of the stock and letting her sell it, because her tax rate will be lower. 
 This move, however, could reduce her eligibility for financial aid, so I would have to be careful. Raymond D. Loewe, president of College Money, a consulting firm in Marlton, N.J., said that I should do that only if I'm sure she wouldn't qualify for aid. Otherwise, he said, I should hold onto the stocks instead and take out a Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students, a federal loan that now has a rate of 4.22 percent, though it can change every year.
 None of those options look pretty. And with three sons coming up behind Marian, I get to do this again, again and then again. My eldest son, Antonio, is now 13, so maybe I should be pulling out money for his freshman year right now.
 Frankly, life from my daughter's perspective is starting to look peaceful.

On His Shoulders,A Graying Japan

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: Tokyo 

 BODY:
YOU would never know by looking at Noboru Terada that he helps manage the world's largest pension fund. Diminutive, graying and no-nonsense, he looks more like an ordinary middle manager than someone in charge of 31.6 trillion yen (about $283 billion).
 Mr. Terada, the executive investment officer of the Government Pension Investment Fund, is arguably Japan's most influential investor, overseeing the nation's vast retirementpiggy bank. Largely hidden from the public, he also has one of the most difficult jobs in Japan: raising investment returns to keep the national pension system from collapsing. 
 After years of rising payouts, interest rates near zero and falling stock prices, Japan's pension plans are deeply in the red. Faith in the system is so weak that a staggering 37 percent of self-employed workers do not pay their premiums, which could leave them without benefits. Yet the government must prepare for waves of baby boomers nearing retirement. Politicians, reluctant to alienate voters, have only trimmed benefits and nudged premiums higher. 
 Though the United States and other countries face similar demographic problems, Japan's pension situation is one of the worst cases because of the size of the deficits and the graying of the population. And while many other countries have had an inflow of younger immigrants, who have been replenishing tax rolls and pension plans, Japan has not. 
 The hesitancy of policy makers in Japan to find solutions to these immense problems has put the spotlight on Mr. Terada. Under pressure to generate large-enough profits to offset the yawning gap in the plan's budget, he has imported new investment techniques, like indexing, and broken with the local custom by rewarding better-performing -- not better-connected -- investment managers. 
 By modernizing Japan's pension system, he hopes to increase returns and reassure the public.
 "Many people wonder about the direction of the pension system, but we want them to have confidence," said Mr. Terada, who carries stacks of papers like an absent-minded professor. "The aging society is a very significant problem we have to face. If we can enhance our returns, the burden on the Japanese people will be reduced."
 Many of Mr. Terada's tactics were introduced decades ago in the United States. But they have shaken Japan's trust banks and life insurers, whose cozy relations with the government long protected them from competition. They have also been a boon for foreign fund managers who specialize in quantitative products like enhanced indexing, which promises to outperform an index with little extra risk or cost. 
 His performance-based agenda is groundbreaking in Japan, especially in a public organization. 
 Mr. Terada, who is 67 and has worked in the field for more than three decades, started his career at Nomura Securities, Japan's largest broker. In the mid-1960's, he moved to the company's research arm, the Nomura Research Institute. During that time, he spent a year at the University of Chicago's Center for Research in Security Prices, where he learned the latest methods of evaluating risk and maximizing returns.
 Since then, he has focused on pension funds and Japan's looming demographic problems. Through Mr. Terada's growing connections overseas, he introduced to Japan the ways to measure volatility called beta coefficients. Writing in journals, he explained the latest innovations incorporated into the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa, of the United States to fund managers who knew little about fiduciary responsibility.
 "I was deeply influenced by his papers in the 1970's," said Takahide Mizuno, now the chief investment officer at the Nomura Asset Management Company. "Terada was the first person to introduce modern portfolio theory into Japan."
 STILL, with Japan's stock market and economy booming in the 1980's, few people paid attention to Mr. Terada's warnings, even after he took on a more prominent role as director of the Pension Fund Association. But in the 1990's, as stock prices and interest rates tumbled and the financial industry was deregulated, local fund managers had to heed his warnings to improve or lose out to foreigners and their newfangled investment methods.
 "Terada's like Nostradamus: whatever he said has come true," said Tomomi Yano, executive managing director of the Pension Fund Association. "Most fund managers only care about getting their contracts renewed. But Terada has consistently been able to see the future."
 Mr. Terada took his vision to an even bigger audience in April 2001. That was when the government broke up Nempuku, the Government Pension Investment Fund's predecessor, which was tightly controlled by the Finance Ministry. With the government's debt exploding and the pension plan's finances in disarray, policy makers needed to raise returns or face a financial catastrophe.
 So they created the pension investment fund and gave it the ability to invest as it liked, freeing it from the strict guidelines that limited Nempuku's creativity -- and returns. Mr. Terada took this mandate to heart. Careful study had shown him that passively managed funds that tracked indexes not only charged lower administrative fees, but also outperformed the funds that actively picked stocks and bonds.
 Armed with that knowledge, the Government Pension Investment Fund shifted trillions of yen into passive funds. More than 70 percent of its investments in Japanese stocks are now managed this way, nearly three times as many as in 2000. Nearly 80 percent of the fund's money in foreign stocks and bonds is managed this way as well.
 The results were immediate. The fund cut the amount of management fees it paid by 57 percent, to $153 million, in just two years.
 Under Mr. Terada, the Government Pension Investment Fund also threw open the process for choosing and evaluating fund managers. Fund mandates are now solicited online, and the results are posted on the pension investment fund's Web site. The performance of each money manager is ranked and compared with the market average; those numbers are also available online. The site even lists the amount of fees it pays to each investment manager.
 The Government Pension Investment Fund "has set the trend for the whole market when it comes to corporate governance and returns," said Mark J. Lazberger, president and chief executive of State Street Japan, which has $30 billion of assets under management in Japan. 
 "Terada's one of the very few people bringing about change in the fund management industry," he added.
 While foreigners celebrated the more liberal disclosure policy, the local asset managers who had been chosen primarily for their relationship to Japan's powerful banks and their business partners were less pleased. "There used to be a very under-the-table approach to why someone was hired and fired," said one Japanese asset manager with decades of experience in the industry.
 In a very un-Japanese way, the clear-cut, public benchmarks allowed the pension investment fund to cut the number of asset managers, to 70 from 91 last year alone. Not all of those let go were Japanese; foreign investment advisers were dumped, too. But Japanese firms with less sophisticated skills were hit hardest.
 "Japanese investment firms are not as competitive," said Mr. Terada, who has publicly chastised Japanese fund managers for failing to give up their old business practices. "They don't compete on returns and new investments. They rely on their strong relationships with their "keiretsu,"' or corporate groups. 
 Mr. Terada's forthrightness has not gone unnoticed. To increase returns, the Government Pension Investment Fund has increased the amount it invests in equities and in assets overseas. Unfortunately, the Nikkei 225 slid about 40 percent in the two years after April 2001. The fund's stock portfolio, domestic and foreign, lost 3.5 trillion yen ($31 billion) in the year that ended in March 2003. Politicians were livid and took aim at Mr. Terada's tactics. 
 Despite the red ink and bad blood, the fund's losses were largely in line with public funds outside Japan, according to Wilshire Associates' Trust Universe Comparison Service.
 Moreover, the pension investment fund's strategy of buying stocks in a falling market turned out to be shrewd: the Nikkei 225 has risen 35 percent since April. Instead of being concerned about individual stocks and industries, Mr. Terada pays attention to producing needed returns. To that end, he is studying whether to invest in real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments. 
 The question is not only whether Mr. Terada's moves can produce the return of 4.5 percent that is the target of the pension investment fund, but also whether they will be enough to cover the decline in workers' contributions and the rising payouts that retirees demand. Policy makers have endlessly debated the issues, and few of the proposed solutions are expected to solve the problems. 
 "The Koizumi cabinet has a time bomb -- the national pension plan -- and no one wants to touch it," said Kunji Okue, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, referring to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. "If I were Terada, I wouldn't take that job."
 Mr. Okue estimates that the pension investment fund will run cumulative deficits worth 27 trillion yen over the next five years because interest rates are so low. That would force the government to dig deeper into the fund's reserves to meet its pension obligations. That may not come about, of course, if Japan's stock market and bond yields keep rising and the economy truly recovers.
 REGARDLESS, the investment fund will play an increasingly prominent role in the world's financial markets in coming years. 
 The pension investment fund is expected to manage 97.2 trillion yen ($870 billion), more than the economy of Canada, by March 2009. Of that pool, 11.6 trillion yen ($103 billion ) will be invested in foreign stock markets. 
 That should make the fund an even more formidable player on Wall Street, and in other major markets, and make Mr. Terada's policies that much more relevant to the world beyond Japan.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK OBSERVED; 
Eight Reasons New York Is Better

BYLINE:  By JOE QUEENAN; Joe Queenan is the author, most recently, of "True Believers: The Tragic Inner Life of Sports Fans."

 BODY:
A COUPLE of summers ago, I dragged myself into a downtown Pittsburgh restaurant at 6 a.m. and was immediately informed by a belligerent waiter that there were 130 things to do in Pittsburgh and that I would be ill-advised not to do all of them.
 As my teenage son and I gamely tried to eat our meal in peace, Randy the Waiter and Part-Time Artiste hectored us about the Andy Warhol Museum. He also insisted that we visit funky, bohemian Squirrel Hill, spend some time at the Carnegie Mellon Museum and ride Pittsburgh's demure, safe, clean subway system. 
 Finally, he demanded to know if our travels would take us to the Pittsburgh Pirates' fabulous new stadium in this resilient, thoroughly livable, immensely charming, unjustifiably neglected western Pennsylvania municipality. 
Told that we were from New York, where a certain measure of Andy Warhol fatigue had set in decades ago, Randy snapped: "Oh. Well, you're the Big Apple, and we're the Little Apple. But there's nothing you have in New York that we don't have in Pittsburgh."
"Yes, there is," I replied. "We have eight Vermeers. There are only 34 Vermeers in the entire world. We have eight of them, and you don't have any. Now, could we have some more coffee?"
I mention this incident not because I enjoy pulling rank on provincial wait staff, but because in recent times, New York has come in for a good deal of pummeling from the misguided Podunkian classes. And now that the latest facts and figures are in, the news is even worse than we had suspected.
Recently, I read a story about a dubious "creativity index" reporting that New York is now the ninth-most-creative city in the United States, trailing not only fussy, self-involved San Francisco and Seattle, but such ghastly localities as Houston and Raleigh-Durham. Indeed, in terms of the percentage of inhabitants paid to think for a living, New York is only one slot ahead of Dallas, a city which, incidentally, has no Vermeers. The creativity index was devised by Richard Florida, a professor of regional economic development at Carnegie Mellon University. Carnegie Mellon is based in Vermeerless Pittsburgh.
Declining creativity isn't the only problem Gotham faces. Last year, The New York Times reported that New Yorkers suffer some of the worst commutes in the entire country, actually spending more time getting to work than people in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the fifth annual Forbes rankings of Best Places for Business and Careers this year ranked New York a dismal 94th, trailing Oklahoma City by 76 slots, and also ceding pride of place to Hamilton, Ohio (38) and Allentown, Pa. (66). None of theseplaces have any Vermeers, either.
Several years ago, GQ magazine capriciously required me to visit Money magazine's most livable American city and see how it compared with New York. The winner that year was faceless, amorphous Raleigh-Durham, a series of interlocking suburbs masquerading as a city. The perfect example of the soulless abstractions described by James Howard Kunstler in his book "The Geography of Nowhere," Raleigh-Durham had no focal point, no civic epicenter, no cultural fulcrum. And it certainly didn't have any Vermeers.
When statisticians, academics, economists, city fathers and waiters set out to prove why Odessa, Tex., is a better place to work than New York, they invariably focus on readily quantifiable data like jobs, hospital beds, teacher-student ratios, homicides. What they always leave out is the Vermeer Quotient: the unquantifiable and ineffable psychological euphoria derived from living in a city that has eight more Vermeers than Bakersfield, Calif. And that's without even going into the Rembrandts.
YES, it is true that residents of the New York area wake up every morning and turn on their radios to find out if the bridges to Manhattan are still standing. This is certainly no treat. But at least they do so knowing that if the bridges are still standing they can go across them and look at the Vermeers. Or the van Goghs. Or the Yankees. In Raleigh, if the bridges are still standing, the only thing you can do is go across them to Durham.
While researching that GQ article, I noticed that Money magazine gave both Stamford, Conn., and New York a grade of 100 in the arts and culture category: New York because it had all the great art and Stamford because people could jump on the train into the city to see it. This seemed a bit like giving New York and Stamford an equal ranking in the golf course category, since people from the South Bronx and Stamford were both within easy striking distance of the lush fairways in Greenwich.
Studying the persuasively inane rankings, compiled by New York-based journalists who would tear out their eyes rather than move to Raleigh-Durham, it also occurred to me that if Sioux Falls, S.D., could somehow persuade just one more entrepreneur to open up an art gallery specializing in Inuit artifacts, it might be able to compete with such traditional Money-sanctified municipalities as Rochester, Minn., and Provo, Utah, and perhaps even wrest away the top ranking from Raleigh-Durham. 
In short, all of these surveys and studies and charts and statistics are cunning mechanisms to prove something that nobody really believes: that San Diego and Houston have a larger class of creative people than New York, or that Albany is a better place to work than Gotham. Incidentally, San Diego and Albany have no Vermeers, though they may have a few LeRoy Neimans.
About two years ago, my daughter and I had a 45-minute wait between "Chicago" and catching our train to Tarrytown, so we stopped by the Museum of Modern Art to see Picasso's "Demoiselles d'Avignon," the painting that gave birth to, or at the very least midwifed, modern art. This was one of those unexpectedly exhilarating moments that reminded me why I had come from Philadelphia to New York in the first place: because you could look at the single most revolutionary painting of the 20th century while you were killing time. You cannot do that in Salem, Ore., or Anchorage, Alaska. With all due respect.
In the end, this brings us back to all those dodgy statistics and cunning charts and seemingly irrefutable studies providing unassailable evidence that New York is less livable, less cerebral and less prosperous than San Diego or Appleton, Wis. Yes, the numbers look good. And the logic seems sound. But just because you can prove something doesn't mean it's true.

HEADLINE: I Dream of Royalties 

BYLINE:  ByGARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
A CLUTCH of suited dignitaries, standing beneath a makeshift thatched roof of dried palm fronds, don floppy white sailor caps on cue as a band blares the "Gilligan's Island" theme song. One of them, Kenny C. Guinn, the governor of Nevada, is struggling to retain his dignity as he shares a spotlight with Gilligan, the Professor and Mary Ann -- the actors Bob Denver, Russell Johnson and Dawn Wells -- during the opening ceremony of the gambling industry's big annual trade show, held here earlier this month. 
 The three castaways were among a cavalcade of celebrities -- some faded or forgotten -- who turned out at the cavernous Las Vegas Convention Center to help sell slot machines created in their images. 
 The schedule of appearances at the booth of International Game Technologies, a slot machine company in Reno, Nev., seemed as if it were lifted from Nick at Nite. Appearing after Gilligan and friends was Jeannie (Barbara Eden), who posed next to an "I Dream of Jeannie Magic Spin" slot machine. 
Jethro followed Jeannie. Max Baer Jr., dressed in a black track suit, a fanny pack and tinted glasses, was there to promote the third in a series of "Beverly Hillbillies" theme machines sold by I.G.T. Radar (Gary Burghoff), Laverne (Penny Marshall) and Shirley (Cindy Williams) also made star turns. So did Dick Clark and Jim Lange, who once was host of "The Dating Game" and now does the same on an I.G.T. creation bearing that name.
Slot machines account for more than 70 percent of casino revenue in the United States, according to William Eadington, an economist at the University of Nevada at Reno. And the most profitable machines, slot makers have discovered in recent years, are those that tap into the recognizable and nostalgic. The manufacturers are spilling tens of millions of dollars licensing such brands, hoping that they will help their machines stand out in the crowd of games clamoring for gamblers' attention. 
In the old days, the best that some of yesterday's celebrities might hope for was a call from the producer of "Hollywood Squares" or "The Match Game" -- both of which have been licensed by the slot maker WMS Gaming, a unit of WMS Industries in Waukegan, Ill. -- to supplement their Screen Actors Guild pensions. But now they might be invited to sell their names, voices and images of their former selves for use on devices that more often resemble video games -- with television-style monitors, stereo speakers and complex bonus rounds bracketed by brief TV clips -- than traditional spinning-reel slot machines. A TV show's creators and stars (or their heirs) are partners who typically receive a payment based on a daily census of the number of their machines on casino floors.
"Basically, in the last few years the makers of these devices have gone and licensed everything under the sun," said Eugene M. Christiansen, a gambling industry analyst in New York and chief executive of Christiansen Capital Advisors. "It's changed the slot business." 
The licensing trend has shifted the balance of power in the industry. The slot world's undisputed leader is I.G.T., which boasts around a 70 percent share of the United States slot market, according to Jeffrey M. Martin, a senior research analyst at Roth Capital Partners in Newport Beach, Calif. Since January 2000, the company's stock has climbed fivefold -- in no small part, analysts say, because of the company's partnership with the likes of Jeannie and Jethro. At $9.85 billion, I.G.T.'s market capitalization is now nine times that of its nearest slot-machine rival, the Bally Gaming unit of the Alliance Gaming Corporation. 
More significantly, those analysts said, the licensing trend has altered the relationship between manufacturers and casinos. The intellectual-property costs are typically so enormous for these machines, and the physical design so elaborate, that they are not sold to casinos but leased to them based on a revenue-sharing model. The slot makers and licensers now have a hand in a casino's pocket -- much to the chagrin of the casinos.
"If a dollar walks into our property, the question is: Do I get that dollar, or do I have to give 40 cents up?" said Jason Tate, the director of slot operations at the Luxor Las Vegas. Mr. Tate said many slot players might stop coming to his casino if the Luxor did not offer these leased games.

The 'Wheel' Factor
The beginning is simple to mark. A slot machine based on the game show "Wheel of Fortune," and featuring a spinning-wheel bonus round, made its debut in 1996. 
Almost immediately, the machine gained a disproportionate share of the casino floor -- and has since proved to be a hit like no machine before or since. The familiar sound of an audience chanting "Wheel! Of! Fortune!" now blares from machines in casinos around the country, and updated versions even include the voices and images of Pat Sajak and Vanna White.
Slot managers typically evaluate the machines on their floors in terms of win per day: coins in, minus money paid out. A former I.G.T. executive who asked not to be identified said that each "Wheel of Fortune" machine generates an average daily win of at least $300. There are roughly 12,000 "Wheel" machines on casino floors, according to I.G.T. That would mean that they generate at least $3.6 million a day, or $1.3 billion a year.
"Before the 'Wheel of Fortune,' the theming of slot machines was generic -- cherries, lemons, pots of gold, four-leaf clovers," Mr. Christiansen said. "Stuff in the public domain that didn't cost any money to use. But that changed as soon as 'Wheel of Fortune' hit. Consumers suddenly were demanding something more than cherries and lemons."
That meant greater development costs for slot makers, but also greater profits. A slot machine typically sells for around $10,000, adding maybe $4,000 in profit to the company's bottom line, I.G.T. executives said. By contrast, a successful revenue-sharing machine can provide a steady stream of cash, adding as much as $16,000 a year to the bottom line.
"We're not trying to replicate a game show or TV show so much as create a deep emotional connection between the player and these shows they've come to love," said Joe Kaminkow, the vice president for game design at I.G.T.
Under Mr. Kaminkow, I.G.T. has doubled, to 28,000, the number of machines -- known in the industry as boxes -- that give the company a share of the revenue they reap for the casino. Revenue from such arrangements soared to $916 million in 2002 from $401 million in 2000. That figure should easily top $1 billion this year, according to a Goldman Sachs research report released in mid-September.
All told, I.G.T. now has at least 62 licensed games, said Nancy King, who has overseen the company's licensing program for the last four years. "Every licenser calls me to check on how many boxes they have out there," Ms. King said. One, she said, calls faithfully each week.

Who's Pursuing Whom?
At first, licensers were more likely to say no when approached by I.G.T. In the first couple of years after the "Wheel of Fortune" machine was introduced, said Jean Venneman, the company's marketing director, those rejecting I.G.T. included several soap operas, an assortment of country singers and Frank Sinatra. 
Today, though, at least as many agents and lawyers knock on I.G.T.'s door to pitch a personality as I.G.T. pursues. "We've turned down hundreds of titles in the last couple of years," Mr. Kaminkow said. 
According to I.G.T. executives, the agent representing the estate of Lucille Ball originally told Mr. Kaminkow that there was no way that Ms. Ball's survivors would ever go for a slot deal -- until he floated the possibility of a $10 million deal. Today, there are several Lucy-theme machines, with more coming, including "Lucy's Grape Stomp" and "Lucy's Chocolate Factory." The guaranteed payment ended up being far less than $10 million, Mr. Kaminkow said.
Bruce Bronn, president and chief executive of Unforgettable Licensing, in Northbrook, Ill., represents the family of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. Mr. Bronn would not confirm or deny dollar figures, but he acknowledged that he initially told Mr. Kaminkow "absolutely not" when he first broached the idea of a Lucy slot machine.
"In the end, the money wasn't the important thing for the family," Mr. Bronn said. "The estate's biggest concern was that these games be respectful to the property, to the 'I Love Lucy' show."
There is now a pair of Frank Sinatra machines as well. Nine months after Mr. Sinatra's death, Mr. Kaminkow says, I.G.T. came to terms with the singer's heirs.
Mr. Sinatra was aware that family members were talking about a slot machine that would carry his image, said Robert A. Finkelstein, a lawyer representing the Sinatra family, but the process was lengthy because of the interest expressed by several manufacturers.
The joke inside I.G.T. is that the company rarely approaches celebrities until they are well past their prime -- and therefore affordable. "Once you've hit your decline, we're all over you," cracked Lance Peterson, an I.G.T. game designer who figures he has written more than three dozen scripts for celebrities lending voices to machines. 
Most deals do not approach the size of those for a Lucy or a Sinatra. An executive at Warner Brothers, which retains the rights to "Gilligan's Island," described his company's arrangement with I.G.T. as a "fun deal but not a lucrative one," with a guarantee of less than $1 million over the life of the contract.
Anthony N. Cabot, a lawyer at Lionel Sawyer & Collins, which is based in Las Vegas, has represented individuals who have cut deals with slot-machine makers. Mr. Cabot said $100,000 "is a typical number as an upfront payment for use of a name or brand," with an additional $500 to $1,000 a machine per year. 
"At that rate, placing 1,000 machines would mean $500,000 to $1 million, minus the upfront guarantee," he explained. Each deal also grants a celebrity final rights of approval over his or her depiction in the game, Ms. King said.
It is likely that the deal Mr. Baer signed with I.G.T. is more generous than that. In 1991, he licensed from CBS the rights to "The Beverly Hillbillies" for any gambling-related activity. As a result, he has received the lion's share of the residuals from the three types of slot machines that already carry the "Beverly Hillbillies" theme. Mr. Baer declined to say how much he is earning from his multigame deal with I.G.T., but he did say that "I could live for another 2,000 years and not have to work another day."

From Li'l Abner to Don Ho
Slot floor managers grouse about licensed machines' cost, just as they complain about games with themes that have no apparent connection to gambling. The "Beverly Hillbillies" were common folks who struck it rich, but there is no apparent link between "Gilligan's Island" and gambling, or even money. In the last couple of years, Mr. Kaminkow of I.G.T. has even licensed products like Tabasco and Spam, and counterparts at Bally have a deal for an "S & H Green Stamps" machine.
"I'm waiting for the Old Spice game," said Bruce C. Rowe, who was vice president in charge of slot operations for Harrah's Entertainment until earlier this month and is now a consultant based in Henderson, Nev. "It's gotten totally out of control."
Mr. Rowe made his comments at the trade show, called the Global Gaming Expo, during a breakout session about the changing relationship between casinos and slot-machine makers. The most outspoken of the panelists, he advised casino executives to be judicious in accepting leased games -- and appealed to their sense of the bottom line. 
He says casinos should stick mainly to the standard practice: buying nonlicensed machines outright and then keeping them fresh by using conversion kits that can change the game's theme from, say, "Rich Little Piggies" to "Fairy's Fortune." A typical, conventional machine costs a casino $11 a day over five years, he said. That accounts for the purchase price of roughly $10,000, and $2,000 or so for each of several conversion kits, which include new computer chips and glass. By contrast, the typical revenue-sharing game costs a casino $75 a day, Mr. Rowe said.
Frank Neborsky, who oversees the more than 6,000 slot machines on the floor of Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, figures that his casino pays more than $15 million to slot makers each year to carry these licensed games -- but that the machines are worth the extra cost. "No doubt some of these fees are very expensive," Mr. Neborksy said, but he also expects the licensed games to earn at least twice as much as the casino average. The advantage for casino operators is that the slot makers assume all the risk on the licensed machines; by all accounts, slot floor directors are never shy about giving the boot, even after just a few weeks, to games that fail to earn considerably more than their cheaper counterparts.
Typically, slot makers take a 20 percent cut of a casino's winnings on a leased machine, but the figure can be higher for some games, slot makers say. The Mohegan opts for a fixed daily fee on these machines, Mr. Neborsky says, that can run as high as $75 a machine.
"The manufacturers raise the bar on these games when they want to take up valuable real estate on our floor," he said. "They have to come to our floor with high-quality product" -- and keep coming back with more once the current crop shows a falloff in earnings.
Certainly, the slot makers are doing all they can to produce a steady flow of licensed games. Bally Gaming unveiled around 20 licensed machines at the trade show, including games based on Li'l Abner, Felix the Cat and the Lone Ranger. 
Bally also offered games based on a range of "Saturday Night Live" bits, including "Wayne's World," the Coneheads and the Blues Brothers. Those who sign off on the deals include the network, NBC, as well as the production company and the relevant actors.
The WMS Gaming booth included more than a dozen licensed games, including "Don Ho's Kahuna Kash" and several based on the Monopoly board game. "Consumers want comfort; they want security," said the company's president and chief executive, Brian R. Gamache. "They want a gaming experience with brands they know and trust." 
Then there are the offerings by relative newcomers to the slot world, like the Mikohn Gaming Corporation and Shuffle Master Inc., two companies that exclusively sell revenue-sharing games. Among Shuffle Master's new games were "Sydney Omarr's Horoscope" and "Marvel Heroes and Villains," while Mikohn had new slots featuring the smiling face of the game-show host Wink Martindale and several more based on familiar games like Trivial Pursuit and Clue.
"These games add to the bigness and the glitz and the sizzle of the casino floor," said Mickey Roemer, Bally's senior vice president for game development. "Operators must agree with that or they wouldn't keep signing deals to carry these kinds of games."
I.G.T., however, continues to dominate a North American market that Mr. Martin, the analyst at Roth Capital, places at 700,000 to 750,000 machines. The company recently put the finishing touches on a studio that it says cost around $1 million -- including a $150,000 high-definition camera and a motion capture system to perform the kind of animation seen on sports video games.
"The companies we bought the equipment from were laughing at us," said Anthony J. Baerlocher, I.G.T.'s director for product development. "They were like, 'You're making little three- and five-second clips that run on a slot machine.' This is equipment they use for a major motion picture." 
Rarely does a company want to include current video clips of a star in one of its games. ("The people we work with are usually too past their prime for video," said Mr. Peterson, the I.G.T. designer.) But it happens occasionally, as when the comedian Drew Carey went to Reno during the summer to be filmed so his image and voice could enliven a new "Big Balls of Cash" video game.
Chuck Mathewson, the I.G.T. chairman, allows that his company has probably gone overboard. "There's probably too much of it out right now," Mr. Mathewson said. "But you really can't stop something like that." 
I.G.T. released 150 new titles at the show, roughly half of them based on licensing deals. Among the licensed ones were a pair of Elizabeth Taylor "Dazzling Diamonds" games, as well as a "Star Wars" game -- based on the costliest licensing deal I.G.T. has ever entered, according to Mr. Baerlocher.
Apparently Mr. Kaminkow is not satisfied pitching his machines to the typical over-50 slot player.
"I want people in their 30's and 40's to walk into a casino and hear, 'Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope.' And your hands go into your pocket," Mr. Kaminkow said. "I'm sure of it."

HEADLINE: The World; 
For Americans, It's French Sissies Versus German He-Men

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
IT was on display again last week, that old double standard. On camera, Germany's chancellor got a muscular handshake from America's president and a meeting that let bygones be bygones. France's president got the official cold shoulder and columnists' heated denunciations.
 Yet France and Germany had taken the same position on the Bush administration's policies in Iraq. Both were offering to help train Iraqi security forces, but not to send soldiers. Both argued that only accelerated Iraqi sovereignty and a larger United Nations role could secure peace. 
 Apparently, it sounded different in French. Somehow, to American ears, it always does. And at this point in strained trans-Atlantic relations, an obvious explanation comes to mind: in the American imagination, France is a woman, and Germany is just another guy.
The French themselves depict La Belle France as a bare-breasted "Marianne" on the barricades. They export high fashion, cosmetics, fine food -- delicacies traditionally linked to a woman's pleasure, if not her boudoir. And French has always been Hollywood's language of love.
Germany, meanwhile, is the Fatherland, its spike helmets retooled into the sleek insignia of cars like the Mercedes and BMW. It also exports heavy machinery and strong beer -- products linked to manliness. And notwithstanding Goethe, Schiller and Franka Potente, German is Hollywood's language of war, barked to the beat of combat boots in half a century of movies.
Such images simply overpower facts that do not fit the picture -- like decades of German pacifism and French militarism since World War II. So what if France was fighting in Vietnam, Algeria and Africa, and deploying a force of 36,000 troops around the world, while Germans held peace vigils and invented Berlin's Love Parade. For Americans, it seems, World War II permanently inoculated Germans against "the wimp factor" and branded the French indelibly as sissies.
Sure, both countries were dubbed members of the "Axis of Weasel" and dissed as Old Europe for opposing the war in Iraq. But no one poured schnapps down the toilet, renamed sauerkraut or made prime-time jokes denigrating German manhood. Only France can evoke that kind of frat-boy frenzy.
"It's in the way we view both countries," said Irwin M. Wall, a historian of French-American relations. "We view Germany as producing iron and steel, and we view France as producing perfume and haute couture. You'll never get America out of this stereotype that France is a feminine country."
Of course, Mr. Wall added, when Secretary of State Colin L. Powell refers to America and France as having been in marriage counseling for 225 years, "you know darn well he means we're the male partner."
American officials have long used sexist stereotyping as diplomatic strategy. Franklin Roosevelt once declared that Charles de Gaulle knew no more about economics "than a woman knows about a carburetor." In 1953, Life magazine likened the French government to "a big can-can chorus" and France itself to a showgirl slipping a billion-dollar bill's worth of American aid into her stocking.
Frank Costigliola, a historian at the University of Connecticut, gives many such examples in his book "France and the United States: The Cold Alliance Since World War II." He contends that giving France negative "feminine" traits has always served to delegitimize French points of view.
"Associated with France as a woman is France as hysterical, or France as crazy," he said. "It really is a knee-jerk reaction."
Robert O. Paxton, an emeritus professor of history at Columbia University, agreed. "It's an American stereotype and an American strategy," he stressed. "There are elements in our culture that the Bush people can play on in stereotyping France as feminine."
The paradox, added Mr. Paxton, the author of "Vichy France," is that the French hold a mirror stereotype about America. "They believe the American male has been completely emasculated, and American women rule the roost."
Others use similar categories to explain why France, not Germany, rubs Americans so raw. "I haven't used male and female, but I've used cat countries and dog countries," said Walter Russell Mead, the author of "Special Providence: American Foreign Policy and How It Changed the World."
Mr. Mead sees France as a cat country, while Germany -- like America and Britain -- is a dog country, "the underdog baring its throat."
To the film critic Molly Haskell, it seems that France has been cast as the femme fatale, "the seductress who's leading all Europe away from us."
"It's this insidious evil woman," she continued, "and the others are probably good guys who are just being led astray."
What doesn't fit that script is forgotten -- like Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's pre-emptive election promise that Germany would not take part in a war against Saddam Hussein even if the United Nations authorized it. Or the fact that in his youth, President Jacques Chirac of France made banana splits at Howard Johnson's in the United States before serving as a French Army officer.
"The Germans are getting away with it because we are so eager to tar and feather France," said Ann Douglas, a cultural historian at Columbia University and the author of "The Feminization of American Culture." "The constant need to denigrate France -- and feminization has always been the way to go -- is because France has always maintained a separate voice."
A female France, seen as the bastion of sensual pleasure and elite cultural refinement, is a made-to-order enemy for the Texan in the White House, Ms. Douglas contended. With a sagging American economy, and the fear of appearing weak that often underlies aggressive masculinity, she said, French-bashing has new political appeal. "I think George Bush is carrying around a tremendous amount of anger," Ms. Douglas added, "and a lot of men are tapping into that."
But under Bill Clinton, reflexive animosity also flowed between Washington and Paris, recalled Charles A. Kupchan, who was a security adviser on Europe in the Clinton years. "When the French sent dispatches about operations in Kosovo, people would just throw them away," he said. "The attitude was, if it's from France, it must be to undermine American power."
Still, said Mr. Kupchan, now a professor of international affairs at Georgetown University: "Deep down inside, Americans feel deeper affinity for France than Germany. If France is female, there's also an attraction, a lure, a romance."
Maybe that's the rub. "The well-built iron-pumping male is being laughed at, or poked fun at by the woman with attitude -- that resonates with me," Mr. Kupchan acknowledged. "It creates that mix of anger and indignation, that 'How dare you?' "

To the Editor:
 Re "Hangout for the Courtroom Crowd Succumbs to Economic Laws" (Sept. 21): Woe am I. About a month after my move to New York last year, I read about the last wooden phone booths in the city, including one (cherrywood, no less) at Giambone on Mulberry Street. 
 Visiting this particular booth was high on my to-do list. In spite of every intention, I never got there, often because I did not have the exact address with me when I found myself near Canal Street or Mulberry Street.
Now I read that Giambone has closed. My chance is gone. Carpe diem.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Good Economy. Bad Job Market. Huh?" (Economic View, Sept. 14), which discussed rising productivity amid weak demand in the economy: 
 We are at the beginning of a long-term trend that deserves serious policy discussion. We thought the billions of dollars of investment in telecommunications and Web-based technology would empower American workers to do their work from their beach houses. In fact, it enables people in other countries to do their jobs. 
 On the positive side, the Americaneconomy benefits. Americans enjoy increased quality in products and services even as prices remain flat. On the downside, American workers cannot compete when it comes to wages. 
 On balance, the trend is good for American shareholders but bad for American workers. What matters, however, is that the trend is unstoppable. It is likely to define American life over the next decade.

Study Finds 401(k)'s Remain Popular

BYLINE:  Compiled by Vivian Marino

 BODY:
The economy may be difficult and the stock market volatile, but a new study suggests that companies and their employees are not retreating from their financial commitments to their 401(k) plans. In fact, the study found that employers, over all, were increasing their contributions to the plans, and that more of them were providing investment advice for participating workers. 
 In a 401(k) plan, employees contribute part of their pay to the account, which is tax-deferred, while their companies often match a percentage of that contribution. 
 In its annual survey of defined-contribution plans, which include 401(k)'s, the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America found that 80.3 percent of eligible employees held balances in 401(k) plans in 2002, up from 78 percent in 2001. 
 Workers contributed 5.2 percent of their pay, on average, last year, off slightly from 5.3 percent in the previous year but still higher than the 5.1 percent rate in 1998. The average matching contribution from their companies, meanwhile, grew to 2.8 percent of pay in 2002 from 2.5 percent a year earlier.
 The number of funds offered in the plans also grew: nearly 81 percent of plans had at least 10 funds available, up from about 70 percent in 2001 and 62 percent in 2000. 
 The survey found that nearly 52 percent of the company plans offered advice to their participants, up from 41 percent in 2001 and 35 percent in 2000. 
 The study surveyed 1,046 plans -- 401(k) and profit-sharing plans. The results were released this month.

HEADLINE: States Moving to End Tribes' Tax-Free Sales 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: CHARLESTOWN, R.I., Sept. 23 

 BODY:
The sign on the tan box of a building on the Indian reservation here still says Narragansett Smoke Shop, and lashed to a tree out front is a sales pitch for Salem cigarettes at $31.99 a carton.
 But inside, the place has been transformed into the Narragansett Sovereignty Protection Headquarters. The only items for sale are two kinds of T-shirts: one proclaiming "Sovereignty" and the other with the slogan "Homeland Security. Fighting terrorism since 1492. In support of the Narragansett Tribe, July 14, 2003." 
 That was the date the Rhode Island State Police raided the smoke shop in a dispute over the Indians' insistence on selling tax-free cigarettes. The raid erupted into a scuffle between state troopers and tribal members, leaving eight people with minor injuries. Eight Indians were arrested, including the tribe's leader. 
The raid was an unusually pointed way to handle an issue that many states are facing, the refusal by Indian tribes to collect sales taxes on cigarettes and gasoline. Now Rhode Island and the Narragansetts are battling in court over whether the state has the right to collect those taxes or to send in police officers to enforce state law on Indian land.
State governments say tribal tax-free sales, in stores and on the Internet, deprive them of millions of dollars. Those losses have grown as financially struggling states raise cigarette taxes, driving some smokers to tribal stores. And with the deficit among the states projected to reach more than $50 billion in the next fiscal year, legislators and governors are increasingly trying to collect taxes from Indian businesses.
In New York, after a long history of sparring with tribes over taxes, the state won a victory in 1994 when the Supreme Court backed its right to collect taxes on sales to non-Indian consumers. But New York has never collected the taxes, and in 1997, under Gov. George E. Pataki, the state stopped trying after several tribes protested vehemently and blocked the New York State Thruway.
Now New York is poised to try to collect the tax, which officials say would bring in at least $64 million a year. The Legislature has ordered the Department of Taxation and Finance to draw up new regulations, with the intent of collecting taxes starting Dec. 1. Indians say they will resist and have threatened to sue.
In Maine, Gov. John Baldacci wants to prevent the Aroostook Band of Micmacs from opening tax-free tobacco shops. The Idaho legislature has been trying since January to collect tribal cigarette taxes.
"There's quite a few states that are very furious about this tax issue," said Robert J. Miller, an associate professor at Lewis and Clark Law School in Portland, Ore.
The Supreme Court has ruled that states can collect taxes on tribal cigarette sales to non-Indians and to members of other tribes, said Robert N. Clinton, a law professor at Arizona State University. But because tribes are also sovereign entities, states cannot sue them if they fail to pay taxes, effectively neutering states' ability to enforce the tax law.
"The tax in the abstract may be lawful, but all the accouterments including the ability to sue the taxpayer are not in place," Professor Clinton said. "The tribes are immune from state enforcement."
For the states, Professor Miller said, "this is what you call a right without a remedy." And because the states have no enforcement power, he said, many tribes have been opening tax-free businesses.
Several states have handled the issue by arranging compacts with tribes. In Washington State, under a 2001 agreement, tribes must collect taxes from non-Indian consumers but can keep the tax revenue, a deal that generates money for the tribe and also helps the state by undercutting the tribal businesses' competitive edge over non-Indian retailers.
In Oklahoma, tribes give the state a percentage of the taxes they collect. New York intends to follow a different model, collecting the taxes from wholesalers who sell cigarettes to the tribes; the wholesalers could then pass on the tax in the price they charge Indian smoke shops.
In Rhode Island, the situation has been complicated by an unusual law concerning the relationship between the state and the Narragansett tribe.
For a decade, the state of Rhode Island and the 2,600-member tribe have feuded over the Narragansetts' desire to build a casino on its reservation, in the southwest part of the state.
In May, facing yet another governor's opposition to the casino, the tribe said it would open a smoke shop. Because the shop would not charge consumers the state cigarette tax, which recently increased to $1.71 from $1.32 per pack, it would cost the government $10 million to $12 million annually, state officials say.
Tribal leaders agreed to delay the opening after Gov. Donald L. Carcieri visited the reservation, becoming the first governor in decades to do so, and offered to help the tribe find other ways to lower its high rates of unemployment and poverty. But the tribe's leader, Chief Sachem Matthew Thomas, said the proposals, which included a water-bottling plant and an assisted-living facility, would not generate the revenue of a casino or a smoke shop.
"They weren't really advantageous to the tribe," Chief Thomas said. "They were creating jobs, but it's not self-sufficiency."
On July 12, the tribe opened the smoke shop along a rural road dotted with trailer homes. State officials met with tribal leaders and asked them to close it. Chief Thomas said the tribe offered to discuss a compact, but only if Mr. Carcieri would no longer block a tribal casino.
Calling that condition "outrageous," the governor ordered state police to the smoke shop to execute a search warrant. Tribal members, including Chief Thomas, tried to block them from entering.
"Everything was out of control," said Bella Noka, the tribe's youth director, who was arrested on disorderly conduct charges, along with her husband, teenage son and daughter. "It was ugly, and it was only over cigarettes."
Now, the tribe and the state are in federal district court in Providence, their dispute centering on a 1978 federal law, the Rhode Island Settlement Act. The act granted the Narragansetts 1,800 acres for their reservation, but unlike laws that apply to tribes in other states, it also made the tribe subject to the state's criminal and civil laws and any income-producing activities on tribal land subject to state tax.
"They can't willy-nilly say 'I'm going to start selling cigarettes without taxes,' " Rhode Island's attorney general, Patrick C. Lynch, said in an interview. "They should be treated no differently than the mom and dad who run the store down the street or a Cumberland Farms convenience store."
The Indians say the act gave the state authority only over the land, not the Indians themselves. And in any case, they say, the act applied to the Narragansetts only before they were a federally recognized tribe, a status granted five years after the act was passed.
"Here's where the state, I think, takes their eye off the ball," Chief Thomas said. "In 1983, when we became recognized, the relationship with the state dissolved."
Several experts on Indian law said courts had previously ruled that the settlement act did make the tribe subject to Rhode Island laws. But they said it might be harder for the state to justify the raid. 
Professor Miller of Lewis and Clark Law School said it was comparable to Rhode Island sending state troopers to shut down a business in Connecticut.
"A tribe is a government too," he said. "You don't send your police across the border."
That finding could leave Rhode Island in the position of so many other states: legally entitled to tax tribal cigarette sales, but legally unable to compel those taxes to be paid.

HEADLINE: Refugee Plan For Mongolia Adds to Dispute On North Korea 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
Three hundred miles east of here, near a wall built by Genghis Khan, dust blows from the steppes through the empty barracks and apartments of an abandoned Soviet military base at Choybalsan. 
 The local mayor, South Korean missionaries and American Congressional staff members share a common vision for the old border post. They hope to make it the first transit camp for North Korean refugees, on their way to a new life in the United States. But the plan seems frozen in place, like most efforts to aid people fleeing North Korea. 
 Alarmed by the idea, North Korea last year sent Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun here, its highest-ranking envoy to Mongolia in 14 years. During a three-day visit, he renewed a bilateral friendship and cooperation treaty, replacing one torn up almost a decade earlier, and officials here indicated it would be fine with them if the barracks remained empty.
China frowns on the idea of preparing a transit camp for people who have been fleeing the repression and economic hardship in North Korea, preferring to bottle up potential refugees at the source, its 870-mile border with North Korea. This fall, China is placing as many as 150,000 soldiers on that border to keep the North Koreans at home.
South Korea's government quietly objects to the transit camp idea for fear of irritating North Korea.
In this setting, Mongolia does not want to make a move alone. "Mongolia does not want to offend anyone," said Mongolia's prime minister, Nambaryn Enkhbayar. "We are a small country. We are also not a direct neighbor to the two Koreas."
Mr. Enkhbayar, who plans to visit both North and South Korea in November, has received several delegations in recent months from groups that think creating refugee camps would be a good solution. One South Korean Christian group, the Doorae Community Movement, has bought land in Mongolia that could be used for refugee camps.
"These are human beings, people who suffered in this long journey, crossed the border, risked their lives," Mr. Enkhbayar said of the refugees. "They should be treated as human beings in a humanitarian way. But, on refugee camps, there is no such plan by the government."
With Mongolia at least two days from North Korea's border by train, the refugee flow here was always only a trickle. Since the late 1990's, missionary groups have quietly brought hundreds of North Koreans to Mongolia, a multiparty democracy with a population of 2.5 million, for eventual settlement in South Korea. But after the Chinese police intercepted 29 refugees two years ago, missionaries stopped running their underground railroad. The prime minister said bona fide North Korean refugees who reached Mongolia were allowed to travel on to Seoul, the destination most North Koreans preferred, on daily flights that link Mongolia and South Korea. 
An earlier policy of repatriation to China, the route here for the North Koreans, has been dropped, partly because of pressure from the United States. American pressure on China to allow camps here takes a back seat to Washington's need for Chinese assistance in dealing with North Korea's nuclear program.
At the urging of Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who visited the North Korean refugee areas in China last year, the United States Senate in July approved measures to allow North Korean refugees to go to the United States. With Bush administration officials talking of admitting several thousand next year, senators have urged the State Department to use refugee relief money to support transit camps for North Koreans.
Joel Charny, an executive with Refugees International, a Washington-based group, said the North Korean refugees he interviewed in China last year all wanted simply to live safely in China, near their families in North Korea. "For them, Mongolia might as well be another planet," he said.

HEADLINE: Investment Gains Lift Endowments at Leading Colleges 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
Better financial markets helped push endowments at Harvard, Princeton, Yale and some other colleges to record levels this year, according to preliminary fiscal 2003 year-end financial results that many colleges released last week.
 Harvard, whose endowment was already the largest in the country, earned a 12.5 percent return on its investments in the 2003 fiscal year (which ended June 30) helping its endowment climb to $19.3 billion. Investment experts said the gain was not only one of the highest among colleges, but also among large financial funds generally. 
 At Yale, which has the second largest endowment, an 8.8 percent return helped push it to $11 billion. Princeton's endowment, also ranked among the top five, earned 8 percent and grew to $8.7 billion. 
While many colleges earned lower returns than these three Ivy League giants, most showed gains this year, in contrast to the two previous years, when their endowments fell or stagnated.
"It has been a pretty good year," said John S. Griswold Jr., executive director of the Commonfund Institute, the research arm of the Commonfund, a nonprofit organization in Wilton, Conn. that manages money for colleges and other nonprofit institutions. 
Mr. Griswold said the college returns were impressive in a period in which the Standard & Poor's 500 index was up less than 1 percent and returns on private capital investments were also small. 
An institute survey this month found that the average return last year among 122 educational institutions was 2.9 percent. The average return for the six institutions in the survey with endowments of more than $1 billion was 2.3 percent.
The highest return in the survey group (which did not include Harvard) was 11.5 percent. But 15 of the 122 lost money last year, Mr. Griswold said, with the biggest loss nearly 9 percent. He declined to identify the institutions by name.
At the other Ivy universities, contacted on Friday, preliminary estimates of investment returns for the 2003 fiscal year ranged from 1.9 percent at Cornell to 6.5 percent at Brown. Columbia earned 5.3 percent, the University of Pennsylvania 4.7 percent and Dartmouth 2 percent.
Other universities reporting strong investment gains included Swarthmore (7 percent) Duke (6.6 percent) and New York University (6.2 percent). One university that reported a loss for last year was Emory (down 1.8 percent). 
The investment return is not the only factor in determining the size of a college's endowment; it also depends on how much the college spends and how much it collects in donations. And at a time when state subsidies for colleges have fallen and tuition increases have provoked sharp criticism, endowments have become an increasingly important source of revenue. 
Only a small number of the more than 3,500 colleges and universities have endowments of any significance. The Chronicle of Higher Education list for the 2002 fiscal year, published in January, showed only 39 with endowments greater than $1 billion, 290 with endowments of more than $100 million and 651 with more than $1 million.
For universities with sizable endowments, however, the income earned on them has come to represent an increasing share of their operating budgets. Harvard's endowment income last year provided 31 percent of its $2.4 billion operating budget, up from 19 percent in 1992. 
Yale's endowment income now accounts for about 29 percent of its $1.6 billion budget -- a larger share than grants and contracts (26 percent) and student payments for tuition, room and board (20 percent).
But financial experts say that while the investment gains are likely to ease the financial pressures on colleges, they are not likely to lead to much relief on tuition.
"The reality is that for big research universities, the endowment influences the scope of the projects they feel they can undertake more than the prices they charge undergraduates," said Michael S. McPherson, an economist who is president of the Spencer Foundation in Chicago, which provides grants for higher education research. "There is already more than adequate financial aid for the students who need it at the top Ivies. And institutions like Harvard, Princeton and Yale have a long list of things they want to do to help society. The ambition always exceeds the resources."
Harvard has performed better than the market -- and better than many other fund managers -- for many years, thanks to the Harvard Management Company Inc., its in-house investment arm, which has its own trading room in Boston and 50 investment professionals. It manages 55 percent of its $19 billion endowment internally and oversees the investment of the remainder. 
Although its return in 2002 was a negative 0.5 percent, and for 2001 was minus 2.7 percent, in 2000 its return was 32 percent. In all of those years it did markedly better than most other investment managers.
Jack R. Meyer, the company's president, said Harvard kept a diversified portfolio and had not significantly changed its asset allocation in the past year or so. Although he would not disclose how much Harvard had invested in specific areas, he said the "policy portfolio" that it had determined would best meet its goals was about 22 percent bonds (domestic, foreign and inflation-indexed) 43 percent equities (domestic, foreign, emerging markets and private) and the remainder in commodities, real estate and investments chosen for their absolute return or high yield.
Last year's investment strength, Mr. Meyer said, came from foreign and domestic bonds, which returned 52 percent and 30 percent. But he said that rather than betting on market movements, "we look for mispricings among similar securities, arbitrage-type situations."
"These aren't immediately obvious," he said. "Typically they are very complex, and it takes experienced eyes to see them. We have those, and that has helped us, not just over the past year but over the past 5 or 10 years."
He said that while a 12.5 return looked "pretty good" this year, it was still well below the returns of 20 percent or more earned in the mid-1990's.
"If you said everything is great now, you'd be wrong," he added, "because the real value of our endowment after inflation is still down 11 percent from where it was in 2000."

HEADLINE: At a Whimsical, Turreted Suburban Castle, Condominiums Are at the Gate 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Sept. 25 

 BODY:
Back in the 1930's, when this city had more dairy cows than corporate headquarters, an ambitious furniture maker from Italy named Salvatore Apicella bought some land here on top of a hill and built his family a home. Not just any home, but a whimsical French Normandy manor whose turrets, secret passageways and terraced gardens cascading over 30 acres reflected his family's remarkable success during the Depression.
 But now, Mr. Apicella's former dream house and his dusty Horatio Alger-like tale are in the way of a proposed condominium development. Much of the house's history has been forgotten, and economic pressures pushing the city to expand its housing stock speak louder than the few voices asking, "Can this castle be saved?" 
 Even the house's fans acknowledge that it may be a goner, doomed to suffer the same fate as so many of Stamford's other once-grand estates.
Neighbors in the adjacent Castlewood section of town have hardly weighed in to stop the teardown, with many unaware that their community was named after what was once considered the grandest home in the area. "For the most part, people are pretty apathetic about these things," said Phyllis Kapiloff, the head of the Stamford zoning board.
The proposed development, billed as River Oaks, also has the blessing of some town officials because it would add 59 new three-bedroom homes to the tax rolls, preserve 12 of the property's 30 woodsy acres as open space and make four newer homes on the parcel available to local teachers at bargain prices. The city's planning board unanimously approved it this month, ignoring a request from a local preservationist that board members at least visit the property before consigning it to the dustbin.
"We don't have too many buildings of this caliber left in Stamford and have to be careful not to lose the few that remain," Renee Kahn, the preservationist, pleaded in her letter to the board.
The zoning board is to review the matter on Monday.
In their application before the city, the developers never discuss the house or its history, referring to it as one of several "existing structures" scheduled for removal.
William J. Hennessey, Jr., the lawyer for the developers, said that anyone still calling the place a "castle" was not being accurate. "It's an interesting building, but not historically significant," he said. He said that there was some talk of using the house as the condominium's clubhouse, but that some neighbors preferred that the new clubhouse be in the center of the property, where noise would be less likely to bother them. "At the end of the day, it's in a bad spot," he said.
But Mark Madsen, president of the Castlewood Park Association, said putting the clubhouse at the center was the developers' idea "from the start."
James Fieber, who is one of the developers and whose family was part of a group that bought much of the land from the Apicellas for $225,000 in 1966 after the patriarch's death, added that the building had been leased for the last three decades to the Piper's Hill Learning Center.
He said the building had been altered over the years to suit the school, which has since relocated. "After 35 years as a child-care center for over 100 children, the interior looks like a day-care center and no longer looks like a structure worth preserving," he said.
Regardless of whether the Apicella homestead survives, other towns and cities in Connecticut have more success preserving older properties, or at least engage in more public debate before things come down.
But Stamford has neither the army of preservationists so common in richer towns nor the problems of needier towns that, in their own loopy way, deter builders from replacing old buildings with new. And its land can sometimes fetch $1 million an acre. So rundown mansions or estates play into the hands of developers looking to build.
"We don't have a very good history of preserving a lot of our historic architectural heritage," said Robin Stein, chief of the city's land-use bureau. "That's been true since urban renewal. So obviously, every time there's even one that is quasi-historical or significant, people like Renee go to bat."
One teardown that some people still lament was that of the lavish summer home that had been owned by Sir Douglas Alexander, the president of the Singer sewing machine company. A turn-of-the-century Victorian home with formal gardens, it was knocked down about a decade ago to make room for cluster housing, and, when that plan sputtered, for a new assisted living facility. Antique dealers and salvagers carted away what they could, and homesas far away as Pennsylvania ended up with doors and other finery from the house.
In this case, Mr. Fieber said he did not think there was anything particularly interesting about the old Apicella house. He professed to know little about the Apicellas, and said he thought the building was only 50 to 60 years old at most.
Descendants of Mr. Apicella, however, said the home was built in the 1930's. "The house was spectacular in every way," said David Apicella, creative director for Ogilvy & Mather in New York and a grandson of the man who built the house. He said he could still recall the sunken pool, the tennis courts, the ice skating pond and the wishing well where he played when visiting his grandparents. Inside, he said, there were carved fireplaces and a circular library hidden inside one of the turrets behind a fake wall.
With so much conspiring against it now, he said, the house "may very well be a lost cause."
The end may come as soon as Monday, when the developers ask the zoning board to rezone the property, clearing the way for them squeeze 59 homes onto a parcel that might fit only 35 under its current zoning classification.
Oddly enough, to qualify, the developers need to satisfy five tests, including one whose stated goal is preserving "exceptional terrain, natural beauty or sites of historic interest."
Though he is knocking down a house with some history to it, Mr. Fieber does not see a problem availing himself of the extra homes sometimes granted in the interest of preservation.
"The beauty here," Mr. Fieber said, "is the city will get a model community that produces tremendous fiscal benefits for the town, and empty nesters are getting a really wonderful community to cater to their interests. What's being lost, when you balance it, is negligible."

HEADLINE: A Vintage Crop of Apples After Years of Trouble 

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: MARLBOROUGH, N.Y., Sept. 25 

 BODY:
In the late afternoon sun, the Empire and Golden Delicious apples that cling to the trees in the Crist Brothers orchard here look almost too perfect -- as if a food stylist had sneaked in and done some retouching. Hefty, smooth and deeply hued, the apples are so numerous that the branches seem to strain under their weight.
 Finally there is a harvest to crow about. After several years in which drought, hail, a hurricane and frost devastated apples in the Hudson Valley, farmers here have been blessed with a bumper crop. "In a lot of respects it's really a vintage crop," said Jeffrey D. Crist, a fourth-generation grower. "It's nice to know we can still do it." 
 From this town on the Hudson River in Ulster County all the way up to Wayne County on Lake Ontario, the results are the same. New York apple industry representatives expect a harvest of 24 million bushels this year, up from 16 million last year, when a late frost killed blossoms on many trees. 
"After five years in a row of severe weather problems, we finally came through a growing season unscathed," said Peter Gregg, a spokesman for the New York Apple Association. "We're looking at a beautiful, lush crop. We needed a shot of optimism like this."
Indeed, in this area the combined pressures of a hot housing market, depressed apple prices and awful growing conditions have pushed a number of growers to sell their orchards in recent years.
The number of farms in Ulster County, the second largest apple-producing county in the state (after Wayne), has fallen by almost half since the mid-1980's, according to the Cornell Cooperative Extension, a Cornell program that provides research information and educational programs to farmers. Mr. Crist himself is considering an offer from a developer for a 227-acre orchard he owns south of here in Hamptonburgh, in Orange County.
Federal disaster aid and crop insurance payments helped somewhat to offset the big losses reported by apple growers. A number of growers from Ulster and Columbia Counties formed the Hudson Valley Fruit Growers Task Force in 2002 and traveled to Washington to ask for federal support. 
But the cooperation of the elements seems to be most responsible for brightening the outlook. "It certainly reduces the pressure of having to sell land we don't want to sell," said Mr. Crist, who was overseeing the Empire apple harvest today across his eight orchards.
A mile away at Porpiglia Farms, the owners were also marveling at the quality of their apples. "You don't know the feeling," said Joseph Porpiglia Jr., who, with his brother, Anthony, owns 700 acres of orchards. "We have a gorgeous crop. It makes it all worth it."
The last few years have been tough for Porpiglia Farms. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd barreled up the East Coast, wiping out 40 percent of their apples. In 2000, hail storms pummeled their trees, destroying 70 percent of the crop. And last year, a late frost and more hail laid waste to two-thirds of their apples.
"You wonder how you're going to make ends meet when you have a year like last year," Anthony J. Porpiglia said, surveying ruby-red Cortlands the size of grapefruits as they rolled past on a conveyor belt.
The weather-related problems were augmented by economic forces. An overproduction of apples worldwide and imports of cheap apple juice concentrate from China have led to lower apple prices in recent years. And with retailers consolidating, stores have been demanding lower prices from apple growers, too.
So far this fall, prices for apples appear to be holding up. New York is second only to Washington State in apple production. Many of the apples picked here this week will end up in supermarkets on the East Coast, in the Midwest and even in Great Britain. 
"The farmers look like they are going to get a good return for their crop," Mr. Gregg said. He pointed out that the economics of supply and demand should work in the growers' favor, with apple production nationwide expected to be a "little flat" this year. Last year, wholesale prices improved for the first time in years, he said.
Another bright spot is a recent increase in the public's appetite for apples. Industry representatives credit publicity surrounding research that has shown the health benefits of apples in countering cholesterol, obesity and asthma. "There's been a lot of university research proving that an apple a day really does keep the doctor away," Mr. Gregg said. 
With Hurricane Isabel on the move earlier this month, apple farmers collectively held their breath, knowing that after months of ground-saturating rain, the trees themselves, not just the apples, would be vulnerable to high winds. "For three or four days, we were nervous wrecks," Joseph Porpiglia said. "We couldn't sleep."
But the hurricane passed them by. Now they need another four weeks of relatively calm weather to see them through to the end of the harvest, when the Ida Red and Northern Spy varieties are finally plucked from the trees. "There's still quite a bit of harvest left to go," said Michael J. Fargione, an educator with Cornell Cooperative Extension. "Everyone is saying things are looking good, and then knocking on wood."

HEADLINE: On the Final Journey, One Size Doesn't Fit All 

BYLINE:  By WARREN ST. JOHN

 BODY:
Perhaps nowhere is the issue of obesity in America more vividly illustrated than at Goliath Casket of Lynn, Ind., specialty manufacturers of oversize coffins.
 There one can see a triple-wide coffin -- 44 inches across, compared with 24 inches for a standard model. With extra bracing, reinforced hinges and handles, the triple-wide is designed to handle 700 pounds without losing what the euphemism-happy funeral industry calls its "integrity." 
 When Keith and Julane Davis started Goliath Casket in the late 1980's, they sold just one triple-wide each year. But times, along with waistlines, have changed; the Davises now ship four or five triple-wide models a month, and sales at the company have been increasing around 20 percent annually. The Davises say they base their design specifications not on demographic studies so much as on simple observations of the world around them. 
"It's just going to local restaurants or walking in a normal Wal-Mart," Mrs. Davis said. "People are getting wider and they're getting thicker."
Like the airline industry, which was warned in May that passengers were heavier than they used to be, and was asked to adjust weight estimates accordingly, the funeral industry is retooling to make room for ever-larger Americans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 20 percent of American adults are obese, up from 12.5 percent in 1991. Of those 70 and older -- the demographic that most interests the funeral industry -- 17 percent are obese. Despite the numbers, nearly every aspect of the funeral industry, from the size of coffins to vaults, graves, hearses and even the standardized scoop on the front-end loaders that cemeteries use for grave-digging (it is called a "grave bucket") is based on outdated estimates about individual size.
"Many people in this country no longer fit in the standard-size casket," said David A. Hazelett, the president of Astral Industries, a coffin builder in Indiana. "The standard-size casket is meant to go in the standard-size vault, and the standard-size vault is meant to go into the standard-size cemetery plot. Everyone in the industry is aware of the problem."
The Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx recently increased its standard burial plot size to four feet wide from three feet to accommodate wider burial vaults, and the cemetery's newest mausoleum has four crypts designed especially to hold oversize coffins. The Cremation Association of North America has begun providing special training to its members in the handling of obese bodies.
And hearse manufacturers are pushing the limits of design to make their vehicles ever wider and with bigger rear doors.
"If a funeral home calls looking to buy a hearse, that's one of the first things they ask: 'How wide is it?' " said Terry Logan, the head of marketing at Federal Coach in Fort Smith, Ark., which sells 250 hearses a year. "That's the biggest selling point in our industry."
Despite these changes, critics say the funeral industry has not done enough. Families of obese decedents often have to wait several days for coffins, and the cost of burial for the obese -- which can include surcharges for embalming and transportation -- typically exceed standard burials by $800 to $3,000.
"It's not exactly rocket science that people have been getting larger; that's been well known for 30 years," said Allen Steadham, the executive director of the International Size-Acceptance Association, an advocacy group for the obese. "People are living larger and they're dying larger, and industries have to adapt to that situation."
George Lemke, the executive director of the Casket and Funeral Supply Association, said that shape more than weight determined whether someone would require an oversize coffin. But for people of average height, he said, those above 300 pounds are likely candidates.
Many families are unaware their relatives will need a special coffin until a funeral director measures the body and informs them. Some then face difficult choices. Grace Moredock of Evanston, Ill., said that in 1999, when her mother died weighing 340 pounds, the family could not afford an oversize coffin and opted for cremation. "Because of our faith and our religious belief we would have preferred to have buried her," she said. Ms. Moredock herself weighs 400 pounds and she said the experience had affected her own funeral plans. "I'd prefer to be buried," she said. "But I wouldn't say to my family, 'You have to bury me,' because I wouldn't want them to be in a bind if they couldn't afford it."
For the severely obese, though, cremation may not be an option. Jack Springer, the executive director of the Cremation Association of North America, said most crematoria cannot handle bodies over 500 pounds.
One way that some companies have responded is by reducing the thickness of their coffins' sides and the profiles of their handles, so they can hold larger bodies but still fit in a standard vault.
Cemetery owners have less flexibility. Many cemeteries were plotted years ago, and in the more crowded cemeteries, burial vaults are lined up wall to wall, not unlike seats on an airliner, to maximize potential sales. And just as on a plane, it is impossible to buy an extra half a seat.
"If we have someone who is oversized we may have to go larger than the actual grave space permits," said William Wright, the vice president of Fairlawn Cemetery in Hutchinson, Kan. "The family would have to own it."
The issue can be especially complicated when the deceased has prepurchased a site, but cannot fit in it.
For funeral directors and grieving families, discussions over the deceased's weight can be especially awkward. Tim King, an undertaker at the Tufts-Schildmeyer Funeral Home in Goshen, Ohio, said, "When you tell a family that just lost a loved one that their loved one is too big for a casket, what they hear is you saying, 'Mom or Dad is fat,' " he said.
Mr. King said the weight issue had given rise to a new euphemism. "We say, 'Mom's not going to look comfortable in that casket,' " he said. "The family knows we mean, 'Mom won't fit.' "
Families that have buried large relatives say it is important to compare funeral homes, since some funeral directors with more experience burying the obese can perform the task at a lower cost. Lois Kehrer, whose brother-in-law John Kehrer of Loveland, Ohio, died last spring at 52 of heart failure at 696 pounds, said the first undertaker the family spoke to said Mr. Kehrer would require a custom casket, a custom burial vault and two funeral plots, which together cost $20,000.
The Kehrers eventually found another funeral director who could fit Mr. Kehrer into a ready-made coffin from Goliath, and a local cemetery agreed to fit the coffin in a single plot, by positioning it slightly off center. The cost of the funeral came to $7,921.74.
"People need to be aware there are other options," Mrs. Kehrer said. "We kind of lucked out."
Mr. Hazelett, the coffin maker from Indiana, said he expected the coffin industry to continue courting the oversize market.
"The economic opportunity exists until the country changes," he said. "We're just reacting to the supersizing of America."

$9.7 Million Profit Reported at Comtech
 The Comtech Telecommunications Corporation (Nasdaq: CMTL) of Melville posted a profit of $9.7 million for its fiscal year, which ended July 31, on stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, the company said Monday. In its last fiscal year, Comtech reported a profit of $1.1 million. 
 Comtech, which develops mobile telecommunications systems for commercial and military users, said that sales for the fourth quarter were $51.7 million, compared with $28.5 million in fiscal 2002. 
Orders from the United States Army increased earnings considerably, said Fred Kornberg, the company's president and chief executive.

DeLuise Joins Dowling
Michael B. DeLuise, formerly the vice president for university relations at Hofstra University, has joined Dowling College in Oakdale as the vice president for development, Dowling announced on Monday.
In addition to fund-raising, Mr. DeLuise will manage government and community relations at Dowling.
Mr. DeLuise left Hofstra Sept. 15 after serving as the university's chief spokesman since 1986, interrupted by a 16-month stint in the late 90's when he took a similar position at New York Institute of Technology.
Mr. DeLuise also serves as chairman of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau and the president of the Long Island Advertising Club.

Investor Group Formed
A new organization formed to help connect local companies with investors and other financiers will hold an investor conference, LI Invest 004, next September at the Melville Marriott, the organization's president said Tuesday.
Jordan Darrow, the president of LI Invest and the investor-relations manager for Stronghold Technologies of Basking Ridge, N.J., said the new organization, formed as a nonprofit group, had recruited an advisory board, which includes Herman Fialkov, a venture capitalist, and Michael A. Breit, a partner in the Long Island office of Ernst & Young. 
"With greater accessibility to capital and a lower cost of capital, companies in the region will be better positioned to contribute to local economic development," Mr. Darrow said.

Long Island Business News: 50 Years of Change

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
ON his second day as the publisher of Long Island Business News, in March 1998, John L. Kominicki met his reporters and realized that he needed to make some immediate changes.
 One reporter asked permission to leave the building. 
 "I thought he meant he needed to leave at that moment," Mr. Kominicki recalled. "He meant, 'Could he start covering stories in person?"' 
The "reporting by phone" policy, aimed at producing more stories per writer, was instituted by the paper's previous owners, Paul and Terry Townsend, who ran it for 38 years in a manner that might be best described as idiosyncratic. The paper, a weekly tabloid with a circulation of about 12,000, has its offices in Ronkonkoma.
Mr. Kominicki, who had published The Oklahoma City Journal Record, a business weekly, for two and a half years, reversed the "don't leave the building" policy. "In fact, I encouraged reporters to leave the building as much as possible," he said.
That decision was the first in the transformation of Long Island Business News after the Dolan Media Company bought it in 1998 and installed Mr. Kominicki to run it. Dolan, a private Minneapolis company, owns six business publications, including the one in Oklahoma City.
Arthur Hug, a reporter, founded the newspaper as the Long Island Commercial Review in 1953 and published it from his basement in Freeport. Mr. Hug sold it to the Townsends for $5,000 in 1960. 
(Full disclosure: I worked as a reporter for the paper from 1985 to 1986, and as a freelancer, I contributed articles to it from 1998 to 2000.)
In addition to running Long Island Business News, the Townsends also operated a public-relations agency that shared space, and sometimes employees, with the newspaper for many years. Blending news, advertising and public relations, frowned upon by mainstream journalists, became the norm at the newspaper.
The lack of competition enabled that arrangement, said Lee E. Koppelman, the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. "The other newspapers weren't covering local business regularly," Dr. Koppelman said. Mr. Townsend's arrangement "was totally accepted," he added.
Circulation was meager but influential. Readers included government officials and corporate executives, university presidents and civic leaders. The Townsend Letter, Mr. Townsend's weekly exhortatory and partisan call to action, dominated the front page.
There was never any doubt where Mr. Townsend stood on an issue. Each week he beat the drum for projects he deemed "good for Long Island," building support or unifying resistance. Among the projects he supported that brought major changes to Long Island were the Roosevelt Field shopping mall, North Shore Hospital, MacArthur Airport and the Fire Island National Seashore.
To Mr. Townsend, issues were clearly good for Long Island or not. The column had little room for nuance. His signature sign-off spoke for itself: "My name is Paul Townsend. Any questions?" 
The client list for his public-relations agency was a who's who of Long Island's midcentury moguls. There was Arthur Roth, the banker who founded Franklin National, which eventually grew into one of the country's biggest banks; William Zeckendorf, who built the Roosevelt Field mall, one of the nation's first; and the Levitt brothers, William and Alfred, the developers of Levittown. 
"Paul was a force to deal with," said Dick Dunne, who retired in 2001 after 22 years as a spokesman for Grumman and Northrop Grumman. "His newspaper was this little publication that didn't go to John Q. Public. It went to the business readers. They picked up on what he wrote in his column. He was able to use the newspaper as his bully pulpit and shape the issues that were important to Long Island."
Dr. Koppelman agreed. "The newspaper was totally Paul's voice," he said. "In my opinion, no one was a stronger booster of Long Island economic development than Paul Townsend. Paul was really an early advocate of smart growth."
Mr. Townsend's approach drew critics, too, at least one of whom worked, albeit briefly, at the paper itself. Fred Gottesman, the managing editor of Long Island Business News from 1985 to 1986, described the paper's coverage as tainted by its favoritism.
"I had a constant running feud with Paul, and to some extent with Terry, too, because I didn't believe it was being run as a legitimate newspaper," said Mr. Gottesman, who joined the paper after two decades at Women's Wear Daily and other Fairchild publications. "I wanted less puff and more hard news."
His campaign, he said, resulted in his dismissal, and he retired after that. 
When Mr. Kominicki arrived, he said he found a quid pro quo arrangement in place. "My reporters complained some sources turned them down for interviews, saying they didn't have money that week" to buy ads, he said. He has now stopped the practice, he said. 
Mrs. Townsend, who was the publisher of Long Island Business News, disputed this. "There was never a connection between editorial and advertising -- never," she said. "Anything that Paul has ever done in the paper has been in the best interests of Long Island."
The Townsends put the paper on the market after Mr. Townsend, now 86, had a stroke in 1997. "People kept saying to me, 'How are you going to replace Paul Townsend?"' Mr. Kominicki recalled. "I kept hearing, 'Paul Townsend is Mr. Long Island.' I had no intention of replacing Paul Townsend."
Mr. Townsend continued to write his column -- for a while. Then Mr. Kominicki gave the paper a makeover and moved the Townsend Letter off the front page. Soon it was gone altogether.
Some executives praise Mr. Kominicki for creating what they say is a source of unbiased reporting on local issues and for injecting humor into the process.
"Under John, the paper has no agenda," said Bob Wallach, the chairman and chief executive of the Robert Plan insurance companies in Bethpage. "Under the Townsends, there was always an agenda."
On Sept. 18, a thousand people paid $150 a ticket to attend a dinner at Crest Hollow Country Club in Woodbury to celebrate the paper's 50th anniversary. Mr. Kominicki said the money raised would be used to create a scholarship for a graduate business student at Hofstra University. 
At the dinner Mr. Kominicki seated the Mr. and Mrs. Townsend and Mr. Hug at the table nearest the dais. In his opening remarks he praised all three, complimenting Mr. Townsend's public-relations skills and calling him "a crusading editor." 
Guests were given copies of a journal tracing the newspaper's history and the Island's business history. The end page was written by Mr. Townsend in the form of his old column under the headline "Any Questions?"
"We figured," Mr. Kominicki wrote, "we'd give him one more trip to the pulpit."

HEADLINE: In Island's Wealthiest Area, Backlash Against the Poorest 

BYLINE:  By JULIA C. MEAD

 BODY:
THE SOUTH FORK has reverberated for many years with the buzz of lawn mowers pushed by Latino laborers and vacuum cleaners pushed by Hispanic housekeepers. But there's a new sound filling the air here: increasingly shrill echoes of the nationwide debate over the impact of Spanish-speaking immigrants.
 Natives of Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean have flocked to the region for at least two decades, and many of the earlier arrivals are now established as citizens or legal residents, homeowners, business owners and community leaders. But much of the resentment seems to have been generated by the largest and most recent wave of immigrants who have made the sound of Spanish conversation commonplace in the shops and schools and on the sidewalks of Southampton and East Hampton towns. 
 "It affects us on every level, like an invasion," said Tammy Morgan, who lives in Southampton. She said her son is the only English-speaking student in his 11th-grade math class, her daughter was required to study Spanish from kindergarten through sixth grade, "then you add on top of that that many of them are illegals, they drive without licenses and insurance, they commit crimes, they live in overcrowded group rentals." 
In public meetings and on the letters pages of the local newspapers, Ms. Morgan and other residents are calling for deportations, stepped-up police action, legislative reform, an end to overcrowded housing and the hiring of undocumented workers, sanctions against employers who do hire illegals, and more.
It is a debate that is familiar up-Island, especially in Farmingville, which for several years has been one of the East Coast's hot spots for tensions over illegal immigration. But this year it has sprung forth, full-throated, in the Hamptons, which for better or worse is the genteel, sophisticated face that Long Island presents to the rest of the world. 
Fernando Bustamante was a restaurant dishwasher when he came here 25 years ago from Colombia. He is now a United States citizen and owns Warren's Nursery in Water Mill and Southampton. "People say I brought all these Latinos to the Hamptons, but I tell them businesses here can't make it without them," he said. "American kids don't want to work this hard. It's intensive labor to dig a hole for a 20-foot tree."
Like other established Hispanic-Americans, Mr. Bustamante blames both sides for the growing animosity. Too many recent immigrants are slow to assimilate and too many Anglos lack tolerance, he said. "We have to educate people before we punish them," he said. "I see hostility every day, but that's just ignorance. I tell my workers, 'You have to believe in what you're doing and why you're doing it."'
The 2000 census put Hispanics at 12 percent of the South Fork's population, but there is general agreement on the South Fork that Hispanics comprise closer to quarter of the two towns' residents, a ratio reflected in many of the public schools' student bodies.
Kathleen Bouker of East Hampton said she was prompted to write her own letter to a local paper after noticing more Latinos moving into her neighborhood.
"I'm sorry, but I don't feel they should be able to have 20 people living in one house," she said. "It looks terrible to have six or seven cars in the driveway. They don't have insurance, so they go to the public clinic. They're illegal and they don't pay taxes, but they send their children to our schools. So my school taxes go up and everybody else's do too."
William Kalbacher, an East Hampton builder, blew the whistle earlier this month on a fellow contractor who hired illegal aliens to landscape an East Hampton Village green. Like Ms. Morgan and Ms. Bouker, Mr. Kalbacher was quick to assert he is not anti-Latino but anti-illegal immigration. "I love the Latino people," he said, "but I make sure that whoever works on my job site is legit. So should everyone else."
But that's not how the day laborers who congregate in front of the 7-Eleven in Southampton Village and the East Hampton Village train station see it. On a recent morning, more than 50 were scattered around the 7-Eleven parking lot and a grassy field across the street. Some said they resented the hostility but had no alternative but to stay.
"We only want work," said Juan Hernandez Olvera, a Mexican immigrant who spent the past 11 years traveling through Texas, Georgia, the Carolinas, and New York in search of steady employment. "There are no jobs in Mexico. We have to live."
At 63, he was by far one of the elders on the corner. Mr. Hernandez said he waits there until 11 p.m. or noon for a contractor to hire him, generally at $10 or $12 an hour, before he takes the bus home to a rented room he shares with three other men. "This time of year is very bad," he said.
A man who called himself Juan Condor and said he emigrated from Ecuador three years ago, said through an interpreter that the day laborers see that the anti-immigrant sentiment they faced in other places, such as California and Texas, was now brewing on the South Fork. Mr. Condor, who called it "racism," said he had learned the best defense was to "follow all the rules."
He said he does not own a car and was once stopped by a police officer while walking. "He wanted to know where I was going and where I lived," Mr. Condor said. "I felt like a terrorist or a criminal just for walking down the street." He said he wishes he could go home, but he said he borrowed $13,000 to pay a smuggler to guide him across the border and the man who loaned him the money now has a lien on his house in Ecuador. "I have to stay until it's paid," he said, grimacing.
Several others talked about employers who hired them, then refused to pay. The stories of exploitation and discrimination sparked formation last year of Organizacion Latino Americana, known as OLA. The advocacy group, run by Latin-Americans, has been holding public meetings, documenting complaints of discrimination, lobbying local government for improved services and the state attorney general's office to enforce legal protections, and mediating disputes between Anglos and Latinos.
OLA has also chartered two buses for next month's nationwide "Freedom Ride," when hundreds of thousands are expected to make the cross-country trek to call for immigration reform. Handing out flyers, Isabel Sepulveda de Scanlon, OLA's president, told the day laborers a strong turnout would "show everyone we are here and how badly changes are needed." They read the flyers and nodded.
Latinos are divided by the differences among their own cultures, but she said the growing number of advocacy groups is helping them coalesce into a political force.
"Look around," said Jacqui Candemir, OLA's vice president. "Who's working at CVS, Kmart, the banks, King Kullen, Burger King, inside town hall? Even some of the volunteer fire departments and ambulance squads have given up their good-old-boy ways and are recruiting Latinos. We're more visible now. The time has come."
But over the past several months, as advocacy groups have given voice to a previously silent minority, the demands to rid the region of illegal immigrants have only grown more strident. This may not be a coincidence; government leaders and advocates described a correlation between how vocal the Hispanic community has become and the decibel level of anti-immigrant criticism.
"They are calling attention to themselves and their issues, which is good," said Diana Dominguez Weir, an East Hampton Town councilwoman of Puerto Rican and Colombian descent. "But being out there makes you a target, right?"
Ms. Weir is sponsoring town legislation to curtail the raucous backyard volleyball games popular among East Hampton's Latinos, which for the past few summers have fueled angry complaints from neighbors about overcrowding, drinking and urinating in public, as well as charges of illegal gambling. 
"Latinos are taxing the system out here and yet they're needed by the system," she said, alluding to the fact that they fill many of the low-paid, unskilled jobs as landscapers, motel chambermaids, restaurant dishwashers, and construction laborers that keep a resort economy running.
"There's been a major change here in the past year, and it's frightening," said Katherine Hartnett, who runs SoLA, an educational program that teaches English and computer skills to some 300 Latinos per week. "We don't have to go to Farmingville to feel that kind of hostility. It's right here."
Two white supremacist skinheads were convicted of severely beating two immigrant day laborers from Farmingville two years ago. This summer, four Farmingville teenagers were charged with burning down a Mexican family's home. 
"I'm horrified at the mean-spirited tone I hear now," Ms. Hartnett added. "For some reason, which is incomprehensible to me, people are feeling now that it's O.K. to be right out there with their hostility and racism. And I worry about where that will lead."
The police say there have been no violent hate crimes against Latinos on the South Fork. Still, they too are concerned.
"We know there are hostilities in the community, some valid and some not, and we have to go into these neighborhoods and resolve the disputes before they get out of hand," said Todd Sarris, chief of the East Hampton Town Police Department. 
Two weeks ago, after neighbors complained bitterly at a town board meeting about the volleyball games, he met with OLA and residents of the most affected neighborhood. Up to four officers at a time spent the weekend monitoring the games there, talking with the hosts and helping to organize a neighborhood watch.
"There was not one violation the entire weekend, but we were able to develop a relationship with the neighborhood," he said. "We'll continue to monitor it, but I'd say the situation appears resolved for now." The town also bowed to OLA's demands to build two volleyball courts at a town park to move the games away from residences.
Chief Sarris and officials from other departments disputed claims that Latinos, illegal or otherwise, commit more crimes than other ethnics group. Any increase in crime involving Latinos has been only proportionate to their population growth, agreed Det. Sgt. Howard Lewis, a spokesman for the Southampton Village force, and Gerard Larsen Jr., the East Hampton Village chief.
But at a contentious public meeting hosted in Southampton last month by Representative Timothy Bishop, the East End's congressman, a man who did notidentify himself called all Latinos "garbage." Among the recent letters to The Southampton Press, a local weekly, one signed by a Capt. Bruce Robertson warned that "today's smiling, subservient Latino becomes tomorrow's Shining Path."
"All you need to do is remove 'Latino' and replace it with 'Irish' and you've got a letter from our paper in 1900 probably," said Joseph Shaw, editor of The Southampton Press. "It's the same sentiment, and it's frightening, but we print those letters because we have to shine a light on what's happening."
Mr. Bishop said members of Sachem Quality of Life, the organization leading the fight in Farmingville against illegal immigration, have attended three of his public meetings in eastern Suffolk and each time made comments he described as "abusive" and "incendiary." He said the group is targeting him for supporting the idea of community hiring halls as a way to get the day laborers off the streets.
The Sachem group's president, Edward Person, confirmed that the group opposes hiring halls, an idea approved by the Suffolk County Legislature but vetoed by the county executive, Robert J. Gaffney, but declined to say whether any members were active on the South Fork.
Ms. Morgan said she and other residents are talking about forming their own group to push for illegal immigrants to be picked up off the streets and deported. "There are plenty of people like me who are resentful and angry," she said. "We feel like we're being ignored."
Mayor Joseph Romanosky of Southampton said village trustees are opposed to a hiring hall there and instead asked immigration and Internal Revenue Service officials to step in, the former to round up and deport illegals and the latter to sanction those who hire them.
"We don't want anything that encourages illegal immigration here," he said.
Hamilton Hoge, who owns HHCM Services, a Southampton-based construction management company, sponsored two of his employees for citizenship as they spent years and thousands of dollars navigating the morass of immigration regulations. He said government leaders and Latino advocates should help illegals achieve legal status. 
"I see their faces in the wintertime, the utter despair at 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning," Mr. Hoge said. "But it's baloney to say we can't find other workers. Just look at the state unemployment lines."
"I don't think there's a person out here who is not affected by this crisis," he added. "At some point, we all have our lawns mowed, our car washed by some guy we don't even know. We should be asking the contractors, 'Who are these guys working in my house? What are you paying them? Are they insured?"'

HEADLINE: Hunting for Work, Many Say They Enjoy Some Company 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER S. STEWART

 BODY:
WHEN Dan Flak lost his job 14 months ago as the information technology manager at Gilbarco, a North Carolina gasoline pump manufacturer, a gaping void opened up in his world. "Losing a job is a lot like losing a family member," said Mr. Flak, 54, who has had a full-time job for most of his life. "Daytime TV isn't any good. You sit there without anything to do and start thinking about the situation and it becomes hopeless and lonely."
 Since then, Mr. Flak has become a regular at a few local job groups, where people gather to talk about problems associated with unemployment. Recently, he started one of his own at a local hospital. "There's a comfort in getting out of the house and going to a place where all 40 people are in the same boat as you," Mr. Flak said. "For the moment, these groups are very important to me." 
 With unemployment near a nine-year high and over two million Americans out of work for more than 27 weeks, according to the Labor Department, many people struggling with job searches are finding refuge in job groups. It is hard to say exactly how many job-focused gatherings there are nationwide, because most of the groups are grass-roots efforts operating out of churches and local municipal buildings with no central organizing body. Still, Donald R. Teff, a New York City management consultant specializing in placing people in jobs, speaks at many such gatherings, and he estimates their number to be in the thousands.
"As the economy slides, the calls for help increase and that drives a heavy volunteer response," Mr. Teff said. "The amount of groups nationwide ebbs and flows with the times. When the economy is the way it is now, the need for them is accelerated and you have many, many more." 
Typically, job groups have free admission and they meet early in the morning or after hours at local churches or government offices. Some groups are highly structured with a specific schedule of speakers, job-hunting strategies and financial advice. Others are more open-ended, and the conversation might stray to what some participants call "pity sessions."
After being laid off 18 months ago from SPSS, a software company in Chicago, Susan Greenberg, a 38-year-old M.B.A., made a habit of visiting a couple of groups a week. For her, the groups were less about strategy than about motivation. "At 10, I have to be there," she said. "So it creates a schedule for me. I put on makeup, do my hair. There's this whole process of getting fixed up and going out to meet people. It's incentive to get going. You're going someplace and getting something done."
Though Ms. Greenberg said she had developed only a few leads from the groups, she continues to go for the human contact. "The biggest thing I miss about being employed is the water cooler talk. You talk about job hunting stuff at the groups, but you also talk about things that are going on in your life or the last episode of 'Friends."'
For some unemployed professionals, the groups humanize the job search and ease the pains of displacement and alienation, especially during long stretches of unemployment. "There are so many people that are depressed and lonely," said Marian J. Karpen, founder of WorkTalk, a nonprofit career development organization on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. "People need to feel like they belong to something. They've been out of work for so long and feel ashamed."
WorkTalk has no set formula for its gatherings, but they usually involve round-table discussions about job hunting and a speaker on subjects like leadership, interview etiquette and financial strategies. "There is no magic solution," said Ms. Karpen, who has been running the group for nearly 12 years and has recently seen an increase in the number of new faces. "But these groups give you exposure to more angles than the self-help books or the Internet." 
Some also find that the groups offer useful networking opportunities. John Schegg, vice president and managing director of Goodrich & Sherwood Associates, a human resources firm based in New York, is the host of nine networking-oriented job groups in Connecticut organized by professional specialties like human resources, financial or sales and marketing.
The groups are kept to 30 people and meet for two hours every other week, allowing members to exchange leads and talk about different job-seeking approaches. Some 75 percent of those attending have landed jobs in the last year, Mr. Schegg said, and that has definitely been noticed. "I get phone calls continuously now, and have to turn a lot of people down," he said. "I'd say we get an average of six phone calls a day for these groups."
Duane Elms was able to land a spot at Mr. Schegg's meetings. Just over two years ago, he was laid off from TranSwitch, a telecommunications and semiconductor company in Shelton, Conn., where he was a product marketing manager. He began attending five groups with Mr. Schegg, and four other groups also in Connecticut. "It made me feel like I had an actual job," Mr. Elms said. "I dressed up for them just like I was going into the office."
Mr. Elms, 58, estimates that in 25 months he has attended over 350 job groups, looked at hundreds of thousands of job openings and sent out over 1,500 resumes. The groups helped him persevere when he was discouraged, he said. "If I felt down or hit a wall, there were people there to pick me up," he said.
When he finally got an interview with Western New Mexico University last month for a position as director of information technology, the meetings helped him prepare. "I didn't have any experience with an academic setting and people in the groups had," he said. "They taught me what I needed to know so I could interview effectively."
Mr. Elms was hired by the university and he credits the groups for his success. For the five groups with Mr. Schegg, he brought in doughnuts, a common gesture of thanks from graduates of these meetings, and he told everyone how he landed the job. In late August, he and his wife moved to New Mexico but he continues to stay in touch with some 30 group members. "I'm actually using a guy from the group as a real estate agent to sell our house in Connecticut," he said.

HEADLINE: Robert Moses' Village Gets Him Back, in Bronze 

BYLINE:  By CAROLINE B. SMITH

DATELINE: Babylon 

 BODY:
ROBERT MOSES, the master planner of New York State's parks and parkways, was a controversial figure during his long and much-accomplished life, and disagreement over his legacy has not faded in the 22 years since his death. But there was little but praise here last Saturday when a bronze statue of Moses was unveiled in a ceremony attended by more than 100 local residents in the village he called home. 
 "It takes a true visionary to transcend not just politics but to be able to deal with all the bureaucracy involved in carrying something to fruition," said Mark Romaine, 39, a three-year Babylon resident who came out for the unveiling. He said he knew about the public outcry over the neighborhoods ruined by Moses' development of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and Cross-Bronx Expressway, but said, "when you take the measure of a man, you have to say that Robert Moses would definitely be on the positive side." 
 Maura Miles-Mason, a consultant to the Babylon Village Public Arts Commission, which oversaw the project with a $190,000 appropriation from Suffolk County, said it was good that the statue found a place on the lawn of Babylon's Village Hall. "Those types of bronzes usually go at a crossroads," she said. "The piece is so worthy of close inspection and contemplation. I'm happy that people can get close to that." 
And they did. The 1,500-pound, seven-foot bronze, by Jose I. Fernandez of Sylmar, Calif., showing Moses with brow furrowed and dressed in suit and tie, was pronounced "a very good likeness" by Carney Maguire, 73, who was a dressmaker to Moses' first wife, Mary Louise. She described him as "gruff, pleasant, firm," a man who "got the job done" and was always on the go.
"That's what we were driving at," said Joy Torrey, 82, a village resident since 1934 and a member of the village arts commission. "Can't you just see the power behind it?" 
Longtime village residents recalled an eccentric man who preferred bare lightbulbs over lampshades to maximize the electricity he paid for, and an unparalleled road-builder who never drove a car but was instead chauffeured around in the back of a limousine. He also never owned but rented his home on Thompson Avenue. 
"He never had money in his pocket," said Judy Skillen, a Babylon resident whose father, Ellison Driscoll, was the photographer for the state Parks Commission for 44 years and often accompanied Moses on business. "My father would pay the tolls," Mrs. Skillen said.
In a career that began in 1924, when he was appointed to head the Long Island region of the state Parks Commission, and ended in 1968, when he gave up control of the last of a dozen state and New York City agencies through which he spent nearly $150 billion (inflation-adjusted) in taxpayer money, Robert Moses adapted New York State's road system to the automobile age, creating every mile of road now designated as parkway and directing construction of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, the Long Island Expressway, 13 major bridges and 2 major tunnels. He also built all the major state parks, the United Nations, Lincoln Center, Shea Stadium and both World's Fairs in Queens, 658 playgrounds in New York City and hydropower plants at Niagara Falls and on the St. Lawrence River. 
Long Island, Moses' home, was his first and favorite canvas. Jones Beach State Park is widely regarded as his masterpiece. But his passion for pavement finally met its limit on the Island, when public opposition forced him to abandon plans to build a cross-Sound bridge from Bayville to Rye and a parkway running the length of Fire Island. The defeats signaled the end of his career.
"Of course he stepped on people's toes. He had to. He was a great man," said Larry Merryman, 68, a Babylon resident since 1967. "All you have to do is drive that grand span along Jones Beach. It could have been a city just like Long Beach if the developers were allowed to get to it." 
"He gave us power, parks and transportation," said former Gov. Hugh Carey, who attended the unveiling. "He could spend money and he got value in return. No economist has ever figured out the return to New York State. You don't need to defend his record. His record is clear. He incorporated safety into everything he built. He overcame opposition so we could all live better today." 
Moses paved the way for three careers in the family of Bob Chapin, whose father, William, was an engineer for Moses in the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and ultimately general manager and chief engineer of the state Power Authority. "He demanded a high degree of capability and he got it," said Bob Chapin, 63, who brought to the unveiling a picture of his father with Moses at Niagara Falls. "He surrounded himself with the best people," said Mr. Chapin, a retired highway engineer for the state Department of Transportation, where his son Steven, 36, now works. 
Babylon's county legislator, David Bishop, said he was aware of Moses' reputation as a petty tyrant. "But you come back to Babylon and people have the opposite perception," Mr. Bishop said. "Yes, he had flaws. But he was what New York needed."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 12, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 28 about the installation of a statue of Robert Moses in Babylon credited him incorrectly with one part of the state's highway construction record. Part of the Bronx River Parkway was built before he became chairman of the New York State Parks Council, in 1924; he was responsible for building the rest of the state's parkways. A picture caption referred incorrectly to Moses' birthplace. It was New Haven; he was not a native son of Babylon.
An article on Sept. 28 about the unveiling of a statue of Robert Moses in Babylon included an erroneous reference from the Village of Babylon Historical & Preservation Society about the ownership of Moses' home. He owned it; he did not rent it. The president of the society corrected the error in a letter dated Oct. 23.

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL; 
Neighbors Collide With Proposed Revival of Freight Line

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES

DATELINE: KENILWORTH 

 BODY:
THE rusting railroad tracks pass within 20 feet of the south side of Carol Westervelt's house, a gray Cape Cod on Faitoute Avenue, but no freight train has used them for more than a decade. Having been told by the railroad that the tracks were abandoned, she and her husband extended a hedge from their front yard across them and erected a fence over them in back. 
 The idea was to keep people from dumping garbage along the right of way and cars from taking short cuts to Michigan Avenue, which borders their back yard to the east . Gesturing toward the rail bed one recent morning, she said, "One year we had a drunk who thought this was a street and actually drove down." 
 In many places in Union County, scrub brush has taken over this railroad line. Some people have planted flowers to make the rail bed look a little more pleasing. Few thought the line would be used again. 
But much to the chagrin of many residents, Union County, with the state's blessing, has initiated a plan to rehabilitate some 12 miles of track, through eight towns from Linden to Summit, and to reactivate limited freight service.
The plan, which the Board of Freeholders gave final approval in June, has run into heavy opposition from residents along the route. Their concerns about safety and quality of life have prompted a lawsuit by officials in five towns to derail the plan.
It has also raised questions, including one on the plan's cost. Neither Union County, Morristown & Erie Railway Inc., which the county chose to reactivate the line, nor the State Department of Transportation seems to have a figure because no current cost analysis has been done. 
"We don't have an estimation of the total cost," County Manager George W. Devanney said in a telephone interview.
That alone, says Mayor Michael A. Tripodi of Kenilworth, a leading opponent, makes the viability of the plan questionable, 
"The railroad is supposed to have an operating plan, and they're still developing it," Mayor Tripodi said. "It's a very simple issue. When you're starting up a business you have to have a business plan to know the impact, feasibility, and cost benefit analysis. None of this has been done."
Union County says it can count on $7.5 million from a state transportation bond fund. State transportation officials, however, say state aid amounts to $5.5 million.
Critics contend that clearing debris and vegetation, replacing rotted ties, laying new track, installing warning devices and repairing old bridges, as well as replacing at least three that have been torn down, could cost tens of millions more. 
Mr. Devanney says no county money will be spent and defends the plan as fostering economic development.
"The purpose is to provide service and enhance local business and take trucks off the road by servicing local business," Mr. Devanney said. 
But many argue that freight service ended a decade ago for a lack of business.
"In actual fact, the railroad will bring noise, diesel exhaust pollution and traffic congestion," Herbert Slote, a Springfield resident, wrote in a position paper for a group of residents along the route called Stop the Train. "It will create physical hazards along the at-grade right of way, imperil emergency services, depreciate real estate values and erode the tax base without contributing any economic benefit to the community." 
Mr. Devanney , who indicated the county could not legally stop the train service, said the county made the best deal it could by choosing to contract with a short-line railroad service serving local customers rather than heavy long-distance carriers like CSX and Norfolk Southern, both of which had expressed interest in the lines. 
"We would have all the headaches of a heavy freight service and no benefits to business in Union County," he said.
Under the 10-year contract, three trains with a maximum of 15 cars will be permitted to use the tracks each week in the first year of operation and no more than three to five trains will be permitted per week beginning in the third year. Maximum speed will be 25 miles an hour.
The county will receive a fee of $2 from the M.&E. for use of the track and share in a percentage of the revenue: 8 percent in excess of $65,000 per month up to $155,000 and 10 percent of revenue over $155,000 a month plus 10 percent of rail-related property rights revenue. 
Although critics say the revenue will go toward maintenance, Mr. Devanney said the money would be made available to towns for economic development along the line. 
The current situation evolved when two railroad companies abandoned the lines: the Staten Island Railway Corporation in 1991 and the Rahway Valley Railroad Company in 1992. 
In 1994, the State Department of Transportation bought the lines and in June 2000, Union County signed an agreement with the department to rehabilitate and reactivate them. On May 9, 2002, after seeking requests for proposals from three railroad companies, Mr. Devanney said the county chose M.&E. based on its safety and service record. The Federal Surface Transportation Board approved the agreement that June.
Opponents contend that county officials never gave the municipalities sufficient notice of its plan and then reneged on a promise to abandon it if the municipal governments opposed it. 
"They kept telling us it wasn't going to happen and in the meantime, they had already signed an agreement," said JoAnn Dillon, who with her neighbor, Ms. Westervelt, organized the Stop the Train in the summer of 2002.Mr. Devanney countered by saying that the county transportation advisory board, which includes members appointed by the mayors, had been exploring the resumption of freight service for a decade. In all, there have been more than 100 public meetings, he added. "This is something people have been aware of over the last decade," he said.
Ms. Dillon, a secretary to the Springfield schools superintendent, and Ms. Westervelt, an accountant, went to a council meeting to asked Mayor Tripodi and council members about the plan. "They didn't know what we were talking about," she said. 
In late June 2002, a month and a half after the operating agreement had been reached, the mayors received a letter from Gordon R. Fuller, M.&E. chief operating officer. His company, he said, had been chosen to rehabilitate the line and reactivate service.
In early August, however, the mayors received a letter from Mr. Devanney, who wrote that the track work was meant "to address safety and public health concerns" and that it "should not be viewed as a precursor to the start up of rail service."
As sentiment against the project grew, the Board of Freeholders passed a resolution in late August saying the reactivation would not be approved without consent of the municipalities. Many towns quickly adopted resolutions opposing the project.
In the next year, opponents received assurances from county officials that no train would run without the consent of the towns. But the railroad then threatened to sue the county for breach of contract. 
"After nine months of a legal review, one by a Washington attorney who specialized in transportation and one by a local New Jersey counsel, it was determined that the resolution was unenforceable," Mr. Devanney said. 
As a result, the council made the rail line's reactivation official on June 5, authorizing Mr. Devanney to implement the plan's remaining phases. 
Critics say the procedure the county followed was further flawed because no environmental impact, economic feasibility or traffic and safety studies were conducted.
Mr. Fuller said in a telephone interview, "Environmental impact studies were done when the state took over the property. There's no need to do a new one. What we're doing is replicating what was there before."
Mr. Devanney said the State Department of Transportation was responsible for analyzing traffic and safety issues, but Kris Kolluri, the department's chief of staff, said such a study probably would be necessary only if the track is built into areas currently not on the existing right of way. 
Five of the eight affected towns -- Kenilworth, Roselle, Roselle Park, Springfield and Summit -- filed suit in state Superior Court opposing the plan, pinpointing these and other issues. 
In addition, the five towns have hired a Washington law firm, Patton Boggs with expertise in railroad law to ask the Federal Surface Transportation Board to review its decision allowing resumption of service. 
Stop the Train officials say trains will travel over 28 unprotected crossings at grade. Those crossings include Faitoute Avenue and busy roads like Michigan Avenue here, Westfield Avenue in Roselle Park, Mountain Avenue in Springfield and Route 22 in Union.
"You're talking about reactivating railroad lines that were originally constructed a hundred years ago when this was rural New Jersey," said Bruce H. Bergen, the Springfield Township Attorney.
Opponents question whether the rail service will have enough customers.
"Here they're doing something and they hope people will come," said Robert J. Sheehan, a Summit representative of Stop the Train. "Remember the movie, 'Field of Dreams?' Well it's a field of dreams with our tax money. "
Mr. Fuller, who acknowledged that his company had done no survey of businesses, used the same analogy but in a positive way.
"What we found when we took over the Morristown & Erie, many of the customers we serve now weren't there when we started service," he said. "When you provide service, people will come to you. It's not quite like 'Field of Dreams' but when you have the opportunity to provide rail service to the local customer, yes, we have the customers come to us." 
As for the cost of rehabilitating the tracks and implementing service, he said: "Can't tell yet. We're waiting for information from the state diagnostic team on the type of crossing warning devices that are necessary and we've got several bridges to rebuild and we haven't gotten any information on this yet either." 
He noted that while his company had not done an economic analysis of costs and revenue, "The county and state have."
Mr. Devanney said the county made a preliminary analysis that estimated costs would reach $7.5 million. That figure was included in a county engineering study about five years ago.
And Mr. Kolluri said the state's agreement did not require a cost analysis. Noting that he had not been told the total cost either, he said, "The money we've given is what was asked of us because that was the cost of the project and I've not heard it's going to be more than that."
Mr. Devanney said work on the Staten Island rail line section would be completed in 2004 and the Rahway Valley portion in 2005. He acknowledged that there was not enough money to complete the project and said he did not know where additional money would come from. 
"The current estimate is that $7.5 million will take us to the Township of Union," Mr. Devanney said. "Obviously it will be more expensive than our initial projection. Clearly it's not enough to do the whole job."
Asked what the options were, he said, "If there's no additional funding, that's where it will stop. It will run from Linden to Union."

HEADLINE: Bone Diagnosis Gives New Data But No Answers 

BYLINE:  By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
The disease, if it is a disease, afflicts most middle-aged and elderly women, and a large segment of men. But it has no symptoms, it is not clear what patients should do about it and it is being diagnosed more and more often.
 The condition is osteopenia, or low bone density. It is considered by many doctors to be a first step along the path to osteoporosis, a serious condition in which bone density is extremely low and bones are porous and prone to shatter. But researchers say that while bone density predicts fracture risk, more is involved, including age, family history and a poorly understood factor known as bone quality. 
 Those nuances may be lost, researchers say, as patients fixate on a number -- bone density -- and a diagnosis -- osteopenia -- and fear that unless they take action their fates are sealed. 
Doctors are telling women to find out their bone density as soon as they go through menopause. Younger women as well as middle-aged men are also getting tested.
The tests are easy to come by, with special X-ray machines springing up at hospitals and free-standing screening centers, offering scans for about $125. Small, portable bone density testing machines are turning up in doctors' offices and in shopping centers and drugstores, with scans that cost about $40.
But the painless screening test and quick diagnosis by no means offer patients and doctors a simple answer. Osteopenia, it turns out, is yet another diagnosis that strikes at the core of debates emblematic of modern medicine, when screening can get ahead of treatment, or even the understanding of a condition, medical experts say.
The stakes are particularly high with osteopenia because the number of patients is enormous. One federal study in which more than 14,000 men and women were screened estimated, conservatively, that osteopenia afflicts 13 million to 17 million women and 1 million to 2 million men in this country. 
"Most people would agree that if someone has osteoporosis, you should treat them," said Dr. Ethel Siris, who is a professor of clinical medicine at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons and directs the Toni Stabile Osteoporosis Center at New York Presbyterian Hospital. But, she added, "no one knows what to do about the woman who has quote unquote osteopenia."
Dr. Joan McGowan, chief of the musculoskeletal diseases branch at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, said that, of course, drug companies see a huge market in people with low bone density, and who could blame them?
Also at stake is the calcium supplement market. Many people take calcium supplements in the hope of staving off bone loss. While a large federal study is investigating their effectiveness, researchers say that calcium may have a small effect but is not going to obliterate the effects of menopause or aging.
"It is very difficult for people to accept menopausal bone loss and bone loss from aging without trying to stop it," Dr. McGowan said. "Since every woman in America is going to go through menopause and have accelerated bone loss, every woman in America is a candidate for some type of treatment. The problem we have in the bone field is identifying people who have a high risk of fracture and not those who may be perfectly normal." 
Opinions range from dismissing the condition as largely an invented problem to urging that nearly everyone who has it starts treatment. 
"We have medicalized a nonproblem," said Dr. Michael McClung, director of the Oregon Osteoporosis Center. Most people with the condition, he said, have bone densities that are below average but not below normal. "Only in Lake Wobegon is everyone above average," he said. While some women may need treatment, many more do not, he added.
Dr. James Simon, president of the North American Menopause Society, begs to differ. Once bone starts being lost, it is time to think about taking action, he said, with the only question being how low should bone density go before consideration of treatment begins. He added that, in his opinion, if the drugs were free, "the argument would largely go away."
"Fractures don't wait until you are osteoporotic or barely osteoporotic or osteopenic or barely osteopenic," Dr. Simon said. "Fractures increase with decreases in bone density and once you fracture, you put yourself at a dramatically increased risk of a future fracture."
Complicating the situation is the fall from grace of hormone therapy for menopause. Last year, when a large federal study indicated that the drugs were riskier than many had realized, many women stopped taking them. Doctors are now advising these women to have a bone density test.
"Women going off their hormones has re-upped the ante about whether some alternative treatment should be started," Dr. Simon said. "It really is an issue now."
Drugs to prevent or treat osteoporosis include bisphosphonates like Merck's Fosamax, which permanently bind to bone; parathyroid hormone, which is generally reserved for severe osteoporosis; Eli Lilly's Evista, which acts like estrogen on bone but also can cause hot flashes and blood clots; and calcitonin, a less effective treatment that is administered as a nasal spray. Worldwide sales of osteoporosis drugs reached $3.98 billion last year.
There are no national data on the number of people with osteopenia who are treated. But Merck estimates, from its own market research, that about 8 million women have been found to have osteopenia and about a third of them are taking an osteoporosis drug.
Osteopenia was defined in June 1992 at a World Health Organization meeting in order to prompt governments to pay attention to the problem of bone loss. 
Dr. L. Joseph Melton, an osteoporosis epidemiologist at the Mayo Clinic who attended the meeting, said the group decided to identify a new condition, osteopenia, for people 50 and older with lower than average bone density who did not have osteoporosis. It would encompass a bone density that was one standard deviation below that of a normal young adult. (The group also defined osteoporosis as 2.5 standard deviations or more below that reference point.)
"It was just meant to indicate the emergence of a problem," Dr. Melton said of the definition. "It didn't have any particular diagnostic or therapeutic significance. It was just meant to show a huge group who looked like they might be at risk."
But that is not how it has been interpreted, said Dr. Steven R. Cummings, of the University of California in San Francisco.
"There is no basis, no biological, social, economic or treatment basis, no basis whatsoever, for using minus one." Dr. Cummings said. "As a consequence, though, more than half of the population is told arbitrarily that they have a condition they need to worry about."
One problem is that bone density fails to capture a poorlyunderstood factor known as bone quality, which declines with age, researchers say. 
"A 50-year-old woman with a bone density that is clearly in the osteoporotic range has a much lower risk of having a fracture in the next year or the next five years than an 80-year-old woman with the same bone density," Dr. McGowan said. "It's definitely something about the quality of the bone changing." 
As bone scanning took off, new problems emerged, including what constitutes low bone density in men. 
With women, the standard comparison is to the bone density of a 30-year-old white woman. Comparing men's bones to those of a 30-year-old white man means that nearly half of all middle-aged men have osteopenia, said Dr. Anne Looker of the National Center for Health Statistics. But men have just 35 percent the risk of hip fractures as women.
There also are questions of what different machines are measuring. The first scans were with X-rays, known as Dexa, for dual-energy X-ray abosorptiometry. Newer cheap and portable scanners use ultrasound, and portable X-ray machines measure density in the heel. But a Merck study directed by Dr. Siris found that the prevalence of osteopenia varied from 28 to 45 percent depending on the type of machine.
Then comes the question of whom to treat. While osteoporosis drugs do slow bone loss, it has been difficult to show that they prevent fractures in people with osteopenia, maybe because their fracture rate is already so low. "If people aren't having fractures," Dr. McClung said, "you can't prevent them."
For example, Dr. McClung asked if Fosamax helped in women with osteopenia. After six years, he found, the women taking Fosamax had a higher bone density than women taking a placebo but no fewer fractures. 
It usually takes 10 to 15 years after menopause before women get osteoporosis.
"If you are going to seriously try to prevent hip or spine fractures later in life, you want to be confident that these drugs will work in 5 or 10 years," Dr. Cummings said. "A number of us are concerned that long-term treatments with drugs of this sort that stop the turnover of bone may lead to a lesser effect or no effect or even increase the risk of fracture."
Bones, he explained, are constantly being remodeled, breaking down and growing in a process that, until middle age or so, is in balance. With bisphosphonates, remodeling is slowed. "That turnover in bone, that cellular activity, seems to be a very strong indicator in risk of fractures," Dr. Cummings said. "You want turnover, because if bone is not replaced over 30 years, it can weaken because of microscopic damage. Some of us believe that old, highly mineralized bone is more brittle, more prone to break."
Some osteoporosis experts, like Dr. Siris, follow guidelines issued by the National Osteoporosis Foundation (www.nof.org). She focuses on women and looks at other factors besides bone density. Did the woman have any fractures after menopause? That greatly increases her risk. Does she smoke? Is she small and thin? Does she have a family history of osteoporosis? Is she taking drugs like corticosteroids that suppress the immune system and can increase her risk? Dr. Siris suggests bone density screening for 50-year-old women with additional risk factors for osteoporosis and tells others they can wait until they are 60 or 65.
"You've got to have a strategy for dealing with this huge mass of women," Dr. Siris said. "What do you do?"

Expect to Pay More At the Gas Pump

BYLINE:  By Eric Pfanner

 BODY:
YOUR taxes, in a manner of speaking, were raised last week. If you didn't notice, perhaps that is because it happened in Vienna.
 "Old Europe" strikes again? Not quite. While the decision was made in the capital of decadent kaffeehaus culture, the Viennese were simply the hosts for a meeting of OPEC oil ministers, who made life a bit rougher for Americans. 
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has had a quiet couple of decades, losing market share and watching its influence over energy prices wane. In Iraq War II, it took it easy on its customers, pumping more oil to keep prices in check. Perhaps as a result, there has been no real American move to force Iraq, which sits on the world's second-largest oil reserves, out of OPEC.
The oilmen are taking back some of their largesse. Last week, they moved to cut output by 900,000 barrels per day as of Nov. 1, catching the experts by surprise. Prices in the energy markets soared. Soon they should rise at the pump, unless demand slows, Iraq quickly ramps up exports or non-OPEC producers like Russia pick up the slack.
And that means Americans are getting a tax increase. Analysts estimate that a one-cent rise in the price of a gallon of gasoline at the filling station cuts overall consumer spending in the United States by $1 billion.
In some parts of the country, gasoline prices have already been hovering around $2 per gallon. A 5 percent rise -- roughly the amount by which crude-oil prices rose in the two days after the OPEC move -- amounts to about 10 cents, or $10 billion in lost spending. Oil-market math is never that simple, but by any calculation the United States economy suffers when energy prices rise.
Some OPEC officials made noises about possible further cuts, though. They cited the so-called jobless recovery as one factor that will curb demand. Fewer trips to the office mean fewer rides to the mall and fewer stops at the gas station.
Oil ministers also said they were optimistic about Iraq's ability to protect its oil facilities from sabotage, allowing it to raise output to prewar levels by March.
If not, further tax increases may be on the way.

Another Good News, Bad News Kind of Day

BYLINE:  By Robert Strauss

 BODY:
For Governor McGreevey, the news these days offers a mixed bag. For instance, while voters do not seem to be overly fond of the Governor, they don't think he's the state's biggest problem either. 
 A new Quinnipiac University poll released last week said Mr. McGreevey has broken the 50 percent mark. An all-time high of 52 percent don't think he is doing a good job, as against 35 percent who do. 
 On the other hand, the poll noted that 29 percent of those surveyed think taxes, both income and property, are the state's biggest problem, followed by the 13 percent who blame the economy and 11 percent who cite education. Only 4 percent blame politicians the most for the state's woes, and only half of them single out Governor McGreevey. Robert Strauss

Miscasting W.U.S.A.'s Target Audience

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
They came out in force Thursday night for the United States versus Nigeria in the Women's World Cup, the pigtailed hooligans in their Mia Hamm jerseys and painted faces, their voices collected into a familiar shriek of adulation.
 My 13-year-old daughter, Julie-Ann, was not among them. 
 Not that she dislikes soccer. Far from it. She plays on a travel team, once wore her uniform to school on career day and has incorporated her jersey number into her e-mail address. 
She has met many of the American stars, and they have been kind. Hamm signed autographs for her entire team. She has high-fived Julie Foudy on the sideline after W.U.S.A. games and chatted with Brandi Chastain. She keeps their autographs on the wall, beside her pictures of the rapper Eminem and the actor Ashton Kutcher. But she went to soccer practice Thursday, rather than attend the World Cup match.
"It's interesting to play, but boring to watch," Julie-Ann said. "Like baseball."
In a broader sense, I wonder if this adolescent disconnect figured prominently in the recent collapse of the Women's United Soccer Association. Apart from corporate indifference and a weak economy, did the league disengage the very fans who should have been its most ardent supporters?
James Chung thinks so. He is the president of Reach Advisors, a Boston-based marketing research firm serving companies that focus on families and youth. His firm conducted independent consumer research on the W.U.S.A. and found several miscalculations by the league, Chung said in an interview and e-mail correspondence.
First, he said, the W.U.S.A. tried to sell itself to sponsors as a vehicle to reach soccer moms. "Unfortunately," Chung said, "the soccer mom phenomenon is dead. Not that fewer kids are playing soccer, but Generation X moms do not identify themselves as soccer moms as much as their baby boom predecessors. The W.U.S.A. was trying to push a societal trend that prospective sponsors had already discarded."
He refers to advertising for the Nissan Quest that declares, "Moms have changed," a signal that minivan ads are turning 180 degrees from the soccer mom concept.
Secondly, Chung said, the league should have targeted soccer dads, a strategy used by organizers of the hugely successful 1999 Women's World Cup. It is fathers who generally push their daughters into the sport, and who were more likely to buy W.U.S.A. tickets and merchandise, Chung said.
"The W.U.S.A. still subscribed to the theory that family decisions were driven by moms, when a good portion of their ticket sales were actually driven by an audience that they did not address," he said.
Perhaps the most troubling discovery in his research was that girls -- the W.U.S.A.'s core audience -- found the league to be "uncool" once they reached middle school. They became "somewhat embarrassed" to consider themselves fans or to wear league merchandise, he said. When they watched games on television, they tended to watch them alone instead of with friends.
Kate Sobrero, a defender on the national team, said that societal pressures on adolescent girls "made it tough to have your own identity at that age."
Julie-Ann, my daughter, said that a lack of advertising and news media coverage about women's soccer, and women's sports in general, made them less desirable.
"You always know when the Eagles are going to play football, but you never know when there is going to be a soccer game," Julie-Ann said. "If you don't hear about it, you are not going to be interested."
We bought season tickets to Philadelphia Charge matches for the inaugural season in 2001. In 2002, Julie-Ann attended only a couple of matches. This past season, she had zero interest. She keeps a Charge rally towel on the wall in the basement, but as of now, has no Charge to rally. 
An inexperienced W.U.S.A. staff, Chung said, violated a cardinal rule of youth marketing: you do not advertise yourself to the age of your core audience, but to the age your core audience aspires to be.
In other words, if the league had played down "sugar and spice" wholesomeness campaigns meant to attract 8- to 12-year-olds, and sold the concept of the players as strong women, the W.U.S.A. could have kept the youth audience and also made itself relevant to a much wider group of adolescent girls and young women.
"If you speak solely to that 'tween' audience of 8- to 12-year-olds," Chung said, "you almost guarantee the teenage audience will run away from you."
Meanwhile, W.U.S.A. average attendance dipped in each of the league's three seasons, from 8,116 in 2001 to 6,957 in 2003. And the league struggled to attract more than 100,000 television households before suspending operations.
This was disappointing, Chung said, because the W.U.S.A. "had incredibly strong assets to turn itself into one of the coolest brands out there for older girls -- and guys." He added, "But the league would have had to break out of the mind-set that they were selling women's soccer, and start behaving like an entertainment marketer."
Perhaps the mistakes can be corrected. The W.U.S.A. is considering returning in some altered form, with a condensed schedule or with its eight teams concentrated in four cities. He hopes the league survives, Chung said. He is the father of a young daughter and wants the sport to be a part of her life. He would love to become a soccer dad himself. 
"I hope it's not wishful thinking," he said.

 GREAT FORTUNE
The Epic of Rockefeller Center.
By Daniel Okrent.
Illustrated. 512 pp. New York:
Viking. $29.95.
When Rockefeller Center's design was unveiled, Lewis Mumford, the urban planner and architecture critic, declared that it followed "the canons of Cloudcuckooland." Its decorative scheme was, he complained, "bad with an almost juvenile badness." If this misguided project was "the best our architects can do with freedom," Mumford fulminated, "they deserve to remain in chains." 
"They all laughed at Rockefeller Center," the Gershwin lyric goes, but the early reaction was nothing so benign. Newspapers overflowed with letters to the editor excoriating the complex as the "ugliest conglomeration of buildings in New York," and a "disgraceful symbol of a generation." One leading architect urged that it go up "as quickly as possible," because the sooner it was done "the sooner we shall be able to clear the ground and begin again." 
But before long, as Gershwin noted, they were "fighting to get in." And Rockefeller Center had established itself as one of the best-loved and most critically revered cityscapes in New York, or anywhere else. Today, its mere mention summons lush images of Manhattan at its swankest: late-night cocktails at the Rainbow Room; the Art Deco splendor of Radio City Music Hall.
How Rockefeller Center came to be, and its dramatic ascent in the popular imagination, are the subject of "Great Fortune," an absorbing, brightly written history by Daniel Okrent, who was a longtime top editor at Time Inc. Okrent delves into the history and pulls out an array of intriguing men, most of them little known, who have greater bragging rights to Rockefeller Center than the man whose name it bears. 
Ask a New Yorker which Rockefeller was responsible for Rockefeller Center, and the response will likely be John D. Rockefeller Sr., the great Standard Oil monopolist. But the family patriarch played no part in its creation, and may never even have visited. It was John D. Rockefeller Jr., known well into his adulthood as Junior, who took on the project and put up the money, in a Depression economy that left even him strapped for cash. 
Junior had a privileged childhood, as the son of the world's first billionaire, but one steeped in the flinty Baptist faith of his mother, Laura Celestia Spelman Rockefeller. "I am glad my son has told me what he wants for Christmas," Mrs. Rockefeller once said to a neighbor, "so now it can be denied him." While his father was the quintessential robber baron -- Ida Tarbell, the famed muckraker, detected in him "craftiness, cruelty and something indefinably repulsive" -- Junior was made of milder stuff. When the president of the Standard Oil Trust was caught up in a bribery scandal, Junior pronounced himself "sickened." He was deeply moved after visiting Ludlow, Colo., the site of the infamous Ludlow Massacre, in which 13 women and children were killed in antiunion violence at a Rockefeller-owned coal field. Partly, in Okrent's words, to "change the word 'Rockefeller' from the signifier of rapacious greed to a symbol of enlightened citizenship," Junior embarked on an energetic philanthropic career, building Riverside Church and what would later become Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, donating the land for the United Nations, and creating the Cloisters and Colonial Williamsburg. 
The idea for Rockefeller Center fell into Junior's lap, dropped there by the financier Otto Kahn, who wanted to build a new opera house. In time, the opera house would fall out of the planning, but Junior was enthusiastic about the idea of tearing down a stretch of speakeasies and rooming houses in midtown -- which, as it happened, neighbored on his own mansion -- and building something grander. He leased the land from Columbia University and hired John R. Todd, a wily, hard-driving developer (and grandfather of the former governor of New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman), to make the dream a reality. 
From January 1929, when the Columbia lease was signed, to November 1939, when the U.S. Rubber building was officially completed, a colorful array of visionaries, artisans and schemers contributed to the undertaking. The book is at its best when it rescues these figures from obscurity. Charles O. Heydt, who started out as a 14-year-old office boy and rose to handle the Rockefellers' real estate transactions, extracted the land from Columbia on favorable terms. Ray Hood, a struggling architect who had recently won a competition to design the Chicago Tribune tower, drew up blueprints for the RCA Building and set the aesthetic tone for the whole complex. Donald Deskey, a modernist who went on to design the Crest toothpaste tube, was responsible for Radio City's opulent interiors. 
Rockefeller Center struggled in its early years, the worst of the Depression. It had an anchor tenant, the National Broadcasting Company, that lent the complex the name "Radio City," as well as undeniable cachet. But despite aggressive marketing and highly discounted rents, new lessees were hard to come by. To cut its losses, the Rockefeller family engaged in some strategic self-dealing: Standard Oil of New Jersey moved in, as did the Rockefeller Foundation. After World War II, as the national economy recovered, Rockefeller Center hit its stride. By April 1946, it had achieved the once unimaginable: a sizable waiting list. Before Rockefeller Center was finally sold off, it would become, in the assessment of family insiders, "by far the largest single repository" of Rockefeller wealth. 
Okrent has a good time with the most storied parts of Rockefeller Center lore. In his telling of the Diego Rivera mural fiasco, which ended with the radical artist's work in the RCA Building being destroyed, it was Frida Kahlo, Rivera's wife, who forced the showdown. Kahlo was the one, he suggests, who insisted on including touches like Lenin's head and upper-class women surrounded by gonorrhea and syphilis germs, and it was she (aided by Rivera's young assistant, Ben Shahn) who would not let them be removed. 
The history of the Rockettes appears in detail, as does the sad story of S. L. Rothafel, better known as Roxy, the larger-than-life impresario responsible for putting them on the Radio City stage. There are walk-ons by Gregory Peck and the writer and Trappist monk Thomas Merton, both of whom were briefly tour guides; Arturo Toscanini, who conducted the NBC Symphony from the famed Studio 8H; and Georgia O'Keeffe, who was bullied by her husband, the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, into giving up the chance to paint a massive mural. 
The humorist Fran Lebowitz has written that one problem with children is that they "will persist in discussing the color of a recently sighted cement mixer long after one's own interest in the topic has waned." So it often is with authors of books about building projects. Okrent's fascination is not with cement mixers, but with architectural planning and contractual arrangements. In the case of, say, the financial negotiations between Rockefeller and Columbia University less, as a noted architect said in another context, would be more.
A greater flaw is the book's failure to situate Rockefeller Center in a larger historical context, or to extract deeper meaning. It would be interesting to get more of Okrent's thoughts about the project's impact on the development of New York City. How important a role did it play in making Midtown Manhattan the center of world business it was to become? How influential was it on development in other cities? 
The book also has a light touch -- too light -- with the most unsettling parts of the story. Black employees were largely unwelcome at Rockefeller Center -- in the case of the Rockettes until as recently as 1987. Workers, represented by a toothless company union, were routinely mistreated. And the city was robbed of its fair share of this undertaking, since Junior, called by one critic New York's "Chief Tax Dolee," had a knack for keeping assessments low. Okrent notes all this in passing but, as his title suggests, he writes as a fan. The book ends by quoting a writer's sunny reflection that "Rockefeller Center begets a sauntering mood." It is an aesthetically justifiable, if not exactly earth-shattering, conclusion.
Of course, in an age when construction projects so often produce bland monstrosities, the ability to induce sauntering should not be discounted. Even Mumford was won over by Rockefeller Center in the end: he eventually pronounced it "a serene eyeful" and "the most exciting mass of buildings in the city." And generations of visitors, tourists and locals alike, have been moved to feel something like Gertrude Stein's modernist encomium: "The view of Rockefeller Center from Fifth Avenue is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen ever seen ever seen."

HEADLINE: The Personal Is the Antipolitical 

BYLINE:  By Michael Lewis; Michael Lewis is a contributing writer for the magazine. His most recent book is "Moneyball."

 BODY:
The Sacramento directory offers no listing for Charlotte Goland, and so I have no choice but to show up, unannounced, at the address on her check. I don't usually hunt down strangers in their homes, but unusual times call for unusual methods. This woman, unreachable by phone, is herself a clue to a mystery: how did California go so quickly from order to chaos? Republicans say it's because Gray Davis caused and then covered up the state's financial crisis. Democrats claim the attempt to remove Davis from office just six months after he was legally elected is a right-wing conspiracy. Both are obviously wrong. What we have here is a crime of passion, committed by the people upon their ruler. It demands an investigation. 
 I find Charlotte Goland's home behind a tall hedge, hidden from the street. No sign of life. It is Dave Gilliard's fault that I'm here, peering through some stranger's window. Gilliard is the Sacramento political consultant hired by U.S. Representative Darrell Issa to gather the signatures necessary to put the recall of Gov. Gray Davis to the voters. Issa promised Gilliard he'd give him whatever it took -- about $2 million, as it turned out -- and Gilliard made it happen. Throughout the summer he supervised, in what passes for a skyscraper in downtown Sacramento, an entire floor filled with college students opening mail and sorting signatures. He didn't ask people for money, but money poured in anyway, in heartbreakingly tiny amounts. So when this bigger check landed on his desk, it was the amount ($2,000!) that first caught Gilliard's eye. Two grand -- he now noticed the woman's name, Charlotte Goland -- was the biggest unsolicited donation he'd received so far. Then Gilliard saw the mailing address: Wilhaggin Drive. The lady lived next door to Gov. Gray Davis. 
 In California, the governor's residence is not a mansion, just an upper-middle-class house, one of 13 similar houses that encircle a small, communal pond in the neighborhood of Lake Wilhaggin. At length I get up my nerve and ring Charlotte Goland's doorbell. A small dog yaps, then spastically hurls its body against the door. For the longest time I hear nothing, and then comes a shout: "Ugly Edna!"
A woman, white-haired, in a bathrobe, opens the door but just a crack. She's clearly more worried about my getting in than in Ugly Edna's getting out. I explain that I've come to find out why she paid $2,000 to get rid of her neighbor. She breaks into a big smile and throws open the door. "Because I don't like him!" she booms. "Want to come in and talk about it?"
Charlotte Goland is 79, elderly without being old. She's tall and straight, and she laughs enough for two. She apologizes for the bathrobe -- she has just had a pacemaker installed. It had never occurred to her to get involved in politics. She doesn't care all that much about the state's $38 billion budget deficit, for instance, though she agreed it would be nice if it didn't exist. In 79 years, she tells me, she has never once given money or put up signs or passed out literature or encouraged politicians in any way. 
But that morning in May, when she opened the form letter asking her to sign a petition to recall Gray Davis, she felt a little shiver of delight. Unlike most everyone else in California, she took the time to read the fine print at the top, along with Davis's rebuttal at the bottom, the stuff about how this was the work of right-wingers and was going to cost the taxpayer millions of dollars. She signed it instantly, and then she wrote out the check for $2,000 and slipped it in the return envelope. She didn't tell anyone about it -- not even Claudia, her daughter, who lives next door. 
Charlotte cannot quite put her finger on why she so despises Gray Davis. She met him in 1999 when he moved into the governor's house. The Lake Wilhaggin association gave a welcoming party for Davis just as it had for his predecessors. Charlotte tried to make small talk with the governor at the party but finally gave up. "He's a cold cookie. . . . Wooooo-eeee," she says. "Never changes his expression. Deadpan-like." 
For five years now she has watched the man come and go. He passes by in his limo, windows always up, without ever once saying so much as hello. "Maybe I'm stubborn," she says. "But I've got such a violent reaction to the man. It's a gut reaction. I don't like him. It's intuitive. I'm not really sure this feeling I have for him would be as strong if I didn't live here next to him." She motions to the pond out her back window. "You'd never see him out there. He just goes in that house and shuts the doors and closes the curtains." She says she doesn't believe there is a trace of originality in her view of Gray Davis; the neighbors she knows all share it. "You ought to talk to some other people here," she says. 
I ring another doorbell, another lunatic dog barks and hurls itself against the door. 
"The Deukmejians," Claudia Goland says, as she sinks into her deep sofa, after she has locked her mongrel in the bedroom. "God, they were wonderful people. She drove an old Cutlass. Didn't give a damn. Had two dogs. They'd have us over at least once a year, for Christmas brunch. Mimosas, all kinds of things. And Pete Wilson," she continues, "he's a nice man. She's very junior-league president -- and there's nothing wrong with that. They had parties, just like the Deukmejians. She loves to sing. They'd get us all out in the living room with the piano and sing show tunes. They lived here. Every evening they'd take walks. And then this guy comes in."
There is no need to ask whom she means.
"The only other sign we see of him is when they bring out his dog sniffers. Yes! Can you believe it? We've now got dogs sniffing for bombs. They run around every house getting all the dogs riled up."
"Does everyone around here have a dog?"
She thinks about that. "Jenny Ferguson has a Lab and a retriever. Cheryl Osborn has two little yapper dogs. . . . " She goes on listing them. "I guess most of us do have dogs, now that I think about it."
"Does the governor have dogs?"
She hoots her mother's hoot at the absurdity of the question. "He's not the dog type," she says.
Claudia, too, has sour memories of the welcoming party that the association gave Gray Davis. "The first thing out of his mouth was, 'We need a new governor's mansion.' That man is like" -- she searches for the word -- "paste," she finally says. "Like gray paste. Not one ounce of charisma there. I thought you had to have charisma to raise money. How the hell does he raise all that money?"
Like her mother, Claudia has a genius for finding things that amuse her. But the only time she finds amusement in Gray Davis is when she recalls the gay couple who moved into the neighborhood. The two men had no curtains, and their guest bedroom faced the governor's front door. One day the governor's social secretary called the head of the association to inform her that the governor's security cameras -- no one even knew Davis had them -- had caught the two men . . . well, Claudia doesn't know how to say what they were doing. "Fornicating," she finally says. "They were fornicating, let's just say, for the governor." She stops. "I don't want to give you the wrong impression. They were very nice people. They went out to walk their dogs all the time. I guess they were trying to make a point to the governor." 

The Joy of Chaos
One delightful thing about the movement to chuck Gray Davis out of office is that so many people in so little time have come to suspect they might be the next governor. One hundred and thirty-five candidates paid the $3,500 and collected the 65 signatures needed to earn a place on the ballot. More than 500 went to the trouble of filing papers, most of whom were disqualified for one reason or another. In Santa Clara County -- the only one I checked -- 10 people asked for the papers for every one who filed them. If, say, 5,000 people went to the trouble of getting the papers necessary to run for governor, how many hundreds of thousands considered it -- if only for a moment? The 135 candidates have been treated as a small, distinct class of freaks, but really they are only the few who took that last little mental step. Here is another clue to the mystery of California democracy: a lot of Californians clearly believe that, to run this state, they don't need political experience.
Other than that shared hunch, the candidates don't have much in common. They can be classified only by motive. A few jumped in to stop the recall; by entering they thought they could help to make the whole thing seem ridiculous. At least one of these, Bill Prady, producer of hit TV shows ("Dharma and Greg," "Good Morning, Miami"), figured the race offered him a chance to satirize the entire political process. ("If I finish anywhere but last I will view it as a victory. If I get more than 100 votes, I'm going to view it as a mandate from the people to lead.") Some are in the race to advance their careers outside of politics -- the porn star Mary Carey, for example. Another dozen or so candidates hope only to advance a single issue -- witness the father's-issues writer Warren Farrell, who traces many social problems to his belief that feminism has been too successful. 
But by far the biggest class of candidates are those who are in this race to win. Among them are maybe 40 practical people -- doctors, engineers, small-business owners -- who suffer from what might be called the Ueberroth syndrome: when they look in the mirror they see the best person they know to fix things that are broken. Jon Zellhoefer is one of these candidates, but by midsummer he, and many others, had become a bit disillusioned with the process. Zellhoefer had begun to feel that lesser-known candidates like himself weren't getting a fair hearing. The odd thing about this is that there have been more than enough news media to go around; you can't find a candidate who hasn't been interviewed by "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer," featured in The San Jose Mercury News, tracked by a Danish film crew or studied by a panel of South American political scientists seeking deeper lessons about democracy. 
At any rate, Zellhoefer had an idea: get a bunch of candidates together to complain about it. The first meeting he arranged drew in 12 candidates and attracted little attention. The next one, on an aircraft carrier in Oakland, pulled in more than 40, along with some press. Sixty candidates were invited to the third meeting, which must count as the largest such assemblage in American history. They gather one Sunday morning in early September at a restaurant in Beverly Hills, observed by reporters and several TV cameras. 
Zellhoefer opens the proceedings by saying a few words about how he hopes the group, which ranges from socialists to libertarians, will "come up with a unified strategy that we can all accept." He simulates a stately tone and refers to everyone by the honorific "Candidate." Once he establishes the tone, he cedes the floor to Candidate Cheryl Bly-Chester.
Whatever else she is, Cheryl is a gamer. The other candidates have tended to wait for the world to discover them -- and it has! -- but Cheryl, who has kids and a job, has been everywhere. I'd turn up at the big rallies for Arnold Schwarzenegger, and there she'd be, in the middle of the thing, passing out her literature. At one of these, I asked her how she felt she was being treated. "Reporters stick their mikes in my face," she said, "and say, 'You're not going to win, so why are you running?' I never tell them what I actually think." 
"What do you think?" 
"What's in my mind when they ask me that is: 'You are going to be so embarrassed when I do win.' " 
She told me that when she learned how easy it was to get on the ballot, she reacted instantly. She had all these ideas for California, and yet had never run for public office. But then when the recall got under way, she said to herself, "Put up or shut up, Cheryl." She sat down and wrote up her qualifications, and, she says, "it looked like I'd been training to be governor my whole life." 
Her qualifications are impressive. She is impressive. In every respect but one she seemed perfectly sane, and so I could not believe she was serious. 
"Who do you really think is going to win?"
She adjusted her tone, as if she was now ready to have a free and frank exchange. "Honestly?"
"Honestly."
"Honestly, I think I'm going to be the next governor of California."
Cheryl now asks each candidate to rise and describe his constituency, real or imagined. Candidate Roscoe, for instance. The owner of a chain of tobacco shops, Ned Roscoe is a libertarian who sees his base as those Californians who smoke cigarettes. "I'm the special-interest candidate," Roscoe begins. If this were Old Maid, he'd be paired with Candidate Renz, a bar owner who opposes taxes on alcohol.
"Finally, honesty," says an immaculately groomed man across the table. I noticed him immediately when I arrived. He is not like the others. He alone does not seem interested in being mistaken for a man of the people. He wears big gold rings and a neatly pressed suit. He dresses like a man who wears cologne.
"But on Oct. 8," Roscoe says, ignoring him, "I know who is going to be governor." He pauses for dramatic effect. "Myself."
"Finally, lunacy," the well-pressed man says.
Again he is ignored. The candidates speak without serious incident for a full 10 minutes, then Gino Martorana, who owns an Italian restaurant outside Fresno, labors to his feet. Gino begins innocently enough. He says that he hopes the group can "show that there is civility in politics. Show that we're honestly and sincerely concerned about the state of California." He praises his fellow candidates for their willingness to mix it up. "The elite consider themselves above the fray," he says. "They think of us as. . . . "
"Commoners!" someone shouts.
"Even though we say 10 times more . . . ," someone else chimes in.
Gino agrees, but he also has one actual political view he feels compelled to express, something he seems to think they all can agree on. "This giving driver's licenses to illegal aliens . . . ," he begins, and then he is off on a rant to the effect that Gray Davis should be pistol-whipped for pandering to Latinos.
"Are we here to hear your views?"the critic with the gold rings shouts. 
"I only have one view," Gino says. "I think I'm entitled."
"But that's not appropriate. . . . "
"I'm entitled!" Gino says.
"I'm not here to listen to this!' the critic shouts. His name, it turns out, is Ron Palmieri, and he claims to be "the first openly gay candidate for governor in American history." But he isn't running for votes. He strongly opposes the recall and is running to make the point that everyone else running, and especially everyone in this room, is an ignorant fool. Gino, still standing, listens quietly to what Ron has to say, then blinks and, as if nothing has happened, continues: "Let's put it this way. For thirty-five hundred bucks I want to say what I got to say to somebody." 
For thirty-five hundred bucks I want to say what I got to say to somebody. A lot of heads nod at that one. Before the first openly gay candidate can strike back, Cheryl leaps in. "The whole purpose of this . . . ," she calmly begins. Cheryl is the leader here. You can see her thinking: I am proving by the manner with which I hold this group together my ability to do the job they all seek. But Gino's insistence, coupled with the revelation that among them is a Gray Davis supporter, has the room in an uproar. Cheryl shouts over the din: "Who agrees with Ron about the recall?" Amazingly, five hands go up. "O.K.," Cheryl says, "we should look for common ground of pro- and anti-recall people."
"I don't think a consensus is desirable or possible," says a new voice. It was Logan Darrow Clements, "the first objectivist candidate for governor, as far as I know." 
Candidate Zellhoefer, glancing nervously at the television cameras, rises to offer a proposal. "As a group," he says, "we will approach Governor Davis and say we are going to volunteer as an advisory committee. You're going to play ball with us. We're going to play ball with you. But it's going to be a different ballgame the next few years."
"The power of this group is the power to say whether Davis stays in or stays out," another candidate says. "That's a given."
Even Ron seems to like the drift of this. "Good!" he shouts. "All of you get together! Get out of this race!" 
But then they start to argue again, until Cheryl stops them. She suggests that they come up with a few "proclamations," points of agreement they can tell the press. Candidate Diane Templin (American Independent Party) likes the sound of this, and begins. "A: address the constitution." 
"What's that mean?" Ron says. When no answer comes, he adds, "What do we need sound bites for that don't mean anything?" 
"We need an A, B, C and D," Templin says. "What's your A?"
"No A," Ron says.
Zellhoefer, who has just sat down, stands up again. He has an A. "A: I would like us to say that after this election we are all going to run for office again." 
I expect the whole bunch of them to burst out laughing, but they don't. Only Ron does. "Ha!" he shouts. "Ha! Ha! I'm not running for office. I'm going back to Bel Air."
Ten minutes later, they are done. They line up as if for a class photo, facing the media, and recite the four principles they have agreed upon: A) We will document what we have learned and we will not go away. B) A balanced budget will be good for California. We have the experience in this group to balance the budget. C) We have the experience and determination to clean house. D) Elections are about more than winning and losing. They are about the free expression of ideas in a democratic society.
They also agree to meet again.

Gray Davis Is Human
Like just about everyone else, I assumed that the recall had been the work of crackpots, and that the crackpot in chief was a man named Ted Costa. He runs a small organization, called the People's Advocate, out of a few dusty rooms behind a Krispy Kreme doughnut shop on the outskirts of Sacramento. The People's Advocate is known for its belief that people shouldn't pay any more tax than absolutely necessary, but that belief is as much tactic as principle. "Taxes are the umbrella," Costa explains. "You can interest everyone in taxes." His real goal is not to eliminate taxes but to torment politicians. STOP THE CROOKS FROM TAKING YOUR MONEY just happens to be the most likely rallying cry to which Californians might respond.
The funny thing about this is that Costa himself has no apparent interest in money. He draws a modest salary, dresses with no obvious goal other than to avoid walking around naked and drives a Ford so decrepit that it is exempt from the state's car tax. The Danes have filmed him on his front lawn beside his 2,000-pound statue of Lincoln, and the papers have reported that the morning he filed the papers to recall Gray Davis, Costa fed his chickens and peacocks. But his wife bought the statue, and the birds are hers, too. What's genuinely eccentric about Costa is that, of necessity, he has erected a political organization on an obsession he himself does not share. "There aren't a hell of a lot of people like me out in society," he says.
Few of the candidates care to look too closely at the founding spirit of the revolt, but in the founding spirit there is another clue: it's less about any one issue, or even any broad agenda, than it is about the way in which professional political people conduct their affairs. For weeks after the 2002 gubernatorial election, in which Davis defeated the Republican Bill Simon, Costa carried around an article by a syndicated columnist named Tom Elias. Only a third of the people eligible to vote had actually done it, Elias pointed out. Davis had won with nearly 1.5 million fewer votes than he had in 1998. The voters' absence wasn't apathy, Elias argued, it was a silent protest, outrage waiting to happen. So one morning in early February, Costa went on a local radio talk show at 5 a.m. to say he was collecting signatures to recall the governor. Five minutes later people started pounding on his door. Within an hour there was a line that went around the corner of people willing to sign anything to get rid of Gray Davis. Representative Darrell Issa saw the rich vein of ore Costa had unearthed with nothing more than a pick and shovel and realized that $2 million of his car-alarm fortune was a small price to pay for the claim.
The animating spirit of that day is rapidly becoming something like the Californian conventional wisdom. And yet now that the serious campaign is under way, that spirit, and its best friend, go largely ignored. The morning after Schwarzenegger entered the race, for example, Costa, the man who made the race possible, called his campaign office and left a message. He's still waiting to hear back.
Still, Costa seems philosophical about it all. "That's the way revolutions always work," he says as we take our seats at the first debate and wait for Davis to take the stage. "Did you ever see one where the people who start it, finish it?" 
As no one else was paying him much attention anymore, and as his car probably wouldn't have survived the 70-mile journey, I drove Costa to the debate, being held in Walnut Creek, outside San Francisco. For 30 minutes before the debate, the governor takes questions from voters and journalists -- hasn'tdone that in a while! -- and generally does what he can to appear human. He smiles and tells little personal stories and behaves as he hasn't for the last five years. It's hard not to feel a bit sorry for the guy. He's running millions of dollars of TV ads against the recall -- in which he does not appear by face or name. The pro-recall people, by contrast, say that Davis's personality is their greatest asset. "All you have to do is put Davis's picture up there on the TV, and his numbers drop," Dave Gilliard says.
So long as the state was rolling in dough from the Internet boom, no one paid too much attention to who Gray Davis was or how he led his political life. Then came the bust, and suddenly he was evil. His many troubling acts -- spending $10 million to drive Dick Riordan from the 2002 Republican primary, his sensational ability to get people to pay him to do business with the state -- were newly exposed. The excuse for exposing them was the budget deficit -- which no governor could have avoided. When Cisco and Intel employees cashed out, the entire Legislature was happy to use the state's cut of their capital gains to hike spending and cut taxes. Davis's crime was the crime of the entire society: an inability to foresee that the Internet boom was a bubble. He's the political equivalent of the Wall Street Internet analyst, one of those characters who must be blamed even if he didn't exactly cause the problem. 
Now all sorts of people who should be on his side are turning against him. Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, for instance, keeps telling reporters that Davis has no friends . . . and by this he does not mean political allies. He means no friends, period; and Davis hasn't been able to turn up evidence to the contrary. For five years now, it appears, he has had no emotional tie with anyone in California, with the sole exception of his wife. He has used money as a substitute.
For Ted Costa, this emotional void between ruler and ruled comes as manna from heaven: a tool to be used to generate animosity toward the governing class. The most loathed politician in American history -- so said polls this summer -- is a gift that keeps on giving. Hence the odd sensation I have as I watch Costa watch Davis: he feels some affection for the man. He listens politely for the most part, and when Davis is finished, Costa says: "He's a mysterious guy. He doesn't have personality enough not to like him. He's just there. Do you know who his political hero is?" I don't. "Alan Cranston," he says, and laughs. "Who has Alan Cranston as his political hero?" Ted Costa's hero is Sam Adams.
The debate that follows, though delightfully contentious, reveals one thing the candidates have in common. Even Schwarzenegger, who ducked the debate, shares it. Every candidate polling at better than 2 percent says boldly that, when he is governor, if necessary, he'll go directly to the people and pass spending and tax plans as initiatives. What, then, is the difference between the governor and Ted Costa? Only that Ted isn't waiting; he's already thinking where next to strike. Repeal the car tax? Overturn the new law granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants? ("You could use that to reform the whole D.M.V.," he says.) He feels spoiled for choice.

A Freeway Civics Lesson
I could have been driving to interview Sharon Davis, the governor's wife; or maybe I was just out looking for someone who knew someone who knew Arnold Schwarzenegger. Wherever I was going, I wasn't going fast. I was stuck in Los Angeles rush-hour traffic, letting the radio surf itself. It was then I stumbled upon another clue to this political mystery: a talk show. Two guys hollering into the ether. You paused for that? you say. Yes I did. Something about their tone made me want to listen. 
First Guy: "Earlier in the show we went after the Issa campaign manager because he made some crack about Michael Huffington saying that. . . . "
Second Guy: "He doesn't think California's ready for a bisexual gubernatorial candidate."
First Guy: "Well, guess what? Those kind of remarks are why Republicans lose elections in California. Because they have a bizarro obsession on sexual politics."
These guys agreed that Republican politicians ought to leave people alone. They also seemed to agree that the guy who paid to put the recall on the ballot, Darrell Issa, needed a beating. The tone was right-wing radio. The content was something else. Issa's campaign staff, they said, had been calling in to complain about their coverage.
First Guy: "Let me tell you this. You're running for governor and you call and yell at one of our producers over something we said. . . . I don't have any use for that nonsense. 'Cause this thing was fueled by talk radio around the state. And I'm sure it was fueled more by our program than anyone else's, because I have the audience numbers to prove it. . . . "
Second Guy: (calmly now, the voice of reason): "Putting Darrell Issa on the air at any time is not a thrill for John or myself."
I know before they tell me that this must be John and Ken, heroes to signature gatherers everywhere. I know this because I find myself wanting to do whatever they tell me to do. 
John: "If there is anything I don't like more than politicians, it's those wormy little nerds who act as campaign handlers and staff. . . . I -- I can't stand you. You have no idea how I can't stand you . . . . I have no respect for you. I have no desire actually to meet you. To talk to you. To shake your hand. I don't want to have a meal with you. . . . You're all creepy. Maybe it sounded like we jumped on board your bandwagon. No. We just happened to on our own decide that Davis was a rotting stool that ought to be flushed."
Ken (cheerily): "Yeah, thanks for the money!" 
They go on in this vein for some time until John concludes, very matter-of-factly: "I'd like someone in Issa's office to call Jason, our screener, and apologize to him. You oughta do that by 6:30. Thanks." And then they cut to a commercial 
Forty-five minutes later. Same highway, new jam:
Ken: "Well, we have U.S. Congressman Darrell Issa on the line calling in to us." 
Representative Darrell Issa: "Hi, John. I apologize. This is going to sound terrible. . . ." 
In the most conciliatory tones, Issa apologizes for each and every transgression. But when he's done, Ken gives him one last biff: "Again, Darrell Issa. Four percent in the latest polls we saw. Your people should be aware that you need us more than we need you." Issa dropped out a week later.
John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou, hosts of California's highest rated drive-time talk radio program, are having the most fun they've ever had in their 15 years together -and that's saying something. Their show is broadcast every weekday from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. and reaches from Tijuana in the south to, on a clear evening, San Francisco in the north. The vast majority of the signatures to recall Davis were collected in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego Counties, where John and Ken's ratings are strongest. Since late May the show has been all recall all the time, and its ratings are as high as they were during the O. J. trial, but for much longer. When Democratic politicians say, as they often do, that the recall is a conspiracy of Darrell Issa's money and right-wing talk radio, John and Ken is exactly the sort of show they have in mind. 
But the Democrats have got it wrong. While John and Ken are unlikely to vote for a Democrat (though John occasionally threatens to), there are important distinctions to draw between them and "right-wing radio." Actually, the market has already drawn them. In 1997, after five years on the air in L.A., John and Ken allowed the show to be syndicated nationally. They found themselves carried on the same stations as, as John puts it when I visit them, "Oliver North, Michael Reagan and Gordon Liddy -- all those crackpots." In a couple of smaller markets -- Buffalo, Sacramento -- where the right and middle co-exist, they did well enough, but in most they were met with hostility. "We couldn't possibly compete with the guys who wanted to kill Clinton," John says. "And if you're one step off the reservation, you're shot dead as a traitor." Listeners routinely complained about their politics. Michael Savage, who followed them in San Francisco, ran a campaign to get them off the air. "In Bakersfield," Ken says, "we're regarded as socialists." 
That's one reason Davis and everyone else failed to see the recall coming: they misunderstood the anger. They were unable to see the long, porous border between the right and the middle. Had Davis ever accepted any of their many invitations to address John and Ken's audience, he might have learned that they were hardly of the far right. They weren't even especially political. When the drive to recall Davis began, John regarded it as "a bunch of kooks. I didn't want to attach myself to a bunch of kooks. It wasn't until Issa put the money up that I saw it could be done. And then the car tax happened: and the thing exploded." (The "car tax," which kicked in more or less automatically when the state ran out of money, simply raised the annual fee car owners already paid from 0.67 percent to 2 percent of the assessed value of their cars, which happened to be exactly what it was during the Wilson administration.) 
That's when John and Ken started to care about state politics -- when politics finally accommodated what they call their "tone." "The challenge is to hold onto the tone," John says. Asked to describe the tone, Ken says, "Rabid dogs." John says: "I don't know that part of the brain that shouts all these things you aren't supposed to say in polite company, but that's the part of the brain we speak to." Ken: "People relate to the shouts. What differentiates us from a crazy man is that a lot of people agree with the shouts." John: "The line we get all the time is, 'You say exactly what I feel in the car!' " Then he laughs. "Some part of me always roots for chaos."

Flirting With Order
On the day of the California Democratic convention earlier this month, Cruz Bustamante, the lieutenant governor and unlikely front runner in the race to replace Gray Davis, must have felt as warmly as he ever had toward his governor. Today he would make his first public appearance with Gray Davis since the recall became real. The world would see this as a show of unity or, at the very least, as comity: a meaningless little family spat had been patched up. All the little humiliations Davis and his people had visited upon Bustamante for the past few years -- shutting him out of every decision, taking away his parking space -- had been forgotten. 
The trouble was, two hours before Cruz Bustamante clasped Davis's hand onstage, I spoke to him. He declined the invitation to argue that the recall was a hijacking. "This isn't some right-wing conspiracy," he said. "It's valid criticism of leadership." When I asked him what was wrong with "leadership," his long answer, though it meandered a bit, had a nub: his personality. "I don't know if it was style," he said, "but it could be." He traced the politics of the current situation back to the state's energy crisis in early 2001, when he wanted to tell the energy companies to stuff it and take them to court, but Gray Davis did not. "The governor's people said it doesn't make any sense, 'You're grandstanding, Cruz.' " 
The lieutenant governor told me that he hadn't met with the governor in ages and, since the recall, hadn't once spoken to him -- except for making a single courtesy call to let him know he'd be running to replace him. He tried to put this into perspective. "If you look at California history, the lieutenant governor isn't usually even from the same party as the governor." On the other hand, he didn't want me to think that he had anything nice to say about Davis either. 
The only thing to say for the professional Democrats' disunity is that professional Republicans, if anything, are even less unified. Republicans with money have been forking it over to Arnold. The party as a whole is torn between Arnold and Tom McClintock, a state senator and a man of fierce conservative principle. The head says Arnold (he can win!), but the heart says Tom (he actually knows something!). In late August, I met Darrell Issa and asked him about the Republican split. He asked, "When's your story running?" Assured I wouldn't scoop the convention, he said, with a knowing smile, "It'll get much clearer at the convention." He planned to endorse Arnold on the first night. "We'll see how Tom McClintock feels when he sees his political career going down the toilet," Issa said. 
I thought Issa might be overestimating his clout, but he wasn't. In the convention's banquet hall, where the speeches are given, hangs a banner with letters six feet high: THANK YOU DARRELL ISSA. For the next three days, every time Darrell Issa's name is mentioned, the whole crowd leaps to is feet and chants Darrell! Darrell! Darrell! Arnold and McClintock both receive standing ovations, but neither is treated with such reverence as Darrell Issa. Issa has the single most important quality in a California politician -- a quality Arnold had at the outset but has quickly lost. He's not running for anything. Now, on the convention's first night, Darrell Issa, selfless servant of the people, faces a roomful of party faithful hanging on every word . . . and says nothing at all. Or, rather, he says that the party needs to get behind one candidate but stops short of saying which one. 
That morning Darrell Issa called Arnold to let him know that he planned on endorsing him. Instead of getting through, he was told by Arnold's campaign people that Arnold was busy. Issa should sit down with some staff member. And that was that: no endorsement. 
Arnold's people, like their boss, have a policy of not returning the phone calls of anyone who might ask them a question. So it's hard to know what they were thinking when they dissed Issa. Could it be that they -- like Davis -- misunderstand the recall's spirit? Do they, too, view it as the work of right-wing nuts and want to avoid getting too close to it?
I find Ted Costa striding the halls. He has the amused air of a man who owns the place but hasn't let the inhabitants in on the secret. "Tell you something," he says. "I've had people calling me to tell me that Arnold's people have been calling me a kook." 

Happy Jesus: A New Approach
At the center of California democracy is a perfect silence. The reason for the silence is that the moment someone gets up to speak, the people smell political ambition and shut their ears. But maybe there is hope. California democracy has, in this election, invented an entirely new kind of candidate: the candidate who refuses to speak. His name is -- well, it's hard to say what his name is, because he lists himself on the ballot only as "S. Issa." Six weeks into the campaign, he has been spotted just once, in the county clerk's office. The person who spotted him was Heather Peters, another candidate. She turned up the first hour the filing papers were available. She assumed, not without reason, that she was the most organized and enthusiastic candidate. But she was not alone. S. Issa filed at the same time. 
That morning, S. Issa did two things that struck Peters as fishy. He tentatively agreed not to spend more than $1,000 on his campaign, then he forked over the $3,500 fee on the spot, even after the clerk told him he should wait until he collected his 65 signatures and not risk losing his fee until he'd been certified. "He spoke with a thick accent," Peters says, "and didn't say much." His next move was even stranger: he vanished. 
Why does a man so keen to be on the ballot remain hidden once he's on it? The Darrell Issa campaign has an answer: S. Issa's sole purpose was to confuse voters who initially supported Darrell. His ballot listing -- no first name, Republican, businessman/engineer -- was designed to maximize the confusion. Before Darrell Issa quit the race, pollsters estimated that the presence of S. on the ballot might cost him three points. "How much it cost obviously depends on how well you're doing," Darrell says. "But we would have been lumped together." At any rate, the existence of S. factored into Darrell's decision to withdraw. S. had achieved his goal. 
Who is S. Issa? The question is not easy to answer. Like all candidates, he was required to file a phone number and an address with the California secretary of state. But the address is a small mail box at a mini-mall in a suburb called Arcadia, east of Los Angeles, and the phone is answered by a beep. I leave a dozen messages and write him a note, and never hear back. The Arcadia directory lists an "S. Issa" -- without a number. The Darrell Issa campaign unearthed an Arcadia address for S., and so one Sunday evening I visit the place. Cobwebs hang from its outdoor lights; grime-stained blinds obscure the windows. Outside there are signs of a disorderly life: a fly-specked cat-food dish; a rusty bike; a trash can with an empty jug of cheap wine. I poke around long enough to upset a large hairy man next door. He says that no one named Issa lives there. 
The Darrell Issa campaign has investigated S. Issa. He emigrated from Syria eight years ago, they say, used the Syrian Embassy as his mailing address, but then quickly became a U.S. citizen. He has a wife named Semeen who works for something called the Muslim Women's Organization. S. works for Caltrans, the state transportation agency. This last fact closes the circle of their suspicion: public employees had fed huge sums to the Davis campaigns and been given fat pay raises. "Let's not kid anybody," Darrell Issa tells me. "This is an opposition technique. The governor isn't so stupid that you'd ever trace it back to him. But this is a classic opposition technique." Exactly the kind of thing people have come to expect from Gray Davis. 
Darrell Issa knows just one other strange fact: S. Issa called the pollster John Zogby. Darrell tells me, "He's making the traditional Middle Eastern assumption. 'Oh, he's Middle Eastern, he'll help me.' " To Darrell's delight, his friend Zogby told S. to get lost. But that raises the question: why would a hidden candidate hire a pollster? "Who knows?" Darrell says. 
It's not easy to find a live human being inside the California Department of Transportation. After an hour of asking people to connect me to S. Issa, I find an operator who says, "Hold for that number." She makes unhappy noises. "Seems like he doesn't have a phone number," she says. 
"Don't they all have numbers?" 
"They're supposed to!" she says, and searches a bit more. "He's in this building," she says triumphantly, then goes looking for an e-mail address. After five minutes, she says, "This guy really doesn't want to be found."
I leave my sixth message at the Muslim Women's Organization, where Mrs. S. Issa presumably works, then drive down to Caltrans's office in downtown L.A. I tell the receptionist I have an appointment with S. Issa. Somehow she finds a number for him and calls it. She listens, she frowns, she rechecks her directory. "Yeah, that's the right number," she says, then, as much to her colleague as to me, "Listen to this." She calls again, on speakerphone. A recorded voice says: "On vacation until Oct. 8" -- the day after the scheduled election. 
With that, I phone the secretary of state's office, describe the situation and listen as a helpful woman says, "It sounds like this may be fraud." She faxes me S. Issa's papers as well as a lot of barely legible addresses of people who signed S. Issa's ballot application. I'm walking out the door to track them down when Mrs. S. Issa calls. "Saad's at home now," she says. "He'd be happy to talk to you." I tell her how improbable that sounds, given his remarkable reclusion. "Oh," she says. "He's just started his campaign." 
The man I meet the following Sunday, just days before the recall is thrown into turmoil by three Appeals Court judges, is round and jolly. A neatly trimmed white beard frames his red cheeks. If you described Saad Issa physically to the police, you'd start a manhunt for Santa Claus. If you described him simply by his manner, they'd forget about Santa and go looking for his biggest elf. He is shy and diffident and curious and thoughtful and completely obsessed with his three children, who, dressed for their soccer games, pour out of the car behind him. 
Maybe because of all the thinking he has done about the long term -- his job is to consider the distant futures of California Highways 23 and 170 -- or perhaps because of the way life has changed for Muslims since 9/11, his mind turned to politics. "Do you know how many hours people lose each day on the freeway? 315,000. Road capacity is up 30 percent, while the population is up 70 percent and drivers up 140 percent. This is a social issue. We don't realize if those two hours you spend in the car was spent with your kids, they would be much better kids." 
He explains that, as obliged as he felt to run for governor, he very nearly did not, for fear of his children's privacy. He explains further that when the campaign began, and he saw that minor candidates like himself weren't being taken seriously, he was mortified at the thought of being one of them. "I saw the media was making fun of the process itself. I didn't see it that way. I think it takes guts to be one of the 135."Fear of ridicule, coupled with his lack of time, compelled him to lie low for a while. But when the coverage became more serious, he went into his boss and said he wanted to take all his vacation at once, to focus on his political aspirations. That's when I, for the 400th time, called again. "I really appreciate you trying to find me," he says, then he laughs. "Tell me, Michael, do you think I've lost my chances of winning?" 
Saad Issa is now ready to run. Trouble is, he hasn't the first idea how to begin. "I'm like everyone, an ordinary John Doe. A soccer dad. I know I'm not going to win. I just want to give one message to help the state of California." His message: Your society is falling apart. Your problem is not your money; it's your priorities. You have forgotten what is important in this short life. What is important is family. What is important is love and duty. You must learn to sacrifice your immediate wants for long-term happiness. He offers many specific proposals, but beneath them all is that simple gist. 
To get his one message across, he has printed up a press release. He has exactly three campaign buttons -- S. Issa for Governor -- which he had made at a souvenir stand at a local mall. His first thought was that the only way he'd be taken seriously and take part in the debates was to have his name included in the polls. "I'm asking myself: what should I do for publicity? What should I do to get in the polls? I have no money. I don't know anybody. A friend gave me this name: Zogby. He says he's an important pollster. I found his number on the Internet." So he called and left a message for Zogby. Just to talk to him, it's usually a hundred grand, but S. Issa got lucky. The very day he called, Zogby called him back. "'Darrell,' Zogby said, 'this is John.' I said: 'I'm sorry, this is not Darrell. This is Saad.' " 
S. Issa had something to say, but the idea of saying it frightened him. That first day when he went to pull his papers, when the lady told him he didn't need to write a check on the spot, he was sure if he didn't hand over the money, he would chicken out. "I said to myself, if I don't submit that day, somebody or something will pull you out." He scribbled out a check and hurried away. Then came the question of how to list himself on the ballot. Political party? His wife was a noisy Democrat, but he'd always been a Republican. (He opposes abortion.)
Occupation? He owned his own contracting firm but found the hours interfered with his duties as a father. So five years ago he took his 9-to-5 job at Caltrans. When he nervously told his superiors at Caltrans of his intentions, they weren't happy, so he could hardly list himself as "Caltrans employee." "Businessman/engineer" seemed about right. 
Name? "My name is Saad Issa," he says. "That means in Arabic 'happy Jesus."' He swells a bit at this statement. "But so many Americans, when they see my name, they pronounce it 'sad.' Sad is a very bad feeling for me and for others. So I say to them, 'Can I use an abbreviation?' " 
S. Issa: Republican. Businessman/engineer. 
I ask him about the home address I visited, the one with the creepy feel about it. "That's an old, old address," he says. I ask him about the Syrian Embassy. He says he never had anything to do with it. He has been married to his wife, a U.S citizen born and raised in Marin County, for 21 years. He grew up in Kuwait and Paris and came to the U.S. in 1979 to study engineering at North Greenville College, in South Carolina. From there he went to U.S.C. . . .
Why am I so interested in the picayune details of his life, he wants to know, rather than his specific policy proposals? Why do I and others have all this bizarre information about him? (He has just had a call from The San Jose Mercury News asking him to confirm that he served in the Lebanese Army. He has never been to Lebanon.) I explain that the entire Republican Party and a lot of Democrats, too, assume he is a shill for Gray Davis. I tell him that the other Issa campaign has a file on him. The idea astonishes him. "Why wouldn't they just contact me?" he wonders. He likes Issa. "I wish Issa was still running. I was very unhappy when he dropped out. I had this feeling in my heart he was forced out." He pauses. "We make the system so corrupt that we are suspicious of everything."
S. Issa likes the effects of the recall -- "I think it's a wake-up call for California" -- but he admits that he's not going to vote for it. He's not sure any of the candidates are qualified to replace Davis, with one possible exception. If it came to that, he says, he could do the job, because he is guided by the sincere desire to leave the world a better place than he found it. "Money, it comes and goes," he says. "Fame, it comes and goes. Health, it comes and goes. One day I will die. There will be a judgment. I'll be asked: 'Did you do something good?' And I'm going to say, 'I tried to run for governor.' "

Rental Units Rising at Journal Square in Jersey City

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
JOURNAL SQUARE, with its bustling PATH train station, its ethnic restaurants, its dozens of little shops, an Art Deco Loew's movie theater and a statue of Jackie Robinson, is the acknowledged heart of Jersey City's downtown area. A building now going up will add some homes to that heart.
 In the first new construction at Journal Square since an office building opened in 1988, a 12-story, 130-unit rental apartment building is being built on the site of the old State Theater movie house, which was set aside for redevelopment some years ago. 
 The apartments will be a mix of one-bedroom and studio layouts, with 30 units reserved for low-income occupants, said David Barry, president of the Applied Development Company of Hoboken, part of a consortium doing the construction with financing from federal, state and local redevelopment funds. The 100 other units will be leased at market rates. 
The new building, called State Square, will have an eight-level parking garage at its core and 100,000 square feet of retail space at its base -- with shops on John F. Kennedy Boulevard in the front of the building and on Sip Avenue at the rear.
The 395-car garage, which city planners say will provide much-needed relief to congested Journal Square, will have an entry ramp on Kennedy Boulevard and an entry ramp and an exit way on Sip Avenue.
Inside the building, one hallway -- a "single-loaded corridor," Mr. Barry said -- will serve both shoppers leaving their cars in the garage and those who live in the building.
"The city wanted to see parking there for the merchants in Journal Square," Mr. Barry said. "But they didn't want to have parking visible from Kennedy. So, the design we came up with is all apartments on the Kennedy side and on the four floors above the garage."
The design for the Sip Avenue side will "blend in" with the neighborhood, said Joseph Alpert, president of the Alpert Group of Fort Lee, another principal in the $31 million project.
"Journal Square has already received substantial capital improvements over the past three years," Mr. Alpert said, "new and renovated office space, commercial stores and restaurants, the newly renovated Loew's theater and several buildings belonging to Hudson Community College.
"We believe we have come up with an important missing piece in the overall effort to revive Journal Square, providing a place for people to live in the downtown area."
BESIDES Applied, which has completed a number of high-profile urban projects in the last few years, and Alpert Group, the consortium includes Panepinto Properties, Harwood Properties and a former district congressman, Frank Guarini.
The Journal Square redevelopment effort was started almost a decade ago, with the busy PATH commuter station as the catalyst, Mr. Alpert said.
Local architecture fans have also been raising funds and working with City Hall all that time to restore the Art Deco Loew's building as a nonprofit arts and entertainment center. Four years ago, the square was refurbished with a pedestrian area featuring fountains, old-fashioned lampposts and the statue of Jackie Robinson -- who broke baseball's color line, playing his first major league game at Jersey City's old Roosevelt Stadium in 1946. 
Ground was broken last month for the apartment building, at 2 Journal Square, a block south of the Kennedy overpass. The foundation is laid, and the pilings are in place. The entire job will take about 18 months, Mr. Alpert said.
The State Square project will be the first housing with a Journal Square address, he noted, although there are single-family and multifamily homes and two renovated older apartment buildings in the surrounding neighborhood.
Construction financing for the project was arranged with $20 million from a combination of taxable and tax-exempt bonds issued by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, a $600,000 federal loan funneled to the project by Jersey City and $600,000 through another state housing construction loan program. 
Mr. Barry said the redevelopment site was "ideally located" near one of the Port Authority's largest metropolitan transit hubs. "From Journal Square," he said, "commuting by public transportation is possible to Manhattan and Newark on the PATH trains, the buses, the ferries and every town in Hudson County on the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail." New York Waterway ferry service is provided from Port Liberte in Jersey City, where Applied built the Port Liberte apartment development.
But in Journal Square, Mr. Barry said, "we are kind of pioneering a new area, bringing the first residential redevelopment downtown."
"Our company," Mr. Barry said, "is many times the first one into the pool, so to speak. With this project, we create a market in that square. When our building is done and leased, and we're getting the rents up, banks and lenders will be more open to other projects on other lots where the property may be underutilized." 
NOT that the project developers want to significantly change the character of Journal Square. "It's important to keep that retail element," Mr. Barry said. "It's a nice place to walk and shop, and that's one of the great things about Journal Square. 
Applied, which redeveloped the historic Essex and Sussex Hotel in Spring Lake as condominiums last year, is at work on several new phases of its Port Liberte development. Mr. Barry said 1,650 condos would be built at Port Liberte, starting with 57 high-end town homes right on the Hudson riverfront.
In the oceanfront community of Long Branch, Applied is redeveloping a 16-acre property, where it is building 100,000 square feet of retail space and 320 rental units. And it is a co-developer, with Matzel & Mumford, of Beachfront North, a 15-acre parcel where town houses and condos are under construction.
Applied, which built and manages the Shipyard residential complex on the Hoboken waterfront, is also working on another apartment tower there, to be called the Sovereign. In addition, Applied built the Palisades waterfront apartment tower in Fort Lee, which opened last year.

 CORRECTION:
An article in some regional copies last Sunday about a planned apartment building in the Journal Square area of Jersey City misstated the reason for the statue of Jackie Robinson there. It commemorates the day in 1946 when he played in the city for the Montreal Royals, a Brooklyn Dodgers farm team, becoming the first black player in organized baseball. (The game in which Robinson broke the major league color line came the next year, when he played for the Dodgers themselves.)

HEADLINE: Investing; 
Household Names,Over the Counter

BYLINE:  By ERIC UHLFELDER

 BODY:
CATHAY PACIFIC has one of the best reputations for service and reliability in the airline industry. Nestle is one of the most familiar household brands. Beer from Heineken is imbibed across the globe. 
 All these companies trade in the United States, but none of them are among the 500 foreign stocks listed as American depository receipts on the New York and American stock exchanges and the Nasdaq. Instead, Cathay Pacific, Nestle and Heineken have chosen to trade their A.D.R.'s on the over-the counter market. So have companies like Rolls Royce, the venerable British engine maker; Societe Generale, the French bank; and Yukos, the Russian oil giant. 
Most of the 1,500 foreign companies with over-the-counter A.D.R.'s are relatively obscure, and some were delisted from Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange because their prices fell below minimums or failed to meet other listing requirements. Some foreign companies, however, prefer the over-the-counter approach.
American depository receipts are certificates issued by an American bank and traded in the United States as dollar-denominated versions of foreign shares. Each A.D.R. represents a set number of shares of a foreign security held by the bank. Some A.D.R.'s are sold to investors in public offerings in the United States; those also trade in lock step with their home-market shares.
 Investors who look into this market may find intriguing opportunities, said Stephen Saker, senior investment adviser at International Assets Advisory L.L.C., a broker-dealer in Orlando, Fla. "Over the past several difficult years, O.T.C.-traded A.D.R.'s, because they are less liquid than listed shares, were hit hard as U.S. investors retreated to more familiar homegrown equities, bonds and money markets," Mr. Saker said. "But as interest in stocks revives, a modest boost in investment flows into these shares may permit them to rally potentially more than the rest of the market."
 For most American investors, buying and selling A.D.R.'s is much easier than trading foreign shares because there is no need to exchange currencies or to deal with the logistical and legal hurdles and higher costs often involved in trading abroad.
 Foreign companies have a major inducement for seeking a listing on an exchange: the potential for higher volume and better liquidity. But to gain a listing in the United States, companies must meet relatively stringent disclosure and reporting standards. These include issuing financial statements quarterly, not just twice a year -- the norm in Europe and much of the rest of the world -- and restating financial statements in accordance with American accounting rules.
 Many companies prefer to sidestep some of these requirements. Differences in accounting standards, for example, can cause some significant changes in reported earnings. In 1993, when Daimler-Benz prepared to meet the requirements for a full listing on the N.Y.S.E., it had to restate its financial statements according to generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Filtered through GAAP, the profit of 615 million marks it reported in Germany collapsed into a loss of 1.84 billion marks. The main cause was a restatement of retained earnings, which knocked off more than 4.2 billion marks from profits. 
 Companies may also be affected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires them to provide much more detailed information about their off-balance-sheet obligations and to adhere to more stringent governance standards. These include chief executives' certification of financial statements. "Since Sarbanes-Oxley, some firms perceive the benefits of listing to be outweighed by the increased risk brought about by the new law, especially given our nation's inherently litigious character," said Edward Cofrancesco, chief operating officer of INTL Trading, a Nasdaq broker-dealer based in Altamonte Springs, Fla.
 Over-the-counter trading gives foreign companies a way around these new rules, said Julio Lugo, vice president of J. P. Morgan Chase's division of A.D.R. liquidity solutions. "O.T.C.-traded A.D.R.'s are exempt from Sarbanes-Oxley," he said. "The listed ones at this point are not." 
 After the bill's adoption, Porsche, the German car maker, said that it would postpone its plans for a listing on the N.Y.S.E. So did the Daiwa Securities Group of Japan. Last October, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury-goods maker, moved from the Nasdaq to over the counter because, as the company explained, it was disappointed by its trading volumes.
 Trading over the counter is a cheap way for a foreign company to get a foot into American markets. It can give a foreign company the ability to compensate local employees with stock and options. And over-the-counter A.D.R.'s can provide the currency for future stock-based acquisitions. 
 For American investors, buying the shares of the largest, most heavily traded over-the-counter A.D.R.'s can be cheaper than buying shares of the same companies overseas, Mr. Saker said. "It avoids stamp duty taxes, which still exist in major markets, surcharges most brokers add on for such transactions, custodial expenses paid to the foreign bank actually holding the shares, and the cost of currency exchange necessary to execute the purchase," he said. "All this, times two, when such shares are subsequently sold." 
 Over all, these charges could add up to several hundred dollars a trade, Mr. Cofrancesco said.
 While investors in over-the-counter stocks need to know they are forgoing some regulatory protection, the companies must comply with their home-market rules, which, in many cases, sustain high standards.
 SOME over-the-counter shares are well regarded by many analysts. 
 Cathay Pacific, with a market capitalization of more than $5 billion, is based in Hong Kong, and its financial performance has been hurt by declining tourism after Sept. 11, 2001, the global economic slowdown and fears of SARS. Still, its shares have risen 17 percent this year. While earnings per share are likely to decline in 2003, Peter Lau, an analyst at Nomura Securities, expects that they will rebound in 2004. 
 Anil Daswani, an airline analyst at Smith Barney Citigroup, is also encouraged by the stock, observing growth "driven by pent-up demand and promotional offers." 
 Jean-Louis Morisot, an airline analyst at Goldman Sachs, says the company "will see further improvement in passenger volumes for the rest of the year, driven by the retreat of SARS, lifting of the World Health Organization travel advisories and attractive pricing." He regards Cathay Pacific as attractive.

HEADLINE: BOOK VALUE; 
A Little Here. A Little There. Goodbye, Gridlock.

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

 BODY:
IT would be easy to dismiss this new book by Matthew Miller, who has worked as a journalist and consultant and was an adviser in the Clinton administration. After all, it is just one man's prescription for fixing some of America's most intractable problems.
 But even if readers don't agree with the answers presented in "The 2 Percent Solution: Fixing America's Problems in Ways Liberals and Conservatives Can Love" (Public Affairs, $26), the author has a compelling way of finding the middle ground between conservatives and liberals and ending gridlock on major issues. 
 The problems, of course, are wide-ranging. Millions of people lack health insurance, are working at subsistence wages and are sending their children to largely inadequate public schools. Throw in the fact that politicians and political parties are increasingly prone to accepting money from entrenched interest groups and you have a picture of dysfunctionality. 
 But Mr. Miller argues that it is possible for liberals and conservatives to bury their ideological hatchets and make "grand bargains" on contentious issues. In the current climate, that may seem unlikely, but he suggests suspending disbelief long enough to contemplate what he is saying. 
 "The bad news is that our two major political parties are organized around ideologies and interest groups that systematically ban the expression of common-sense ideas that blend of best of liberal and conservative thinking," he writes. "The result is a 'solutions gap' in public life, which leaves Americans discouraged, cynical and tuned out."
 American politics today is very evenly divided, he writes, in contrast to earlier times -- when President Lyndon B. Johnson pushed for the Great Society in the 1960's, for example, or when President Ronald Reagan campaigned in the 1980's to have America "stand tall." 
 Because neither major party can achieve sweeping mandates, there is much competition for narrow numbers of swing voters or specific demographic groups. "The result is a risk-averse game of inches, driven by the calculation that the right tactic -- a dash of tax-cut pandering here or Social Security demagoguery there -- can lure the two or three points to put a candidate over the top," the author writes.
 Judging from their declining participation in the political system, many Americans apparently believe that politics is a dead end where the winners are ideologues with money. Americans are faced with "cartoon choices" between extreme positions, the author says.
 But he contends that it doesn't have to be that way. A policy expert, he goes into considerable detail about each issue and tries to identify common ground between the ideological combatants.
 To deal with one never-ending debate, he argues that Republicans should allocate more money to education, which they have been loath to do because teachers are unionized and typically support Democrats. But Democrats, he adds, must accept that school vouchers are an effective concept and that the ranks of unionized teachers need to be shaken up. Teachers should be evaluated on quality, and they should be promoted or fired accordingly, Mr. Miller allows. 
 He also offers what he calls an "ideologically androgynous" solution for campaign finance reform. There is no stopping the private sector from continuing to find ways to contribute money to political candidates, he says. He estimates that interest groups put up $3 billion in the 2000 campaign.
 But what if America's 100 million voters were each given $50 to contribute to a candidate of their choice? There would be no need for a government bureaucracy to make the choice; in the best individualistic tradition, voters would decide. And the resulting flow of $5 billion that would be collected every two years for federal elections would overwhelm what special interests could contribute.
 Over all, Mr. Miller argues that America's most crucial problems could be solved by spending just 2 percent more than the government does now.
 Here's the breakout: $80 billion a year to finance health care for those who can't afford it, $30 billion to make teaching in poor schools an attractive career choice, $85 billion to establish a living wage of about $9 an hour; $2 billion for well-financed school vouchers and $3 billion annually to create the campaign finance system, including $500 million for administrative expenses. Mr. Miller then plunks down $10 billion to make preschool universal and $10 billion to repair deteriorated schools. That adds up to $220 billion, or 2 percent of the gross domestic product of roughly $11 trillion for 2004.
 "For 2 cents on the national dollar, we have a country where everyone has basic health coverage; every full-time worker earns at least $9 an hour; poor children have great teachers in fixed-up schools where they show up ready to learn; and we've created a way for politicians to run for office (if they want to) without special-interest cash," the author says.
 Mr. Miller offers ways to offset that spending: by cutting back on what he calls unjustified subsidies for companies, easing up on extra health coverage for Americans who are well covered and imposing a 60-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline, to reduce dependence on Middle Eastern oil and to finance his 2 percent solution. 
 A SWEEPING reallocation of how the government spends money is urgent, Mr. Miller says, because of the aging of the baby boomers. He says that starting in about 10 years, boomers will be drawing down huge amounts of resources from Social Security, Medicare and other programs. The government, in his view, has a limited window to address broader national challenges before the tsunami of retiring boomers hits the system.
 "The 2 Percent Solution" is clear, accessible and well written. The ultimate take-away value is that America could fix its problems if it could define a consensus about what those problems are.
 The timing of this book is conspicuous. An election is coming. The reader might well ask whether this savant is trying to position himself to take part in the winning presidential campaign. But that would be a cynical supposition. And to enjoy and profit from this book, one must suspend such base instincts.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Spend Some, Lose Some; 
In California, the Propositions Keep Rolling Along

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif. 

 BODY:
IT was the last question of a long and raucous debate here, almost an afterthought, and for many television viewers it probably sounded like a lot of bureaucratic mumbo jumbo after the evening's theatrics.
 But perhaps more than any of the other questions posed to Arnold Schwarzenegger and the candidates seeking Gov. Gray Davis's job, the one asking whether they supported Proposition 53 struck at the heart of the chronic budget and taxation problems in California that have fueled the recall campaign and will undoubtedly haunt any new governor. 
 Proposition 53, which will appear on the Oct. 7 ballot with the recall vote, would set aside up to 3 percent of the state's general fund for things like new roads, sewer improvements and public building renovations. It has attracted virtually no attention in an election dominated by the recall itself, and to a lesser extent, a second proposition on the ballot that would ban the collection of certain racial data by government agencies. 
But the measure is a quintessential example of California's propensity for "ballot box budgeting," a trend that when matched with the state's formidable obstacles to raising taxes, has tied Mr. Davis's hands in keeping the state fiscally afloat. Over the summer, confronted with a $38.2 billion deficit and a Republican legislative caucus refusing tax increases, Mr. Davis was forced to make unpopular cuts in spending while also papering over much of the crisis until next year.
"Most initiatives lose, but most of these initiatives to lock up money have passed," said Edward L. Lascher, a professor of public policy at California State University at Sacramento. "The problem is that there is no mechanism forcing people to equilibrate one thing with another, no mechanism that says given a choice, which do you want to protect, this or that."
Already, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan California Budget Project, about 90 percent of the state budget is spoken for each year, in large part because of huge voter-mandated set-asides for things like public education and transportation. The trend seems unstoppable.
Proposition 53 was killed last yearby the State Legislature, but was revived and placed on the ballot at the insistence of Republicans as part of a last-minute budget deal. Also last year, Mr. Schwarzenegger, the leading Republican candidate to replace Mr. Davis, led a successful campaign that would require state spending for after-school programs.
"It is great, because you tell the voters you get something for nothing," said Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project. "Then the voters get frustrated when the Legislature and governor can't figure out where to cut spending. And you wonder why we have paralysis."
There is a certain paradox, Ms. Ross said, that while Mr. Davis's chief critics campaign against his handling of the budget morass, they have also lined up behind Proposition 53.
Mr. Schwarzenegger and his chief Republican rival, State Senator Tom McClintock, both of whom have made fiscal conservatism and tax restraint pillars of their campaigns, openly embraced the measure during the debate. "I think it's a good beginning," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "The fact of the matter is that we need a lot of infrastructure in California."
Mr. McClintock spoke of the halcyon days of Gov. Pat Brown in the early 60's, when the state spent as much as 20 percent of the general fund on roads, bridges, colleges and water projects. 
"It seems to me that the importance of our infrastructure has been completely overlooked," Mr. McClintock said, adding that during the earlier era, "we were building highways faster than Detroit was building cars."
Professor Lascher said most people would agree that the state's infrastructure has been neglected and that a strong case could be made for Proposition 53. Ms. Ross said the ballot measure, unlike many others in the past, was written with language that would prevent the siphoning of money during tough economic times.
But the merits of the proposition become almost incidental when the state's fiscal woes are considered. Good or bad for California, Proposition 53 would amount to another spending obligation without any new way to pay for it, a fact that inevitably brings up the question of new taxes.
"Let's not romanticize the days of Pat Brown and Ronald Reagan," said the only Democrat at the debate, Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante, of the projects the measure would support. "Back then, they raised taxes to pay for it."
Nevertheless, he supports the proposition. Should he become governor in October, Mr. Bustamante would be counting on another ballot measure to help Democrats solve the problem. In March, voters will be asked whether to change the state Constitution so that legislators could raise taxes with 55 percent of the vote. Currently, raising taxes requires the approval of two-thirds of the legislature, effectively giving veto power over taxes to the Republican minority.
IF Mr. Schwarzenegger should win, there could be another outcome. He has complained that Californians are overtaxed but has not ruled out new taxes. If Mr. Schwarzenegger were elected with a broad base of support that extended beyond Republicans, he might be able to persuade enough Democrats and Republicans in the Legislature that a tax increase was the only way out.
Mr. Schwarzenegger's aides don't like to talk about that possibility. But there would be ample historical precedent. As governor, both Pete Wilson, who is a chairman of Mr. Schwarzenegger's campaign, and Mr. Reagan, who is one of Mr. Schwarzenegger's political idols, presided over some of the biggest tax increases in California history.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Hard Sell; 
In a Democracy, the President Is Also Salesman in Chief

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE American president has always played multiple roles in the drama of the United States: commander in chief, steward of the economy, symbol of the nation, head of the party. But presidents have to be salesmen, too.
 Salesmanship and democracy are intricately linked in that most presidents have had to learn how to sell difficult policies to the public in trying times. President Bush is now faced with the challenge of selling the public on his policies in Iraq, but Woodrow Wilson had to sell World War I and Franklin D. Roosevelt spent six years talking Americans into World War II. "Roosevelt was in a sense a master salesman of what the public thought at the time were some largely unpalatable items," said David M. Kennedy, a professor of history at Stanford. "If anything, he faced even deeper, widespread opposition than Bush." 
 But the history of presidential salesmanship has taught three critical lessons: the importance of building a broad consensus, of assuming intelligence on the part of your audience and of leveling with the people who voted you into the White House. 
"I don't care if the public is buying an automobile, a drug that cures allergies or a foreign policy," said Donny Deutsch, an advertising executive in New York. "It's basically 'Give them the facts.' " On Iraq, Mr. Deutsch said, "forget whether this was the right or wrong move, and in their hearts, most Americans were behind it. Good selling starts with complete candor."
Given these parameters, interviews last week with historians, advertising executives, pollsters and Democratic and Republican image-makers turned up this consensus: Mr. Bush has to do a better job -- or at least a more extensive job -- of selling Americans on Iraq and the American occupation, no matter what anyone might think of the policy itself. 
Many of those interviewed, including some Republicans, said Mr. Bush's speech two weeks ago, when he said he would ask Congress for $87 billion to pay for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, has turned out to be one of the biggest political eggs laid this year.
From an advertising point of view, Mr. Bush was perhaps too successful, or inadvertently sold the wrong product. The most famous number in America right now, pollsters said, was that stunning $87 billion, a symbol of how entangled the United States is in Baghdad nearly five months after Mr. Bush declared major combat at an end.
Certainly various polls conducted after Mr. Bush's speech, a prime-time address on Sept. 7, show that his words did not reassure the public. In late August, a Gallup poll found that 59 percent of Americans approved of the job Mr. Bush was doing. But that number dropped to 52 percent in a Gallup poll conducted from Sept. 8 to 10, right after Mr. Bush's speech.
The week after that speech, the White House sent out its best-known salesmen to blanket the Sunday morning talk programs and defend the administration on Iraq. Vice President Dick Cheney appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press," Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was on CBS's "Face the Nation," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was on Fox News Sunday, and Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, appeared on ABC's "This Week." 
The campaign continued with Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, appearing on Fox News on Monday and NBC's 'Today" on Tuesday.
But Mr. Bush's slide didn't stop. In the most recent Gallup poll, conducted from Sept. 19 to 21, Mr. Bush's overall approval rating had fallen to the lowest of his presidency, with 50 percent saying they approved of his job performance. 
The White House could take some encouragement that his support was stronger in the Midwest and South, Republican "red states" territory. In the Midwest, 53 percent approved of Mr. Bush's job performance; in the Northeast, 46 percent did.
Mr. Bush's next big job of salesmanship was last week at the United Nations, where his address to the General Assembly was both a forceful defense of the war and an unapologetic appeal to skeptical allies for help in securing and rebuilding the "young democracy" of Iraq. But the response was cool, and many world leaders said Mr. Bush was simply playing the role of tough-minded president for an audience at home.
The speech would have been better received, some historians argued, if the president had built a broader consensus at home and abroad. Though Pearl Harbor ultimately plunged the nation into war, Roosevelt had also waged a long campaign to sell Americans on the dangers of fascism. 
"By some reckonings, he started as early as 1935 trying to educate this country about just how dangerous the international environment was becoming," Mr. Kennedy of Stanford said.
So what should Mr. Bush do now? 
Democrats say that the problem is the war and the occupation itself, and that the slickest message from the White House can't change the substance underneath. In other words, some things can't be sold. 
"Unfortunately, at this point, it's a policy question, not a communications challenge," said Stanley B. Greenberg, who was Bill Clinton's pollster. "They've got to internationalize it."
Republicans say that Mr. Bush has to give more speeches with a good-news theme, and talk up the new schools, hospitals and power plants in Iraq. 
"Part of the problem is, the president has got more than one thing on his plate," said Charles Black, a longtime Republican strategist who is close to the White House. "He can't go speak about Iraq every day, but every chance that he gets they ought to err on the side of him doing a lot of news on Iraq until people understand a little bit better what we're trying to do."
Advertising executives say that Mr. Bush has to say in public what his advisers are saying in private, which is that they were unprepared for the problems of the occupation. "It's basic Selling 101," Mr. Deutsch said. "If a car in the past has had a problem flipping over, you have to hit it head on. The American public gives people second and third chances."
G. Clotaire Rapaille, a French-born medical anthropologist who has done psychological consumer research for Seagram, Procter & Gamble and Ford, agreed -- up to a point. The most important thing, he said, is for the president to move on. "Everything that happened yesterday is irrelevant," Mr. Rapaille said. 
On the other hand, he said, citing statistics about new schools in Baghdad is not the answer. "This is kind of boring," Mr. Rapaille said. 
The important thing is to tell a story. "I would have an Iraqi child, and I would make a hero of this child," Mr. Rapaille said. "And then we have him on television telling, 'Today I went to school, I talked to my grandmother, and this is what my future is going to be now. I want to study, I want to become an engineer.' " 
Then, Mr. Rapaille said, "we can have e-mails sent to this child, we create connections. So that's for one day."
The next day, Mr. Rapaille said, the president's advisers should find a young Iraqi woman who wants to be married and have children, and they should put her on television with the message, "now there is peace, she can do just that." The next week, Mr. Rapaille said, "we have a guy who wants to start a shop to repair cars."
Or as Mr. Rapaille concluded, in the words of a true salesman, "Right now it's not that the president is not good, it's that the story is bad."

The White House Wants to Create Jobs, but How?

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
REPUBLICAN senators returned from their summer recess after Labor Day to find a memo in their in-baskets from Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who holds the No. 3 spot in their leadership. "The top issue continues to be the economy/jobs," he wrote. "Let me repeat that. The top issue continues to be the economy/jobs."
 That same week, President Bush went to Kansas City, Mo., and Indianapolis to lay out what he called "a comprehensive plan for job creation all across America." The president said he would not "be satisfied until every American who's looking for a job can find a job." 
 The president must hope the economy, recovering strongly in other respects, begins to produce more jobs soon. But his program seems unlikely by itself to do the trick, as even some conservatives admit.
Its central feature would make permanent the tax cuts now due to expire later in the decade. Even if, as the president says he believes, lowering taxes mostly for affluent individuals is the best way to stimulate the economy in the long run, the new jobs would not be created for many years. 
The other parts of the plan are mainly staples of the Republican agenda not directly related to job creation and, in any event, unlikely to have much effect on employment before the election. They include reducing government regulations on business, protecting companies from class-action lawsuits, exploring new sources of energy and allowing companies to put less money into their employee pension plans.
"Basically, he's just crossing his fingers and hoping for the best," said Bruce Bartlett, a Republican economist who worked in the first Bush administration.
Jobs have also been the issue of the month for the Democratic presidential contenders. Last week, days after he announced his candidacy, Gen. Wesley K. Clark made job creation the topic of his first formal issues paper. At their debate in New York on Thursday, the 10 candidates tried to outdo one another in demonstrating their commitment to reducing unemployment.
Since George W. Bush became president, the country has lost 2.7 million payroll jobs. Even the most optimistic White House economists do not believe that so many new jobs can be found between now and January 2005. So this will almost certainly be the first presidential term since Herbert Hoover's in which fewer Americans were at work at the end of the four years than at the beginning, even though other presidents experienced recessions deeper than Mr. Bush's.
The president's political advisers see this jobs picture as his biggest liability going into the election year. 
In February, the president's Council of Economic Advisers forecast that 510,000 new jobs would be generated this year. In fact, through last month, 437,000 jobs had been lost, 93,000 in August alone.
THE latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, in July, found that 38 percent of the respondents believed the economy and jobs to be "the most important problem facing this country today," almost four times as many as those who cited the war in Iraq, the second-most-common response. A poll last week by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News found that 52 percent of those surveyed were not pleased with the way Mr. Bush had handled the economy.
"They are biting their fingernails," said a prominent Republican economist about the people he talks to regularly at the White House.
A Republican strategist who meets often with top administration officials said they were "more concerned about the economy and the lack of job creation than they are about Iraq."
Democrats see an opening. "The jobs issue is the key," said Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
Mr. Bush seems determined to avoid the fate of his father, who was defeated for re-election in 1992 at least in part because he seemed insensitive to a weak economy. This president talks about jobs at every opportunity. In a recent 21-minute speech at the White House on the environment, he mentioned jobs or the economy more than 20 times. 
The president has suggested creating a new assistant secretary in the Commerce Department devoted to manufacturing, the economic sector with most of the job loss. The department plans to issue a report next month on steps that could make the business climate more attractive to manufacturers.
Given political and economic realities, that may be the only course available to Mr. Bush.
Interest rates are already at their lowest level in 40 years. Mr. Bush cannot expect the Federal Reserve to drive them lower.
Three straight years of tax cuts, the president's tonic for whatever ails the economy, have not improved the jobs picture but have led to the largest budget deficit in history. Further tax reductions between now and the election are not in the offing.
For the sake of protecting manufacturing jobs, Mr. Bush has already imposed stiff tariffs on imported steel, and his administration has begun scolding China and Japan about the high value of their currencies. Additional steps to restrain imports are not likely.
A Democratic president at this stage would probably propose an employment-intensive public works program. But such programs run counter to Republican philosophy, and the large budget deficit probably rules them out anyway.
"Essentially, the choices have already been made," said William C. Dudley, director of domestic economic research at Goldman Sachs. 
The tax cuts Mr. Bush worked so hard for might have led to more jobs more quickly if they had been aimed more at low- and moderate-income households, Mr. Dudley said, because those people are the most likely to spend their tax savings.
"But," Mr. Dudley added, "that ship has sailed."

A chart last Sunday showing the percentage of payroll jobs gained or lost under presidential administrations from Herbert Hoover to George W. Bush labeled the figures for Franklin D. Roosevelt's terms incorrectly. The first figure shown for Mr. Roosevelt, 45.5 percent, was for his first two terms, not his first term alone. The second figure, 21.5 percent, was for his third term, not his second.

An economist strolls through history and turns patent theory upside down.

BYLINE:  By Teresa Riordan 

 BODY:
CAN a theoretical stroll through the Crystal Palace exhibition of 1851 in London -- at which thousands of inventions from countries around the world were on display -- tell us something about the nature of innovation today?
 Petra Moser, now an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, took exactly such a stroll -- in the form of a Ph.D. thesis -- and has come up with some surprising conclusions that are attracting the attention of fellow scholars. This month the Economic History Association awarded her a dissertation prize at its annual meeting. 
 On Friday she will be giving a seminar on her research at the University of Maryland in College Park. 
One of Professor Moser's conclusions is that developing countries like India, which is scheduled to come into full compliance with an international patent treaty in 2005, may be better off without strong patent laws.
The conventional wisdom among economists has been that a robust patent system helped transform the United States into an economic powerhouse. And this may be true. But, Professor Moser concludes, what was good for America and Britain in the 19th century is not necessarily good for emerging, largely rural economies in countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
"In economics, we are taught that patent laws are what create incentives for innovation," she said. "But many of the best innovators in what was the high technology of the day came from some of the smallest countries in Europe, and these nations did not have patent laws."
Professor Moser found, for example, that Swiss inventors tended to concentrate their efforts in watch making and specialized steel making for scientific and optical instruments. Their innovations were exceedingly difficult to reverse-engineer and thus were successfully guarded as trade secrets.
"There were competitions in England to reproduce some Swiss innovations in steel," Professor Moser said. "But the English just couldn't figure out how to do it. The Swiss would have been silly to patent these innovations."
That is because the purpose of patents is twofold: to protect the inventor and to speed technological progress. Thus, patent laws require that an inventor, in a quid pro quo exchange for the limited monopoly that a patent provides, disclose his methods to others. "Countries without patent laws have much larger shares of their innovations where patenting would have been a bad idea," Professor Moser said.
Meanwhile, inventors from countries not governed by patent laws were free to appropriate ideas patented by innovators in other countries.
The French inventor Hippolyte Mege-Mouriez, who invented margarine in 1870, blithely showed his invention to two Dutch entrepreneurs. Mr. Mege-Mouriez, having received a patent, felt confident that his idea was protected. The Dutch entrepreneurs took the Frenchman's ideas, improved on them (keeping their improvements secret) and established a thriving margarine business that in the 20th century merged into the multinational conglomerate Unilever. Mr. Mege-Mouriez died a pauper.
Professor Moser's work builds on work of Jacob Schmookler and Kenneth Sokoloff, both of whom have used 19th-century patent records to correlate rates of invention with market demand.
But her source material was not patents, since many of the inventions she studied were not patented. Rather, she combed through exhibition catalogs from the Crystal Palace exhibition and the 1876 Centennial exhibition in Philadelphia.
"The idea of using the exhibition data to empirically examine this idea was exceptionally creative, and the analysis was well executed," said Professor Sokoloff, a professor of economics at the University of California at Los Angeles. "Petra deserves enormous credit."
For about two hours every day during the four years she pursued her doctorate in economics at the University of California at Berkeley, Professor Moser entered data from 33,000 19th-century exhibition inventions into a spreadsheet.
The Crystal Palace exhibition was the first in a series of world fairs at which countries showed off their newest technologies. More than 6 million people visited the Crystal Palace, and almost 10 million people attended the Centennial Exhibition.
"Exhibition data are particularly useful for studying the effects of patent laws on innovation because they measure economically useful innovation in a way that is independent of changes in patent laws," Professor Moser said. "Countries without patent laws were really doing quite well."
So what is the lesson for Brazil, China, India and other countries that are being pressed by industrialized nations to create strong patent systems?
"We try to force patent laws on developing countries and say, This is best for you," she said. "Then we are surprised when they say they don't want patent laws. But they have a point. Such laws could actually hinder innovation in those countries."

Netflix Uses Speed to Fend OffWal-Mart Challenge

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS THOMPSON 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif. 

 BODY:
Reed Hastings, Netflix's 42-year-old co-founder and chief executive, has made a lot of money from starting his business. But he is not planning to retire to enjoy his riches anytime soon.
 The company, one of the few surviving successes of the dot-com era, has been profitable in renting DVD's by mail through an innovative online service. But Netflix now faces a bruising challenge from Wal-Mart Stores, the $244 billion-a-year retailing monolith that has recently started a competing rental business with nearly identical offerings. 
 Wal-Mart has enough money "to send a man to the moon," Mr. Hastings said. "We alternate between stark raving fear and bracing optimism." 
So far, Netflix has stayed several steps ahead of Wal-Mart and other threats, like movie services using streaming video technology over the Internet.
The companies' differences are evident in everything from size to strategies to attitude. Visitors to the headquarters of Walmart.com, the retailer's e-commerce operation in Brisbane, Calif., are greeted by a revolving door that spins when it senses their approach and opens up into a giant atrium with a view of San Francisco Bay. Visitors to Netflix's headquarters in San Jose are greeted by a cardboard cutout of Gandalf, the wizard from "Lord of the Rings."
Netflix allows customers to rent as many DVD's as they can handle for a monthly fee of $20. Customers select the films online from Netflix's 15,000-movie library and are allowed to have three out at any time.
Netflix provides postage-paid envelopes for returning the films. Once a customer watches a film and mails it back, Netflix sends out the next on a list of movies created online by the customer. Relying extensively on word of mouth, the company has about a million subscribers, including more than 5 percent of San Francisco households.
Wal-Mart began a very similar pilot program last October and fully started it in June through Walmart.com. Its prices, envelopes and movie selection are nearly the same as Netflix's.
The company will not release figures on its subscriber base. Tom Adams, founder of Adams Market Research, said that although Wal-Mart.com was gaining subscribers, it would have, at most, a fifth the number of Netflix subscribers at the end of the year.
Netflix's advantage comes from having started when DVD's were rare and having developed a big lead in customers, revenue and brand recognition. "No one is going to out-hare Netflix," Mr. Hastings said. "Our danger is in a tortoise attack."
Wal-Mart is an adversary that has the ability to mount a steady, relentless attack. 
The retailer's advantages, said a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, Cynthia Lin, include its ability to process and ship DVD's from existing facilities and its ability to advertise directly to the 100 million shoppers it says visit Wal-Mart stores weekly.
The company already packages advertising for its DVD rental service with the DVD players it sells. It currently operates 7 shipping centers (compared with Netflix's 18) and plans to open more centers at other Wal-Mart facilities.
Netflix, on the other hand, has a large subscriber base and has spent several years testing and debugging the intricate software that controls the shipping and rental processes. Wal-Mart is still working out the kinks. Of the five movies it chose to promote on its online DVD rental home page recently, for example, three required a wait of more than two weeks and one required a wait of more than a month. All of those films were immediately available at Netflix.
And in June Netflix, whose share price has more than doubled since it went public in 2002, won a patent covering much of its business model. It could use the patent at some point to stifle competitors or, more likely, to demand licensing fees. Netflix's stock closed Friday at $34.81 a share.
Blockbuster has also begun to investigate the online DVD rental market. Last year, it acquired Film Caddy, a small Netflix competitor. Blockbuster, however, considers online rental itself to be a niche market and is focused on a program it plans to start rolling out next year that would integrate online and in-store rentals.
"The vast majority of people don't want to wait by the mailbox for their movies," Karen Raskopf, a spokeswoman for Blockbuster, said.
Several smaller competitors also offer similar services, but Netflix appears unfazed by them. But if Blockbuster and Wal-Mart "wanted to get at the market in a big way, they could beat Netflix," said Safa Rashtchy, a senior analyst at Piper Jaffray. So far, she added, "they have been ambivalent."
In the meantime, Mike Schuh of Foundation Capital, one of the earliest financial backers of Netflix, noted that "the barriers to entry in this market are low, but the barriers to profitability are extremely high."
Mr. Hastings believes that Netflix can succeed just as Amazon.com has managed to establish itself in its rivalry with store-based book chains like Barnes & Noble and Borders. Most optimistically, he considers the entry of Wal-Mart into the market as validation of his business strategy, which he considers to be a combination of both old- and new-economy approaches that once might have been dismissed by 90's-era promoters of the "new new thing" as hopelessly old-fashioned.
On the old-economy side, Netflix spends considerable time and effort perfecting the red envelopes it uses to mail DVD's to minimize weight, maximize protection for the discs and enhance the speed at which the envelopes can be processed by the Postal Service.
At one of the company's shipping centers, also in San Jose, workers earning $8.50 to $10.50 an hour apply mailing labels by hand. The most exciting piece of technology -- an elaborate conveyor belt system -- has not been used in a year because the company decided that moving the video discs with trolleys was more efficient.
"We have a very, very vanilla approach," said Marc Randolph, who founded the company with Mr. Hastings but left last year.
Netflix, however, does rely on sophisticated software that allows it to process and ship DVD's as soon as they are returned. It also sees great potential in software that can offer film recommendations to an individual subscriber based on how highly other subscribers -- particularly those who rent similar movies -- have rated them.
This system gives life to customer favorites that were not supported by much studio advertising. For example, Netflix points to "Talk to Her," a critically acclaimed independent film by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar, which Netflix users gave rave reviews. It was rented more often in its first six months on NetFlix than "Daredevil," the box office hit with Ben Affleck that received much less positive reviews on the site.
Wal-Mart, with a different demographic audience and lacking the large database of previous customer ratings to mine, says that "Daredevil" is doing about seven times as well as "Talk to Her" in its online rental program. Blockbuster would not release its data on those two films but said that 80 percent of its rentals came from the company's new-release selections.
Netflix says that large box-office hits still account for the core of its business, but the company notes that its customers make up about 2 percent of all video rentals compared with 30 percent of all the rentals for "Talk to Her." Netflix said it was responsible for about 10 to 12 percent of the market for rentals of small independent films.
"Netflix is without question one of the most efficient and convenient resources for consumers who want niche and independent films" said Fritz Friedman, a spokesman at Columbia Tri-Star Home Entertainment, which distributed "Talk to Her."
Netflix also rents documentary films and has distributed 13 documentary films that major studios did not pick up. It does not carry pornography, partly because Mr. Hastings considers himself "a prude" and partly for fear of legal costs. The only full-length movie unrented by anyone after remaining more than 90 days in Netflix's catalog is "Alien Blood," a 1999 film described in its studio publicity as "an offbeat vampire/alien movie, featuring sex and bloodshed."
Netflix's most popular feature may be the fact that it has no late fees. "Returning videos is a pain," said Mia McCroskey, a Netflix user who works for a subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Hastings, in fact, said he founded the company in part because of frustration over a $40 late fee at his local video store.
Kerry Echols, a Netflix user who has the longest personal queue of requested movies on record, at over 1,700 films, says that Netflix's policy is particularly good for saving money during bouts of what he calls "video guilt." A former video store worker and now a journalist in Birmingham, Ala., Mr. Echols said video guilt occurred when someone "rents an early Ingrid Bergman film because he thinks he should; but he really wants to watch 'Gilligan's Island' reruns, so he just keeps the Bergman film and racks up late fees."
Besides new entrants in the rental market, Netflix also faces a more powerful if more distant challenge: the likelihood that DVD's will in the future no longer be the medium of choice for home entertainment and that customers will instead watch films that they download to their computers and television sets.
Netflix "has taken one step by moving its stores onto the Internet," says Michael Ramsey, chief executive of TiVo, the digital video recorder service, and a Netflix board member. "The next step is moving into electronic distribution."
"I'm worried that we'll be the king of DVD's," Mr. Hastings said, "but then someday that won't matter."

Guarding Privacy vs. Enforcing Copyrights

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
Sometimes, it seems, the sanctity of data is in the eye, and ideology, of the beholder. The libertarian stripe found in many meets some seeming contradictions when the discussion turns from swapping songs to sharing personal information.
 Many of the people who argue that they should not have to pay for one kind of file (say, the latest song from J. Lo) can become outraged at the thought of sharing another kind of file -- say, the one that contains their personal financial data or a map of their Web wanderings. 
 The issues came into sharp focus recently in two data firestorms. In one, Internet denizens expressed outrage over the lawsuits the recording industry filed against 261 people accused of being large-scale swappers of pirated music. At the same time, equally fierce outrage met news that JetBlue Airways had handed over customer records to a military contractor for a test program to blend the data with personal financial information from another company to spot likely terrorists. 
Some Internet activists have said that privacy should be treated like a property right -- and a wave of companies arose in the 1990's to create a marketplace in which people could retain control of their personal information and even be paid when someone wants access to it. (They call themselves "infomediaries," and the concept has proved as ungainly as the word.)
Taken as a whole, these events have set up a potential ideological conflict between protecting privacy rights and protesting the enforcement of copyrights. The American Civil Liberties Union, for example, which has sponsored a "Take Back Your Data" campaign to promote online privacy, is also filing a lawsuit to protect the rights of file traders against the entertainment industry. 
"This is relatively new and treacherous ground," said Alan Davidson, associate director for the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. The group, which has focused on issues of privacy and civil liberties online, found itself without a place in the copyright wars about a year ago and decided that it needed to go on active duty, Mr. Davidson said. "We realized that so many of the things that C.D.T. has stood for -- the open, decentralized vision of the Internet -- are threatened by some of the ideas on how to protect copyright online." 
But establishing a position has been difficult for the group, which takes a pragmatic view of policy issues. The copyright issue "cuts through all these different coalitions we had built up over time" among high-tech groups, he said. "There is no real negotiating going on."
The center had a coming out of sorts at recent Congressional hearings over the recording industry lawsuits against file traders. Mr. Davidson delivered careful testimony that called for changes in the law governing subpoenas that copyright holders can obtain -- currently with scant judicial oversight -- as they try to find file traders and other copyright infringers.
Those subpoenas, which are allowed under the Millennium Digital Copyright Act of 1998, have become a point of contention for the high-tech civil liberties groups, which see them as heavy-handed tactics -- a crusade against data piracy that can quickly become an invasion of data privacy.
Mr. Davidson said his group saw the testimony as a cautious first step. "We're not going to be bomb throwers," he said. Instead, the group is hoping "to find the places where there might be middle-ground solutions."
But another digital advocacy group, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, sees little contradiction between the privacy and piracy campaigns. The group has taken a highly vocal stance in favor of protecting music file traders, but has also been at the forefront of the online privacy fight. Cindy Cohn, the foundation's legal director, said that privacy rights and copyrights were not really comparable. 
"I think artists should be paid," Ms. Cohn said, explaining that her group is fighting industry tactics, not artists' rights. "We want people to keep creating." But problems arise, she said, if the industry's subpoena power violates file traders' privacy without the court protections that are available to people in criminal investigations. 
The rights to protect privacy and to protect intellectual property started from very different doctrines, said Mike Godwin, a lawyer with Public Knowledge, a group that focuses on the many battlegrounds of the copyright wars. Copyright and patent rights, Mr. Godwin said, were enshrined in the Constitution, with provisions to ensure that the creators were paid for the fruits of their ideas and that the public had access to those ideas -- a very delicate balancing act that is at the heart of a healthy marketplace of ideas. A constitutional right of privacy was divined only later, beginning with the theories of Louis D. Brandeis, who became a Supreme Court justice, and was drawn from "penumbral" rights of freedom of speech and the feeling of security in one's home, he said. 
Privacy rights and intellectual property rights are also treated differently under the law, Mr. Godwin said. Copyrights protect only the specific expression of an idea or information, as in a song or a book. But in the right to privacy, the information itself -- a Social Security number, the medications you buy -- must be protected. 
"That's a very rare and fundamentally different right," he said. "These are two different bodies of law -- the legal theories are different," and different things are protected. 
That argument appeals to Jessica Litman, a professor at the Wayne State University law school in Detroit. She suggests that the comparison between privacy rights and property rights is the sort of thing that sounds good if you say it fast, but that breaks down under close scrutiny. 
Ms. Litman looked askance at advocates who, during the 1990's, in an attempt to get lawmakers to pay more attention to privacy, began talking about private information as a form of personal property. 
"I am one of the people who, back then, said, 'This is a terrible idea,"' she said. Property law is largely intended, she said, to make it possible to sell property, not to keep it secure. The property framework does fit intellectual property, she said, because those rights help artists and their representatives "trade their art for money." 
Mr. Davidson agreed. "There's just a big difference between personal privacy, and the protections that get afforded to a copyrighted work," he said, and then laughed. "But of course, I would say that. I'm one of the people that could be accused of inconsistency."

HEADLINE: OPEC Seeks Outside Help on Supply 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
OPEC does not plan to cut production further to keep oil prices stable unless Russia, Mexico and other non-OPEC members agree to make cuts to help offset growing Iraqi production, the president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said over the weekend.
 "I don't think OPEC will cut more and more just to stabilize the market and the others will take all this share," Abdullah al-Attiyah, the president of OPEC, said here, where he is attending the United States-Arab Economic Forum. 
 OPEC, which pumps a third of the world's crude oil, agreed last week to reduce output to 24.5 million barrels a day, or 3.5 percent. The energy minister of Russia, Igor K. Yusufov, said that his country would support future OPEC actions, Mr. Attiyah said. Mexico and Angola have also expressed support and Norway may participate in the future, he said. 
Iraq is expected to produce 1.64 million barrels a day by December and 2.8 million barrels next year, Mr. Attiyah said. When Iraq, Nigeria and Venezuela supplies were disrupted by the war in Iraq and unrest in the other countries, OPEC increased production to maintain supply. Now, Nigerian and Venezuelan production is back and Iraq is returning, Mr. Attiyah said.
"OPEC alone cannot protect the market," he said.
He said non-OPEC countries have had a history of backing OPEC to control supply. In March 1999, all of them participated and cut production when oil dropped below $10 a barrel, he said.
OPEC decided to reduce production after considering internal forecasts that showed the world oil supply might exceed consumption by 1.4 million barrels a day in the first quarter, hurting prices.
Iraq plans to produce as much as 4 million barrels a day by 2005 and seek the help of international oil companies to develop its oil reserves, Iraq's oil minister, Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum, said last week.

HEADLINE: Fixing Flaws, Microsoft Invites Attack 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Microsoft's Security Response Center in Redmond, Wash., is the computing equivalent of a hospital emergency ward. When a problem comes in the door the center's director, Kevin Kean, and his staff must swiftly make an assessment: Is the security weakness detected in a Microsoft software product only minor? Or is it possibly so serious that, if exploited by a vandal's malicious code (as happened last month with the Blaster worm) it might crash computers and networks around the world?
 If the threat appears grave, the problem goes immediately into the center'semergency operating room, where it is attended to by a team of Microsoft engineers, working nearly round-the-clock to analyze the flawed code, anticipate paths of attack, devise a software patch to fix the defect and alert millions of customers of the problem and the patch. 
 "It's triage and emergency response -- so it's a lot like an E.R. ward in that sense," Mr. Kean observed last week. 
The race to protect the computing patient has begun again.
On Sept. 10, after Mr. Kean's team completed another E.R. mission, Microsoft issued an emergency warning of a critical vulnerability in its Windows operating systems and released a patch -- its 39th so far this year. What particularly worries computer professionals about the warning is that the security hole in Windows is the same kind of flaw, in the same feature of the operating system, that was exploited in August by the notorious Blaster worm.
Those who monitor Internet crises know that once Microsoft raises the alarm and releases a patch, a curious race begins. Digital vandals -- those who write worms, viruses and other rogue programs -- eagerly download the patch and reverse-engineer, taking it apart to search for clues on how to exploit the very Microsoft security hole the patch was meant to cover.
Some portion of Microsoft customers, from corporations to home PC users, takes the time to download the patch, but most do not. Meanwhile, there is a scramble to write malicious code and spread it across the Internet.
The Blaster worm was sighted on the Internet 25 days after Microsoft warned of that security hole. The company issued the latest warning 19 days ago. So if recent history is a guide, Blaster 2 may be coming soon to a computer near you.
The brand-name worms and viruses of the last couple of years -- Blaster, SoBig, Slammer, Code Red, Nimda, ILoveYou and others -- are simply the most virulent representatives of an alarming surge in attacks by malicious programmers. 
The CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon University, which monitors rogue computer programs, reported 76,404 attack incidents in the first half of this year, approaching the total of 82,094 for all of last year. And the 2002 incident count was nearly four times the total in 2000. If anything, the CERT statistics may understate the problem, because the organization counts all related attacks as a single incident. A worm or virus like Blaster or SoBig, a self-replicating program that can infect millions of computers, is but one event.
The security flaws Mr. Kean's team is scrambling to catch and patch are part of the larger problem with software today. The programs that people rely on for all manner of tasks -- from writing reports and sending e-mail, to monitoring factory floors and managing electric power grids -- are becoming increasingly large, complex and, all but inevitably, filled with bugs. The problem is magnified by the fact that most computers are now linked to the Internet, enabling programs to travel around the globe and mingle with other programs in unforeseen ways.
Most software bugs are a result of small oversights by a programmer. And most large software programs are combinations of newer code and old code, accumulated over time, almost as if in sedimentary layers. A programmer working years ago could not have foreseen the additional complexity and the interaction of software programs in the Internet era. Yet much of that old code lives on, sometimes causing unintended trouble.
Security holes, computer experts say, are a manifestation of the fragile and often unreliable software foundation that underlies today's economy. "These worms and virus attacks are just the visible tip of a massive iceberg," said Peter G. Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI International, a research firm.
The major rogue programs all exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft products, and Microsoft is the leading target of criticism by computer security experts. Indeed, Microsoft must shoulder a lot of the responsibility for the security woes suffered by its customers, analysts say. But the security weaknesses in Microsoft products, it seems, stem mainly from the company's success as the leader of the PC era of computing.
The PC business model has been to push products out the door fast, add features constantly and market each product version as a millennial event. Microsoft perfected the model and attracted millions of customers. But security experts note that the PC business model has not placed much value on building secure, well-engineered software.
The other reason Microsoft is the white whale for most digital vandals is that more than 90 percent of all desktop PC's run on the Windows operating system software. And the company's Office package of programs has more than 90 percent of the market for word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software.
Other operating systems like Linux, Unix and Macintosh, experts say, all have security vulnerabilities. "But they don't get the attention and the attacks because, unlike Microsoft, the other technologies are not deployed on 300 million computers," said Russ Cooper, a security expert at TruSecure, a computer security company. "This is not just Microsoft's problem."
The task of making software more reliable and secure will not be quick or easy. But computer scientists and industry analysts say that the goal is achievable, and that some encouraging steps have been taken. Improvements, they note, will depend largely on changing attitudes in the marketplace so that software makers have a greater incentive to invest in building better software.
"By and large, vendors build what people are willing to pay for," said Edward Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington. "People have historically been willing to pay for features -- not reliability or security."
There is evidence, though, that corporations and the federal government are placing a greater emphasis on obtaining secure software. Within the last two years, the government has pushed security initiatives in its technology policy, especially in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Recent moves by the government include placing greater emphasis during the purchasing process on software design and reliability standards like the Common Criteria and the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Policy No. 11, a Pentagon directive that went into effect 14 months ago.
Such standards now apply mainly to the Department of Defense and national security agencies, but Congress is looking to extend similar standards to other federal agencies. The federal government is the world's largest buyer of information technology, spending nearly $60 billion a year.
"If the government made a serious commitment to buying better software, it would change the industry," said Mary Ann Davidson, chief security officer of Oracle, the big database software company.
Two weeks ago, the House Subcommittee on Technology, Information Policy, Intergovernmental Relations and the Census, which is under the Committee on Government Reform, held a hearing on the impact of the Pentagon's programs to link procurement to tighter security standards for software.
Representative Adam H. Putnam, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee, said he saw great promise for adopting similar standards for civilian agencies. "The government can leverage its purchasing power," he said, "and can be a leader for the entire industry in setting rules and standards of engineering behavior."
A decisive step toward changing market incentives would be to expand product liability law to include software products. So far, software companies have sidestepped liability suits partly by selling customers licenses to use their programs, not own them, with a lengthy list of caveats and disclaimers.
The industry has resisted any suggestion that software should be held legally liable for bugs. The industry's argument is that software is a highly complex product, which users tend to misuse or modify, so trying to assign responsibility for a failure would be unfair to any single company.
Whether the software industry can continue to operate beyond the reach of product liability suits is uncertain.
A report last year by a panel of the National Academy of Sciences, "Cybersecurity Today and Tomorrow: Pay Now or Pay Later," included the recommendation that "policy makers should consider legislative responses to the failure of existing incentives to cause the market to respond adequately to the security challenge."
Professor Lazowska, a member of the panel who at times has advised Microsoft, explained, "You could draw an analogy to auto safety, where a set of government actions has caused automobiles to become far more safe over the course of the past 35 years."
Technology is giving programmers tools to build more reliable software. The Java programming language, created at Sun Microsystems, and C#, developed later by Microsoft, are technologies for creating "managed code," which sharply limits the damage that can be done by errant lines of programming. "You have to design it so that bad things don't happen when programmers make mistakes," said William Joy, the former chief scientist at Sun.
At Microsoft, much more time is now being set aside in the design cycle of products for security considerations, a mandate approved by senior management this spring. "There is a shift from mainly an emphasis on working features to an emphasis on trustworthy and secure computing," said Steven B. Lipner, director of security engineering strategy at Microsoft.
Some of the tougher security standards, Mr. Lipner said, have shown measurable improvement in Windows Server 2003, which shipped earlier this year. The number of security vulnerabilities detected so far is half as many as at this stage after the release of Windows Server 2000, Mr. Lipner said.
Yet years of steady progress in the quality of software engineering will be needed for big gains in security and reliability to become apparent. And it starts with education, noted Shawn Hernan, a security specialist at CERT. He makes a game of seeing how quickly he can find security vulnerabilities in the programming examples used in college textbooks. It rarely takes him more than few minutes.
"The textbook examples are riddled with vulnerabilities," Mr. Hernan noted. "Computer science culture is based on, build it, get it working and fix it later. We need a culture change away from the cowboy and toward the engineer."
Even as his E.R. team scrambles to patch Microsoft's security holes, Mr. Kean agreed. "It's not just Microsoft," he said. "The world will commit itself to more secure computing. There will be a cultural change."

C1) Chart/Diagram: "Attacking Computers by Overloading Them"Computers are designed to share information and to be easily accessible over networks, but that also makes them vulnerable to worms -- types of viruses that automatically duplicate themselves. Among the most disruptive worms are those that overload the memory of computers, causing so-called buffer overflows. HOW A WORM CAN CAUSE A BUFFER OVERFLOW A file containing a worm is sent to a computer on a network. The computer looks at the file name to see if it is short enough to be handled by the computer memory. File names cannot exceed a fixed number of characters. The file name appears to be short enough, but the actual file name is hidden and is too long. When the computers on the network -- which share the file -- try to read the name, it overflows the memory, or buffer, set aside on each computer to read names. After the overflow, code in the worm gives the computer instructions, essentially taking control of the computer. (pg. C5)

This Guru Hugs a Lot, and Gets Lots of Love Back

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: COCHIN, India, Sept. 27 

 BODY:
In a palatial room, about 100 mostly Indian-born business leaders discussed long-term strategies for uplifting India's masses this weekend. About two miles away, those masses spiraled around a stadium, waiting for a short-term uplift -- a hug, and a few whispered words of reassurance -- from a small and, some say, divine woman in white. 
 They represented two faces of the Indian meritocracy, which has proved capable of producing some of the world's most successful technology entrepreneurs and of transforming a woman of humble roots into a global guru worshipedby millions. 
 This weekend they overlapped, brought together to celebrate the 50th birthday of the guru, Mata Amritanandamayi, known as Amma, or Mother. She was joined by India's deputy prime minister, Hollywood stars, peace advocates and hundreds of thousands of devotees, who lined up for her trademark "darshan" -- the hug she has bestowed on what her followers say is 20 million people. 
As part of the event, President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam had brought together Indian and Indian-American business leaders to help realize his vision for making India a developed nation by 2020. Some of the executives were Amma followers. Others were new initiates, like Sriram Viswanathan, a managing director at Intel, who described his hug as "pretty dramatic." Others said they would give interviews only if they were not asked questions about spirituality. 
But their distance was hard to maintain. Even if he felt distaste for the Amma hagiography, including the regular references to "her holiness," any corporate titan would have to admire her advertising campaign. The chief executives were subjected to repeated showings of videos about her life and good works. In the stadium where the main celebration was held, banners featured her sayings next to the names of commercial sponsors. 
The city was blanketed with her image, including larger-than-life posters of her walking on water. 
It was an apt image for some of her followers -- like Sindhu Nataraj, a 25-year-old housewife who waited in line to see Amma for hours this morning -- who say they see her as God. When she vacated a chair, men and women knelt to stroke and kiss it. Her presence, even the mere thought of her, made some devotees weep. 
This dark-skinned woman with a glowing smile has a Clintonesque ability to focus intensely on whoever is in front of her, even if she has been hugging for 10 hours straight. Like many empires, hers began small. She was born to a poor, low-caste family, the legend goes, which mistreated her and then cast her out when she began to speak of her visions of God. Eventually, a small, dedicated group of devotees gathered, moved by her compassion. 
She has founded an 800-bed hospital, a medical college and a university. She has built thousands of houses for the poor. She has an ashram in Kerala that is home to 1,800 people, and about two dozen ashrams abroad, including a 160-acre complex in northern California. This week she was being transported in a white Mercedes. 
Much of her financing comes from overseas, but Hindu nationalists, usually wary of foreign support or religion in India, are also among her fans. 
Much like the executives, many of whom now live in the United States but commute back to India, she has built a bridge to the West. On her initial visit to the United States, recalled Steven Fleisher, one of her early devotees there and now general counsel of her nonprofit foundation in America, perhaps a dozen people came to see her. But her following grew. In 1997, her followers decided to "launch" her. 
Rob Sidon, a marketing consultant and devotee, reached out to media outlets across the country. The initial pitch was tough, he recalled: "She hugs?" But eventually the "hugging saint" caught on, and now she draws thousands in America and elsewhere. She spends half the year on the road, including two American tours. The lines for hugs, which are free, are so long that people are given tokens to keep order. 
Her Western following is enormous. The stadium was crowded with American faces, including Linda Evans of "Dynasty" fame and Yolanda King, a daughter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
But tens of thousands of Indians also lined up for their hug. What is the appeal? Most people had trouble putting words to it. Mr. Fleisher, who is 58, compared it to the unconditional love a mother provides "even when you're bad." 
K. G. Jagadish, 74, a retired engineer and executive who was waiting to hear her speak this morning, said he did not see her as God, just as a compassionate woman seeking world peace. "She's very, very pure," he said. 
Using simple parables, her talk focused on elevating love over negativity, peace over anger. "Serving others should not be viewed as a tireless endeavor, but rather as an opportunity given to us by God," she said, or rather her translator did, since she spoke in Malayalam, her native language. 
The chief executives' discussion, in contrast, was considerably more pragmatic. They agreed to support President Kalam's plan, Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas. It calls for government and business to provide jobs and infrastructure to clusters of villages, to stanch the flow of people to the cities. 
The collective brainpower -- and bank balances -- in the room were a reminder of how India, in the 1990's, spawned a wealth of technology entrepreneurs. Sabeer Bhatia, the founder of Hotmail, was among the speakers. 
The weekend seemed to pose a question: Does India need more Amma-like love and compassion, or does it need -- as some of the executives argue -- more wireless technology? Some combination, many suggested, including Mr. Kalam, who combines exhortations for technological progress with entreaties to preserve India's civilization. 
Everyone knew the solutions, said B. V. Jagadeesh, the president and C.E.O. of Netscaler. They needed someone like Amma to bring them to the masses. 
"It's about marketing," he said, "how we can use the power of Amma to deliver." 
That power was evident today, when the lines wrapped around the stadium. Inside, as her Caucasian devotees turned slowly pink in a burning sun, she sat as still as a statue, eyes closed, while devotees bathed her feet in flower petals.

HEADLINE: Survey Shows Cabdrivers in Financial Bind, Renewing Push for Higher Fare 

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
A group representing thousands of taxi drivers said it would begin to push harder for an increase in fares, after a broad survey of drivers found that many -- facing higher gas prices and a weak economy -- are increasingly unable to support themselves with their jobs.
 The survey, to be released today, included 581 drivers who were interviewed at Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports last winter. It was the first time such a large group had been interviewed by the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents 4,800 of the more than 40,000 licensed taxi drivers in the city. 
 Among the survey's main findings was that 62 percent of the drivers reported facing some form of arrears in their rent or mortgage payments or in phone or utility bills. Almost two-thirds of the drivers, who were largely immigrants, said that they were the sole income earners in their families, and more than three-quarters said that they were supporting two or more family members. 
While taxi fares have not risen since 1996, the survey said, drivers' expenses, particularly for gas, have climbed sharply in the last seven years, and the cost of living has risen by 15 percent. Meanwhile, the upfront costs for drivers -- many lease their cabs daily from garages or brokers -- have stayed roughly the same, according to the drivers. And while demand for taxis has rebounded this year, many drivers have not recovered from the financial effects of the dip after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack.
"The current structure of the taxi industry places the financial burden and risks of the industry on drivers," the survey concluded. "They have little control over the conditions and terms of their work, and it is nearly impossible for drivers to achieve financial stability."
Bhairavi Desai, coordinator of the taxi group, said that while there was no way to verify the financial information provided by the drivers, she believed that the survey provided an accurate snapshot of the hardships they are now facing. Drivers in the survey reported taking home an average of only $22 per shift after expenses, she said, not enough to support their families even when working six days a week.
Many within the taxi industry contend that the $22 figure is not credible and say that most drivers make more money per shift. But many also agree that drivers are struggling and that the situation, in turn, makes it hard to attract qualified drivers. 
"There's no question that drivers are in need of a fare increase," said Michael Woloz, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents 13 taxi garages that account for about 20 percent of the industry. "But this whole industry needs an increase. It's the longest period in the history of the taxi industry that we haven't had one."
A spokesman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission declined to comment about the issue of a fare increase.
The garage group and the drivers' group have both petitioned the commission to raise fares, an action that requires the commission to formally assess the need for an increase. The garage group wants an increase of about 23 percent, while the drivers' group recommends that the base fare be kept at $2 but that the charge for each additional one-fifth of a mile increase to 40 cents from 30 cents and that the flat rate between Manhattan and Kennedy Airport rise to $45 from $35.
But the two groups disagree sharply about how much it costs drivers to lease cabs, the drivers' largest expense. While taxi owners say that any fare increase should be accompanied by a corresponding rise in the maximum allowable lease rates -- the maximum rates now range from $103 to $112 per shift -- the drivers' group says that an increase in lease rates would leave drivers in much the same straits as before, with most of a fare increase being passed on to the taxi owners. The drivers' group contends that the only way to help drivers is to raise fares and lower lease rates.
"Both politically and morally, it's the right thing to do," Ms. Desai said.
Mr. Woloz disagreed. "Just because someone owns the cab doesn't mean that he doesn't have needs here, too," he said. "Owners have their own expenses and bottom line to think about."

HEADLINE: The Mask of Warka 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A tip from an Iraqi led to a frightened boy, then to a smuggler, finally to a farm where -- wrapped in rags under six inches of dirt -- Iraqi police and U.S. troops recently found the priceless Mask of Warka, "the Mona Lisa of Mesopotamia," the face sculpted 5,500 years ago and stolen during the liberation of Baghdad. 
 Acting on another tip, searchers were directed to a garden near Tikrit, where they found a buried cache of weapons, including 23 missiles capable of shooting down aircraft. 
 Intelligence is the tool we need to find out where to dig. Those now so gleefully certain we will find no weapons of mass destruction may be surprised if -- someday -- an Iraqi technician, no longer terrified of reprisal or eager for reward, directs us to an easily hidden sack of deadly germs. 
Such a find would be treated with suspicion by the legion with a stake in failure. Planted by the C.I.A., they'd say; or, old viruses left over from a previous era. Nothing that helps justify our overthrow of this generation's bloodiest tyrant -- not human rights, not even a major victory in the war on terror -- will they find acceptable.
Evidence of that deep-seated denial is the reaction to the most significant and extensive poll conducted this year by the Gallup organization. 
The startling finding: despite all the hardships -- the early looting, the explosions and killings afterward, the publicized lack of power and worry about water, fear of the bands of criminals that Saddam released and of terrorists that Syria and Iran exported -- despite it all, two out of three residents of Baghdad believe that they are better off today under occupation than they were in the "orderly" times when Saddam was butchering his opposition. 
That is the opposite of the impression created by pictures of explosions and angry shouters. The Gallup results that get the news lead are those showing a slip in President Bush's approval rating. But when the newsworthy measurement of Iraqi pro-overthrow opinion is even reported, a secondary finding is emphasized: the popularity of Jacques Chirac. 
How should Bush and Tony Blair react to such failuremongering in the face of strategic success? They acted on the best information and logical evaluation, took no chances in stopping a proven sociopath and -- as Bush coolly reminded grumpy U.N. politicians who had vacillated for a decade -- "the world is safer today."
Realistically we should expect political campaigning, not gratitude, from the temporary leadership we appointed. As night follows day, members of the Iraqi Governing Council will outdo one another in demanding more authority quickly -- thereby currying favor with potential voters and future European customers -- while secretly hoping our coalition sticks around to make the country governable. 
We should take full advantage of the Franco-German-Russian shortsighted unwillingness to take part in Iraq's reconstruction. For example, that means the $10 billion claim on Iraq's empty treasury to pay for Saddam's arms should be paid by New Iraq on the day Vladimir Putin redeems the czarist debt, including interest, and not a day sooner. 
We should also take the $21 billion portion of the $87 billion budget that Bush earmarked for rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure and make that an obligation of an Iraq Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It is right for America to pay the military costs of regime change because it was clearly in our (and the free-riding world's) anti-terror interest. But New Iraq's huge oil reserves should be collateral for our low-interest loans to pay for the rebuilding of that nation's economy. 
The Iraq we ultimately leave behind will be happy to be rid of all occupiers. It will belong to the Arab League and OPEC. But it will not sponsor terror nor threaten its Kurds and Shiites with genocide. New Iraq has a good chance of showing its oppressed, downtrodden neighbors what freedom and enterprise can do for Arab peoples.
The happily recovered mask of Warka, with its mysterious oval face and darkened eyes -- relic of the Sumerian civilization that invented writing -- is a suitable symbol of the reborn nation. She may look a little like Hillary Clinton wearing sunglasses, but I think I can detect a smile.

HEADLINE: Selling Off Access to the Erie Canal; 
Developer's $30,000 Purchase Raises Concerns About the Process

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
The Erie Canal took more than 9,000 workers and eight years to build, at a cost of $8.3 million. More than a thousand laborers died while building it. But when it was completed, in 1825, it transformed the nation by linking the Eastern Seaboard to the American heartland.
 In 2002, a developer from Buffalo bought the exclusive access rights to this unique piece of Americana by answering an advertisement in an obscure government publication and becoming the sole bidder. For $30,000, the developer, Richard A. Hutchens, got the right to cut private canals into the 524-mile state canal system, allowing him to build housing developments with access to the canal on any land he purchases along a maximum of 9 percent of the canal's length, about 45 miles of shoreline. 
 Just how one man quietly purchased the right to tap into a piece of New York history for what seems to be a small sum will be the subject of a public hearing scheduled for Friday by Democrats in the State Assembly. The state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, is also looking into the bidding and sale. 
Some critics have alleged that the sale may have been a sweetheart deal, but canal officials dispute that. They say the contract received a proper review and was approved by the comptroller's office, though they acknowledge that they could have done a better job of publicizing the sale to attract more bidders.
"Upon reviewing the facts, it's clear that there was a process that was in the public domain, that was approved by the state comptroller, the attorney general and the Canal Recreationway Commission," said Michael Fleischer, executive director of the New York State Thruway Authority and the Canal Corporation, a subsidiary of the Thruway Authority that oversees the canal system.
Mr. Fleischer refused to say whether that process secured the best possible deal for the rights the state sold, and said that the chairman of the Thruway Authority, John L. Buono, had asked that a more public process, including wider advertisement and greater public outreach, be used in future projects.
Officials at the Canal Corporation note that the deal with Mr. Hutchens was made before Mr. Buono became head of the Thruway Authority in 2002 and before Mr. Fleischer became executive director this year. The details of Mr. Hutchens' deal with the state were made public this month in an article in The Post-Standard of Syracuse.
What is already known about how Mr. Hutchens bought the rights to build along the canal paints what some critics describe as a troubling picture of how New York State authorities, the huge quasi-public corporations that do everything from running the highway and subway systems to building dormitories and bridges, do business.
"This state is selling used trucks for more than it quietly sold the rights to the entire Erie Canal corridor," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat who is the chairman of a committee that oversees authorities and will hold the hearings in Albany. "This is extraordinary."
Mr. Hutchens, who has given money to Gov. George E. Pataki's campaigns and other state Republican funds, has had business ventures that include construction of low-income housing developments and frozen food distribution. He could stand to make millions should he be able to buy up land along the canal and build developments with water links. His business partner, Thomas Bystryk, said that it was a risky venture and that they had paid a fair price.
"We have invested in excess of a half million dollars, and not a dime came back yet," Mr. Bystryk said. 
Indeed, the modern-day lure of the canal is largely untested. But for much of the 19th century, it was the engine that drove New York's economy, making the state a manufacturing and shipping powerhouse. 
While the system is a treasure in history'seyes, its actual value now is difficult to state. Railroads superseded canals as the transportation method of choice. By 1959, when the Saint Lawrence Seaway was completed, the canal was all but abandoned. Today, mostly recreational and cruise boats ply the canal. 
Meanwhile, the system costs the state $70 million a year to operate, but it brings in only $2 million in fees and development rights. The Thruway Authority pays the difference.
In 1992, the system was put under the Canal Corporation. Given its near mythic place in history, the canal has something of a cult following, with a platoon of boosters, people who are bullish on prospects for redevelopment to attract tourists and upscale housing.
One of those boosters was Howard E. Steinberg. As chairman of the Thruway Authority in 1996, Mr. Steinberg wrote to 200 companies he thought might be interested in submitting proposals to redevelop land along the canal. Thirty-three responded, with proposals from theme park builders, cruise ship companies, a bank and real estate developers.
Officials at the Canal Corporation said most of the responses were perfunctory and did not hold much promise. They contacted several of the companies and began negotiations with one that proposed to build a marina and rent houseboats to vacationers, but the plan fell through, canal officials said.
In a letter to a canal official in 1998, Mr. Hutchens expressed an interest in building houses on small canals that would be cut from private land into the main canal system. Each house would have its own private waterway leading to the system, like a water driveway where homeowners could park their pleasure boats next to their garages or in a shared marina.
In April 1999, an advertisement appeared in the Contract Reporter, a state-run newsletter available only by subscription. The newsletter is a vehicle for agencies and authorities like the Canal Corporation to advertise items for bid.
The advertisement described a proposal similar to the one that had been outlined by Mr. Hutchens. Mr. Hutchens sent in the only written reply to the advertisement, and the authority negotiated a deal with him, ultimately agreeing to the $30,000 price for his exclusive right to cut into the canal.
Canal officials said the price was approved after a study by the accounting firm KPMG. The study concluded that while canal side development might turn out to be lucrative, the risk shouldered by the first developer and the capital outlay required to build would be so great that a low price made sense to jump-start development, canal officials said.
The officials said they did not know whether the 32 other companies that had expressed interest in the canal were contacted after the Canal Corporation received only one bid in response to the advertisement.
Mr. Hutchens hired a law firm run by H. Douglas Barclay, a former state senator and prominent Republican who was recently appointed as ambassador to El Salvador by President Bush. The contract was approved in May 2002.
Under its terms, which expire in 2007, Mr. Hutchens will make further payments of $15,000 for every cut into the canal once he begins building, and cuts for developments larger than 100 units would cost more. Also, each residence in the developments would be assessed a $300 annual fee for use of the canal; that fee would rise after five years.
Mr. Hutchens would have to buy private land near the canal to use the rights he purchased. He has yet to identify any sites, canal officials said. The agreement gives Mr. Hutchens right of first refusal on sites identified by other developers, but it does not preclude other deals that might be struck to develop land along the canal.
At least one other developer, Michael Bragman, a Democratic state assemblyman for two decades before resigning in 2002, is interested in building a similar project to the one Mr. Hutchens has proposed. Mr. Bragman, a Syracuse-based developer, plans to build a $95 million complex of luxury houses along the Oneida River, part of the canal system, that could sell for more than half a million dollars in Clay, north of Syracuse, using the right to cut into the canal Mr. Hutchens owns.
Mr. Hutchens reached an agreement with Mr. Bragman on using his rights. The amount of the deal has not been disclosed. The Canal Corporation said last week that under the contract, Mr. Hutchens did not have the right to make such an arrangement without its approval.
Mr. Bragman did not return more than half a dozen phone calls to his office requesting comment on the canal development deal.
Canal officials said the sale of access rights was reviewed and approved by the state comptroller's office and the state attorney general's office and an independent accounting firm reviewed the contract.
Marc Violette, a spokesman for Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, said such reviews addressed only the legality of the contract, not its merits. "It is not a seal of approval on the substance of the deal," he said.
The comptroller's office submitted questions about the canal deal to officials at the Canal Corporation, including a request for information about what happened to the 32 other companies that had expressed interest in the canal in 1996, canal officials said. The corporation produced the information and the comptroller's office approved the deal, canal officials said. But Dan Weiller, a spokesman for the comptroller, said the office was now looking into the deal.
Last week, the Canal Corporation hired a real estate firm to do another assessment of the value of the rights that Mr. Hutchens purchased.
Joseph Conway, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, said that "we believe the canal is a tremendous asset, and we have confidence in Chairman Buono and in the steps he's taken to review this process." 
Critics wonder whether the rights to something as legendary as the Erie Canal should have been sold so quietly and for so little money. Assemblyman Brodsky said he wanted to know, among other things, why the 32 other companies that wrote to Mr. Steinberg in response to his letter in 1996 were not contacted about the rights being put up for bid in the Contract Reporter in 1999.
"First, you don't know the value of something until you test it in a competitive environment," he said. "In this case, they had only one bidder, so it was not competitive. The second thing is, if the market won't yield sufficient value for a resource, maybe it is better to take it off the market and rethink how it should be used."
Blair Horner, executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, which advocates open government, said that while the sale of the canal rights appeared on the surface to comply with state rules, it also exposed how closed the world of state government was, particularly state authorities, which, by design, have little public oversight. "The secret and unaccountable nature of New York State public authorities has been a historical fact," he said. "It really is a very closed system that only the well connected can penetrate. Too often, secret government is bad government, where the public pays more and gets less."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
F.D.A. ponders pros and cons of the ways prescription drugs are promoted to consumers.

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives 

 BODY:
AN ad for the prescription drug Zoloft asks: "Feeling sad? Anxious? Tired?" Zoloft is sold by Pfizer as a treatment for depression and other disorders. It is but one of many print and broadcast advertisements that pitch prescription drugs directly to consumers -- a category of ads scrutinized last week at a hearing held by the Food and Drug Administration. 
 The two-day hearing, in Washington, was part of the agency's review of the rules governing prescription-drug advertising. Because many of the 29 studies presented at the hearing reported positive public results -- like increased communication between patients and doctors -- the prevailing prediction among supporters of the ads was that the drug agency would allow the ads to continue in much the same form as today. 
 "It's rare that you get such validation from a meeting like this," said Dick O'Brien, executive vice president and director for government affairs at the American Association of Advertising Agencies, a longtime advocate for the ads. "This is one where you feel all of a sudden like you're on the side of angels."
"My hope is that these two days were so positive that they may help to put this controversy to bed once and for all."
Even critics were not optimistic that the agency would make significant changes. They said the event, at which research was presented by attendees from Pfizer to Time Inc. to the Mayo Clinic, told just part of the story. Calls for change continued from critics like Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.
"Senator Edwards thinks it's misleading for an ad to show a woman running through a field while the fine print says 'may cause serious side effects,"' said Michael Briggs, the senator's press secretary. "The F.D.A. should require drug manufacturers to provide fair and balanced information about a drug's risks as well as the potential benefits."
Meanwhile, though, the ads are the darlings of broadcasting and publishing executives. Even in an uncertain economic climate, spending in the prescription-drug category totaled more than $2.5 billion last year, up from nearly $1.6 billion in 1999, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres.
More than just revenue, magazine executives said, the ads even give readers another reason to buy their publications. 
"Both the advertising and the editorial product provide information, and that presents a benefit to the reader," said Ellen Oppenheim, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the Magazine Publishers of America. Even some F.D.A. officials said the meeting showed that the ads can also have public health benefits.
"It's been an incredible sea change, from 'Is it a good thing?' to 'This is a good thing, and how can we make it better?"' said Peter J. Pitts, the drug agency's associate commissioner for external relations. 
Making it better might mean communicating risks more effectively, he said: "That's exactly what we're studying now. We're going to try to reach our own judgment on what would be the best path forward." The agency expects to propose any rule changes by the end of the year.
At Pfizer, executives said few if any changes were necessary. "We feel that the regulations are working the way they are," said Dorothy Wetzel, the company's vice president for United States consumer marketing of pharmaceuticals.
"My hope is that whatever comes out of the meeting really advances our ability as an industry to effectively communicate with consumers," she said. "It would be a shame if what comes out makes it more complicated and confusing."
But some critics showed no sign of backing off.
"This is a really unlevel playing field for consumers," said Larry D. Sasich, a research analyst at the health research group of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. "You have an industry that maintains that a 30-second or 60-second television spot empowers consumers to make an informed decision about their drug therapy." 
Instead, Mr. Sasich said, the spots play up the promise of the products, leaving consumers on their own to ferret out potential side effects or adverse reactions.
The Washington meeting did not adequately address such issues, said Barbara Mintzes, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Health Services and Policy Research at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
"The question is: Who was talking?" Ms. Mintzes said. "There were a few people presenting who were independent, but the large majority were either people from the industry or financed by them."
Anyone was welcome to present original research at the meeting, but an open door does nothing to ensure that all the relevent research is included, Ms. Mintzes said.
Linda Golodner, president at the National Consumers League, another nonprofit advocacy group, said that the meeting generally showed that consumers were using the information from ads as a springboard to seek more information. "They are not necessarily demanding the drug, but they want to see if that drug is right for them."
The problem with the ads, Ms. Golodner said, is that in many cases information on effectiveness and potential side effects is too hard to find, in contrast with the marketing claims being made about benefits.
"When risk information is given, an upset stomach is sort of given the same equality of liver damage," she said.
The Consumers League is pushing for rules requiring print ads to include a box summarizing all that information, similar to the nutrition box on packaged food.
But the Consumers League agreed with Ms. Mintzes and Public Citizen that the biggest improvement would be additional money for monitoring of the ads and greater power to punish violators.
Mr. Pitts, the drug agency commissioner, said that the agency constantly reviewed ads and was getting better at it.

HEADLINE: China Censors a Senator 

BYLINE:  By Ross Terrill; Ross Terrill, a research associate at Harvard's Fairbank Center for East Asian Research, is author of "The New Chinese Empire."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Hillary Clinton has good reason to be "amazed and outraged" that the Chinese edition of her biography "Living History" omits her criticisms of Beijing's repressive regime. After all, President Bill Clinton, shortly before the couple went to China in 1998, said that "the shackles of state socialism once choked off enterprise" but the country was "moving to join the thriving community of free democracies." Unhappily, although many top Democrats and Republicans still see economics as destiny for the People's Republic, getting rich and becoming free are not cause and effect.
 The passages in "Living History" about the 19 years that the dissident Harry Wu spent as a political prisoner disappear in the officially licensed Yilin Press translation, which has sold more than 200,000 copies in just a month. Gone too, in violation of Senator Clinton's book contract, is her sympathy for the students in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and her account of Tibetan activists banned from a United Nations conference on women near Beijing in 1995. She was correct to attend that conference -- against the advice of Mr. Wu, Representative Nancy Pelosi and others who felt boycotting it would have made a more effective statement -- and she spoke boldly there. 
 Yet Beijing seems to be getting the last laugh. Chinese readers will undoubtedly believe the book's accounts of her 1995 and 1998 trips to China, but they are being lied to. Even if they are aware the book has been edited by the thought police, they are in the position of not knowing what "anti-China" sentences have been excised, which is almost worse than having no book in their hands at all.
Senator Clinton is the latest in a long line of victimized authors. In the 1980's my biography of Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, was published in Beijing -- without contract or permission -- with all the positive references to her cut out. In the bowdlerized version, Jiang Qing appeared responsible for all Mao's failings. Since then China's government-controlled publishing houses have seemed to improve, particularly after Beijing signed the Bern Copyright Convention in 1992 and joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. 
Yet the "Living History" episode suggests backsliding. We're talking about a United States senator here, and the tampering with "Living History" is so blatant that the Chinese must have known she would find out. Here is the nub of the issue: foreign opinion, even that of the Clintons, is less important to Beijing than keeping its grip over the minds of its citizens. China's post-Mao openness to the world, an economic strategy, remains contradicted by its fear of a free flow of non-economic information reaching the ears and eyes of the people. Citizens of the People's Republic are trusted with their money but not their minds. 
A fashionable phrase in academic and foreign policy circles holds that today's China is "a normal country." Its Leninist state somehow slipped away in the middle of the night, and the Communist Party's new agenda is simply to free up markets and bless commerce. But this is nonsense: ultimately, it is impossible to separate economic freedom and political freedom. China's progress, economic and political, will be held back if censorship and condescension to the populace continue. Leninism cannot indefinitely be propped up by consumerism.
In 1990, 14 years after Mao's death, I found my way to a government-planned (but unpublicized) exhibition on AIDS in a gray-walled building near Tiananmen Square. There were pictures of dirty toilet seats, promiscuous American soldiers, gays frolicking in San Francisco. The Chinese captions said Western bourgeois society had spawned a new and terrible disease. 
Yet soon AIDS became a major problem in China, and not just in Shanghai and Beijing, where the government could blame "decadent" Western tourists for seducing Chinese youth, but in the poppy-growing country of southwest China. In rural China, blood-selling and drug use caused the disease to spread in frightening ways. Beijing's instincts over AIDS were similar to those over SARS and, now, "Living History": weed out awkward truths and spur the Chinese people to patriotism. 
So a literary trick reveals the dictatorial dragon's teeth. Worldwide, neither a truly free press nor a privatized economy has ever appeared while a Communist Party held on to power. There are two implications for China policy. One is that the United States won't get reciprocity in cultural and professional exchanges or in market access until political freedom comes to the Chinese people. 
The other implication concerns China's future. Will the People's Republic become strong enough to replace the United States as No. 1 in the world? Or will it collapse from the strains of going down one road in economics and a different one in politics? My feeling is that a power formidable enough to eclipse America would need global moral authority as well as skyscrapers, missiles and patriotism. 
For the average Chinese, the arbitrariness that mauled Hillary Clinton's memoir is a daily occurrence. They learn to self-censor. "To get rich is glorious," Deng Xiaoping rasped with pride -- but to become well informed can be hazardous.
Turning the current of information on and off in a complex society of 1.3 billion people, if managedintelligently, may preserve the party-state for a time. But the government risks its credibility issuing a diktat demarcating "pro-China" from "anti-China." Lies diminish the liar. Beijing may find that deception from above threatens stability no less than criticism from below.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
In Handling Innovation, Patience Is a Virtue

BYLINE:  By JULIE FLAHERTY 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 25 

 BODY:
In one of its current television commercials, the Hewlett-Packard Company describes itself as a leader in the science of nanotechnology. It invites consumers to imagine the exciting products of the future, like light bulbs that never burn out and "a cellphone so small an ant could use it."
 The advertising team probably did not run that one by R. Stanley Williams, who works in the nanotechnology trenches as director for quantum science research at Hewlett-Packard Labs in Palo Alto, Calif. Not surprisingly, Mr. Williams chose not to elaborate on the telecommunications needs of insects when he spoke here this week at the Emerging Technologies Conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Instead, he preached patience. Yes, it is possible to build a hand-held device that can outperform all the earth's present computers, he said, but it may take 50 years to figure out how to make it. 
 He warned that consumers will get fed up with innovations -- including the wonders expected from nanotechnology, or the science of very tiny objects -- that are oversold or underdelivered.
"They are a little bit jaded," Mr. Williams said. "They've heard too much of this wonderful future, and they wonder why it isn't here right now." 
Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of the General Electric Company, also counseled patience, to engineers and investors. He has poured extra money into research and development at G.E. while loosening timelines on projects that may not pay off for 10 years or more. For established companies, he said, investing in emerging technologies is a matter of survival. 
"I just see very clearly that unless you're out there pushing the envelope and driving innovation, you're not going to get the kind of margins and the kind of growth that we need for a company like G.E.," Mr. Immelt said. "I really see it as an economic imperative."
Some experts warn that even the best corporate research efforts may not be enough to ward off disruptions to their businesses that come from innovations out of left field. Inevitably, some of today's household names will falter in the face of newcomers with better ideas, just as several mainframe computer companies were left behind in the wake of minicomputers and minicomputer companies disappeared with the advent of PC's.
Nathan Myhrvold, a former top scientist at the Microsoft Corporation who runs Intellectual Ventures, an investment firm in Bellevue, Wash., surmised that in the not-too-distant future, the top 20 companies in pharmaceuticals, with the exception of one or two, would be unfamiliar names. 
"If you look at the pipeline of drugs in clinical trials," he said, "way more of them were made by the little companies than the big guys." 
The conference, organized by M.I.T.'s Technology Review magazine, drew about 1,000 attendees from established companies like Cisco Systems Inc., Kraft Foods Inc. and the Sprint Corporation, and even a few unknown start-ups. 
They listened to colorful descriptions of nanotechnology as well as other innovations like developing hydrogen fuel sources and creating medicines based on genomics. Wireless technologies seemed among the ripest for products making their way onto the market, as demonstrated by four-year-old WideRay, a San Francisco company that was showing off the wireless capabilities of its proximity server, which allows a user to download information onto a personal digital assistant just by moving near it. 
Despite the promise of these inventions, several speakers were fretful. Faced with a sluggish economy, many companies have reined in their research and development budgets.
David Tennenhouse, vice president of the Intel Corporation's technology group, more than once lamented the insufficiency of government financing for basic research at universities. And Edward B. Roberts, a professor of technology management at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management, pointed out that two-thirds of all corporate research and development expenditures are for short-term projects, not the long-term ones that will be the ground-shaking breakthroughs.
At the General Motors Corporation, research spending has stayed about the same in recent years, but Lawrence F. Burns, vice president for research and development and planning, said he has achieved better results by working with knowledgeable (and less expensive) researchers in China, India, Israel and Russia. Sharing is also a virtue, as in the research lab G.M. owns with the Boeing Company and the Raytheon Company. 
"Each company has specific directive research and then shared research," Mr. Burns said. "That's a highly leverage-able thing." 
Lucien P. Hughes, research director for the technology labs at Accenture, the consulting company, agreed that alliances in research are now the norm.
"The days of the large-scale insular lab -- not talking to the rest of the world -- I think are over for now," he said.
Finding the technology -- either through internal ingenuity, outsourcing or acquisition -- is only the beginning. For a time-honored company, breakthrough technologies can be as disruptive inside the company as they are externally. Too many companies are not structurally prepared to handle them, said Professor Roberts of M.I.T.
"It's not all a question of a willingness to spend," he said. "It's a willingness to participate."
Moreover, while many companies are trying to tie their research efforts more closely to their actual marketing needs, some of the most successful companies have faltered along the way by listening too closely to what their current customers want, and not planning for unknown markets. 
"I do a lot of customer interaction," Mr. Immelt of G.E. said, "but when it comes time to figure out nanotechnology, there's no customer view on nanotechnology."
As for whether old-school or upstart companies will dominate the innovation game in the coming years, Mr. Myhrvold of Intellectual Ventures said it is anyone's guess. 
"Really radical stuff," he said, "is going to come bubbling up from random sources, like it always does."

HEADLINE: New Museum Joins Forces With Artists' Web Site 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 

 BODY:
In an unusual instance of an established cultural organization taking an upstart arts group under its wing, the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo is forging a partnership with Rhizome.org, an Internet site where digital artists can exhibit their online projects and crow about their status as art-world outsiders.
 In an arrangement announced last week, Rhizome will become officially affiliated with the New Museum. Rhizome's staff has already moved into the New Museum's offices at 583 Broadway, between Houston and Prince Streets, and the museum will provide Rhizome with accounting, clerical and other administrative services. The partnership will allow Rhizome to expand its activities and audience while giving the New Museum's curators access to a fresh crop of emerging artists. 
 Lisa Phillips, the New Museum's director, said, "Our audience and Rhizome's audience will have the potential to cross over and know more about each other."
In its last fiscal year Rhizome spent about $323,000. Ms. Phillips said the affiliation would reduce Rhizome's expenses in the current year by more than $100,000.
But a digital-arts group and a museum, no matter how progressively minded, can make strange bedfellows. When digital artists began to create online artworks in the mid-1990's, much of the art form's energy was derived from the notion that the works did not need museums or galleries to reach an audience. Spawned by that sensibility in 1996, Rhizome quickly became one of the most popular Internet sites devoted to the digital arts. It is an online-only meeting place where members can announce new artworks, request technical assistance or argue over obscure aesthetic issues.
As excitement about digital art spread, museums began to commission online artworks. After the dot-com boom went bust, though, museum interest cooled along with the economy. The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, for instance, dismissed its new-media curator earlier this year.
As a result it is not clear whether the New Museum-Rhizome partnership can be viewed as a step in extracting Internet art from its tiny niche or as a life preserver for a floundering art form. Tim Whidden, a digital artist in Brooklyn and a longtime Rhizome contributor, said, "I'm wondering if it means a strengthening of new media, that is, it's being taken out of its ghetto and put into a larger art-world context, or a weakening, that is, it can't stand on its own legs."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE REVIEW; 
The Scrimmage of Old and New

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
The new football stadium at Soldier Field in Chicago is an uncannily accurate portrait of a great American city in changing times. Some Chicago lovers find the portrait less than flattering. Even before the inaugural game last night, the Chicago Bears' new home has been harshly criticized for (among other things) destroying the old landmark stadium that the design has transformed.
 I suspect that it won't be long before the city embraces the new field. The design's urban and architectural merits are considerable. Its conceptual qualities are better still. If you set out to write something bad about the design, you ultimately end up with a critique of the society that produced it. But the design is much more than a symptom of our time. It is a creative response to it. Soldier Field is a daring study of urban America in extremis, precariously poised for a future beyond its widely unlamented demise. 
 Designed by Ben Wood of Chicago and Carlos Zapata of Boston, the 62,200-seat stadium stretches the concept of adaptive reuse nearly past the breaking point. Retaining the classical shell of a stadium designed in the 1920's, the architects have inserted what amounts to an entirely new structure. Instead of matching the two parts in style, they have updated the old stadium in terms of spirit. The result is a major breakthrough: the liberation of sports architecture from sports architects. 
If you want to build a great stadium, hire a real architect. Cities in Europe, Asia and Latin America have understood this for years. In the United States sports architecture has been crippled by the same developer mentality that has hampered almost every type of building except museums and concert halls. Make it exciting! But don't risk surprises. Don't hire anyone who hasn't done the same thing at least 2,000 times.
This Catch-22 has given us 10 years of mediocre sports architecture, much of it in the retro mode typified by Coors Field in Denver. It has been riveting to watch baby-boom fathers inflict their traumatized inner childhoods on their own unsuspecting progeny in turn. But for cities the loss has been great. Just when our urban centers might have been aiming to surpass our overseas counterparts in creative ambition, our teams were settling for the architectural equivalent of stale popcorn and warm beer.
Soldier Field, by contrast, is easily a match for the most advanced stadium design anywhere in the world today. The $382.5 million building, part of a broader plan to improve Chicago's lakeside parks, should be a model for cities that are looking toward architecture to strengthen their identities as contemporary cultural centers.
The original Soldier Field was a concrete structure in Doric style, reflecting the classical motif of Chicago's lakefront parks. Designed by Holabird & Root in 1919-22 as a memorial to those killed in World War I, the stadium was originally intended for track and field events. Even after successive remodelings, the sightlines for football were far from ideal.
The decision in the early 1990's to rebuild the stadium was part of a movement away from the existing practice of putting sports arenas in suburban areas accessible only by car. Retaining the downtown location made perfect sense for Chicago, a great walkers' town. Preserving the perimeter colonnades from the old stadium was also a sound decision, and one of impeccable classical pedigree. In Rome the reuse of ancient theaters and stadiums has long been integral to the reweaving of the urban fabric.
But the artistic pairing of old and new is distinctly contemporary. Additions to older structures are a defining building type of our time. The type is the product of a collision between two forces: the impulse to preserve and the need for economic development. 
Chicago has dealt with this conflict better than most cities, nowhere more emphatically than in the new stadium's design.
I call this type of design parabuilding: it is the modern tick on the postmodern host. New York examples include the Palace Hotel, a modern shaft that towers above the historic Vuillard Houses on Madison Avenue and 51st Street. Typically, as at the Palace, the parabuilding is designed as a discreet background to the existing host. Not at Soldier Field. Here modernity erupts with the jubilance of a prodigal returned. It's happy to be home.
This is a place of extremities held in a dynamic state of imbalance. The tension between tradition and contemporaneity is but one source for this highly energized design. Perhaps the most startling of these derives from the juxtaposition of the stadium's classically symmetrical shell and the whirling asymmetry of the new building within it. This is a place made for movement: sky boxes and open seating are arranged in what look like tectonic plates that have been subjected to the forces of a centrifuge.
Extreme cantilevering makes this composition possible. This technique is theatrically demonstrated in the long, tapering trusses that streak through the air like comet trails at either end of the field. Functionally justified as armatures for two electronic signboards, these elongated forms are emblematic in themselves: symbols of grace under pressure.
Cantilevering is also used to give the banks of seating a steep rake. Besides bringing the seats closer to the playing field, the steep angle creates an impression of verticality. This effect plays off the horizontal stretch of the grandstands. And so it may occur to you that the field has become the central plaza of a European town, the site of some great civic ritual viewed from the packed windows of surrounding buildings.
The skyboxes -- here called executive suites -- add to this impression. These glassed-in luxury accommodations are housed on four levels in what amounts to a separate building. Stretching around the field's east sideline, they give the effect of a glass office building just outside the lower structures ringing the plaza.
This impression links the stadium to views of the Chicago skyline made possible by deep cuts through the structure at the end zones. A result is extreme intimacy: with the field, the city and Chicago's heroic tradition of leadership in the building arts.
A separate building for rich people! A defiled historic landmark! A prime lakesidelocation instead of some depressed neighborhood on the outskirts that might have benefited from this enormous urban investment! Extreme intimacy, my foot! More like an extreme example of big bucks getting their way!
Well, all right, if you insist. Yet implicit in such criticisms is the assumption that the city should somehow operate outside the economic system we have developed for ourselves in the post-cold-war world. Perhaps it should. Until that dubious prospect is realized, however, we shouldn't expect our architects to do more than aestheticize the actual urban condition.
Our cities are becoming more, not less, dependent on spectacles and pastimes. One spectacle is the historic fabric of the city itself. But only theme parks can become museums of themselves. New buildings interpret the changing life of the contemporary city to its living inhabitants.
Sports is big business. If you don't like seeing the name Cadillac on the clubhouse for the luxury suites at Soldier Field, try Wrigley Field. At Soldier Field the pressures coursing through the modern city are made visible. 
If your commitment is to classicism, you will find a more authentically classical urbanism in the recast stadium than was present when the concrete colonnades stood alone. And if your commitment is to conflict, as a city lover's ought always to be, the field's controversial reception will not let you down.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 2, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An architecture review on Tuesday about the new football stadium at Soldier Field in Chicago misidentified the headquarters city for one designer, Ben Wood; it is Boston, where he is a partner with the other designer, Carlos Zapata -- not Chicago. The review also misstated the timing of the decision to rebuild the original stadium. It was in 1998, not the early 1990's.
An architecture review on Tuesday about the new football stadium at Soldier Field in Chicago misstated the name of the firm that designed the original stadium. While it is now called Holabird & Root, it was then Holabird & Roche.
An architecture review on Sept. 30 about the new football stadium at Soldier Field in Chicago misspelled the name of the historic Manhattan houses that adjoin the modern Palace Hotel the way the classical shell of the old football stadium meets the modern design of the new one. They are the Villard Houses, not Vuillard.

HEADLINE: AN APPRECIATION; 
Method Man: Kazan's Landscape of Desire

BYLINE:  By A. O. SCOTT 

 BODY:
Movie directors are known for being vain, autocratic and egomaniacal, but the curious nature of their art form also makes them invisible. Their own powerful personalities most often find expression in the faces and gestures of others. Think of John Ford, for example, and the picture you see in your head will probably be of John Wayne. Elia Kazan, who could be as passionate, difficult and dictatorial as any of his peers, will live on primarily through the images of a handful of actors. 
 The television obituaries that followed Mr. Kazan's death on Sunday were like an anthology of great moments in method acting. There was Marlon Brando, in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "On The Waterfront," screaming, "Stella!" and whispering to Rod Steiger that he could have been a contender. There was James Dean in "East of Eden" and Warren Beatty in "Splendor in the Grass," beautiful young men suffering beautifully; there were Eli Wallach and Karl Malden in "Baby Doll," playing out their Mississippi snake dance of sexual and economic rivalry. 
 Mr. Kazan was a founder of the Actors Studio, and in the late 1940's he frequently shuttled between Broadway and Hollywood. He was, perhaps more than anyone else, responsible for bringing the sensibilities of American theatrical realism and the style of acting it spawned into American movies. The stylized speech and decorous movements of an earlier era gave way to stuttering, smoldering displays of emotion. Social problems, sexual subtexts and psychological truth became the hallmarks of seriousness on stage and screen. 
Realism, in any art form, and perhaps especially on film,where the illusion of transparency is greatest, is a notoriously tricky term. Mr. Kazan's movies, seen today, are likely to seem less slices of life than social and psychological fables, more rhetorical and high-minded than tough and unvarnished. Which is what they always were of course, and why they stay with us. They are parables of conflicted conscience and unstable desire, studies of individuals -- of men, to be precise -- driven to rage, rebellion and sometimes to do the right thing. Nobody is really like Stanley Kowalski, or like Lonesome Rhodes, the backwoods media demagogue played by Andy Griffith in "A Face in the Crowd." Even the actual Emiliano Zapata was not much like Mr. Brando in "Viva, Zapata!" But sometimes we like our realism to be larger than life.
Critical appraisals of Mr. Kazan before his death tended to be grudging: he occupies at best the second tier of the auteurist pantheon, applauded for his work with actors but denied the laurels retrospectively granted to directors like his friend and contemporary Nicholas Ray. 
This is partly because Mr. Kazan's films, unlike Ray's, were readily embraced and easily understood when they came out. Their popularity with audiences and Oscar voters, their earnest engagement with serious contemporary themes, their sometimes pious liberalism make movies like "Gentleman's Agreement," "Pinkie" and even "On The Waterfront" look to some eyes hopelessly middlebrow. 
Mary McCarthy, who from her perch at Partisan Review was the most intransigent critic of American dramatic realism in the 1940's and 50's, summed up these objections: "Today most intellectuals have seen at least one play by Williams, Inge and Miller, and at least one movie directed by Kazan. Their opinion, so far as I can tell, remains about the same as when they did not have the price of a ticket: they think this theater is corn."
She was not entirely wrong. Mr. Kazan's realism, like that of Arthur Miller (whose plays he directed on Broadway) and John Steinbeck (who collaborated with Mr. Kazan on "Viva, Zapata!" and "East of Eden") did have its corny aspect. But though it offended some refined palates, that grain also provided some honest nourishment. 
It is easy now to cringe at the didacticism of "Gentleman's Agreement," in which Gregory Peck pretends to be a Jew (and is actually believed to be one) to expose and denounce anti-Semitism. But in 1947 the point needed making, and in a way that a mass audience might be prepared to hear. "Pinky," the story of a pale-skinned black woman passing for white, may seem stilted and melodramatic today, but in 1949 its agonized humanism was downright radical. The impact of movies like these on American attitudes about race and ethnicity after World War II should not be underestimated.
Those movies have faded into history, but Mr. Kazan's work from the 50's retains a great deal of vitality, and not only because of Brando and Dean. Along with his movies, and perhaps at their expense, Mr. Kazan is remembered for his role in the ideological melodrama of the McCarthy era. He is recalled both as a hero of liberal Hollywood in its golden age and as a scoundrel in a time of political treachery. 
Did he, as his detractors claim, betray his principles by giving names to anti-Communist inquisitors? Or was he, as he insisted, trying to live up to them? There is no use trying to settle the argument, or to resolve the contradictions that define Mr. Kazan's career, and are what his movies are all about.

HEADLINE: The Gold in Baseball's Diamond 

BYLINE:  By Andrew Zimbalist; Andrew Zimbalist, professor of economics at Smith College, is author of "May the Best Team Win: Baseball Economics and Public Policy."

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass. 

 BODY:
As this season drew to a close, remarkably half of baseball's teams had a chance to make the playoffs. Has Major League Baseball's year-old collective bargaining agreement, with its revenue-sharing plan and luxury tax, leveled the playing field? Not exactly.
 The tight races were chance occurences -- the result of a muddle of mediocrity at the top of the American League's Central Division and in the battle for the National League's wild card slot. They had nothing to do with greater parity among the teams. 
 If the changes in the collective bargaining agreement were having their intended effect, the payrolls of the top teams would be falling and those for the bottom teams would be rising. But this isn't happening. The standard deviation, or the dispersion, of opening-day payrolls actually rose to $27.3 million in 2003 from $24.7 million in 2002, an increase of 10.5 percent.
Viewed differently, of the 15 teams in contention in mid-September, 10 were among the top 12 teams in payroll. Only two (the Oakland Athletics and the Kansas City Royals) came from the bottom 10 teams in payroll.
So why is the new collective bargaining agreement not working? Put simply, the agreement taxes increased earnings of low-revenue clubs at around 45 percent. Every time a relatively poor team like the Milwaukee Brewers increases its revenues by a dollar, the league gives the club 45 cents less in revenue-sharing money. The team thus has little incentive to use its revenue-sharing money to buy better players and improve itself.
But wait, you say, doesn't the new agreement require teams that receive revenue-sharing money to meet a minimum payroll standard? No. Rather it sets out a vague criterion: a team must use its transfers "to improve its performance on the field." According to this standard, then, Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner and the person charged with enforcing this provision, could conclude that a team that pays off its debt or increases executive pay is taking steps to improve itself. In fact, almost any action could be justified as potentially improving the team.
Interestingly, the team owned by Mr. Selig's family, the Brewers, is faring pretty well under the new system. According to league estimates, the Brewers will receive a larger increase in revenue-sharing money than any other team, with receipts growing to an estimated $8.2 million in 2003 from roughly $1.2 million in 2001. (This is because Mr. Selig insisted on a revenue-sharing system that taxed the top teams most heavily and benefited the lower middle, rather than the bottom, teams the most.) 
But are the Brewers improving themselves by signing better players? Well, the team's opening-day payroll fell to $40.6 million this year from $50.3 million last year. 
Of course, the Brewers are not alone. Other teams benefited from increased revenue sharing -- and also cut their payrolls. Transfers for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, for example, grew by $5.1 million, yet the team's opening-day payroll fell to $19.6 million this year from $34.4 million in 2002.
Baseball's competitive balance problem is mostly a problem of bottom-dwelling teams performing poorly year after year. If these teams don't have the economic incentive or the statutory compulsion to raise their payrolls or invest more in their farm systems, then they will remain uncompetitive. The game will go on -- but nothing will change.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Shares Rise asInvestors Capitalize on Last Week's Slump

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks climbed yesterday as investors scooped up shares beaten down in last week's slump and fund managers spruced up portfolios for the end of the quarter. 
 Today is the last day of the third quarter, and there could be swings in the stock market as money managers dress up their portfolios by dropping the losers and adding the winners. 
 Stocks fell sharply last week amid jitters over rising oil prices and a drop in the dollar after a statement from the Group of 7 economic powers. 
"Last week's G-7 stuff was the impetus for selling into the end of the week, but right now, the market seems to be shrugging all that off," said James Park, trader at Brean Murray & Company. 
The Nasdaq composite index rose 32.49 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,824.56, while the Dow Jones industrial average gained 67.16 points, or 0.7 percent, to 9,380.24. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 9.73 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 1,006.58. 
Trading volume was moderate as investors questioned whether the economic recovery was healthy enough to support the market's run-up over the last six months. Hefty gains so far this year have ignited worries that share prices may have risen too far, too fast.
The Nasdaq skidded nearly 6 percent last week to its biggest weekly loss since April 2002. 
Intel rose $1.10, or 4 percent, to $28.37. Global chip sales increased to $13.42 billion in August, up 4 percent from July, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization, keeping the hard-hit industry on track for a healthy recovery. 
Nokia jumped 64 cents, or 4 percent, to $15.90. Investors have shunned the company, the leading cellphone maker, leaving it one of the cheapest technology stocks around, but they may be overlooking some changes in the business that could bring a new round of growth, according to an article over the weekend in Barron's. 
The life insurer John Hancock Financial Services fell 48 cents, to $33.82, after rallying on Friday. Manulife Financial of Canada agreed on Sunday to buy John Hancock for about $11 billion. Manulife fell $1.02, to $29.18, in the United States.

Treasury Notes Plunge
(By Bloomberg News) -- The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell yesterday, with the yield posting its biggest one-day gain in almost four weeks in New York trading, after a government report showed that consumer spending increased by 0.8 percent in August.
The note is headed for its first quarterly loss since the end of 2002 as analysts predict that the economy expanded at a 4.5 percent annual rate this quarter, according to the median estimate of 59 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The economy grew 3.3 percent in the second quarter.
"We just don't see a lot of compelling value right now in the Treasury market," said Michael Mullaney, who helps manage $10 billion in stocks and bonds at the Fiduciary Trust Company in Boston.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 22/32, to a price of 101 11/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.08 percent from 4 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 16/32, to 105 13/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.01 percent from 4.93 percent on Friday.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES; 
Speculation on Weaker Dollar Leads to Gains for Euro and Yen

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled against the euro and the yen in New York trading yesterday, on speculation that United States officials might seek a weaker currency to bolster corporate profits and extend a recovery. 
 The dollar fell against 15 of the 16 most widely traded currencies, weakening 1 percent against the euro and declining to its lowest level against the yen since December 2000. 
A government report on Friday will probably show the economy shed jobs for the eighth consecutive month in September, according to the median forecast of 64 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. 
 Paul Podolsky, currency strategist at the FleetBoston Financial Corporation, said the declining payrolls would "raise questions about the sustainability of consumer demand," and might lead officials to "talk down the dollar even more" to bolster growth through exports.
The dollar erased its gains in midmorning trading and weakened to $1.1589 for a euro by 4 p.m. in New York, from $1.1474 on Friday. The dollar ranged from $1.1398 to $1.1601 a euro, its weakest since July 1. Against Japan's currency, the dollar fell to 110.91 yen from 111.91 Friday. It reached 110.73 yen earlier. 
The Treasury Department said there was no change in the administration's strong-dollar policy. Robert Nichols, the Treasury's assistant secretary for public affairs, told reporters, "We are not going to respond to every goofy market rumor on currencies." 
Enrico Caruso, chief currency trader at Tempest Asset Management in Tustin, Calif., said gains in the euro accelerated after its value rose above $1.1550 a dollar, a level where many traders who were betting against the currency had placed orders to cut their losses, forcing them to buy the euro.

HEADLINE: Deal to Acquire U.S. Insurer Is Part of a Canadian Trend 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
By proposing to acquire John Hancock Financial Services, Manulife Financial has joined a growing group of Canadian financial institutions that have come to view expansion in the United States as one of the most critical drivers of their growth.
 "If you look at the size of the Canadian economy and the Canadian population, it's clear that to achieve your goals you have to be present in markets other than your own," Dominic D'Alessandro, Manulife's chief executive, said today. 
 The John Hancock deal, valued at $11 billion in Manulife stock, would create a life insurer that manages $246 billion in assets. Measured by market value, the combination would be the second-biggest company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
Several Canadian banks and insurance companies already have a big presence in the United States. The banks, barred by the Canadian government from merging among themselves, have spent about 13 billion Canadian dollars since 1996 on acquisitions in the United States.
For example, the Toronto-Dominion Bank owns the TD Waterhouse discount brokerage firm, while Sun Life Financial of Toronto controls MFS Investment Management of Boston, a large mutual fund distributor. Sun Life paid $2.6 billion two years ago for Keyport Life, also of Boston, which specializes in annuities. The Bank of Montreal has controlled Harris Bank, based in Chicago, since the mid-1980's.
Michael Overvelde, an analyst at UBS Securities in Toronto, said he expected the pace of such deals to pick up. "If opportunities are limited in Canada, the United States makes the most obvious sense, not only because of its proximity but because Canadian banks have operations there to leverage from," he said.
Over the last three years, the Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, has completed 10 acquisitions in the United States, mostly in North Carolina and Florida. Its American operations contributed 27 percent of revenue and 13 percent of net income in the nine months to July 31, up from 7 percent and 3 percent in 2000. 
Royal Bank's travel insurance arm said last week that it would start offering policies through travel agents in 34 American states. 
Toronto-Dominion Bank is shifting its emphasis from corporate to retail banking, and Mr. Overvelde said that the bank was most likely to expand its retail business through acquisitions in the United States. The Bank of Nova Scotia has also indicated that it is looking for suitable targets in the United States.
Manulife's American operations contributed 34 percent of its earnings last year. In getting John Hancock, Manulife would gain a well-known brand as well as greatly broaden its product range and strengthen its sales force. According to A. M. Best, the insurance-rating group, "the combined organization will possess significant scale and share in every market in which it operates."
John Hancock's chief executive, David D'Alessandro, has often said that the company needed to seek a merger partner to gain enough scale to compete effectively against the likes of MetLife and Prudential Financial. 
Mr. D'Alessandro told analysts today that the deal would also fulfill John Hancock's need "to rebalance our risk portfolio."
Using 2002 data, the proportion of earnings from relatively risky guaranteed and structured financial products would drop to 6 percent from 16 percent. This business mostly comprises 401(k) retirement plans that offer a return guaranteed by insurance companies. The companies need to cover that return through other investments.
Under terms of the deal, John Hancock shareholders will receive 1.1853 shares of Manulife for each John Hancock share, worth $37.60 a share, a 9.6 percent premium over the closing price on Friday.
Shares of John Hancock jumped sharply late last week amid speculation of a pending sale. A Manulife official said that the financial terms were reached last Wednesday but that an announcement had been withheld pending various regulatory approvals. Manulife shares closed at 39.41 Canadian dollars on the Toronto Stock Exchange today, down 1.44 Canadian dollars. Shares of John Hancock fell 48 cents, to $33.82.
The combined company's head office will be in Toronto but its North American operations will be based in Boston. Dominic D'Alessandro, 56, will be the president and chief executive. David D'Alessandro, 52, will initially be chief operating officer and will take on the additional title of president a year after the transaction is completed. 
The two D'Alessandros are not related but say they have ancestors who lived within a few hundred miles of one another in Italy. David D'Alessandro said today that "I expect to be running this company for a long time, working for Dominic."

HEADLINE: As Nassau Attends to Finances, Its Credit Rating Could Rise Again 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Sept. 29 

 BODY:
Nassau County government, until recently a symbol of fiscal mismanagement, was notified today that its bond rating is in line to be upgraded for the second time this year.
 Nassau's turnaround runs counter to the trend of many other local governments, whose bond ratings have been hurt by the economic slump. 
 Moody's Investors Service already upgraded Nassau this year, as did other rating services. The upgrade was the county's first in 15 years. 
Today, citing "significant progress" in Nassau's fiscal recovery, Moody's again placed the county on its "watch list for a potential upgrade" and said it expects to follow through soon. Higher ratings can help reduce a county's interest costs.
Among county governments in New York State rated by Moody's this year, most have gone in the other direction. Nine were downgraded, 2 were placed on a watch list for downgrading and 10 were given a negative outlook. Only four were upgraded.
Local governments have been hurt by sluggish sales tax revenues and hit by rising costs for Medicaid, pensions and health insurance, Moody's said in an overview.
When the economy was booming in the 1990's, Nassau was going in the opposite direction then, too.
Despite the high average income of Nassau residents, the county government ran up annual deficits, and its long-term debt ballooned to nearly $3 billion. Nassau's credit, which had retained high ratings for more than half a century, slid to one notch above junk bonds. 
Eventually the state provided bailout aid and imposed a fiscal oversight board. The budget problems prompted voters to elect a Democratic majority to the County Legislature for the first time, and Thomas R. Suozzi was the first Democrat in three decades to win the county executive's seat.
Moody's latest report, by analyst Yaffa Rattner, said that the rating service would be scrutinizing Nassau's third-quarter fiscal report, its projections for a $54 millionyear-end surplus and the prospect that the county's sales tax revenue will be better than predicted.
Among the county's recent successes, Moody's said, were settling of its union contracts with some savings, a compromise on its sewer authority and a proposed budget for next year with no new property taxes. Moody's also praised the Suozzi administration for reducing the county work force, holding down spending and reducing the debt.
In his annual budget message two weeks ago, Mr. Suozzi had said that while most other governments were struggling to cope with their financial problems, Nassau was already on a course to control costs.. Mr. Suozzi called his budget for 2004 "solid and credible" and predicted that "it will further enhance our status with the credit rating agencies."

HEADLINE: Powell Tells Arab-Americans Of Hopes to Develop Mideast 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell came here tonight, to the American city with the biggest concentration of Arab-Americans, and said the United States was dedicated to building a prosperous and peaceful Middle East.
 Mr. Powell, speaking at an economic conference of leaders from the Middle East and hundreds of American and Arab-American executives, said millions of people in the Middle East were frustrated by joblessness and poverty. "With so much frustration," he said, "no wonder so many people are angry." 
 "I come to help you build a new Middle East," Mr. Powell said.
Echoing the Administration's call for help from other nations in Iraq, Mr. Powell said the United States "was committed to supporting Arab efforts at reform and development." But he added: "We cannot do it alone. We need partners in the region and in the international community."
He spoke of the administration's effort to develop a huge free trade zone in an area that is now hobbledwith more trade barriers than any other part of the world, and he spoke of United States programs like those that finance small-business start-ups for women and send Arab students to intern at American companies.
Summarizing developments in the region, Mr. Powell said the United States was making "remarkable progress" in Iraq, but he said the Middle East peace plan for the Israelis and the Palestinians was stalled because of continuing violence.
To move forward in Israel, he said, the Palestinians must be fully committed to fighting violence. He drew his first ripple of applause when he said that "Israel, too, has obligations," and that "settlement activity" in the West Bank "must end."
He also touched on Iran, saying the United States would not tolerate development of nuclear weapons by the government there. The International Atomic Energy Agency has given Iran a deadline of Oct. 31 to prove it is not using a nuclear power plant to enrich uranium for weapons.
Mr. Powell was in Detroit leading a delegation of nearly a dozen senior American diplomats and trade officials at a time when tensions have been running particularly high in the Middle East and when Arabs and Arab-Americans have been expressing concerns about harassment as a result of increased security measures in the United States.
Some Middle East business leaders acknowledged they are apprehensive about United States policy. After a day of listening, Hisham Abdulla al-Shirawi, an executive of a conglomerate in Dubai, the commercial center of the United Arab Emirates, said he was still worried about the "unhealthy climate" toward Arabs in America.
"You can't say the fears have been completely removed," he said. 
The organizers of the event, the American-Arab Chamber of Commerce in Dearborn, just outside Detroit, have tried to steer the talk away from politics. 
But one of the leaders of the more than 300,000 Arab-Americans living near Detroit, Osama Siblani, said side-stepping politics and the raw feelings of many Arabs toward Washington guaranteed that the conference would accomplish little.
"The biggest question right now is, 'How can Arabs or Muslims come and invest in the United States in light of the harassment and harsh treatment?' " said Mr. Siblani, chairman of the Congress of Arab American Organizations and editor and publisher of the weekly Arab American News. As for the Middle East, he said, "No one will invest in an area that is so volatile."
"The people at the conference all know each other," Mr. Siblani said. "They know how to invest. They should focus on the hardships Arabs are facing."
After addressing the conference this morning, William J. Burns, the United States special envoy to the Middle East, met with Svheil K. Gedeon, a banker who leads the Palestinian-American Chamber of Commerce in Ramallah.
Mr. Gedeon said his delegation came to the conference to demonstrate that "Palestine is there and open for business." But he added, "economic growth is going to have to rely on political improvement."

HEADLINE: Boom Times on the Poverty Roll 

 BODY:
An additional 1.7 million Americans slipped into official poverty last year, ground down by the pernicious joblessness that remains the most salient fact of the economic recovery. Job growth -- promised by Republican architects of the new tax cuts favoring the affluent -- remains a national dream. The poverty roll rose to 34.6 million people, more than a third of them children, according to new census data. And the grimness of this trend is hardly reversible in the immediate future as the president and the Republican-led Congress pay for the tax cuts, postwar Iraq and other programs with budget deficits that are projected to sap $5 trillion from the nation's revenue flow over the next decade. 
 A dark dynamic in the rising poverty is the near tripling of the long-term unemployed in the past three years, to 1.9 million formerly productive workers who have simply given up looking for jobs in the depressed market. Some of the severest poverty and unemployment rates have struck Midwest industrial states, which have suffered many of the 2.7 million payroll jobs lost during President Bush's watch. Republican lawmakers are now scurrying to cobble together some sort of job program -- an effort that seems aimed more at the voting next year in key electoral battlegrounds than at the 12 out of 100 impoverished Americans. It is hard to see these Americans as a priority of Mr. Bush in a year in which he failed to prod Congressional Republicans to reverse the cruel denial of new child-care tax credits to low-income families. 
 The ominous context for the nation's mushrooming poverty, jobless and deficit problems was spelled out yesterday by a bipartisan coalition of leading economists and business and government veterans from the Committee for Economic Development, the Concord Coalition and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. They warned that the coming decade would doubtlessly be "the most fiscally irresponsible in our nation's history," unless the president and Congress somehow lose their cut-taxes-and-spend enthusiasm.

HEADLINE: Bonds for a Midtown Skyscraper Bring Out Supporters and Critics 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The announcements for public hearings by the city's Industrial Development Agency are usually buried in the back of a newspaper and rarely draw more than a handful of people to consider what amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies for private projects.
 But there was a full house on hand yesterday, about 75 people, for a debate over the merits of a $915 million, 57-story skyscraper for Bank of America at 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas. Critics and supporters focused on the city's plan to provide $650 million in tax-free financing known as Liberty Bonds for the bank, which would be the principal tenant, and its development partner, the Durst Organization. 
 "We've been trying to bring more sunshine to the process," said Bettina Damiani, director of Good Jobs New York and a critic of the development agency. "In that respect, this has been a huge success. It can only lead to economic development with clearer public benefits." 
Still, the directors of the Industrial Development Agency are expected to tentatively approve the special financing for the project today without getting more than a cursory report on the hearing. A number of speakers also complained yesterday that city documents detailing the Bank of America project were full of conflicting and confusing numbers.
Andrew M. Alper, chairman of the agency, acknowledged that the matter was somewhat rushed because Bank of America needed to complete the project before its current lease at 9 West 57th Street expired in 2008. But, he added, the project will have to come back to the agency for another public hearing and approval.
Mr. Alper said the bank's decision to build a new headquarters on 42nd Street was "a strong vote of confidence in New York and will do a lot to rebuild the city's economy."
The bank plans to occupy about half the proposed 2 million-square-foot skyscraper. 
But members of the Libertarian Party, a community housing group and an adjacent property owner facing condemnation criticized the city for agreeing to a huge subsidy for a wealthy bank and developer in the most desirable office district in the world. The Liberty Bonds, they said, were intended to rebuild Lower Manhattan after the attack on the World Trade Center.
John C. Whitehead, chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, issued a statement at the hearing opposing the use of Liberty Bonds for Midtown projects, because the use of the bonds downtown is "fully feasible."
Mr. Alper said the city did not see the demand downtown for all $8 billion in Liberty Bonds. The bank project, however, is not feasible without the bonds, he said.
Margaret Hughes of the Good Old Lower East Side housing organization said the money would be better spent on "creating economic development opportunities in the outer boroughs."
Ms. Damiani questioned whether the city had included adequate penalties in the event Bank of America failed to live up to its promises to keep 2,800 jobs in Manhattan and add hundreds more in the future. She said the bank had obtained $18 million in tax breaks in 1993 to bring 1,700 employees to the World Trade Center. But by 1998, the bank had cut its staff at the trade center to 830.
Members of the New York City Arts Coalition and the Environmental Justice Coalition praised the building for its environmental design but said the city should insist on a development fee for the arts and affordable housing.
The Real Estate Board of New York, the construction industry executives and the construction unions all spoke in favor of the project.

HEADLINE: For a Changing City, New Pieces in a Lead-Poisoning Puzzle 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
A single stark image has imprinted itself on the American health system about the dangers of lead: a chip of peeling paint on a child's bedroom wall and a small hand reaching up to touch. 
 More and more, though, health officials, environmentalists and doctors are being forced to look beyond that traditional explanation and into such tangled subjects as immigration, foreign trade and the transformed demographics of urban America. Old lead paint, they say, is still the major threat to most children. And many of the new threats are still wrapped in mystery and controversy. But as the New York City Council considers a new lead hazard prevention law this fall, some experts say that the answer of the past -- find every last chip of lead paint and remove it -- may no longer be enough. 
 Last year, out of about 5,000 cases of children with elevated lead levels in the city, one in four involved a child born outside the United States, according to the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Out of 40 pregnant women found to have severely elevated levels of lead in their blood, 95 percent were foreign-born -- 60 percent of them from Mexico alone, according to city figures. 
Finding the sources of lead is also getting harder. In the most serious lead cases investigated by the city last year, 35 percent could not be traced to paint at all -- a percentage that Health Department officials say is higher than in the past. (The officials added that no exact historical figures had been kept for comparison.) And among immigrant children with the most severe lead levels, the uncertainty about the source was even greater. Only about half the cases could be definitively traced to paint, health officials said.
"So many new pathways for lead have emerged," said Dr. David C. Bellinger, an associate professor in neurology at Harvard Medical School. "You can have legislation to address one, but it doesn't mean you've solved the problem." 
At the heart of that new pattern is the emergence of a new city on top of the old one. Over the last few decades, hundreds of thousands of immigrants have poured into New York City -- often into the same low-income neighborhoods where old housing and lead paint problems had festered.
Many of those immigrants came from countries and regions where lead exposures are endemic: India, Pakistan, Mexico, Eastern Europe, Africa and China. 
Many also brought along cultural products, practices and foods that have been linked in cases around the country with lead contamination, health officials say.
The implications are still unfolding, but the message is clear: lead is getting into New York's neighborhoods, and its children, in new ways.
"It's hard to separate it out -- is it from the neighborhood housing or from country of origin?" said Dr. Jessica Leighton, an assistant commissioner at the city's Health Department. "We don't usually know."
There is a profound chicken-and-egg question at the heart of lead's new arc, doctors and other lead researchers say: Are the persistent lead rates in the "lead belt" across Brooklyn and Queens the result of traditional local factors like buildings and paint? Or can they also be explained by global economics and pollution thousands of miles away? Which came first, the lead, or the people infected with it?
In many respects, lead reduction is one of the great environmental success stories of the 20th century. The biggest sources, leaded gasoline and lead solder once used on food cans, were eliminated in the 1970's and 80's. Within a few years, lead levels in children plummeted across most of the nation.
But as lead in the broader environment ebbed, the urban archipelago of New York's lead belt, and some even more seriously afflicted neighborhoods in Philadelphia, Chicago and Providence, emerged even more starkly.
These neighborhoods were mostly inhabited by poor black and Hispanic families living in old houses. Poverty's connection with lead, less obvious in earlier years when middle-class suburban children were breathing pollution from leaded gas, was reinforced. Lead, more than ever, became charged with the politics of race and social justice.
Those charged politics are playing out now in New York, even as the generalizations and assumptions about lead have become less certain. When the City Council, which is now debating a new lead abatement law to replace the one struck down earlier this year by New York's highest court, held its first public hearing on the bill several weeks ago, some demonstrators in favor of the legislation suggested that the debate would be a litmus test for racism, since most poisoning victims are minority members. 
Other supporters of the bill said they feared that the nuances of demographics and science could be used by the real estate industry to argue for watered-down requirements, or that immigrants could be blamed for their health problems because of where they came from.
There is no question that neighborhood compositions in the lead belt have changed significantly since the city's first lead paint law was enacted, in 1960.
Of the eight ZIP code districts with the highest percentage rates of elevated lead in children in 2000, for example, three had populations that were more than 50 percent foreign-born, and only one was less than 20 percent immigrant, according to federal census figures. In some of the neighborhoods in Queens with the highest percentages of children testing positive for lead, the number of immigrants has tripled just since 1980, census figures show.
But underneath those changes, the list of neighborhoods with the highest poisoning rates has largely remained stable. Advocates for the city's new paint abatement law, which would toughen cleanup requirements and make it easier for parents of lead-poisoned children to sue landlords, say that is a crucial point. Geographic constancy, they say, reinforces the conventional interpretation that old housing and paint are the problem -- sickening whoever lives there, immigrant or not.
"You have a lot of different immigration patterns, but where the kids get poisoned doesn't change very much, which suggests that the overwhelming problem is the paint," said Suzanne Mattei, the executive for the New York City field office of the Sierra Club, which has lobbied the Council to pass the new lead paint bill.
In any case, Ms. Mattei and others say, even if the new picture is less certain than the old, eliminating lead paint is something that government can do. And because the consequences of lead in a child's bloodstream are so firmly established -- down to estimates of how many I.Q. points are lost with each successively higher level of exposure -- the city has an obligation, they say, to take action where it can.
"Not all the sources of lead are under our control, but lead paint is one that the city without a doubt can control," Ms. Mattei said.
Some of the new medical research complicates that picture, suggesting that the problems of lead, while connected with poor housing, can also be compounded by poor diet.
Children who get enough calcium and iron are better able to fight off the lead that can harm their mental development, numerous medical studies say. And laboratory tests on mice -- though less conclusive -- suggest that high-fat diets can increase the body's propensity to absorb lead. Those studies have prompted city health workers to begin giving dietary advice in every lead case they investigate.
Federal health officials, in looking for patterns around the country, stress that old paint is still public enemy No. 1.
"Lead paint remains the most concentrated and readily accessible source, and nothing should detract from our interest in eliminating it," said Dr. Mary Jean Brown, chief of the lead poisoning prevention branch at the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
But Dr. Brown said the campaign against lead was also taking health workers into the politically sensitive terrain of culture and lifestyle.
Health officials in Rhode Island said this summer they had traced a pattern of elevated lead to a deodorant called litargirio that is manufactured in the Dominican Republic and widely sold in immigrant neighborhoods. In one sample, the product contained 80 percent lead. New York health officials subsequently found high lead levels in litargirio in one of five samples purchased around the city. 
In California, researchers have linked lead-glazed pottery from Mexico to high lead levels in children. Tamarind fruit candy from Mexico has been linked to elevated lead. Of the 40 lead-poisoned mothers identified in New York City in 2001, 40 percent, city health investigators said, reported experiencing pica -- a craving for nonfood items like clay and pottery. 
Other studies are suggesting that lead problems are perhaps larger, and more hidden, than previously believed. Numerous studies have concluded, for example, that mothers with high lead levels in their blood, however they were exposed, can pass problems onto their children. But those children might show no elevated lead in their blood by the time they are tested, typically around the first grade, because without continued exposure lead dissipates in the bloodstream over time. Other research suggests that even lead levels once considered insignificant can still have subtle effects on a child's development. 
Health officials say that the lead battle's next frontier may be public education -- teaching people how to avoid or minimize lead hazards, whether these come from environmental exposure in an old neighborhood, or the treats brought back from overseas by a visiting cousin. But none of that will help the health investigators themselves, who are seeing more mixed signals and more dead ends in tracking down exposure trails.
"You're never going to be able to look and say this much is because a person is Mexican, and this much is paint; there's no way to do that on an individual basis," said Dr. Brown at the Centers for Disease Control. "These exposures are cumulative, and wherever you get it, it's bad."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In Myrtle Beach, S.C.; 
A 60-Mile Strip Of Surf and Golf

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

 BODY:
MYRTLE Beach claims to be the nation's golf capital, and given its 123 golf courses, it is hard to dispute the title. The city has just invested $1 billion to improve the roads along the 60-mile-long beach strip, called the Grand Strand, home to most of the hotels and other big attractions catering to the 14 million tourists that pass through each year. The biggest news on the local business scene is a plan by Hard Rock Cafe International to build a 150-acre rock 'n' roll theme park, with a 15,000-seat outdoor theater.

AIRPORT
 Myrtle Beach International Airport, less than 20 minutes from town, gets especially busy in the spring and fall as golfers pour in. It is adding a second runway and looking for new carriers to offer direct service to more cities. Already this year, Hooters Air began nonstop flights to and from Atlanta, Newark and Baltimore. 
 Not long ago, locals drove to airports in Charlotte and elsewhere to get better fares. But Mike Wooten, president of DDC Engineers, a local engineering company, said the trend had been reversed. "People from other locations are coming here because they can get better prices now from our airport," he said.

HOTELS
The 12-story, 402-room RADISSON PLAZA (843-918-5000, $139), next to the Myrtle Beach Convention Center, is the area's newest hotel and the only one with four stars. Its restaurant, VIDALIA'S (843-918-5041), serves a fruit-laden buffet breakfast.
Other popular destinations are the KINGSTON PLANTATION (843-449-0006, $179 to $249), an oceanfront resort with convention facilities and a new health club; the HILTON MYRTLE BEACH RESORT (843-449-5000, $139 to $159), which just underwent a $15 million renovation, and the luxurious LITCHFIELD PLANTATION (843-237-9121, $220). A new 14-story MARRIOTT (843-449-8880) is scheduled to open in November next to the GRANDE DUNES golf course.

RESTAURANTS
For a power breakfast, Walt Standish, president of Beach First National Bank, recommends the CAROLINA ROADHOUSE (843-497-9911, $22 for two, including tip), a hangout for local business leaders, or the SEA CAPTAIN'S HOUSE (843-448-8082; $22).
It is usually crowded at Greg Norman's AUSTRALIAN GRILLE (843-361-0000, $90 for dinner for two, including wine and tip), on the edge of the Intracoastal Waterway. The restaurant features striking Aboriginal decor, cooked-to-order steaks and seafood, and a big wine cellar. For something more offbeat, the elegant COLLECTOR'S CAFE (843-449-9370, $70), offers Mediterranean-style seafood served amid works by local and national artists. 
The king of local restaurants may be the wood-paneled THOROUGHBREDS (843-497-2636, $90), a favorite of Joe Woodle, president of Partners Economic Development Corporation, which works to attract businesses to the area. "It may be just a little bit stuffy," Mr. Wooten said, "but what counts is that it has a quiet atmosphere to talk business, and great steaks."

ENTERTAINMENT
The CAROLINA OPRY (800-843-6779), a music variety show in a 2,200-seat arena, is a hit with visitors. So are DOLLY PARTON'S DIXIE STAMPEDE DINNER AND SHOW (800-433-4401), which features thundering buffalo, music and Southern barbecue, and the vast HOUSE OF BLUES (843-913-3740). For drinks only, Mr. Wooten favors the new CITY BAR (843-839-5483) for its martinis, blues and jazz and its proximity to HOG WILD (843-839-4227), a barbecue-and-beer joint next door.
Hitting the beaches is the most popular leisure activity, but golf is a close second. Mr. Standish favors the DUNES GOLF AND BEACH CLUB (843-449-5236), on rolling terrain that he says makes the holes more challenging than those by the ocean. But for Mr. Woodle, "there is nothing better anywhere" than the three-year-old GRANDE DUNES (843-449-8880), though he says he is also partial to the courses at TIDEWATER PLANTATION (800-446-5363) and BLACKMOOR (866-952-5555).

ON YOUR OWN
There is shopping at the MYRTLE BEACH FACTORY STORES, with 100 outlets including Eddie Bauer and the Gap, and the COLONIAL MALL, which has 90 stores and is adding a 15-screen cinema, a driving range and a salt-water aquarium.

To the Editor:
 A question for David Brooks ("Lonely Campus Voices," column, Sept. 27): 
 If conservative students have difficulty getting teaching jobs, why do so many appear every generation in economics, political science, many of the humanities as well as all over business and engineering schools?
And once the Democrats are back in the White House, watch how quickly the Bush administration conservatives get ivory tower jobs.

HEADLINE: The Letters and the Law; 
Should New York Change Its Awnings or Its Code?

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Last summer, the Bloomberg administration came under fire for issuing what New Yorkers widely perceived as a barrage of nickel-and-dime tickets -- to a pregnant woman sitting on the subway stairs, drivers talking on cellphones, parents double-parking in front of school buildings while dropping off their children. Business owners from the Lower East Side to Jackson Heights claimed that they, too, were being unfairly cited for having information-packed awnings in front of their stores.
 While the awnings might be a violation of the letter of the law, merchants said, they had been tolerated, had even flourished, for as long as anyone could remember. The city, merchants said, was really handing out tickets as away to raise money to close the budget gap. 
 The City Council, eager to restore calm, promptly ordered a six-month moratorium on awning violations and vowed to liberalize the 1961 sign code. 
Now, halfway through the moratorium, preservationists, urban historians and neighborhood advocates are lobbying the Council and the City Planning Commission to defend the existing code. They say that large and garish awnings create an atmosphere of chaos, obscure the distinctive architecture of many blocks, and fuel a frenzied competition among storekeepers to outdo their neighbors with even bigger and busier signs.
So far, these neighborhood advocates say, the public debate has been one-sided, focused only on the complaints of merchants. But illegal signs can be as much of a blight on the quality of urban street life as litter, drug-dealing, potholes and graffiti, they say. To these people, the crackdown on illegal awnings was not an irrational attempt to raise money, but a welcome recognition of a longstanding problem.
"We have been pressing the Buildings Department to move on this for years," said Daniel A. Biederman, president of the 34th Street Partnership. "We were really disappointed that this became a political frenzy and that the mayor was forced to put on a moratorium."
The dispute has arisen partly because of the importance of street life in New York City. Thomas Mellins, an urban historian, once compared the city's streets to "the great public spaces of Europe, which are defined by cathedrals and palaces."
If streets are the city's cathedrals, preservationists say, how should the streetscape look?
To a push-the-envelope sensibility, accustomed to the general clamor for attention of city life, the 42-year-old code governing awnings may seem bizarrely demure, even puritanical. The code dictates that the letters on awnings (signs protruding 12 inches or more from the building) should be no more than 12 inches high, and that stores may not advertise on awnings, which means they are not allowed to give their telephone numbers, or provide long lists of merchandise.
Under these conditions, merchants grumble, who has a prayer of attracting customers? "Without my canopy, I have nothing," said Roberto Guendjian, owner of El Chivito D'Oro, an Argentinian restaurant in Jackson Heights, Queens, who was forced to take down its wraparound awning because it violated the city code. "I need a big one, or they don't see me. If it's raining, you're doing nothing for the people if you don't have it."
Councilman David I. Weprin, a Democrat from eastern Queens, is drafting legislation to liberalize the awning code. His view is that the law should have as few restrictions as possible. If certain neighborhoods want stricter rules, he said, they can do that on their own. 
"We're trying to help small business post-9/11," Mr. Weprin said. "A lot of these mom-and-pop stores are hurting."
But preservationists say that eliminating restrictions on awnings, which have become substitutes for other signs, would institutionalize the chaos that has resulted from decades of almost nonexistent enforcement. 
"Cut the clutter," said Dan Pisark, vice president for retail services of the 34th Street Partnership.
Arlene Simon, president of Landmark West, a preservation group on the Upper West Side, argues that signs do not attract customers; merchants do. "Having a store is more than just putting a sign in your window. They want you to ask how their kids are, how the mattress worked out that they bought last week."
Since 1997, Ms. Simon has worked on stripping away what she calls the honky-tonk jumble of signs and awnings on West 72nd Street and revealing its architectural integrity. Period photographs in hand, she has accosted merchants, showing them how their buildings once looked. 
She points out that stores thrive in the city's most elegant shopping areas, like Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue, with signs that are often no louder than a whisper.
But she insists that she is not arguing in favor of homogeneity or good-taste police. She encourages awnings of different colors and striking fonts. "There's an effort not to make everything too neat and tidy," Ms. Simon said, "so you feel you're in New York, not a theme park." .
Ms. Simon can wax lyrical about the virtues of old-fashioned retractable canvas awnings, which gave way in the 70's to stiff "waterfall awnings," which are designed to fit over roll-down security gates -- another eyesore, to Ms. Simon.
"There's a whole romance," she said of retractables. "The skirt blows in the wind. You crank it in when it's shady, put it out in the sun. When rain gets caught in the slope you push it up. You take it out in the morning and in at night, and it changes the whole look of the building."
The 34th Street Partnership has tried to use what Mr. Pisark calls a carrot-and-stick approach, flagging illegal signs, then providing free design service for merchants who are interested in complying with the code. On a sign, less is more, Mr. Pisark says. Too much information makes pedestrians tune out. 
Like Landmark West, the Partnership has pushed to eliminate canopies -- the overhead canvas tunnels that extend from doorways to the curb. Most commercial canopies are illegal, and long rows of canopies blot out the sky, making the street feel claustrophobic, Mr. Pisark said.
"We once had a glut on 34th Street, as many as 35 canopies, between Madison and Eighth Avenue," he said. "It was out of control."
Even the staunchest preservationists do not argue that the rules should remain rigid across the city. 
No preservationist would dream of tampering with the character of Times Square, says Mr. Mellins, co-author with Robert A. M. Stern and David Fishman of "New York 1960," a book about the city's architecture after World War II.
And in Flushing, Queens, the profusion of Chinese and Korean signs, often one on top of the other, conveys the culture of the neighborhood and gives it a peculiarly coherent look.
To those who insist that one person's bad taste is another's good taste, Mr. Mellins suggests an exercise. "Describe a block you walk by on the way home from work in as much detail as you can," he said. Most people, he contends, will be chagrined to discover that they don't know what the buildings look like because they have been mummified by signs.
Jeffrey Saunders, who owns a Japanese restaurant in Jackson Heights and is a local preservationist, says more discreet signs attract a more upscale clientele. 
Some preservationists suggest that the bigger-is-better attitude has been driven by sign manufacturers. 
Awnings cost $500 for the most basic to $20,000 for features like flashing lights, said Matthew Buckley, an account executive at MSD Visual-Manhattan Signs. However, he added, it is up to the merchant to work with a permit broker to ensure that a sign meets code. Sometimes, he said, merchants do not hire brokers because that adds to the cost.
Mr. Weprin said his office was working with Amanda M. Burden, the director of the Department of City Planning, whose office must approve zoning changes. A spokeswoman for Ms. Burden said she was looking for "a solution that's sensitive to the streetscape issues as well as the issues of merchants."
Meanwhile, the moratorium expires on Dec. 24.

HEADLINE: Man Killed, Possibly in Murder-Suicide 

 BODY:
A man was killed by a commuter train yesterday afternoon in Millburn, N.J., and the police were investigating a possible link between his death and a crime scene at his home, the authorities said. 
 The train's engineer saw the man, Richard A. Josephs, 53, of Short Hills, crouching on the tracks before the train hit him, said Ken Hitchner, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit. 
 The man was killed at 3:38 p.m. just west of the Short Hills station on the Midtown Direct line, Mr. Hitchner said. The Essex County coroner's office will determine whether the death was a suicide, he said.
More than 40 trains were delayed because of the incident, and 250 passengers on the eight-car, citybound train were transferred to another train at Short Hills, he said.
A call to the police department in Millburn, which covers Short Hills, was referred to the Essex County prosecutor's office. A pager message left there was not immediately returned late last night.
The Associated Press reported that Mr. Josephs, an unemployed investment banker, killed himself after killing his 8-year-old son, Eric, who was found in their home about half a mile from the train station. The A.P. attributed this information to the Star-Ledger of Newark.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Rivera on the Mound, Money in the Bank

BYLINE:  By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
Mariano Rivera is realistic. Someday, he knows, he will cease to be a human sawmill. Someday, his skills will decline, his cutter will lose its zip and all those bats will stop breaking. He will be mortal. Someday.
 "I believe that," Rivera, the Yankees' indomitable closer, said. "If I don't believe that, then all those guys that were the best ever wouldn't be out of the game. Michael Jordan would still be playing. Muhammad Ali would still be fighting. I believe you get to a certain age, and you aren't going to be the same as before. That's normal." 
 Rivera will turn 34 in two months. How will he know when he starts to lose it? "I will let you know," he said, smiling. "We're many years from that." 
Rivera can say that now, with his midseason slump safely behind him. He converted his final 15 save opportunities of the regular season and can lean on more than his track record to prove his dominance. His stuff says it for him.
"He's back to being his old self," said the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' Al Martin, who shattered his bat on a game-ending popout against Rivera on the Yankees' last road trip. "I didn't see him when he was bad, but he's as good as ever now. He had more movement than he had earlier in the season. He was nasty."
Rivera is the only pitcher to have thrown the final pitch of the World Series four years in a row. In 2001, that pitch broke Luis Gonzalez's bat but landed past shortstop, clinching the title for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Rivera has seemed fallible ever since.
But as the Yankees begin their ninth consecutive postseason journey, they do so with every reason to be confident in Rivera, who had 40 saves in 46 chances and a career-low 1.66 earned run average this season. It was his steady level of excellence, perhaps more than any other factor, that brought them four championships from 1996 to 2000. They are counting on him to help them win a fifth.
"You don't win without Mariano," catcher Jorge Posada said. "It's always Mo that you've got to rely on."
The Yankees need more than Rivera to win, as they proved in the division series against Anaheim last fall. Rivera saved Game 1, then waited for leads that never came in the last three games. The rest of the pitching staff collapsed, and the Yankees lost in four games.
For five months this season, setup relief was the Yankees' biggest problem. They finally settled the route to the ninth inning in late August, and Rivera has been perfect since. It is no coincidence.
"We're doing a better job, bullpen-wise, of getting to him without having to go to him in the eighth inning, at least for now," the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre said. "Guys are picking themselves up a little bit better, and when the rest of the bullpen's better, it makes it easier on him and easier on us."
Each reliever's role now seems fairly set. Jose Contreras, the fifth starter, will be a long man in the playoffs. Chris Hammond will pitch in the middle or against selected right-handed hitters because of the tailing action on his changeup. Felix Heredia and Gabe White will be the late-inning left-handers and Jeff Nelson the late-inning right-hander.
But if the game is close, Nelson said, no one doubts Rivera will be used before the ninth. He was when Mike Stanton and Nelson were dominant setup men, and he will be again, especially with the Yankees getting an extra day off in the first round. They are off between Games 1 and 2 and between Games 2 and 3.
Nelson returned in a waiver deal with Seattle for Armando Benitez on Aug. 6. That night, Rivera blew his fourth save in six opportunities. After four saves in a row, he blew another on Aug. 16, then gave up four hits in two-thirds of an inning in a rocky save four days later. Questions about Rivera multiplied.
"Whenever I give up a hit, they always say, 'What happened to Mo?"' Rivera said. "But I don't pay attention to that. I don't go on TV and look for those things. I want it to be that way. I want to do good for my teammates. I want to be the guy they look for. I want them to give me the ball at the last minute and close it up. Sometimes it doesn't happen, but 95 percent of the time, it's going to happen. I can live with that."
John Flaherty, the backup catcher, was incredulous at some of the theories.
"It cracked me up when someone told me a scout said it looks like his arm has slowed down," Flaherty said. "I remember thinking, that's what made him so tough to face as a hitter, because you're watching from the on-deck circle and if the radar gun didn't show how hard he was throwing, you would think he was throwing 88-90. Mo lulls you to sleep because he's so free and easy in his delivery, and the next thing you know, the ball's on you."
Flaherty, who joined the Yankees this season after five seasons with Tampa Bay, said he noticed that Rivera's confidence never wavered through the slump. Rivera insisted that his stuff was fine.
Now Rivera admits at least something: his command is much better than before. "The ball inside is staying inside, and the ball away is staying away," he said.
Stottlemyre says that Rivera has been more aggressive, and that his mind-set has made his pitches better. "His stuff is pretty lively," Stottlemyre said. "He's still trying to locate, but not to the point where he was before, where he didn't turn it loose when he tried to locate."
Rivera has also thrown harder as the season has progressed, Flaherty said, and there may be physical reasons. Rivera missed most of the second half last season with a strained shoulder, and he sat out the first 25 games this season with a groin injury. The velocity he lost last season has returned, and Rivera is again throwing high fastballs past hitters.
"I feel good," Rivera said. "But I never check velocity. I can tell I'm throwing good. When I let go of the ball, I know when the ball has something on it."
Throwing harder helps, but what pleases Torre most is that Rivera is not trying to strike out hitters. This is nothing new; Rivera struck out fewer than one hitter an inning this season for the seventh time in his nine seasons. But Rivera is economizing better than ever.
Torre calls it wonderful when Rivera can keep his pitches to 15 or fewer an inning. He has been doing that this season, averaging 14.22 pitches an inning, the lowest ratio of his career. Torre hopes that will make Rivera even better with his busy season upon him.
"He's been doing it with a low pitch count, which bodes well for somebody you plan on using every day," Torre said. "He's throwing the ball as well as he ever has, for me."

HEADLINE: Dialing for Dollars 

BYLINE:  By Ian Ayres; Ian Ayres, professor at Yale Law School, is co-author of "Why Not? How to Use Everyday Ingenuity to Solve Problems Big and Small."

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission's do-not-call registry, the most popular consumer protection initiative in American history, is in jeopardy. Although President Bush signed the law authorizing the list yesterday, a federal judge last week ruled that it violates the First Amendment because it allows households to block commercial telemarketing calls but not calls from charities, political parties, religious groups or other nonprofit organizations.
 Instead of fighting the court's decision, Congress should seize this opportunity to improve the program, which 50 million Americans have already registered for. By allowing households to decide what kind of telemarketing calls they want to receive, Congress can resolve the constitutional difficulty, protect charities, give families better control of their privacy -- and save jobs. 
 The Supreme Court has already made it clear that government can give people the power to choose which solicitations they allow into their homes. In 1970, the court upheld a statute that allowed a household to block mail from any sender simply by notifying the local postmaster.
Such a system of selective association can easily be accommodated within the trade commission's proposed do-not-call regulations. Under those rules, telemarketers can still call people who have registered for do-not-call status if they have given an express authorization to a "specific seller." Congress could expand the concept of express authorization to include intermediaries, like phone companies, which would then connect the call.
This concept of "authorized intermediation" simplifies the government's regulatory burden. The trade commission doesn't have to decide what types of calls to connect; it can simply leave it to the marketplace to offer the kind of filters that families really want. Families would benefit by having greater control of a scarce resource: their privacy.
Some families would choose to block all calls. Others would agree to accept calls from charities. And still others would take commercial calls if the telemarketer agreed to compensate them for their time.
As things stand, telemarketers are trying to take your time without paying you for it. That's why they call so often. Local phone companies could set up a kind of reverse "900" number system where customers would get paid for each minute they listen to a sales pitch -- in fact, companies have already offered long-distance service based on this model (customers can earn free minutes by, for example, listening to phone sales pitches).
By encouraging compensated calling, Congress could save the jobs of tens of thousands of telemarketers. It would even give telemarketers the opportunity to make new types of calls that would be prohibited under the proposed rules. So long as the sender meets the household's prerequisites, the intermediary should be authorized to connect, say, prerecorded calls or faxes.
Finally, allowing families to choose their telemarketers could also serve the public interest. The current hang-up mentality has wreaked havoc on polling organizations, which now average response rates as low as 15 percent or 20 percent. Under this system, perhaps the response ratio will improve, and we will have more reliable information about public opinion.
With compensated calling, the telemarketing industry will enable its reputable members to continue marketing. For Congress, such a system offers a way out of a constitutional dilemma. Instead of crippling the industry, Congress should embrace a regulation that will rationalize and redeem it.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Russia Enter Meat and Poultry Deal 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
The Bush administration announced a trade agreement with Moscow today that could increase American poultry and meat exports to Russia as well as remove some of the obstacles blocking Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization.
 Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, held a news conference today to trumpet the first piece of good trade news since the breakup this month of world trade talks in Cancun, Mexico. 
 Saying that Russia was the biggest market for American poultry, Mr. Zoellick said that "American farmers and Russian consumers both win here." 
The announcement of the agreement comes after talks last weekend by President Bush and the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.
The administration hopes that the deal will put an end to the full-fledged trade dispute that erupted last spring when Russia set a ceiling on meat and poultry imports as a way to protect its own fledgling industries.
For Mr. Putin, it could mean smoother sailing for Russia in Congress. He wants approval for Russia's membership in the W.T.O. and the revocation of Jackson-Vanik legislation. That relic of the cold war denies Russia the normal courtesies of international commerce because during the Soviet period Moscow prevented Jews from emigrating, a policy not followed for years.
Even if it is approved as outlined, however, the arrangement does not eliminate all the barriers erected by Russia that drove American poultry exports down to $400 million this year from $700 million two years ago.
The American meat and poultry trade groups said they were pleased with today's announcement but members of Congress were more cautious, saying they wanted to see the results before giving a seal of approval that would enhance Russia's chances for entering the W.T.O.
"I think this is a positive development but we've had these discussions and negotiations with Russia for a long time," said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who heads the House Agriculture Committee and represents the biggest poultry district in the country. "It's the actual sales that matter, not the piece of paper that promises the sales."
The National Chicken Council, a trade group, announced that it supports the new accord, even though it failed to reinstate the open trading of two years ago. Instead, American poultry will be guaranteed nearly 74 percent of the low tariff quota for imported poultry. If producers are willing to pay a much higher duty, they can import as much chicken and turkey as they wish.
"Sure we'd rather have free trade but at least there is no longer a drop-dead quota where we couldn't export anymore, end of story," said William P. Roenigk, senior vice president of the National Chicken Council. 
Beef and pork will receive guarantees of 9 percent to 11 percent of the Russian tariff quotas. Even with that quota, Russia is the fifth-largest market for American pork exports and the seventh largest for American beef.
Agriculture is one of the few sectors where the United States runs a positive trade balance, and is the most protected sector of the American economy with $20 billion in annual subsidies for grains fed to chickens, cows and hogs.
Competition from Europe and Brazil was hurting some American meat producers in Russia, said Nicholas D. Giordano, the international trade counsel for the National Pork Producers Council, who also said he approved of the deal with the new guarantees.

HEADLINE: With More Cash in Hand, Americans KeepSpending 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
The Commerce Department reported today that consumer spending increased 0.8 percent in August on top of a 0.9 percent advance in July as larger paychecks and other incentives from President Bush's third tax cut began to take hold. 
 "Consumer spending turned in another stellar performance," Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia, said. "Spending continues to be bolstered by the recently enacted tax cuts." 
The disposable incomes of Americans, or what is left after taxes, advanced 0.9 percent in August, after a 1.5 percent jump in July. 
The government attributed much of the increase in disposable incomes in July and August to the president's tax cut, which lowered federal withholdings, increasing take-home pay and provided other incentives. 
Excluding the tax effect, disposable incomes increased 0.2 percent in August and 0.3 percent in July.
Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of all economic activity in the United States. Because of that, the behavior of shoppers plays a major role in shaping any recovery. Thus far, consumers are spending enough to keep the nation's cash registers ringing and the economy's rebound moving forward. 
The economy grew at a 3.3 percent rate in the second quarter, and economists are predicting that it is now gaining even more momentum. 
The report also showed that wages and salaries increased by 0.1 percent in August, after being flat in July. Consumer spending on durable goods -- costly manufactured products like cars and appliances -- rose 2.8 percent in August, after a 3.3 percent increase in July. 
Spending on nondurables, like food and clothes, rose 0.9 percent for the second consecutive month. For services, spending increased 0.3 percent in August, after a 0.5 percent gain. 
Because disposable income growth outpaced spending, the nation's personal savings rate, or savings as a percentage of after-tax incomes, rose to 3.8 percent in August from 3.6 percent in July. The savings rate in August was the best showing since February. 
Amid signs that the economy is picking up speed, the Federal Reserve decided this month to hold a crucial short-term interest rate at a 45-year low of 1 percent and hinted that the rate could stay there for some time.

HEADLINE: Trading Memories 

 BODY:
Bill Clinton talked a great deal during his presidency about building a bridge to the 21st century, but now that we are here, the 10 Democrats trying to occupy his old residence on Pennsylvania Avenue are pitching the country on the idea of crossing that bridge back into the late 20th century, to a happy time of high growth, low unemployment and government surpluses. As Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader, wistfully put it in last week's debate among the Democratic contenders, "Why wouldn't we want to go back to that?" 
 Unfortunately, when it comes to America's economic relations with the rest of the world, some of these Democrats, as Senator Joseph Lieberman is quick to scold them, seem to have selective memories about what accounted for the Clinton success. Most of the candidates are selling decidedly protectionist messages, as if seeking to become the Ross Perot of the 2004 race, not the Bill Clinton. 
 Mr. Clinton was one of the most committed free traders ever to serve in the White House, fighting for passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and presiding over creation of the World Trade Organization and China's entry into that body. That he also presided over the creation of 22 million new jobs is no coincidence. 
Mr. Gephardt often led the fight against Mr. Clinton's opening to the world, and still seems proud of that fact, which makes his attempts to associate himself with Mr. Clinton's results a bit strange. Former Gov. Howard Dean, an early supporter of Nafta, has made protectionism a hallmark of his campaign, recklessly threatening to bolt from the regional trade bloc and even the W.T.O. And though he sounded more moderate last week, Senator John Kerry, a free-trade stalwart in the past, has talked on the campaign trail of "reviewing" the nation's trade deals, and of opposing the Free Trade Area of the Americas, proposed, of course, by Mr. Clinton.
This misguided retreat from the Clinton legacy is especially disappointing in light of President Bush's poor record on trade. It would be nice to see the Democrats attack the White House for imposing unjustified steel tariffs that have cost American jobs and angered our trading partners, but we won't hold our breath. And when asked at the debate last week if he would support eliminating farm subsidies Mr. Bush allowed to be ratcheted up last year, Senator John Edwards essentially answered, um, well, no. What he should have said is that those subsidies do need to be reined in, not only to help the poor around the world, but to ensure the survival of a world trading system that has so benefited Americans.
Some amount of pandering is to be expected at this stage of the campaign. But it is worth recalling that in early 1992, in the face of similar anxieties about a jobless recovery and Asian competition, one Democrat forcefully defended free trade before union groups -- Bill Clinton.

HEADLINE: Mild-Mannered Senator Tries Attack-Dog Role 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
Senator Bob Graham has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the most courtly, mild-mannered and even long-winded members of the Senate. But on the presidential campaign trail, he has bemused the Washington establishment by transforming himself into a one-man grenade launcher. His target is President Bush.
 Struggling for attention as he trails badly in the polls and in fund-raising, Mr. Graham, a Florida Democrat, frequently and uncharacteristically upbraids Mr. Bush, especially for what he considers his national security lapses. Mr. Graham often goes beyond his Democratic rivals in skewering the administration -- even, at times, beyond Howard Dean, for whom harsh Bush attacks have become expected. Mr. Graham has baldly answered "Yes" when asked if Mr. Bush intentionally misled Americans in waging war with Iraq, and has called for his impeachment. 
 Mr. Graham, who was chairman of the Senate intelligence committee at the time of the Sept. 11 attacks, insists that his remarks are heartfelt. But many Democrats say they also reflect the frustration of a respected veteran of Capitol Hill who has yet to become a factor in the contest. 
His campaign appears in such dire shape that Mr. Graham is expected to have raised only a paltry sum for the quarter that ends today. His fund-raising coordinators for New York and California resigned in recent weeks, and one joined the campaign of Gen. Wesley K. Clark.
 The senator's own expectations are so low that he said he would consider it a victory if he placed third or fourth in the Iowa and New Hampshire contests, which he said he could then use as a springboard to a better showing in the Sun Belt.
 Mr. Graham rejects the idea that he is taking potshots at the president and suggests that he was spurred to run by outrage. "I don't consider the words to be strident, I consider them to be an accurate description," he said. "Yes, we have pointed out where I think this administration has taken us in the wrong direction, but I also believe it's incumbent upon a challenger to have something constructive to say."
 But Representative Jim Davis, a Florida Democrat who backs Mr. Graham, said there was a pragmatic explanation for Mr. Graham's newfound outspokenness. "I think that what Bob Graham is doing," he said, "is working to be heard in what has become a very crowded and complicated race."
 In Baltimore, Mr. Graham declared that Mr. Bush "knew or should have known" that "there was no relationship between Osama Been Forgotten and Saddam Hussein." In Des Moines, he said the United States was no safer than it was on Sept. 11, 2001, because "this president does not understand what it's going to take to win the war on terrorism." In Denver, he accused the administration of giving away billions "to Vice President Dick Cheney's friends at Halliburton to rebuild Iraqi oil fields."
 And at the debate in New York last week, none of the candidates went as far as Mr. Graham in taking on Mr. Bush. Answering a question about how to control prescription drug prices, Mr. Graham said nothing would be done as long as Mr. Bush remained in office because "he is literally in bed with the pharmaceutical companies."
 Stephen Craig, a political science professor at the University of Florida, said of Mr. Graham, "He has clearly decided to throw some bombs, and Bob Graham as a bomb-thrower is sort of an oxymoron for those of us who have watched him for a quarter-century."
 There are signs that Mr. Graham's changed stance may be eroding his support at home, where the president and his brother Gov. Jeb Bush remain popular. Mr. Graham has until May to decide whether to seek a fourth Senate term, and a poor showing in the presidential race could hurt his chances. He has consistently said that he is focused on running for president, but he has also refused to rule out trying to keep his seat.
 Despite his impressive credentials, dozens of voters interviewed as Mr. Graham made his way around the country over the past several weeks said they did not take his candidacy seriously. 
 After a recent forum at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York -- Mr. Graham was the featured speaker -- Rodney Nichols, a consultant on science and technology policy, put it succinctly: "I'd rather have him in the Senate than as vice president."
 Even at a recent fund-raiser in Miami, where hundreds of finely turned-out young Floridians, mostly friends of the family and longtime supporters, gathered around a South Beach hotel pool, Graham loyalists expressed doubts about his potency as a national candidate.
 "People write him off because he's trailing," said Oscar Seikaly, an insurance broker who helped plan the event but said that he was undecided. "I'm sitting and waiting until things become clearer."
 Asked if he thought Mr. Graham could win, Mr. Seikaly said, "Realistically, probably not."
 The senator appears undaunted by the lukewarm responses.
 "You don't have any right of expecting that what you have done in the past automatically gives you a ticket to the future," he said in Des Moines. "But I believe that as we get closer to the election, people are going to start to begin to realize that we are not engaged in a pageant here, although it looks like it, but rather we're going to select one of the two peopleattempting to be president, and I think at that point things like maturity, past demonstrated leadership will start to play a larger role."
 Indeed, in small groups and at his own campaign stops, where his comments tend to be far less provocative than in other forums, Mr. Graham can come across as warm and knowledgeable. After seeing Mr. Graham in Chicago, Karen Lennon, a businesswoman, said, "I mean, this is a man you can trust, and isn't that what we're trying to elect?"
 To the consternation of Graham aides seeking to maximize the flesh pressed, the senator often takes several minutes to speak with each person. He remains unfailingly polite, going so far as to apologize for campaign workers watching a University of Florida football game who booed when Governor Bush appeared on the television screen.
 And some voters who have met him say that although he may lack flash, he has his own brand of charm. That was on full display in Purcell, a small town about 35 miles south of Oklahoma City, where Mr. Graham stepped into the perfumed offices of Sunbelt Credit and immediately began asking the two women behind the counter what sort of work they did.
Ben Odom, the campaign's state chairman, broke in to say that it was "one of the best-smelling businesses" in Purcell. Mr. Graham said, "And it is populated by some of the best-looking people," as the women giggled.
 At the same time, Mr. Graham can be inelegant when he appears with the other candidates, often failing to leave much of an impression.
 "He just doesn't grab you like Dean does," said Bill Russell, a government professor at Graceland University in Lamoni, Iowa, who saw Mr. Graham speak at Senator Tom Harkin's annual steak fry in Iowa. 
 But Steve Jarding, Mr. Graham's communications director, said he believed that the jabs would pay off, especially once Mr. Graham's advertisements begin airing.
"At some point this race is going to come down to not just the economy," Mr. Jarding said. "If any Democrat thinks that we can somehow pooh-pooh or ignore the international situation, they can't."
 To Mr. Graham, this rocky period is just something to get through until his moment arrives.
"I was encouraged when I saw that it was in October 1975 that Jimmy Carter was at 1 percent in the polls here in Iowa and then in January he got 27 percent," he said.
 At a stop in Washington, he joked with reporters about a Florida songwriter and producer who, he said, like Beethoven, had been underappreciated. "It takes awhile for people to appreciate your real genius," Mr. Graham said. He might have been speaking of himself.

HEADLINE: Boiling Brew: Politics and Health Insurance Gap 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
The jump in the number of Americans without health insurance is not just another bad economic statistic.
 Health care costs are soaring again, after several years of stability; average premiums rose nearly 14 percent this year, the third year of double-digit increases, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Employers are pushing more of the costs onto their workers, raising co-payments and deductibles. At the same time, many Americans saw their health benefits jeopardized by layoffs, which have continued despite the official end of the recession in November 2001. 
 In such times, the plight of the uninsured becomes more of a middle-class issue, more of a symbol of real close-to-home insecurity and thus more politically potent, advocates and experts say. Until now, "it's mainly been an issue of altruism for a discrete and disadvantaged population," said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal consumer group.
"Now that the losses in health coverage are impacting more middle-class and working families," Mr. Pollack said, "this issue becomes one of self-interest for a very substantial part ofthe population."
Even before the Census Bureau announced the numbers, showing that the number of uninsured Americans had risen by 2.4 million last year, to 43.6 million, most of the major Democratic presidential candidates were campaigning hard on the problems in health care. Not since the 1992 election has the issue drawn so much attention, and the reasons are not hard to find.
For Democrats, it is a powerful symbol of a sluggish economy, of a lack of federal money to deal with domestic problems because of the deficit and the war in Iraq and of what they say is the Bush administration's insensitivity to the needs of the home front. It could, in short, be a significant vulnerability for President Bush -- if the Democrats succeed in framing this election as a referendum on domestic policy.
Republicans argue that the administration has several major initiatives on the table to deal with the problems of cost and access to health care, from its Medicare prescription drug plan to legislation that would cap jury awards in medical malpractice lawsuits.
"If Democrats are seen as obstructing that process, that could be a significant problem for them politically," said Christine Iverson, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.
The Bush administration has also proposed in the past to expand coverage to the uninsured through the use of tax credits to help them buy insurance. Still, some experts say the administration will eventually have to offer a broader vision on health care as an alternative to the Democrats.
In fact, Americans place the health care issue high on the political agenda, based on recent polls. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll last week found that a candidate's position on health care was cited as "extremely important" by 43 percent of Americans, just below terrorism (cited by 49 percent) and the economy (49 percent), and well above the environment (30 percent) and taxes (36 percent.)
An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in July found that health care costs ranked at the top of Americans' economic concerns, cited by 24 percent, compared with 16 percent who cited high taxes.
Most of the major Democratic candidates have produced a major plan to expand health coverage, generally financing it by rolling back all or part of Mr. Bush's tax cuts. But Republican strategists are quick to point out that the politics of health care are complicated and that the candidate with the biggest plan is not always rewarded.
The classic example, of course, is President Bill Clinton, who ran on the promise of universal health care only to see his actual plan for national health insurance turn into a political and legislative debacle. Critics said that plan would cost more, create a huge new government bureaucracy and give many Americans poorer health coverage than they already had.
Given the Democrats' reliance on using the tax cut to finance a health care plan, Republicans are very likely to make a version of that argument again. Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster and expert on public opinion and health, said, "A lot of 2004 will be a fight about who is perceived to pay versus who is perceived to get the benefit." In the past, Mr. McInturff said, when middle-income voters sensed they were being asked to pay more so that others received health care, "political paralysis has happened." 
Still, he added: "People still don't get how big an issue this will be. The numbers and the state of the economy and the relationship between the cost of care and what's happened to the uninsured will be addressed in the 2004 campaign cycle, because it's what people care about."
The problems in the health care system are related to nearly every issue bubbling domestically, from unemployment to the fiscal crisis in the states. Moreover, even if employment begins to pick up -- and new estimates will be released on Friday -- nobody is expecting a speedy turnaround in the problems of health care costs and coverage.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE RECONSTRUCTION; 
INSIDERS' NEW FIRM CONSULTS ON IRAQ

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
A group of businessmen linked by their close ties to President Bush, his family and his administration have set up a consulting firm to advise companies that want to do business in Iraq, including those seeking pieces of taxpayer-financed reconstruction projects.
 The firm, New Bridge Strategies, is headed by Joe M. Allbaugh, Mr. Bush's campaign manager in 2000 and the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency until March. Other directors include Edward M. Rogers Jr., vice chairman, and Lanny Griffith, lobbyists who were assistants to the first President George Bush and now have close ties to the White House. 
 At a time when the administration seeks Congressional approval for $20.3 billion to rebuild Iraq, part of an $87 billion package for military and other spending in Iraq and Afghanistan, the company's Web site, www .newbridgestrategies.com, says, "The opportunities evolving in Iraq today are of such an unprecedented nature and scope that no other existing firm has the necessary skills and experience to be effective both in Washington, D.C., and on the ground in Iraq."
The site calls attention to the links between the company's directors and the two Bush administrations by noting, for example, that Mr. Allbaugh, the chairman, was "chief of staff to then-Gov. Bush of Texas and was the national campaign manager for the Bush-Cheney 2000 presidential campaign."
The president of the company, John Howland, said in a telephone interview that it did not intend to seek any United States government contracts itself, but might be a middleman to advise other companies that seek taxpayer-financed business. The main focus, Mr. Howland said, would be to advise companies that seek opportunities in the private sector in Iraq, including licenses to market products there. The existence of the company was first reported in The Hill, a Congressional newspaper.
Mr. Howland said the company was not trying to promote its political connections. He said that although Mr. Allbaugh, for example, had spent most of his career "in the political arena, there's a lot of cross-pollination between that world and the one that exists in Iraq today."
As part of the administration's postwar work in Iraq, the government has awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts to American businesses. Those contracts, some without competitive bidding, have included more than $500 million to support troops and extinguish oil field fires for Kellogg, Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, which Vice President Dick Cheney led from 1995 until 2000.
Of the $3.9 billion a month that the administration is spending on military operations in Iraq, up to one-third may go to contractors who provide food, housing and other services, some military budget experts said. A spokesman for the Pentagon said today that the military could not provide an estimate of the breakdown.
Administration officials, including L. Paul Bremer III, the top American official in Iraq, have said all future contracts will be issued only as a result of competitive bidding. Already, the Web site for the Coalition Provisional Authority, http:// cpa-iraq.org/, lists 36 recent solicitations, including those for contractors who might sell new AK-47 assault rifles, nine-millimeter ammunition and other goods for new army and security forces.
New Bridge Strategies was established in May and recently began full-fledged operations, including opening an office in Iraq, its officials said. They added that a decision by the Governing Council of Iraq to allow foreign companies to establish 100 percent ownership of businesses in Iraq, an unusual arrangement in the Mideast, had added to the attractiveness of the market.
Mr. Howland is a principal of Crest Investment in Houston and was president of American Rice, once a major exporter to Iraq. Richard Burt, ambassador to Germany in the Reagan administration and a former assistant secretary of state, and Lord Powell, a member of the British House of Lords and an important military and foreign-policy adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, are among the 10 principals.
Mr. Allbaugh, the chairman, spent most of his career in Texas politics before Mr. Bush appointed him to head the federal disaster agency. Mr. Allbaugh, who now heads his own consulting firm here, did not return calls to his office today.
Mr. Rogers, the vice chairman who was a deputy assistant to the first President Bush and an executive assistant to the White House chief of staff, is also vice chairman of Barbour Griffith & Rogers, one of the best-connected Republican lobbying firms in the capital. Mr. Rogers founded it in 1991 with Haley Barbour, who became chairman of the Republican National Committee and is now running for governor of Mississippi. 
Shortly after leaving the White House, Mr. Rogers was publicly rebuked by the first President Bush after he signed a $600,000 contract to represent a Saudi, Sheik Kamal Adham, who was a main figure under scrutiny in a case that involved the Bank of Commerce and Credit International. Mr. Rogers canceled his contract to represent the sheik, former head of Saudi intelligence.
Mr. Griffith, a director of the newcompany, is chief operating officer of Barbour Griffith & Rogers, which he joined in 1993. He was special assistant for intergovernmental affairs to the first President Bush and later worked under him as an assistant secretary of education.
Until November, Mr. Rogers's wife, Edwina, was associate director of the National Economic Council at the White House. Reached by telephone today, Mr. Rogers said he did not want to speak for the record and referred a reporter to Mr. Howland.
The company Web site says the company was "created specifically with the aim of assisting clients to evaluate and take advantage of business opportunities in the Middle East following the conclusion of the U.S.-led war in Iraq."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: COSTS; 
G.O.P. Senators Say Money for Iraq Must Be Grant, Not Loan

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
Senate Republican leaders, preparing for whirlwind votes this week on the administration's request for $87 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan, today forcefully rejected a growing Congressional sentiment to lend, rather than give, $20.3 billion of that to Iraq for its reconstruction.
 Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Iraq was too economically fragile to bear more debt, and Senator John McCain of Arizona said such a strategy would make it appear the United States was only after Iraq's oil riches. 
 "This is an experiment, and it's risky, really risky," Mr. Stevens said, parrying questions at a news conference about the need for an expensive aid package. "But if it comes through, we will not have an army of occupation. If it comes through, we'll bring more of our people home, and there will be more people in Iraqi uniforms being policemen and providing the defense of that country sooner, if we act and give them the $20.3 billion now." 
On Tuesday the committee will begin formal consideration of the spending bill. A draft of Mr. Stevens's bill shows that Republican leaders are planning to make few substantive changes to President Bush's request. 
According to the draft, committee leaders will put few restrictions on the administration's ability to spend the reconstruction money on scores of projects, many of which have been criticized by lawmakers of both parties as less than essential. The administration would have to report to Congress five days before the money is spent.
The draft does add a provision forbidding the use of any of the money to pay Iraq's foreign debt; most is owed to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, France and Russia. 
It also changes some of the spending items in the $67 billion military side of the bill, which includes $11 billion for Afghanistan: It recommends giving the Army about $1 billion more money to pay for weapons, operation and maintenance, while subtracting an equal amount from the Air Force, Navy and occupation partners from other countries. Officials said the changes reflected the deterioration of the Army's equipment and its dominant role in the occupation of Iraq.
It cuts in half, to $2.5 billion, the amount of military money that could be shifted to various purposes without the approval of Congress, and it adds $32 million to reimburse New York City for protecting foreign missions and officials in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. At least $100 million would have to be spent for democracy-building efforts in Iraq, along with $20 million for what are described as media outreach activities.
Although amendments and changes are inevitable once the bill reaches the Senate floor on Tuesday night or Wednesday, the overall amount matches the president's request, and at this stage it appears to contain relatively few of the personal items that are often attached to such emergency spending bills.
Many Republicans and Democrats in both houses are uncomfortable with the idea of giving Iraq the $20.3 billion in taxpayer money for its public works projects, at a time when similar spending at home is being squeezed by a record-setting deficit. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, plans to introduce an amendment this week that would require Iraq to pay back the reconstruction money once it begins making more money from its oil, an aide said today. Democrats plan to propose separate votes for military and reconstruction money.
But Republican leaders made it clear they would fight to build a majority against both plans.
"The country is flat on its back, with its infrastructure destroyed, and we want to go in there and charge them for liberating their country?" said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican whip. "The administration has made a compelling case that the only way to bring the troops home at any time in the near future is to give democracy a chance, and that's not going to happen if Iraqis are sitting in the dark with no drinking water."
Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said he expected a vote this week before the Senate leaves for a week's recess. The House is likely to begin work on the bill next week.
Democrats are furious over the swift pace, invoking in contrast the months of debate devoted to the Marshall Plan after World War II. A few have suggested that Republicans are trying to rush through a bill they know is unpopular with the public. 
Senator Robert C. Byrd, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said the Senate was failing in its responsibility to examine closely a bill that would authorize the spending of 50 percent more money than the education budget.
"We need a complete examination of this attempt to transform a political culture very different from our own into a democracy -- a form of government never before seen in those ancient lands," Mr. Byrd said. "Make no mistake: this bill is the beginning of an enormous, yearslong commitment to Iraq for a mission that may well be impossible."
Mr. Stevens said that the armed forces needed the money immediately and that American troops would come home more quickly if the rebuilding started soon.
"We want to get it done so it can get signed by the president and released to the military as quickly as possible," Mr. Stevens said. "Two-thirds of all the money in this bill is for defense. And too much time is being spent about the $20 billion. There's a lot of money."

HEADLINE: BIG INCREASE SEEN IN PEOPLE LACKING HEALTH INSURANCE 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
The number of people without health insurance shot up last year by 2.4 million, the largest increase in a decade, raising the total to 43.6 million, as health costs soared and many workers lost coverage provided by employers, the Census Bureau reported today.
 The increase brought the proportion of people who were uninsured to 15.2 percent, from 14.6 percent in 2001. The figure remained lower than the recent peak of 16.3 percent in 1998. 
 A continued erosion of employer-sponsored coverage was the main reason for the latest increase, the bureau said. Public programs, especially Medicaid, covered more people and cushioned the loss of employer-sponsored health insurance but "not enough to offset the decline in private coverage," the report said. 
The proportion of Americans with insurance from employers declined to 61.3 percent, from 62.6 percent in 2001 and 63.6 percent in 2000. The number of people with employer-sponsored coverage fell last year by 1.3 million, to 175.3 million, even as the total population grew by 3.9 million.
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said the numbers showed that "the nation must do more" to help the uninsured. Mr. Thompson said, for example, that Congress should provide tax credits for the purchase of private insurance.
But no action is imminent. Congress is preoccupied with efforts to help a large, politically potent group that already has insurance, the elderly, by adding drug benefits to Medicare.
Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal-leaning consumer group, said: "It's hard to grasp the magnitude of the number of uninsured. It exceeds the aggregate population of 24 states."
The number of full-time workers without health insurance rose by 897,000 last year, to 19.9 million. Kate Sullivan, director of health care policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said the increase was alarming and predicted it would continue this year.
"Workplace coverage is becoming unaffordable for many employers and employees," Ms. Sullivan said.
On Friday, the Census Bureau reported that poverty rose in 2002 for the second consecutive year. The poverty rate generally declines when the economy expands, but there is no guarantee that the number of uninsured will also decline.
The number of uninsured increased each year from 1987 to 1998, even when the economy was booming. Small businesses accounted for many of the new jobs then, and such businesses are far less likely to provide insurance.
Health policy experts said the number of uninsured was likely to rise this year because the job market remains weak and many states have cut back their Medicaid programs. The unemployment rate was higher in 2002 than in 2001 and has climbed a bit further this year.
Hanns Kuttner, a health policy analyst at the University of Michigan, said: "Rising rates of unemployment tend to erode health insurance coverage among adults. But when parents lose jobs, their children are more likely to be eligible for public programs."
About 8.5 million children were uninsured in 2002. They account for 11.6 percent of all children under 18. Both numbers were virtually the same as in 2000 and 2001. 
Genevieve M. Kenney, an economist at the Urban Institute here, said: "Programs intended to provide coverage for children are working to compensate for the economic downturn and catching a lot of kids who would otherwise be uninsured. But many states, in the midst of a fiscal crisis, have reduced efforts to locate and enroll children eligible for Medicaid."
Men are more likely to be uninsured than women. Men accounted for two-thirds of the increase in the number of uninsured, apparently because they were more likely to lose employer-sponsored coverage.
The number of uninsured men rose by 1.6 million last year, to 23.3 million, while the number of uninsured women rose by 761,000, to 20.2 million.
The drop in coverage came even though the number of people with health insurance increased, by 1.5 million last year, to 242.4 million. But the increase was more than offset by the combined effects of population growth and the decline in workplace coverage.
The proportion of people without health insurance ranged from 8 percent in Minnesota to 24.1 percent in Texas. The rates for Rhode Island, Wisconsin and Iowa, which have made sustained efforts to expand coverage, were similar to the figure in Minnesota.
Texas, facing fiscal problems and unwilling to raise taxes, cut back Medicaid and its Children's Health Insurance Program this year.
Looking at two-year averages, the Census Bureau said that the proportion of people without coverage fell in New Mexico but rose in 18 states: Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin. The changes in the other states were not statistically significant.
People in the South and the West were more likely to be uninsured. Only 11.7 percent of people in the Middle West were uninsured, compared with 13 percent in the Northeast, 17.1 percent in the West and 17.5 percent in the South.
As an entitlement program, Medicaid expands to meet the need in hard economic times. 
Despite the Medicaid program, 10.5 million poor people, or 30.4 percent of those in poverty, had no health insurance last year. This percentage, double the rate for the total population, did not change from the prior year. About 24 percent of all uninsured people were poor.
The proportion of blacks and non-Hispanic whites without health insurance rose last year, to 20.2 percent and 10.7 percent, respectively. The figure for Hispanics was much higher, 32.4 percent, unchanged from the prior year.
Fully one-third of the foreign-born population was uninsured. About 43 percent of noncitizens -- 8.9 million of the 20.6 million noncitizens -- and 17.5 percent of naturalized citizens lacked coverage.
Among people living in poverty, 49 percent of those who worked full-time were uninsured. 
But middle-income households accounted for most of the increase in the number of uninsured. In households with annual incomes of $25,000 to $74,999, the number of uninsured people rose last year by 1.4 million, to 21.5 million, and the increase was most noticeable among households with incomes of $25,000 to $49,999.
At companies with fewer than 25 employees, only 30.8 percent of the workers had employer-sponsored insurance in their own names last year, down from 31.3 percent in 2001. The proportion of workers with insurance also declined at companies with 25 to 99 employees (by 2.4 percentage points, to 54.4 percent) and even at businesses with more than 1,000 employees (by nine-tenths of a percentage point, to 68.7 percent).
Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said he was working with Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, on a bill that would offer tax credits to jobless workers to buy certain types of health insurance.
"We have long known the problem of the uninsured is serious," Mr. Baucus said. "This week's data show that it's getting worse."

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: WALL STREET; 
Investment Banker's Trial Begins With Scrutiny of Jurors

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
The criminal trial of Frank P. Quattrone, a former star investment banker at Credit Suisse First Boston, began in Federal District Court in Manhattan yesterday with lawyers on both sides trying to identify which speech therapists, nurses or economists might be the most dangerous jurors.
 Mr. Quattrone, whose demeanor was upbeat in the courtroom, faces charges that he tried to hinder investigations by a federal grand jury and by securities regulators into First Boston. If convicted, he could be sentenced to as much as 25 years in prison. 
 The trial of Mr. Quattrone is taking place just blocks from another prominent case, the trial of Tyco International's former chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, whose company-financed parties have become the stuff of corporate myth. He faces charges that he looted the company and investors of $600 million. Both cases have come to symbolize the government's effort to crack down on corporate excesses of the 1990's.
The two cases have also assumed importance as some of the first criminal actions against individual executives. In other cases, those charged with criminal wrongdoing have pleaded guilty, avoiding the spectacle and risk of a trial. But Mr. Quattrone's case will take place under the eyes of a small army of reporters eager to describe every twist and turn.
Zachary W. Carter, a former United States attorney who is now a partner at Dorsey & Whitney, remarked: "You guys in the media, and the general public informed by you folks, find it difficult to imagine that people with this kind of access to wealth feel a need to go a bridge too far and to commit what appear to be unnecessary violations of law to increase their wealth, which was beyond most of our wildest dreams. That's what captures our imagination."
Like the trial of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen last year, this case will probably have effects far beyond Mr. Quattrone, said Sheldon T. Zenner, head of the white-collar practice at Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman in Chicago. Critical in the case against Mr. Quattrone will be whether an e-mail message he endorsed, directing department members at First Boston to follow the firm's document-retention policy, constituted an effort to obstruct a government investigation.
Mr. Zenner said that investment bankers would be much more careful about which documents they got rid of and which ones they destroyed when, as well as about what they told employees to do with documents.
"You can fairly look at what happened in the Arthur Andersen case and what is going on in this case," he said, "and presume that it is going to have an impact and cause people to be extremely cautious in how they respond in similar situations."
Prosecutors contend that Mr. Quattrone authorized the sending of the e-mail message to members of the firm's technology group in December 2000, reminding them to comply with its document retention policy, and that by doing so he encouraged them to destroy evidence sought by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a grand jury. Prosecutors have not filed charges based on other assertions -- that Mr. Quattrone rewarded favored clients with access to hot stock offerings, for example -- that are the subject of regulatory actions.
Mr. Quattrone's lawyers are expected to respond that he was unaware that the investigations extended to his unit of First Boston. They are expected to argue further that the e-mail message only advised employees to comply with First Boston's document retention policy, not to destroy documents.
Lawyers did not get to these arguments yesterday, as Judge Richard Owen, prosecutors and defense lawyers tried to identify suitable jurors to hear the case. Jury selection is scheduled to resume this morning.
The process was not helped when early in the day it became clear that none of the potential jurors in the courtroom were included on the list of names provided to the judge. That problem was quickly resolved and then began a long process of questioning potential jurors, asking about their work experience, dealings with the federal government, investment practices, even their hobbies and reading interests. While many said they read both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, almost none said they knew of Mr. Quattrone, who has been the subject of numerous articles in those and many other publications. 
The defense team wants to find rugged individualists -- "cowboys," said Patricia McEvoy, a partner at Zagnoli McEvoy Foley, a communications firm that specializes in litigation support -- who will not be bullied by other jurors. To convict Mr. Quattrone, all members of the jury would have to agree. 
"By cowboys, I mean people that aren't plugged into the status quo," Ms. McEvoy added, "and who would be willing to hang the jury."
